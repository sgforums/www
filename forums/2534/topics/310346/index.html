              <p><span class="TitleA">Trying 
              
                to be "Ugly"</span></p>
              <p>Everyone in the 
              
                apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. 
              
                Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and, shall 
              
                we say, love.</p>
              <p>The combination 
              
                of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. 
              
                To start with, he had only one eye and where the other should have been was 
              
                a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot appeared 
              
                to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, 
              
                making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long age 
              
                been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and 
              
                twitch.</p>
              <p>Ugly would have 
              
                been a dark grey tabby, striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, 
              
                neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw 
              
                Ugly there was the same reaction. "That's one UGLY cat!!"</p>
              <p>All the children 
              
                were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, 
              
                squirted him when he tried to come in their homes, or shut his paws in the door 
              
                when he would not leave. Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the 
              
                hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. 
              
                If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness.</p>
              <p>Whenever he spied 
              
                children, he would come running, meowing frantically and bump his head against 
              
                their hands, begging for their love. If you ever picked him, up he would immediately 
              
                begin suckling on your shirt, earrings, whatever he could find.</p>
              <p>One day Ugly shared 
              
                his love with the neighbor's huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly 
              
                was badly mauled. From my apartment I could hear his screams, and I tried to 
              
                rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was apparent Ugly's 
              
                sad life was almost at an end.</p>
              <p>Ugly lay in a wet 
              
                circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping 
              
                tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and 
              
                tried to carry him home, I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel 
              
                him struggling. It must be hurting him terribly, I thought.</p>
              <p>Then I felt a familiar 
              
                tugging, sucking sensation on my ear. Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously 
              
                dying, was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped 
              
                the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards 
              
                me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, 
              
                that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps 
              
                some compassion.</p>
              <p>At that moment 
              
                I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never 
              
                once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle 
              
                in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his 
              
                pain.</p>
              <p>Ugly died in my 
              
                arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterwards, 
              
                thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion 
              
                about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and 
              
                truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand books, 
              
                lectures, or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. 
              
                He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it 
              
                was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total 
              
                to those I cared for.</p>
              <p>Many people want 
              
                to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always 
              
                try to be Ugly.</p>
