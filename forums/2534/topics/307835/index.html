              <p>An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.</p>

              <p>The microwave was invented after a researcher walked by a radar tube and a chocolate bar melted in his pocket. (Good thing he did that.)</p>
              <p>The winter of 1932 was so cold that Niagara Falls froze completely solid.</p>
              <p>There are more chickens than people in the world.</p>
