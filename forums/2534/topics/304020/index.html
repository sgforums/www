            <div class='col-md body'>At this very moment you have a certain attitude as you read this. Your attitude could be bad, good, indifferent, melancholy, excited,proud, stuck-up, humble and so on. Every second that you are awake you are experiencing some type of attitude. So, if you constantly have an attitude operating in your life, then you had better believe that your attitude matters.<br><br>There is a great quote by Charles Swindoll who said, Â‘The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company, a team, a home, or even just a trust.<br><br>The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past ...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude ...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you ...we are in charge of our attitudes.Â’<br><br>So the question to ask yourself is, Â‘How are you reacting to the things that are going on in your life?Â’ Are the circumstances in your life controlling your attitude or are you in control of your attitude? Some people may complained on why other hate them for no reason.. there is a reason... only when they can find out why they are hated. A survey indicate that 60% of staff sacked by their bosses due to their poor attitude. Incapability can be improved, mistakes can be corrected, but poor attitude may not be forgiven.<br><br>Your attitude will affect every outcome in your life. Make a decision that you will control your attitude so that you are not a slave to all the myriad of circumstances that bombard you every day.<br><br>Next time before you blame on why you were ill-treated by others, try find the answer from a mirror.</div>
