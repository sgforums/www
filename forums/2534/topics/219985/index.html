            <div class='col-md body'>The famous race of the Rabbit and the Tortoise - II<br><br>The Story Doesn't End Here<br><br>Once upon a time a tortoise and a hare had an argument about who was<br>faster.<br><br>They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route<br>and started off the race.<br>The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time.<br>Then seeing that he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he'd sit under<br>a tree for some time and relax before continuing the race. He sat under<br>the tree and soon fell asleep.<br><br>The tortoise plodding on overtook him and soon finished the race, emerging as the undisputed champ.<br><br>The hare woke up<br>and realized that he'd lost the race.<br>The moral- "Slow and steady wins the race. This is the version of the<br>story that we've all grown up with."<br><br>THE STORY DOESN'T END HERE<br><br>there are few more interesting<br>things.....it continues as follows......<br><br>The hare was disappointed at losing the race and he did some<br>soul-searching.<br>He realized that he'd lost the race only because he had been overconfident,<br>careless and lax.<br>If he had not taken things for granted, there's no way the tortoise could have beaten him. So he challenged the tortoise to another race.<br>The tortoise agreed. This time, the hare went all out and ran without<br>stopping from start to finish. He won by several miles.<br>The moral - " Fast and consistent will always beat the slow and steady.<br>It's good to be slow and steady; but it's better to be fast and reliable."<br><br>THE STORY DOESN'T END HERE<br>The tortoise did some thinking this time, and realized that there's no<br>way it can beat the hare in a race the way it was currently formatted.<br><br>It thought for a while, and then challenged the hare to another race, but<br>on a slightly different route. The hare agreed. They started off. In keeping<br>with his self-made commitment to be consistently fast, the hare took off and<br>ran at top speed until he came to a broad river. The finishing line was a<br>couple of kilometres on the other side of the river.<br><br>The hare sat there<br>wondering what to do.<br>In the meantime the tortoise trundled along, got into the river, swam to the opposite bank, continued walking and finished the race.<br><br>The moral - "First identify your core competency and then change the<br>playing field to suit your core competency."<br><br>THE STORY STILL HASN'T END HERE<br>The hare and the tortoise, by this time, had become pretty good friends<br>and they did some thinking together.<br><br>Both realized that the last race could<br>have been run much better. So they decided to do the last race again, but to<br>run as a team this time.<br><br>They started off, and this time the hare carried the tortoise till the riverbank. There, the tortoise took over and swam<br>across with the hare on his back. On the opposite bank, the hare again carried<br>the tortoise and they reached the finishing line together. They both felt a<br>greater sense of satisfaction than they'd felt earlier.<br><br>The moral - "It's good to be individually brilliant and to have strong<br>core competencies; but unless you're able to work in a team and harness each<br>other's core competencies, you'll always perform below par because<br>there will always be situations at which you'll do poorly and someone else<br>does well.<br><br>Teamwork is mainly about situational leadership, letting the person<br>with the relevant core competency for a situation take leadership.<br>Note that neither the hare nor the tortoise gave up after failures. The<br>hare decided to work harder and put in more effort after his failure. The<br>tortoise changed his strategy because he was already working as hard as<br>he could."<br>In life, when faced with failure,<br>sometimes it is appropriate to work<br>harder and put in more effort.<br><br>Sometimes it is appropriate to change strategy and try something different.<br><br>And sometimes it is appropriate to do both.<br>The hare and the tortoise also learnt another vital lesson. When we stop competing against a rival and instead start competing against the<br>situation, we perform far better.<br>To sum up- the story of the hare and tortoise has much to say:<br>Chief among them are that fast and consistent will always beat slow and<br>steady;work to your competencies; pooling resources and working as a team will always beat individual performers; never give up when faced with<br>failure; &amp; finally, compete against the situation - not against a rival.<br></div>
