              <p>Beware of Garbage Trucksâ€¨</p>
              <p>by David J. Pollayâ€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>How often do you let other people's nonsense change your mood?</p>
              <p>Do you let a bad driver, rude waiter, curt boss, or an insensitive employee ruin your day?</p>
              <p>Unless you're the Terminator, for an instant you're probably set back on your heels.</p>
              <p>However, the mark of a successful person is how quickly he/she can get back her focus on what's important.</p>
              <p>Sixteen years ago I learned this lesson.</p>
              <p>I learned it in the back of a â€¨New York City taxi cab.</p>
              <p>Here's what happened.</p>
              <p>I hopped in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station.</p>
              <p>We were driving in the right lane when, all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us.</p>
              <p>My taxi driver slammed on â€¨his breaks, skidded, and missed the other car's back end by just inches!</p>
              <p>The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, whipped his head around and he started yelling bad words at us.</p>
              <p>My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy.</p>
              <p>And I mean, he was friendly.</p>
              <p>So, I said, 'Why did you just do that?</p>
              <p>This guy almost ruined your car â€¨and sent us to the hospital!'â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, 'The Law of the Garbage Truck.'â€¨â€¨</p>
              <p>Many people are like garbage trucks.</p>
              <p>They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment.</p>
              <p>As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it.</p>
              <p>And if you let them, they'll dump it on you.</p>
              <p>When someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally.</p>
              <p>You just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.</p>
              <p>You'll be happy you did.</p>
              <p>So this was it: The 'Law of the Garbage Truck.'â€¨</p>
              <p>I started thinking, how often do I let Garbage Trucks run right over me?</p>
              <p>And how often do I take their garbage and spread it to other people: at work, at home, on the streets?</p>
              <p>It was that day I said, 'I'm not going to do it anymore.'â€¨</p>
              <p>I began to see garbage trucks.</p>
              <p>I see the load they're carrying.</p>
              <p>I see them coming to drop it off.</p>
              <p>And like my Taxi Driver, I don't make it a personal thing; I just smile, wave, wish them well, and I move on.</p>
              <p>One of my favourite football players of all time, Walter Payton, did this every day on the football field.</p>
              <p>He would jump up as quickly as he hit the ground after being tackled.</p>
              <p>He never dwelled on a hit.</p>
              <p>Payton was ready to make the next play his â€¨best.</p>
              <p>Good leaders know they have to be ready for their next meeting.</p>
              <p>Good parents know that they have to welcome their children home from â€¨school with hugs and kisses.</p>
              <p>Teachers and parents know that they have to be fully present, and at their best for the people they care about.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is that successful people do not let Garbage Trucks take-over their day.</p>
              <p>What about you?</p>
              <p>What would happen in your life, starting today, if you let more garbage trucks pass you by?</p>
              <p>You'll be happier.</p>
              <p>Here's my bet.</p>
              <p>So, love the people who treat you right.</p>
              <p>Forget about the ones who don't.</p>
              <p>Believe that everything happens for a reason.</p>
              <p>If you get a chance, TAKE IT!</p>
              <p>If it changes your life, LET IT!</p>
              <p>Nobody said it would be easy...â€¨</p>
              <p>They just promised it would be worth it!</p>
