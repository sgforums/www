            <div class='col-md body'>A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large<br>celebration. All of their friends and family came to see the lovely<br>ceremony<br>and to partake of the festivities and celebrations. A wonderful time<br>was<br>had by all.<br><br>The bride was gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the<br>groom was very dashing in his black tuxedo. Everyone could tell that<br>the love they had for each other was true.<br><br>A few months later, the wife comes to the husband with a<br>proposal: "I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can<br>strengthen<br>our marriage." she offered.<br><br>"Each of us will write a list of the things that we find<br>a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we<br>can fix them together and make our lives happier together."<br>The husband agreed. So each of them went to a separate<br>room in the house and thought of the things that annoyed them about the<br>other. They thought about this question for the rest of the day and<br>wrote down what they came up with.The next morning, at the breakfast<br>table, they decided<br>that they would go over their lists.<br>"I'll start," offered the wife. She took out her list.<br>It had many items on it. Enough to fill 3 pages, in fact. As she<br>started<br>reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were<br>starting to appear in her husbands eyes.<br>"What's wrong?" she asked. "Nothing" the husband<br>replied, "keep reading your list."<br>The wife continued to read until she had read all three<br>pages to her husband. She neatly placed her list on the table and<br>folded her hands over top of it.<br>"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the<br>things on both of our lists." She said happily.<br>Quietly the husband stated, "I don't have anything on my<br>list. I think that you are perfect the way that you are. I don't want<br>you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I<br>wouldn't want to try and change anything about you."<br><br>The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his<br>love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept.<br><br>IN LIFE, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and<br>annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them.<br><br>We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise.<br>Why<br>waste time in this world looking for the bad,disappointing or annoying<br>things when we can look around us, and see the wondrous things before<br>us?<br><br>I believe that WE ARE HAPPIEST WHEN we see and praise<br>the good and try our best to forego the mistakes of our spouse Nobody's<br>perfect but we can find perfection in them to change the way we see<br>them. Its is necessary to understand the difficulties and be a helping<br>hand to each other....<br>THAT BRIGHTENS THE RELATIONSHIP. "<br><br>"We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge.<br><br>People make mistakes.<br>We are allowed to make mistakes.<br>But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever.<br>Pause and ponder.<br>Think before you act.<br>Be patient.<br>Forgive &amp; forget. Love one and all.<br></div>
