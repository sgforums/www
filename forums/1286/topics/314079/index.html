              <p>   Okay , from what i know , you can get a DS for cheapest $180 heard this price from a shop at sim lim square 2nd storey ard $208 from a shop in sim lim square 6th floor . The so called supercard or the infamouse R4 is an adapter that allows you to store downloaded games into a micro sd card to insert it into the adapter then insert the adapter into the DS games cartridge slot to play all the downloaded games . With either supercard or R4 you don't have to modify your DS at all and your warranty for DS is still valid due to no modifications needed unlike psp .</p>
              <p>    As for WII or DS , well i have both and if you want interactive games which allows for multiplayer playing and also able to do some exercise , get a WII and whats more , Wii is the greatest platform for playing FPS games cos they have gun adapters for your wiimote to insert and play it like those guns in an arcade . And the graphics although not the best in the market but still decent enough for a normal game . And also many gamnes are played by doing actual motions on your wiimote rather then just some finger exercise sitting on your sofa . Besides Xbox360 have their red ring of death and PS3 have also suffered from the blue ray defective drive . So far only WII is still fully workable .</p>
              <p>    If you want to get supercard or R4 , you have to go ask at the shops yourself . I can only tell you that it is still available in the market but discreetion is advised as it is already banned in sg . And it is also much more expensive then last time at ard $100+ .</p>

              <p>ok.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The DS DOES NOT have to be modified to play ahem games. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You need a flashcart to play ahem games though. Thats the purpose for getting a flashcart.</p>
              <p>Eg. of flashcarts are like what you've mentioned.... Supercard, R4, and many others. It is just like a cartridge and is being inserted into Slot 1 of your DS. (there are 2 slots in your DS, Slot 1 and Slot 2).</p>
              <p><br>If you need flash cart, PM me. Supercard and R4 is not the only option. There are better ones out there.</p>
              <p>It doesnt cost more than $100.</p>
              <p>For the console, you can just get it from qisahn.<br><br></p>
              <p>As for Wii or DS, I cant comment because they're different. But since you have PS3 and Xbox360 I think it's time for you to get a handheld. (oh yes i forgot you have PSP too, damn!  so many   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) It's all up to you.</p>

              <p>it's ok la, my siblings and i also collect consoles <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  but not so hardcore anymore. And yea, we're known of having diff consoles in the entire families <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br></p>
              <p>hmm not really DS has alot of nice RPG games to play and girls usually play those action/cute games only (although there are those who play RPG too) Depends if you have any eyes for the games in DS, games are the most impt element.</p>
              <p>Also, you could play NES/SNES/Atari/Gameboy/Gameboy Color/etc on a DS. Not sure if your from these era  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br></p>
              <p>It's all up to you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif">  and i want a PS3 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>by any chance, if you got friends from China or someone going there for holidays, you can buy the R4 cards for much less. I was there last month and bought a collection of DVDs storage of DS games for $30+. got close to 450 games with me.</p>
              <p>a 1gb micro sd can store about 20-25 games.</p>
              <p>and buy a ds lite if you can.</p>

However you can get flash cart of other brand selling from $95 with 1g micro sd card to $125 i don't know the package though other then having the flash cart .
