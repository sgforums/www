              <p><strong>A 41-year-old woman in Singapore</strong> claims she was duped into paying
                  SGD$1000 (US$722) for a PSP. The woman, who is named as simply
                  "Nicole", priced the Sony portable in various shops, noting it ranged
                  between the equivalent of US$217 and US$434. She visited a shop owned
                  by Yeow Tat Trading Enterprises, telling the friendly and helpful clerk
                  that she was looking for a PSP for her daughter.</p>
              <p>The clerk supposedly told her that while the games were free of
                  charge, the woman needed to pay for the PSP hardware and software
                  upgrading license. The bill? SGD$3,500 (US$2,530). Says Nicole: "I was
                  shocked. I thought he had written an extra zero by mistake... I told
                  him that if the upgraded PSP was going to cost as much as a laptop, I
                  might as well get my daughter a laptop." Then the clerk reduced the
                  price to SGD$3,100 and then down to SGD$2,610, saying it wouldn't have
                  the anti-virus software.</p>
              <p>When the woman asked why other
                  shops didn't charge as much, the store clerk replied that those stores
                  were selling PSPs that did not have original licenses for the software.
                  Convinced, she paid SGD$2,600 (US$1,880), but went back the next day
                  after her brother told her she overpaid. She asked to see the licenses
                  for the software, but was told they were confidential. The store agreed
                  to wave the service charge. The woman ended up paying SGD$1,000
                  (US$722) after getting a SGD$1,600 discount. Says the woman:<br> <br> It was still very expensive but I did not want to waste time... All the
                  while, the sales assistant had an innocent face, and was helpful and
                  appeared sincere... My friends all say I'm so stupid.</p>
              <p>Pretty sure more than your friends are saying that, Nicole.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to say how incredibly stupid she is and I'm getting sick of people getting scammed. Why can't you bloody store owners be honest.</p>
