The mothership will then go on to attack Nod pretty heavily, making things easier for you. The main damage from Nod will be the chemical bombs. Take out the chemical factory and bomb launcher in the Nod base. Again, use air, but this will likely be a suicide mission. Yes, and try to expand as soon as you get the chance to. More Tib fields under your control means more income meaning more Mammoths! Lol.<br><br>Oh, and it's Nod, not NOD.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have completed the all GDI, Nod and Scrim missions...<br>In my opinion, Nod last mission was the most challenging for me. You have to defend Scrin from GDI assaults. If you send units to defend Scrin base, the Scrin will still regard Nod as enemy and attack Nod units. If you go directly against GDI, Scrin will grow in power and attack you.</div>
