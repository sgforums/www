              <h1><strong><a href="http://www.video-game-addiction.org/">Video Game Addiction</a></strong></h1>
              <p>When video games become more than just games...</p>
              <h1>Symptoms of Video Game Addiction in Teens</h1>
              <p>Although it hasn't been given an "official" diagnosis, 
                  addiction-like behaviors with computer, video, and Internet gaming have 
                  noticeably increased among both teenagers and adults. Like any addictive
                   behavior, there are signs to look for if you suspect your teen might 
                  have a gaming addiction. Your teen need only exhibit two or three of 
                  these symptoms for his behavior to be considered "addictive."</p>
              <div>Though this list is not exhaustive, it provides warning signs for 
              parents, friends, and other family members to look for if they are 
              concerned about someone's use of video, computer, or Internet games. 
              This list can also be used as a self-diagnosis tool for those who 
              believe they may have a problem.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Preoccupation</strong></div>
              <div>Someone who is addicted to computer, video, or Internet gaming often 
              exhibits an unusual preoccupation with the game or computer when he is 
              away from it. The teen could seem distracted, irritable, or 
              disinterested and may talk about the game almost constantly.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Downplaying Computer Use</strong></div>
              <div>t's common for someone with addictive, computer-related behaviors to 
              downplay the amount of time she spends in front of the TV or computer. 
              The person may make excuses, saying she "needs" to be online, or may 
              outright lie.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Lack Of Control</strong></div>
              <div>A person who is addicted, or at risk of becoming addicted to gaming, is 
              unable to control the amount of time she spends on the computer. She may
               go online with the intent to spend 15 or 20 minutes, but will keep 
              extending the time until several hours have passed.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Loss Of Time</strong></div>
              <div>Along the same lines, a person may sit down at his computer, again with 
              the intent to spend only a few minutes, but completely lose track of 
              time and suddenly find that several hours have passed. It is not unusual
               for someone with a gaming addiction to play through the night and only 
              realize how much time has passed when the sun begins to rise.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Negative Impact On Other Areas Of Life</strong></div>
              <div>Because the person spends so much time on the computer or video game 
              console, other areas of life are neglected. He may grow distant from 
              friends and family who had previously been close. Homework may go 
              unfinished, causing grades to slip. In more extreme cases, the teen may 
              even neglect personal hygiene, choosing to play video games rather than 
              taking a shower.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Hiding From Negative Or Uncomfortable Feelings Or Situations</strong></div>
              <div>Some people become addicted to gaming because they use it to 
              self-medicate. When confronted with situations or feelings that are 
              uncomfortable (feeling sad, arguing with a friend, or getting a bad 
              grade), the person may "hide" in the game as a method of avoidance.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Defensiveness</strong></div>
              <div>When confronted or asked about his time spent gaming, a person may 
              become defensive. Denial is often an indication that something is wrong,
               especially if the person seems unconcerned that friends and family feel
               neglected or left out of his life.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Misuse Of Money</strong></div>
              <div>Someone who is addicted to video, computer, or Internet gaming will 
              spend a disproportionate amount of money on computer-related items. The 
              person will seem to be continually upgrading hardware, software 
              packages, and accessories. This becomes an even greater problem if the 
              person spends money that should be used for bills, groceries, and other 
              necessities.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>Mixed Feelings</strong></div>
              <div>As with any addiction, use of the "substance" – in this case, the video 
              game – initially causes euphoric feelings, but that euphoria is quickly 
              followed by guilt. Guilt may be felt either over what the person is 
              doing while online or simply the amount of time he is spending at the 
              computer.</div>

              TIPS ON BECOMING A PRO GAMER
              
              Ted Owen, from the Global Gaming League, has some advice for those wanting to become pro gamers: get good, and get noticed. Whether you start your gaming career by playing at LANs or competing online, practicing hard and playing against others who are at the top of their game will help you improve yours
              
              There are various organised games tournaments, some of which offer cash prizes, providing incentives to play and win. Winning a lot of online and LAN tournaments will help bring your name to the forefront, as well as netting you some useful cash.
              
              It's not just about skill, though. Personality and branding are also important when trying to stand out from the competitionâ€”media-friendly gamers have a wider appeal than just their firing accuracy. Consider taking classes to improve your PR and image, and think about your appeal outside the gaming world, and you might land some sponsorship and media deals.
              
              Prizes and sponsorship aren't all there is to aim for; the top professional gamers can land themselves full-time positions with regular salaries, and concentrate solely on their gaming. At this level, gamers really are virtual athletes, with intensive training programmes to match those of top sports players worldwide. But staying flexible is key, as tournament games and sponsors are likely to change.
              
              For anyone just starting out, it's a lot of hard work to become (and stay) a professional gamerâ€”but players like Fatal1ty, and the members of Team 3D, show that it can be done. Get yourself online, get into ladders and tournaments, and show the world what you're made of.
