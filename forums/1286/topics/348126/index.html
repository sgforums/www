              <blockquote>
              <p><em><strong>1.1	What is EVE Online?</strong></em><br> <br> EVE is a massive multiplayer online game (MMOG) set in a
                          science-fiction based, persistent world. Players take the role of
                          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spaceship pilots</span> seeking fame, fortune, and adventure in a <strong>huge</strong>,
                          <strong>complex</strong>, <strong>exciting</strong>, and sometimes <strong>hostile</strong> galaxy.</p>
              <p><em><strong>1.5 How is my persona represented in the game?</strong></em><br> <br> Players are represented in the game by avatars, both as ships and with
                          a customized portrait created by the player. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not possible to exit
                          your ship and explore planets or space stations.</span> Each EVE Online
                          account contains three character slots, giving users ample opportunity
                          to try out different skills, races and appearances.</p>
              <p><em><strong>1.10 What is basic game play like?</strong></em><br> <br>The diversity and flexibility of EVE makes it difficult to
                          categorize it by conventional standards. What it is depends on the
                          level at which it is played. <br> <br> The game is set in an unknown portion of space, spanning thousands of
                          solar systems, many of which are settled. Players begin by creating an
                          in-game character equipped with a basic spaceship ready to explore the
                          world.</p>
              <p>As they get acquainted with life in EVE, players can <strong>trade</strong> goods
                          between systems or conduct other money-making ventures such as <strong>mining</strong> asteroids, transporting goods as a <strong>courier</strong> or even cleaning up debris
                          for recycling.</p>
              <p>Financial gains made through such activities can be used
                          to upgrade the ship with weapons and equipment and also to develop the
                          character by purchasing skill packs used for training him or her in
                          various skills he will need to advance in the world of EVE.<br> <br> When a player has mastered the basics of the game, aquired some money
                          and equipment and advanced his or her character through basic skills,
                          the possibilities become almost endless.</p>
              <p>Players who wish to explore
                          peaceful paths may continue to upgrade their ships to bigger and better
                          cargo vessels with high-end defenses, purchase advanced mining or
                          research equipment and continue to develop their characters by
                          specializing in their preferred skills. Others may elect to pursue a
                          more dangerous path such as <strong>piracy</strong>, <strong>smuggling</strong> or <strong>bounty hunting</strong>.</p>

              <p>In-game, my character home base is in Caldari region, Oimmo (Security 0.5). So it is best if you choose the Caldari race from start if you want to team up with me.</p>

              <p>The main difference between different races is the ships they command.</p>

              <p>Ok...</p>
              <p>First - People dont pick race according to location as getting to where your friends are is easy and generally you wont do missions with your friends untill level 3 missions. Its good to be in a corp with your friend, but as ive seen so far people arent dedicated to the process of corp creation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second - Anyone out there playing eve know how to get time cards via stores etc due to my lack or a credit card to use to charge with? Sounds funny but yah im not going to live here for the rest of my life so yah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any info on timie cards would be useful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get a genuine in game idea of playstyle find someone you know that plays and watch them do something interesting, preferably not mining as i HATE it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, anyone out there that plays eve in singapore drop me a text, im pretty knoledgable and have basicly been there and done that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My cell number is 93276455 so call me or drop me a text. next week im free to be as lazy and candide as possible so can organize a meeting of eve players iin singapore if there are enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Goodluck players and if ure interested in the game but are not 100% sure (due to the crappy new player experience) Call or text me so i may reassure u....every eve player has been there at least once.</p>
