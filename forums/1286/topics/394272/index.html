              <p><br>We all know that MMO is short for MMORPG, which is a pretty spectacular thing. When you consider the amount of effort, scope, time and money that goes with it, they are truly the giants of the gaming industry. What a pity, nowadays, many MMOs are lacking in the RPG part. Someone explains it in this way: People don't wanna make really big storylines because everyone would want to do something different at any point of the game, not to mention that in an MMORPG there is no end to the story so what you do really amounts to nothing. So the developers feature the leveling and the stats, but nothing of the large sense of place and storyline that the genre hails as its namesake.</p>
              <p>Many MMOs succeed in being MMOs, but fail in being a RPG. For example in EVE Online, a game in which everyone exists in a single galaxy, the breadth and scale of the game world is breathtaking. The interactivity and socializing featured in the universe is brilliant. However, some feel it poorly implements the roleplaying part of the game, and the roots of the term do define what most MMORPGs are fundamentally aiming at: being an RPG with massive players. It seems that the developer try to prove it is an RPG because you can level up, instead of filling a role in a story.</p>
              <p><br><a href="http://images.mmosite.com/my/upload/fd/28/palelord/10/0104/20100104171929_650.jpg"><img src="http://images.mmosite.com/my/upload/fd/28/palelord/10/0104/20100104171929_650.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="342"></a></p>
              <p><br>Roleplaying games means you are playing a role, acting as yourself or a game character, and fulfill quests, which should be interesting or meaningful in and of itself, not only just another way to get phat lootz. But many MMORPGs just allow you the simple choice of picking a race and class and those choices decide which way you will go. A real Roleplaying game, such as those in the Never Winter Night series, has an epic storyline, which you have to read carefully to learn what will happen and what to do next. Yes, these games have many choices which may lead to different endings, but it is too difficult to be applied in MMORPGs, so I am not that critical.</p>
              <p><br><img src="http://images.mmosite.com/my/upload/fd/28/palelord/10/0322/20100322185709_536.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450"></p>
              <p><br>I just learn that the new expansion of Eudemons Online, Demon Rising, will release its new quests following The Vengeance of Alamut. The story of Almaut: <em>It starts with unavoidable consequences of undoable mistakes. Once he was a knight of the Holy See, but his fame bred jealousy and tried to send him to hell. A nefarious plan was hatched to kill his beloved wife … </em>That`s why Alamut returned as a demon and launched this attack towards his motherland.</p>
              <p><em><br>BENEATH THE LAND OF THE DIVINE KINGDOM<br>A PLACE WHERE ALL DEMONIC SPIRITS ARE HELD<br>A DEMONIC HELL THAT HAS BEEN SEALED FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS               </em></p>
              <p><em>NOW THE DEVILS HAVE AWAKENED<br>SOME HAVE EVEN ESCAPED THEIR FIREY PRISON<br>TO ANSWER THE CALL OF THEIR VICIOUS LORD<br>DETERMINED TO CORRUPT THE MORTAL WORLD</em></p>
              <p><br><a href="http://images.91.com/eo/images/news/demon_hell.jpg"><img src="http://images.91.com/eo/images/news/demon_hell.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="369"></a></p>
              <p><br>Though Alamut has been suppressed temporarily, the mighty heroes in the land had to face the full might of Demon Hell. You have to unseal the 8 chambers in a sequence to defeat the Demons and save the world.</p>
              <p><em><br>THE GATE TO THE UNDERGROUND WORLD IS OPEN<br>ARE YOU PREPARED FOR THE ULTIMATE BATTLE?</em></p>
              <p><br>Another piece of good news is that WoW is investing in new technology like phasing to try to create alterable simulations and replace the predictable everything will reset in T - minus 6 minutes environments. Let's expect the best roleplaying, which was set in a game that had absolutely zero over-arching story, just a setting and some rules, because it's roleplayers who truly bring roleplaying to games.<br> </p>

              <p>What's more, someone said that The Old Republic is also a great roleplaying game. However, to my eyes, its characters models don't look so good, lol.</p>

              Another news about Demon Rising.
              
              The war against the Demons will never end. In this brand new episode, the story of the Demon invasion expands further. Players are going to set off on a tour of hell. A secret world full of demonic lore will then be unveiled. Players need to unseal eight chambers of sin in a sequence, battling with the cunning bosses and even dark mirror images of themselves!
