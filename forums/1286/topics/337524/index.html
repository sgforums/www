              <p>Really now.</p>
              <p>It just struck me that the majority of Singaporeans, say 60%, (now, I'm just pulling figures out of thin air with no research what-so-ever) have never really experienced the true gaming experience.</p>
              <p>Most people are just restricted to the oh-so typical Defence of the Ancients <span style="font-style: italic;">mod </span>(heck, it's not even a real game.) Yes, I give Icefrog (father of DotA) credit for creating such a blockbuster hit, but really people, there are much more outstanding games than Warcraft III.</p>
              <p>A recent visit to a cybercafe yielded unsurprising result. Many of them were playing DotA, MapleStory and CounterStrike 1.6.</p>
              <p>Is this the average gaming diet of a Singaporean? If so, this is poor cruisine and another fine dining experience ought to be catered.</p>
              <p>I get scoffed at for purchasing hits like Fallout 3 or even Left 4 Dead. I cried myself to sleep, rocking in my dark corner, hugging my darling Fallout 3.</p>
              <p>What I really would like to get for Christmas is that Singaporeans move out of the gaming  hits of 1998 and move on to 2008.</p>

              <p>Dota is crap. And the father of dota is eul btw. I play warcraft standard which i feel is the real warcraft 3 game and not dota.</p>
              <p>I think that the system in sg does not allow gamers to play much. Parents will constantly nag if kids spend on games.</p>
              <p>Games in sg are played for thier action packed fast paced style therefore dota and cs. Maple is just lame. Most of this games are multiplayer so no two games are excatly alike, thus players can get most of the game for the cost.</p>

Been playing Oblivion and now playing fallout 3, those are the good games. Can't believe kiddies playing a 2D maple story game</p></div>

              <p>people play games to enjoy mah.. if they like the games why not.. it's just a matter of taste.</p>
              <p>personally i don't find dota appealing at all.. hellgate was full of potential but a total letdown. ra3 i at soviet third mission abit sian already.. even fallout 3 currently at level 7 i also abit sian liao... could be i am getting old no mood to play game liao lol... not even excited that sc2 is coming out.</p>
              <p>looking forward only to diablo 3/ disciples 3. hope cod5 can bring me some excitement haha.</p>

              <p>DotA in every aspect is still a game, not an MMORPG, but still a mod of a RTS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll never go down to a lanshop alone, the only reason I'll enter it is to play games with a group of friends, it's completely different to play side by side then on Vent or just keyboard chat. Also, there are many people in Singapore who doesn't have the privilege to enjoy gaming at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The father of DotA is not Eul, the father of Dota ALLSTAR is Guinsoo. DotA was there long ago, Guinsoo took it up and gave a revolutionary change to it named Allstar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you're saying is something like certain genres of games sucks compare to others. To each his/her own. "One man's meat is another man's poison". What you might enjoy might be something others loathe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you're saying that Singaporeans enjoy old games, there's nothing wrong with it! Older games like RO, Diablo II, Warcraft III(I consider this recent even though it's like 6 years old), Fallout are still well appreciated by people all around the world, because they're awesome.</p>

              <p>COD5 &lt; COD4</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>COD4 is much better IMO, but maybe it's due to me having a strong affection for modern weapons and stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>COD5 is tougher, the camouflage is a pain in the ass, can't see shit.</p>
              <p>Have yet to try the online vers though.</p>

              <p>VagueHart, yes, I agree that many Singaporeans prefer older games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what about people who play new shady releases?</p>
              <p>F.E.A.R. for example, had absolutely no Singapore players at all on its multiplayer. This contributed to the lack of Singaporean servers, and forcing me to play on 120 ping high GameArena championship ladders.</p>
              <p>It's very frustrating when you want a game or two, but you have to connect to another country and suffer, just because your fellow gamers cannot simply move on.</p>
