            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone tell me how can maple be fun at a high level?<br>Regarding quest and events in maple. Its still boring as hell.<br>And how much skill is involved in order to understand the game? Skill as in the amount of knowledge and technique.<br><br>And almost every player in maple has this mentality that ksing is wrong. Whats wrong with it. Some play the game to irritate others, accept it.<br><br>Like in fighting games. Like say tekken. In order to excel. You got to memorise setups,mixups and even frame datas. You got to learn how to buffer things. And stuff like this take at least half a year or more to be considered a average player. Thus most people are un willing to put their effort in the game. Most of the good players i know are either from NUS,NTU,JC or working adults. I have seen 0 ahbeng that excel in fighting game. In sg, and in other countries. Excel = top 10 in SG. I seen, soul calibur tournies,tekken tournies, KOF tournies. And none of the winners are ah bengs. If there are please correct me.<br><br>But for maple, it is just being able to recognise items and stuff. When you are done with that. You just got to tap on one button to attack. I have seen people that just wont get bored playing the game for hours and attack the same monster just to level up, its completely retarded. And most of these people are either primary school kids, ah beng or teens with nth better to do. MOST. But some people still claim that it is fun and its a good game that takes skill. To them.<br>Skill = Level.<br><br>I am not promoting that everyone must play a game that takes plenty of skill and put in effort in their game. I know there are causual players. The reason i started this cause i am still puzzled why do people spend so much money for a causual game. Like buying PPC and high level accts from others. And how fun can the game be? Cause i dont see the "fun" factor in the game at all.</div>
