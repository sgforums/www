I was offered $250 for a dsi (eng.version) from a shop called evolution. It was like so cheap =.= and the second time i went there another guy from the shop offered me at $220.. They said that they could lower the price if my friend and I buy it from them together.. I was afraid that it might be a scam...My friend said that dsi can't be scammed like the psp(mod) but, I am afraid that they meddled with the software or other stuffs(better be safe)  Heard that shop had an ugly history and was blacklisted.. Other shops are selling it at $300... The prices range are so far apart..     If anyone had bought it from the shop or somewhere in sim lim, pls tell me if it is reliable to get 1 from there .... Thx a lot</p></div>

              <p>Shops don't get blacklisted for no reason.</p>
              <p>The reason why such shops are still open is thanks to people like you.</p>

              <p>hey beware...</p>
              <p>some shopkeepers out there are really trying to earn more <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>EXTRAS</strong></span> from selling their chargers.etc..</p>
              <p>There's this foreigner who nearly got cheated by just enquiring a usb cable costing @ <strong><span style="color: #800080;">SG80</span></strong> bucks.Really too much...then the foreigner refused to buy and the shopkeepers showed middle finger to them...</p>
              <p>I think those shopkeepers should be very mindful of what they are doing...!!!</p>

              <p>Got a friend of mine who was introduced to a shop in sim lim square by another friend to buy a DS lite. He bought the DS at 230, thinking it's quite cheap because of the limited edition thingy. To his horror, it was actually a 'recon' set.</p>
              <p>recon meaning that the parts in the DS were changed, meaning that it's not a new one.</p>
