Never mind that he's more famous for throwing something else other than a basketball.<br><br>And it's just so he can help sell a China-made game console.<br><br>That's the unlikely role that has thrust multiple South-east Asia (SEA) Games gold medallist James Wong into the spotlight with Netizens.<br><br>They are wondering why a well-known and decorated sportsman like Mr Wong would endorse a product that is a lookalike of a well-known game console.<br><br>Some Netizens felt that this was bad for Singapore's image.<br><br>The former national discus thrower endorses the China-made Vii, which closely resembles Japan's Nintendo Wii, a console with a wireless remote controller that allow users to play sports simulation games.<br><br>TV AD<br><br>In a TV advertisement in China for the Vii, Mr Wong touts the console as a good way to exercise.<br><br>He says in Mandarin: 'Getting children into the habit of exercising regularly is the best thing parents can do for them.'<br><br>The advertisement introduces Mr Wong as the vice chairman of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) athletes' commission.<br><br>It also features still shots of news coverage on Mr Wong's sporting achievements, and clips of his children playing with the Vii.<br><br>LetVGO, the China company which markets the Vii, also features Mr Wong on its website as its 'Golden Star' spokesman, referring to him as Singapore's Yao Ming.<br><br>His family is also named as the official 'spokesfamily' for the company, which distributes lifestyle products like fitness equipment and electronic goods.<br><br>Its three signature products include the Vii, an inflatable jet-ski and an exercise bench.<br><br>Mr Wong's wife, Ms Jana Lauren, is also featured in a promotional video for the Vii, where she is seen playing a bowling game. She is also featured on LetVGO's website using the exercise machine.<br><br>When contacted yesterday, Mr Wong confirmed that he is endorsing the Vii. He seemed surprised and asked this reporter how she had found out.<br><br>He agreed to answer questions sent in an e-mail but did not respond by press time. Calls to his handphone went unanswered.<br><br>The New Paper also tried in vain to contact LetVGO to find out why it had picked Mr Wong and family to endorse its products.<br><br>While showbusiness personalities like Li Nanxing and Moses Lim have been paid to endorse China property developments, they are known in China through their shows.<br><br>It's not clear how well-known Mr Wong is to the Chinese.<br><br>The Vii has gained online notoriety among gaming enthusiasts since its launch in October, less than a year after Nintendo released the Wii last December.<br><br>Computerandvideogames.com, a gaming website, contacted Nintendo, which said it had 'absolutely nothing to do' with the Vii, which is being sold through a home shopping network in China.<br><br>Customers have to call the LetVGO hotline to order the Vii.<br><br>BAD REVIEWS<br><br>Since its release, the console has also been reviewed on numerous gaming sites including Engadget.com, Joystiq.com and Gizmodo.com, all of which labelled it a low-quality imitation of the Nintendo product, which is not yet available in China.<br><br>One reviewer even posted a video of a Vii console being disassembled, revealing a small circuit board inside the console's white casing.<br><br>There is also a weight attached to the base of the console to make the device appear heavier, and to allow it to stand vertically.<br><br>The reviewer wrote: 'The craptacular Vii doesn't even require CDs: it comes from the factory loaded with a whole bunch of knock-off games.'<br><br>The TV advertisement featuring Mr Wong was posted on YouTube and is fast making its rounds in the online community here.<br><br>It has drawn mainly negative responses from netizens who feel Mr Wong's endorsement of the console reflects badly on Singapore.<br><br>In a response on Gameaxis.com, user Shadowkiller wrote: 'I'm throwing my citizenship away. I'm ashamed to meet my international peers if they see this.'<br><br>Another netizen, Al, wrote: 'I believe we will have no issues if the Vii spokesman is a mainland Chinese.'<br><br>Mr Lee Wei Meng, 22, editor of Singaporean gaming publication Gamesync.net, feels Mr Wong could have been more prudent in his decision to endorse the Vii.<br><br>He said: 'As a national athlete who has represented Singapore in international events, he should be more careful about choosing what products to endorse.<br><br>'His endorsement would reflect badly on Singapore. It's no secret that many Western companies view the region - including Singapore - as an area where piracy is a serious problem.<br><br>'There's no sense in compounding these perceptions.'<br><br>However, some Netizens are giving him the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>One Netizen, Kenster, wrote: 'Maybe James was conned into thinking that he was endorsing the real Wii.'<br><br>Vii vs Wii<br><br>[*] Like Nintendo Wii, Vii has wireless remote control. Controls and main consoles of both look almost identical<br><br>[*] Vii comes pre-loaded with 12 games, including bowling, baseball and a dice game. Unlike Wii, it doesn't require CDs and does not have disk drive<br><br>[*] Vii retails for 986 yuan ($193) in China. Wii retails for about $650, bundled with additional controller and one game, in Singapore</div>
