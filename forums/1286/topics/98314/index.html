            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">PC Gamer Declares Half-Life 2 "The Most Important Game YouÂ’ll Ever Play" </span></strong><br>"ItÂ’s history in the making." Â– Editor-in-Chief Dan Morris<br><br>(Brisbane, CA) October 20, 2004 Â– PC Gamer, the worldÂ’s best-selling PC games magazine, got a world-exclusive first look at hotly-anticipated Half-Life 2 in its December issue, which hits newsstands October 19th, 2004. The game was given an "EditorsÂ’ Choice" award and a review rating of 98%, the highest rating in the magazineÂ’s history.<br><br>PC Gamer was the first publication invited to review Half-Life 2. The December issue of PC Gamer features a 9-page review written by Senior Editor Chuck Osborn, exclusive screen captures, and a four-page technical Q &amp; A with Gary McTaggart, ValveÂ’s resident tech guru.<br><br>"Half-Life 2 is arguably the best game ever made to date. It is a groundbreaking experience in interactive entertainment," states PC GamerÂ’s Senior Editor, Chuck Osborn, "While some games have groundbreaking visuals, or intellectually-challenging gameplay, or perhaps a cinematic story with good voice acting, not one has ever delivered the complete package. Half-Life 2 nails it, surpassing the original in every way."<br><br>Sales of the groundbreaking, next generation first-person PC shooter Half-Life exceed more than 10 million units worldwide to date and devotees have waited six years for the sequel. The release marks the debut of ValveÂ’s revolutionary new Source engine, which enables cutting-edge graphics and takes advantage of the newest video cards and processors.<br><br>The review takes readers through the entire game, focusing on the gameplay and sheer enjoyment and highlighting the enhanced environments, new weapons, plot, character animation, sound and more. The review also boasts a description of Counter-Strike: Source Â­ the multiplayer mode that ships with Half-Life 2.<br><br>Additionally, PC GamerÂ’s Hard Stuff section features a four-page Q &amp; A with Gary McTaggart, Valve SoftwareÂ’s resident tech guru, titled "12 Things You Need to Know About running Half-Life 2 on Your PC". It details what readers can anticipate from the games visuals and expect from their existing system specs, including minimum system spec requirements and upgrade options for optimal performance.<br><br>"Valve is honored to have the first Half-Life 2 review featured as the cover of the December 2004 issue of PC Gamer and its many international affiliates," says Doug Lombardi, Director of Marketing at Valve. "For over a decade, PC Gamer has been the authority for gamers and industry insiders. In spring 1997, PC Gamer UK filed the first-ever preview of Half-Life. Today, PC Gamer is a worldwide voice and a flagship among FutureÂ’s fleet of leading publications.<br><br>Future Network USAÂ’s Group Publisher, Simon Whitcombe, states, "As the editorial and circulation market-leader, PC Gamer is the obvious choice in which to debut new games and reach hardcore, early purchasing gamers. Additionally, PC Gamer is an ideal partner because it also reaches a wider games audience and continues to generate excitement for games long after their launch with its monthly Extended Play section, dedicated to sourcing and providing extensions, game mods and downloads."<br><br>Rounding out a blockbuster issue, the December PC Gamer also features a contest for a customized, $6,000 Half-Life 2 super-PC from Falcon Northwest. The contest is sponsored by Falcon Northwest.<br><br>"Valve has forged the framework for the next generation of games, demonstrating what our medium can and should be able to accomplish," Osborn concludes in his review. Half-Life 2 is "an exhilarating entertainment that can emotionally move you one moment, kick ass the next, and keep you immersed the whole time."</div>
