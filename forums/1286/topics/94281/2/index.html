            <div class='col-md body'>Xbox overtaking PS2 in singapore? i believe it's highly possible. cos if u look at it, Xbox is like most of the time giving out free in some contest, subscriptions to what what what, for example starhub maxonline. u can get it free 1 way or another.<br><br>also the Xbox marketing is better than PS2. every computer roadshow or exhibition, surely will have Xbox 1. look at Funan IT mall, every level have x-box.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its possible, considering many of PS2 hit games are going over, etc. DRIV3R, EA Sports titles, GTA, Burnout 3...<br><br>One thing xbox lacked is a decent controller. The Dual Shock 2 is way more comfortable.</div>

So far, Microsoft has declared that it will place emphasis heavily on XNA, their new programming platform architecture.  That is to say Microsoft is depending on the software edge.  PS3 will have their bet on the Cell architecture, which is a coordinated effort by Toshiba, IBM and a few other majoy players.<br><br>I'm not bashing XBOX. I'm just stating certain facts and views. If you are keen on well-balanced articles on consoles and PC, go get the magzine <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/" rel="nofollow">EDGE</a>.  It's available in MPH bookstores only.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sillyme:</div><div class="quote_body">If you have been following the news on XBOX2 and PS3, it is already known that PS3 is has better hardware.  So far, Microsoft has declared that it will place emphasis heavily on XNA, their new programming platform architecture.  That is to say Microsoft is depending on the software edge.  PS3 will have their bet on the Cell architecture, which is a coordinated effort by Toshiba, IBM and a few other majoy players.<br><br>I'm not bashing XBOX. I'm just stating certain facts and views. If you are keen on well-balanced articles on consoles and PC, go get the magzine <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/" rel="nofollow">EDGE</a>.  It's available in MPH bookstores only.  It covers from game development to publishing to reviews.</div></blockquote>yo.bro,i've been updating news abt the ps3 and the xbox.what u have said are rumours.microsoft have never comfirmed those specs.u think microsoft will wanna release a inferior console to the ps3?XNA is comfirmed,but the hardware are not.show me a link to prove me wrong.cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so the question remains unanswered. ps3 is definitely coming out later since microsoft wants to have the first-mover advantage.<br>if ps3 is better in hardware, are you going back to ps3? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
