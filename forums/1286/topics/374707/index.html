            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Ok. I've opened this topic to find your feedback. I am not speaking for or representing any side (Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo).</p>
              <p>I'll run through the happenings in chronological order so that you can understand what is going on. Just bear with me for the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, I'm an owner of the Xbox generation 1 console, the Xbox 360 Pro and the Playstation 3 consoles. I've had the Xbox 360 (X360) for a long time and have about 30 games for it. I've had the Xbox generation 1 for a mega long time and have about 50 games on it.  Recently, because of the Playstation 3's (PS3) line-up (God of War 3, Uncharted, and the irresistable free online play), I bought the PS3 and am now expanding my collection for PS3 games.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, my X360 had the dreaded Red Ring of Death (RRoD) problem 3 times now. My 3 year warranty is up and the next <strong>RRoD problem will cost me $149.45 for repairs</strong> (according to Microsoft Singapore customer support line).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ironically, I saw hope (and I'm sure all Xbox 360 Pro owners in Singapore saw hope too) when they heard that Microsoft was going to do a Trade-in system whereby you can trade in your old consoles for a discount to buy the new Xbox 360 Elite (X360E), which is valued at S$499, after a massive price cut from S$679. The X360E is supposed to be the new Jasper set where RRoD problems should be almost non-existant. They mentioned that additional details will be give out at the COMEX week and the maxmim trade-in value of a console will be $250. Wow. So I thought I can trade in my X360 console and top up only $249. Or if the X360 does not meet $250, maybe trade in both my Xbox and my X360.</p>
              <p>So, the Trade-in was going to be run by a Third-Party company called Recycle Point Pte Ltd. And here is what the Microsoft Public Relations guy revealed just recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I've got to admit that I almost cho</span>ked on the cup of coffee I was drinking. My immediate instinct was to cry 'Foul'. X360 owners were super unhappy that their WORKING X360 console is only valued at $40! Most of us actually looked forward to trading in our X360 for the X360E, but all our jaws just dropped when we saw the news. I cannot believe that the Microsoft Marketing Director even let this happen. <strong>Microsoft Singapore's response is that they are actually targeting PS3 users and Nintendo Wii users, letting them know that they can let go of their consoles and support Microsoft. </strong>But let me ask you; If you had a working PS3, are you gonna trade it in for a measly $250? <strong>It's even harder to believe that 2 Gameboy Advance can buy a X360 based on the prices above.</strong></p>
              <p>When Microsoft Singapore mentioned that they have UNBEATABLE PRICES for Comex 2009, I have to agree. It was unbeatable indeed (pun intended)! More responses to this outrage can be seen from the Xbox 360 Singapore fanpage in Facebook and the Brotherhood of the Box forums.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But like I said, I am here to hear feedback on the situation from all sides, whether you're a loyalist to Sony or Nintendo.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And to Microsoft Singapore:</strong> Thank you for letting us loyal Xbox users know that we spent $600+ buying a console that is practically worthless in return. After all the drama since you entered the console wars, I can safely say that you, my dear Microsoft, have hyped the Xbox 360 from the very start.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, if there was only a way I can sell all my Xbox games and buy PS3 games with whatever I can get in return.</p>

              <p>I have a Sony PS3 myself and was tempted to buy a a 360 myself when I got my first paycheck but after hearing all this stuff of the 360 having the RRoD turned me off I suggest you sell your 360 as you have no reason to have it and maybe sell of it games to get the upcoming titles for the PS3 I am trying my best to save alot of money just to buy 1! game let alone you have 30 for your 360.</p>
              <p>Thats just my opinion and btw how is the PS3 online? because I have yet to try it since buying.</p>

              <p>Research before getting an Xbox 360. Make sure you're getting one with a Jasper chipset. Otherwise, wait for a few more months for the Valhalla chipset.</p>
              <p>PS3 online is okay. It does not have as much features as Xbox LIVE does, such as matchmaking and it lags more (hey, it's free). The only thing you need to do wih the PS3 is to make multiple accounts and have each account for each region. For some reason, items available in the PS store is region specific. For example, I get my demos from the US and EU store.</p>
