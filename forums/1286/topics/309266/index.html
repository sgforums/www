               A) What are Treasure Troves ?
               -----------------------------
              
               Majority of the stages have hidden areas and will only reveal
               themselves when you have captured the area beside them. These
               hidden areas are called Treasure Troves in the game. When you
               defeat the general in the Treasure Trove, you will unlocked that
               general as your officer. You can bring them to battle once you've
               unlocked them.
