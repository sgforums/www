            <div class='col-md body'>Here's what F2P and P2P <strong>REALLY</strong> means.<br><br>P2P = A community for MOSTLY adults.<br>F2P = A community for MOSTLY kids.<br><br>Catch my drift? CABAL-SEA will hopefully be P2P, but looking at how the European server is going, I'm guessing that Asiasoft will follow suit and be F2P with plenty of in-game cash items. ( Which foolish kids never fail to waste their money on ) Take a look at Maplestory, how many kids actually spammed their money on Gachapons, Megaphones, Clothes ,etc? I'd say, too many.<br><br>Indeed, they are earning money, but I would rather call it <span style="font-style: italic;">ripping off the kids</span>. Yes, it is a business strategy, it's a tactic to earn money, then again, think about it, how kids are affected this way, how parents are going to support their kids, how kids don't even know how to think correctly.<br><br>Also, if the game is F2P, it will lead to cash items imbalancing character development. What do I mean? Simple. The most common items among cash items would be 2X Exp and 2X Drop Rate crap. You got the money, you become more powerful than others, and more imbalanced items gets added to cash shop, and then the richer people will get more imbalanced than ever. This leads to an imbalanced community where the people unwilling to spend money on the game being outcasted by the rest.<br><br>If the games was P2P, it will contain people genuinely enjoying the game and really playing it. For a kid, they rarely would go for such a game, mainly because their parents will not allow it, and also most of P2P games have a mature theme that kids will not enjoy. ( But Ragnarok is different, for it captured many people's heart with their graphic and gameplay. )<br><br>Enough said, I'm not trying to critisize anyone, or trying to flame anything. All I'm saying Asiasoft should reconsider their business strategy, for there are certain morals in the society that should be strictly followed. As to CABAL-SEA being P2P, that's very unlikely, since it's managed by Asiasoft and also because the European server is F2p. That's my 2-cents worth. =)</div>
