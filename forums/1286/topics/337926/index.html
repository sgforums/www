              <p>Thinking to buy a game console for my son (10 years old).  My wife will play with my son also.  So PS3 / Wii / Xbox360, which one is better for my case?</p>
              <p>I seldom play video game and don't know which one is better.  Any idea?</p>
              <p>Please also suggest some good games.  Preferably with the estimated price.</p>

              <p>   Well lets talk abt PS3 first , PS3 is a very advance gaming console whereby it is able to support HD graphics utilising its blue ray technology . If you want the technical spec i would recomend you to check out its website . But one thing i like abt PS3 is it has alot of japanese themed games which are of good quality . But most of its games are can only be played by either 1 or 2 players using control pads with wires ( but i heard there are wireless ones available in the market but will have to check it out ) . As for the prices , the PS3 price ranges for its built in 40g , 60g and 80g harddisk . But many of the PS3 prices in the market are ard $500+ . But do check ard for prices and hardisk range .</p>
              <p>As for WII as a matter of fact i do own one myself , and what i felt was the WII although not as advanced as PS3 and also doesn't support HD graphics . It is very family theme based and has a number of games able to play 4 players at once . One such game was Raving Rabbit series . I own the Rayman Rabbit part 2 and basically it is a mini game based game where you have to compete in some mini games to unlock more mini games if you are playing it for the first time . I would recomend this console if you are looking for some family based games as the games are more general as compared to PS3 which have quite a number of serious type gaming for adult .The WII doesn't have any built in harddisk but is able to save games by using some flash memory thingy i supposed but one good thing abt it is you can insert or use SD card to backup your saved games . . ( But of cos theres a limit much smaller then PS3 )And last but not least , the highly anticipated Monster Hunter 3 is coming to the WII soon .</p>
              <p>   As for XBOX360 , well i personally doesn't like XBOX console at all due to its games being very " limited " in variety . As it belongs to microsoft and the games it made are usually very westernised . Its game mostly consisted of sports , war and some rpgs . Other then that then its good luck for you . I have seen a father looking at XBOX360 games then complained abt the variety of games that XBOX360 haved saying if he knew XBOX has so limited games he wouldn't buy XBOX360 at all . I don't really know abt XBOX360 prices as i am not at all interested in its game at all .</p>
              <p>   So i hope that i have answered some of your questions and last but not least it do helps if you would do some researching on the game console specs and the type of games it offered in the market . Rather then regretting your choice of game console after buying it .</p>
