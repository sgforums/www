              <p>I'm going to keep this short and simple. I paid 50 dollars for this game, and even if it's going to be just a mindless action romp, I expect at least the sound effects to work. They don't. Now I've sent e-mails on support for this, and was apparently ignored, so I did some research of my own.<br><br>I took the game back to where I bought it, and asked the manager to test it on the stores Xbox display unit, which has amazing sound and a great display to it. Enemy gunfire is missing, explosions either make no noise at all, or just barely if you jam your ear to the speaker, and in general, it's missing half the sound effects for no apparent reason whatsoever.<br><br>The kicker however? When the manager who was slightly at a loss for words opened up a brand new copy of the game, it did the same exact thing. So no, it isn't just my copy, and it isn't my console or TV, because I tested it on SIX different TV's, and 4 different Xbox360 consoles, all gave the same exact results.<br><br>Could you play a game lacking these essential sound effects, such as explosions that take place two inches from your face, or point-blank enemy fire? More so, what could POSSIBLY be causing this problem, when it doesn't seem to effect everyone with the game?<br><br>I will not take any cheap excuses, and I don't want to hear it's just me, because I'll get you signed statements from various people who all are experiencing the same exact thing, and since it's not a 20 dollar budget title, and costs 50 dollars...and it's being advertised and somewhat hyped, I expect instead to see the developers fix this, and soon.<br><br>I came in support of a game people are bashing and hating on for no reasons, and I'm starting to feel like maybe I should bash it, because complete or not, for this to occur, the game simply wasn't tested enough.<br><br>As such, myself and other Xbox360 users with this issue, are asking nicely, that you fix it with an update. That's me, and around 37 other people I know on XBL, who all have the same issue, and whom need a fix ASAP.<br><br>Link to proof- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20clx63HNLE<br><br>It's not safe for work btw, and does have some rather foul langague in it, but when you spend 4 hours trying to get a game to work, and get no help or can't find anything to fix it, you tell me if you'd be happy. I mean I work all day, and want to relax and play games in my spare time, not troubleshoot console games that shouldn't need any fixing in the first place.</p>
