So I settled for a Satellite P745. On the brochure it said "Nvidia Geforce GT 525M" for my Satellite P745, which would allow me to play some of the latest games, unlike my brother's Intel HD graphic card which lagged (graphically) on most 3D games. I was kinda satisfied. I got home, and did a system requirements check for Brink, and it failed. Turns out that I got an "Intel(R) HD Graphics Family" graphic card, totally sucks. Didn't pass the recommended or minimum settings at all. I'm thinking of changing the graphic card, but I know don't know anything about it, I've never done this before. Perhaps someone on this forum could help me? I'd like to know the average price, steps on changing the card, where I can buy one, etc. My friend said that I can't change it if it was "integrated", not sure what that means, but it says in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool(DxDiag) that it's "internal'? Can I still change it?</p></div>

              <p>If by any chance you're reading this,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your laptop has NVidia Optimus technology, meaning that when you're not gaming, it uses the onboard Intel HD graphics. When you DO play a demanding 3D game, it switches on your 525M. This way, you get maximum battery life when you need it, and performance when you need it as well. You don't need to change it. You might be able to, depending on the laptop, but you don't need to.</p>
