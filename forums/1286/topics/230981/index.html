It will expand on the game play of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and will be the sixth installment in the popular Ghost Recon tactical shooter video game series, published by Ubisoft.<br><br>GRAW 2 will have dynamic weather conditions, from sandstorms to howling rain, with subtle details such as the mission area glistening with moisture and featuring standing pools of water after a rainstorm. Also, there will be blowing wind. GRAW 2 will feature object translucency which will allow players to see through surfaces like leaves and fabrics under the right conditions. "God Rays" will also be part of the game. This is a graphical technique that simulates the way light goes around an opaque surface. God Rays allow the player to see the limits of light, creating the hard edges rays of light often seen pouring through cathedral windows, for example. New smoke effects will be added, specifically one called the depth sprite. The technique makes smoke particles move over and around objects like an actual gas, eliminating the hard lines you see between clouds and surfaces that crop up in most games. The smoke reacts to light and wind. All this and improved particle effects will make up the bulk of the graphical improvements. It has been reportedly stated by Electronic Gaming Monthly that GRAW 2 will rectify the A.I. problems that the previous game had (namely the squad A.I. and VIP targets purposely endangering themselves). Also, the player will now be able to control Mexican forces in addition to the Ghosts.<br><br>Also, the squad selection option at rally points is being drastically changed. Choosing your squad is more of a strategic option now. In GRAW, players were inclined just to take the default squad that first showed up on the screen because it didn't make much difference; that is all changing now. In GRAW 2, it is important you take the people that can be of most help to you on the particular mission. Choosing the wrong squad could result in a mission failure. For example, the player is only provided with a finite number of health packs, so adding a medic (infinite health packs) to one's squad may be useful. However, bringing along a medic would prevent one from having another support troop (i.e. a marksman or machine gunner). Thus, the player must actively adapt his/her squad to the current game situation.<br><br>The game story will take place just south of the US border, and it will deal with the growing turmoil in that region. The game takes place over a span of just 72 hours, and will feature a wide array of location types including forests, mountains, jungles, and towns. The combat will take place in both Mexico and the United States, although the game will begin the urban part of Mexico City. The game's climax will also feature a full fledged invasion of US soil for control over El Paso, Texas, which the player must repel.<br><br>The game is also likely to feature several new weapon systems. Screenshots thus far have shown the P90 and the Beretta Cx4 Storm.<br><br>GRAW 2 sees the Ghosts move away from the Multicam uniform of the previous game, adopting the US Army's current ACU. This seems to be a move away from the Future Force Warrior program the previous game was based so heavily on.</div>
