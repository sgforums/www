            <div class='col-md body'>Simon Belmont<br><br>Simon is the character featured in the most Castlevania games. His adventures began when the residents of Transylvania sought the current Belmont to fight Dracula. Later he had to rid himself of a curse put upon him by Dracula, and then had to fight Drac yet again, because he wasn't quite dead. Probably the most prominent and recognized of the Belmonts.<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/charsimonlg.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trevor Belmont<br><br>When the town of Warakiya fell under attack from the evil Count Dracula, the people found a surviving Belmont, who was Trevor (the Belmonts had previously been exiled from the country, because of the populace's fear of the Belmont's extreme powers.) Although he is not widely as known as his grandson Simon, he is still well recognized. He wears a similar outfit to Simon, although wears a cape when not fighting vampires. For whatever reason, Trevor is named Ralph in Japan.<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/chartrevorlg.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christopher Belmont<br><br>Christopher Belmont made his appearances in the two Castlevania games for the Gameboy. There's not really a whole lot to say about this Belmont, except for the fact that he's yet another one of the family that killed Dracula when he arose again. He also saved his son Solieyu from Dracula when he was kidnapped in Belmont's Revenge. Christopher is most likely the great-grandfather of Simon.<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/charchrislg.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sonia Belmont<br><br>Sonia Belmont is actually the first member of the line of Belmonts to fight Dracula. Taking him on in Castlevania Legends for the Gameboy, she wields an upgradeable flame whip just like Christopher. Sonia has blond hair which is usually tied back into a pony tail, and wears a light armor. It is uncertain whether Sonia is the mother or sister of Trevor Belmont. Although she does not wield any of the traditional Castlevania weapons, she has a variety of soul powers, as well as a "Burning Mode", which makes her invincible to damage<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/charsonialg.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Richter Belmont<br><br>Richter is most likely the grandson of Solieyu Belmont, captured in Belmont's Revenge. Hero of both Dracula X's (and also an enemy in Symphony of the Night), Richter had to fight his way through yet another wave of Dracula's baddies to save his girlfriend Annette, and her sister, Maria. In Symphony of the Night, Richter mysteriously dissappears, and nobody is quite sure why. He may have been kidnapped by minions of Dracula, to work for him. Richter has a very cool backflip ability which gets him out of sticky situations.<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/char-ric.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maria Renard<br><br>The sister of Annette Renard, who is Richter's girlfriend. After Richter married Annette, she became a sister-in-law of the Belmont clan. Kidnapped by Dracula at 12 years old in an attempt to lure Richter into his hands, she can be freed and used as another character to play as. Her main attack is to throw doves, which return after flying a short distance. She also attacks with birds, turtles, a dragon, and even her shrill singing voice. Maria also has a double-jump power, can slide, and has a powerful move that projects her alter-ego. Unfortunately, she cannot take as many hits as Richter.<br>In Symphony of the Night, Maria is now a teenager, and sets out to find the missing Richter Belmont. No longer the cute little girl she was before, Maria is a brave young woman. When she begins her search, Castlevania mysteriously appears, as if to lead her on the search. When first meeting Alucard, she seems unsure whether to trust him, but soon learns that he is a noble being. She posses magical skills, able to charge up and shoot out magical bolts, as well as summoning more grown-up versions of her animal compatriots. She can also triple jump.<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/char-mar.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Julius Belmont<br><br>Found wandering throughout the castle, Julius Belmont (who calls himself J) was one of the vampire hunters who sealed away Dracula's castle in 1999. Unfortunately, this incident has left him bereft of his memory. Only by exploring the castle can he hope to restore his mind and discover his true purpose. He can be unlocked as a playable character after beating the game, and has access to the usual selection of Castlevania special weapons. He also has a special "warp" manuever that lets him quickly dash behind opponents to surprise them<br><br><img src="http://www.classicgaming.com/castlevania/char/jchar.gif"></div>
