              <p>Hi everyone</p>
              <p>Some years ago I developed a World War Two (board) wargame. It shares some similarities with popular games like 'Risk' and 'Axis and Allies' but luck is much less important and my game has a lot more territories than those other games.</p>
              <p>The period is 1938 to 1945 and eight powers are available for play: Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, USA and China. You do not have to play historically!</p>
              <p>Basically the game revolves around alliances, building (and rebuilding) your land, air and naval forces) and lots of combat when players try to take new territories.</p>
              <p>It's quite a bit of fun if you're into this kind of thing. The game is not difficult to learn, but playing it well is another story... anyway, if anyone's interested or has questions, do post here and let's take it from there.</p>
              <p>If we can get enough players (eight is ideal), I will email you guys the rules, maps and spreadsheet.</p>
              <p>Best</p>

              <p>I think I forgot to mention how this works (briefly) is if we can get 8 players (each controlling one major power) and I'm the referee/gamemaster who coordinates everything and works out the battle results etc.</p>
              <p>So anyway, don't be shy. Drop in if you're game. Or you can PM me if you're really shy lol.</p>

              <p>Hi Yl, I'm a big fan of Paradox games (esp their EU and HOI series)... my game 'World at War' (WAW) was developed back in the mid-1990s with a friend.</p>
              <p>It shares certain broad similarities with Semper Fi - same period (WW2), big global map (lots of places to conquer), each country plays differently and luck is not a major factor in winning/losing.</p>
              <p>However Semper Fi is of course a lot more complicated, many many more options and details. Mine is a lot more abstract to make it playable - the rules are pretty straightforward and but I believe the strategic concept is quite viable.</p>
              <p>Hope this answers your question. Would you be interested in a game? So far I have one other positive reply ... an ideal number is eight separate players so we can get the full experience. A lot of the fun is in making deals and backstabbing ;)</p>

              <p>I'm summarize what happens in a game turn: <br><br>Game starts in Fall (autumn) 1938 and lasts to Summer 1945, unless someone wins before then. Each turn lasts 3 months of game-time -- Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. Each turn has four phases. The year is important as combat ratings of the major powers change annually. <br><br>Phase 1 is the resource allocation/diplomacy phase - players use this phase to buy new units (4 types - infantry, armor, air and naval units) and place them on their supply centers (main bases). They will also make alliances with other players if they wish. Alliances are not permanent - they can be broken, meaning you can backstab :P <br><br>Phase 2 is the air phase<br>Phase 3 is the naval phase<br>Phase 4 is the land and redeployment phase<br><br>For phases 2 to 4, I have abstracted the actual moving and combat for the game into ‘stances’ – the game moves much faster this way. Also less stress for me to ‘referee’ :D<br><br>Players assign an overall stance each turn. There are three stances. <br><br>Defensive - no attacks, units adopt defensive posture<br>Limited offensive - opportunistic attacks while trying to minimize losses<br>Victory or Valhalla (VOV) – aggressive 'do or die' attacks, losses tend to be much higher!<br><br>You may specify the major and/or minor power(s) you'd like to target, if applicable. How your units are placed/positioned is very important. <br><br><strong>Example of a Fall 1938 turn (German player)</strong><br>Air – VOV vs Lille ground forces, limited offensive vs Belgium <br>Naval - defensive (Berlin)<br>Land – limited offensive vs Lille, Belgium and Hungary<br><br>As referee, I will then game out the air, naval and land phases and try to carry out your instructions as far as possible... I will then inform players of the results and changes (territories taken/lost, forces destroyed etc). Finally, players will get a chance to redeploy their land and air forces at the end of the turn. <br><br>Next turn then begins... <br><br>Players (teams) win by capturing all territories (unlikely since there are over 150), or they reach certain victory point (targets) or force other teams/players to surrender. Or the game reaches Fall 1945 then we total VPs... I will say that from my experience playing and testing this game, a lot of the fun is in the actual play, suspense and making/breaking alliances with other players. Sure it’s great to win, but I like to think the journey is equally if not more important :)<br><br>The<strong> time commitment</strong> for players shouldn't be too much of a problem since I've abstracted a lot of things to make it play quite quickly, especially with the 'stances'. <br><br>Players focus on building stuff, alliances, assigning 'stances' and reployment, which probably can be done within 30 to 45 minutes for one turn, once you get the hang of the rules... most of the combat calculations and overall coordination fall on me (the referee) lol.</p>
              <p>The game starts in Fall 1938, just after Germany annexed the Sudetenland (Czechoslovakia) and is preparing for more conquests. <br><br>Britain and France 'allowed' Germany to annex the Sudetenland but will not tolerate any further German aggression. <br>Italy is neutral but friendly toward Germany<br>Russia is neutral and suspicious of everybody<br>USA is neutral and isolationist (minding her own business)<br>Japan is friendly with Germany and Italy and at war with China<br><br>This is the historical backdrop... so obviously Germany is very powerful, with large land and air forces, Britain has the world's largest empire but is very weak on land forces, and China has a large army but poor quality troops etc. So you have to tailor your strategies according to which country you end up with! :)</p>
              <p>Hope that answers your questions. If there's any/more interest, I'm happy to email rules, maps and spreadsheet for your perusal.</p>

              <p>i think the historical backdrop is all wrong............even when Germany was all-conquering , HE wasn't that strong at all............</p>
              <p>the German Army relied on horses and soldiers were on foot.........people thought they were highly mechanized.........also the Germans had less tanks and they were smaller than even the French !</p>
              <p>the Germans were always outnumbered in tanks, planes and everything all the way from the start !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the Germans were able to win so easily in the beginning becoz they really were the BEST !</p>
