            <div class='col-md body'>i think yes.<br>note. cruelty to animals need not be kicking it,slapping it, poking with sharp object etc, it could be as simple as forcing a very shy animal who normally avoids human population whenever it can, to play with humans, albeit forcibly. abuse can also come in the form of mental, like keeping an animal found in the wild in a cage or a pool. it's just like keeping a dog in a tiny room which normally is found on big farms. just like u ask an athelete to remain in front of a com for the whole day ( i know most of us can do it ) when he/she is used to running abt on the tracks etc.<br><br>these animals are not humans, they dun cry ( only some animals do) or write to aunt agony or call good samaritan hotline when they are stressed. they dont tell u "eh i am stressed, release me" . animals reveal their stress in manners often seen a signs of aggression. yet how many of us do know their justification for such aggression?<br><br>food ? they have ample food.<br><br>partners ? they are probably so stressed they cant even mate.<br><br>sick? they have vets.<br><br>freedom ? can anyone answer me ?<br>can anyone find another reason why ?<br>even fellow humans are not spared from our abuse. try looking in yr own home. yr older relatives like yr grandparents,great-grandparents, maids and not to mention yr own parents.<br><br>the principle for animals can also be applied here, talking to yr granny once in 3 mths is not communication, buying lunch for her and talking her to the doc when she is sick is not care and cocern.abuse and cruelty to them need not be physical,like beating them etc. it could be as simple as ignoring them etc. for maids there are ppl who cause deaths and force them to turn bad because of physical and mental abuse.<br><br>i wont elaborate much on the human side .<br><br>so for conclusion, ask 1 question before u think whether shld we train this animal or not. WHO ARE YOU? who do u think u are to take control and possess an animal's life and manipulate to yr whim and fancy? do u mind if i control everything u do from where u do yr business,waht u eat, when u sleep,how long u sleep,etc ? note,animals are living things,not commodities. if u want respect, respect others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm I would agree to a certain extent that it is cruelty........<br><br>But having them in a zoo need not be a bad thing and to make them entertain is really a thin line of survival for the zoo and the animal.  Many near extinct animals are brought into zoos to give them protection against poachers and the habitat is made to almost similar of their natural ones.  To protect these animals, to keep them in zoos is good and ultimately the zoo must survive, it is not a profit generating company, thus entertainement becomes a source...<br><br>You can say its a vicious cycle but I guess no one's right no one's wrong, at least I can say that in the Singapore zoo, the habitat is quite similar to their natural ones....<br><br>So well, as long they are protected from poachers, I am well happy.</div>
