              <p>Me. I pia the quests with my friends since last midnight and ended just a few hours ago. Now at Level 25 on Venus server. The gold thing is either a bug, or something like a jackpot. Anyway, if you ever get a Chaos Lamp, unless you think Lady Luck is beside you, don't rub it. Sell it to a NPC and you'll get 250k for it. I only knew this from a friend after using two of these lamps getting 50 stupid Lv 3 red pots on both occasions. <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_mad.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>

              <p>Hmm. I read some guides online and the gold thing is not a bug but something like a jackpot as mentioned earlier, similar to MU Online. I don't think it has anything to do with the dice function, which seems useless at the moment.</p>
              <p>The experience system is designed in a way to encourage you to train at monsters close to your character level. If a much higher experience rate is given for high level monsters relative to the character's level, some players may exploit this by buffing up their ATT rate (aka accuracy) and attempt to get 1-damage hits on those monsters to earn much more experience points.</p>

              <p>Hmm. I read some guides online and the gold thing is not a bug
              but something like a jackpot as mentioned earlier, similar to MU
              Online. I don't think it has anything to do with the dice function,
              which seems useless at the moment.</p>
              <p>The experience system is designed in a way to encourage you to
              train at monsters close to your character level. If a much higher
              experience rate is given for high level monsters relative to the
              character's level, some players may exploit this by buffing up
              their ATT rate (aka accuracy) and attempt to get 1-damage hits on
              those monsters to earn much more experience points.</p>

              <p>It's closer to existing 3D games like MU Online and GE rather than Maple. In fact, the equipment system and inventory system can be said to be copied from MU Online. What's interesting and unique in this game are its battle system (real-time comboing - where you need to time your button presses, which makes it seem a little Audition-like, to give you bonus exp, and other features like auras, battle styles and skills) and endless (and I really mean endless) number of quests, some with in-depth stories which are far from those "Please get me the mirror from Sera who lives next door." kind of crap.</p>
              <p>And no, you don't grind monsters to level your character up. You grind quests. And beside all these, you can have a female character dressed up scantily and do a dance in the middle of a town for you and other players to ogle at while gaining Spirit Points (SP) required for combos and auras.</p>
              <p>If you were to compare some of its features against Maple's, then I would tell you, the Chaos Lamp in the game is like a Gachapon ticket except that it is found randomly among all monsters and it's free. And shouting in the entire channel is free too, with a 10 second per shout limit (I think they may remove this if people started to spam though). Party members have 30 - 50% EXP bonus as long as you are within close proximity with another member (no, you don't need a priest for that).</p>

              <p>You should be using your skills for most of the time at that level already. And I hope you did pump your character and skill points as you leveled your character up, right?</p>

              <p>my thoughts on cabal</p>
              <p>its quite crowded, alot of people</p>
              <p>some quests r designed badly or have no meaning. 1 of the quest require u to get 5 items from a mob which only spawn 1 at a time o.O always got like 5-6 ppl camping there</p>
              <p>the "dungeons" r not reli dungeons but i havent seen the so call bigger ones yet</p>
              <p>most of the skills r like have the same effect but different graphics o.O i use archer but maybe only mine is like that</p>
              <p>item upgrade system quite good</p>
              <p>class like veri funi, 1 range 1 magic n 4 melee? o.O</p>
