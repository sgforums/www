            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/CallofDuty4Logo.jpg"><br><br>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, announced on April 25, 2007 for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, will be the fourth installment in the Call of Duty video game series and the first not to be set during World War II.<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Tanks will once again be in full use, so the player will be able to drive around the Middle Eastern villages. Helicopters are brand new, and the player will get to fly one at some point and take out enemy helicopters. Night vision goggles will be used when levels take place at night. The player will be able to play as both the Americans and the British army. The game's AI will be massively improved from the previous iterations of the series, and the enemies will now camouflage themselves in the urban battles. The health system from Call of Duty 2 will return, though it is possible that the player will not be able to take as many bullets as previous games before having to find cover. Instead of the original melee style where the player simply whips an enemy with the butt of a gun, the player will take out a knife and violently stab the enemy. Weapons can have numerous attachments, such as the M203 grenade launcher, a laser sight, a scope and others<br><br><strong>Realism mode and multiplayer</strong><br>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has been announced to have a new mode called Hardcore Mode. In Hardcore Mode, a single shot in the chest, heart, etc. can kill, while getting shot in the leg will cause the player's character to fall down.<br><br>For multiplayer, it has been confirmed that Call of Duty 4 will include a class system similar to the one used in Call of Duty 3. In addition to the basic classes like Heavy Gunner and Assault, the game will include Spec Op, Demolition, and a user-customizable class creator. But to create a unique class, the player has to first unlock the ability through a certain number of hours of gameplay. Only two of the classes are available to a first time player; the rest are unlocked as he/she gains more experience online and gains higher rank. It has been confirmed that players will be able to buy maps for multiplayer that contain special vehicles, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the Little Bird helicopter. As told by Official Xbox Magazine, the player gets to enjoy a brief but a thrilling ride in an AC-130 gunship.<br><br>One perk included in the multiplayer is called Last Stand. When the player takes too much damage, the character will fall down but automatically draw his pistol. The player can either kill himself with the suicide button (denying a full kill to the enemy player) or attempt to deliver a few shots to finish the enemy.<br><br>Another perk in multiplayer mode is called Deep Impact, which allows the player to shoot through certain objects in the game that would normally be used as cover (such as walls, floors, and ceilings). It will depend on the type of weapon the player is using, the distance he is shooting, and the thickness of the object he is shooting through.<br><br>A third perk called Double Tap gives the player's weapon an increased rate of fire.<br><br>A fourth perk called Sleight of Hands speeds up reload time significantly.<br><br><strong>Plot</strong><br>A Russian Nationalist by the name of Zakhaev is set on returning his homeland to the Soviet times. Zakhaev knows the United States would never allow this to happen, thus he funds a coup in the Middle East, organized by his ally Al-Assad, to draw attention away from Russia. The two men and their seconds-in-command gain the nickname The Four Horsemen. However, British and Russian governments have been monitoring Zakhaev's activities and discover his real intentions. The story is told from a perspective of a British SAS operative, a Russian Spetsnaz commando, and American Force Recon Marines (whos name is Paul Jackson, his name is the only name known.) and Navy SEALs in the Middle East. Also, the game's E3 2007 trailer shows a nuclear weapon launching, so the game may include a nuclear or biological environment<br><br>Official Site:<br><a href="http://www.charlieoscardelta.com" rel="nofollow">www.charlieoscardelta.com</a></div>
