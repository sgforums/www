              <p>Lately I've been organising at least one game at least of TFC each weekend either Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night. Games are organised via steam invite to game. Last weekend was very successful, we had over 16 people on both Friday and Saturday nights and even though we didn't start till about 11pm on Sunday we still managed to get over 20 people. About 3 weekends ago we had over 20 people and played from 6PM till 3AM AEDST.</p>
              <p><br>So we are kicking off the weekend this Friday night with a TFC bash starting from 6PM AEDST onwards at ChronServ TFC #1 - 61.8.106.60:27015</p>
              <p><br>I'm expecting a big turnout, full server of 32 people. I expect the server to be initially populated with New Zealanders and Aussies. As it approaches midnight and the softer Aussies go to bed, I'd expect them to be replaced by people from Singapore and Japan.</p>
              <p><br>Most maps will a timelimit of 30 minutes. Expect to play all game modes including ctf, i&amp;d, a&amp;d, hunted, push, murderball, etc. As the night wears on and the player numbers begin to dwindle we'll play some other game modes like sniper maps, hide and seek, fun maps, etc and when were down to about 8 players we might even play an escape map to finish off the night(have you played the new escape map thegame2008?). Of course these other game modes will have altered timelimits. Ignore the votemap which will occur when theres 2 minutes left, as I'll be manually setting the nextmap. Useful say commands while on the server include thetime, timeleft, nextmap.</p>
              <p><br>As the server has over 350 maps installed I'd like some suggestions on what maps you would like to play(both standard and custom). In case you have forgotten, the standard valve maps are:<br>2fort<br>avanti<br>badlands<br>casbah<br>crossover2<br>cz2<br>dustbowl<br>epicenter<br>flagrun<br>hunted<br>push<br>ravelin<br>rock2<br>warpath<br>well</p>
              <p><br>We also have FAST HTTP downloads working. If your on a broadband connection, the majority of maps will be downloaded within 30-60s.</p>
              <p><br>For those who have no idea what Team Fortress Classic is about watch these 3 videos for your gaming education:<br>TFC Forever<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddHNmMbA_C8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddHNmMbA_C8</a><br>^^ What maps are shown in this video?<br>^^ Who ever made this demo never played on GA2. Pyros? Worthless? If I was getting torched it would be ozwolf or spyburner lol.<br>Guilt - A Team Fortress Classic Machinima<br><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8314840368152116313">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8314840368152116313</a><br>^^ What maps are shown in this video?<br>Axl's TFC maps<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he83rC0eUcA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he83rC0eUcA</a><br>^^ I'm sure we might play an Axl map or two.</p>
              <p><br>For those TFC old skoolers please use your old gaming aliases as it would be good to recognise some old names. BTW Valve disabled changing the player name via Options. Instead you need to drop down the console by pressing the tilde key "~" and then type in:<br>name "gaming name"</p>
              <p><br>Don't forget your binds also. There were some great binds back in the day. The ones I can remember on the spot are:<br>Thnx for the recording %i &lt;-- Hax<br>scorchin` &lt;-- rpg junkie</p>
              <p><br>Finally if you play TFC regularly or are interested in playing it regulary then please join this steam group:<br><a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OTFC0">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OTFC0</a><br>and you will receive announcements and event notifications of when games of TFC are organised or played. We are looking for people who are good for a game, not people who play once in a blue moon. Atm it is a public group but sometime next week I'll convert it into a private group to stop randoms from joining it. If you wish to join the group after it becomes private just message someone within the group for an invite.</p>
              <p><br>So join Ben, Bennae, and Beaner this Friday and get your boof on!</p>

              <p>Well the TFC public play event was a success. On Friday night I played from 6PM till 3.30AM and we consistently had about 20 players in the server. There were 92 unique players over the course of the night:<br>52 were from Australia.<br>10 were from United States.<br>9 were from Sinapore.<br>3 were from Canada.<br>2 were from Japan.<br>2 were from New Zealand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>On the Friday night we played the following maps:<br>asti_r<br>2fort<br>osaka_r<br>thecove<br>exchange_l<br>murderball_forever<br>warpath_l<br>troy2<br>letgodowl<br>hunted<br>well_now<br>navarone<br>escape_b<br>hwguyz2<br>avanti<br>dustbowl<br>junob7d<br>baconbowl_r<br>spacebowl<br>ksour<br>sc5x_bonus_beta2<br>dustbowl<br>civsawc<br>axldrop7<br>rasen<br>asti_r<br>xpress2k4<br>tc_soldierball<br>nyroball<br>tc_soldierball</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>On Sunday night we got off to a bit of a late start as we didn't really kick off till about 9pm but managed to get around 25 players in the server at the same time. There were 64 unique players over the course of the night:<br>39 were from Australia.<br>13 were from Sinapore.<br>4 were from United States.<br>3 were from Japan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>On the Sunday night we played the following maps:<br>xpress2k4<br>2FortSniperMK<br>escape_b<br>ksour<br>dustbowl<br>osaka_r<br>murderball_forever<br>schtop<br>2chemicalv2<br>TooNsForts<br>xpress2k4<br>high_flag<br>tc_soldierball<br>nyroball<br>2FortSniperMK<br>xpress2k4<br>axltrain_b2<br>airport<br>tc_soldierball<br>mulch_dm<br>sq1</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>rdy ran a Monday night game starting from 8PM. There were 44 unique players. On average there was about 16 players playing:<br>30 were from Australia.<br>6 were from Sinapore.<br>2 were from United States.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>They played the following maps on Monday:<br>dustbowl<br>dust_attack_beta3<br>avanti<br>osaka<br>dustbowl<br>dustplate_a<br>2fort<br>area49_2<br>engineer_battle</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>There were some great moments and fun maps played:<br>* letgodowl was the classic dustbowl map in lego textures with some minor changes which makes it seem easier for the invaders.<br>* murderball_forever was a great update of a classic map with ramps that boost you and sound effects to boot. The objective is simple, kill the person carrying the ball and then grab it yourself to score points for both yourself and your team. 4 teams, 1 ball and a lot of fun.<br>* navarone has a really great start, you jump out of a plane to land in the water below and then storm the beach on the way to the 1st cap point. After the 2nd cap point has been capped the defenders have a button they can push to close the doors momentarily to give the defenders some time to regroup in preparation of the next assault wave.<br>* escape_b is a fun I&amp;D map set in an Indiana Jones theme. tN|Indiana_Jones christened part of the map "canyon of the crescent moon":<br><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/35n6iwg.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"><br>* hwguyz2 is an Axl CTF map. The only allowed classes are HWGUY and medic and its the first team to score 10 caps. If you die you have to spectate until the round is over.<br>* junob7d has the same starting and cap pt1 as navarone as they were both done by the same mapper and this is where the similarities end. Its a 4 cap pt A&amp;D map with a great alternative route for a demo assisted jump point for the final cap point.<br>* baconbowl_r(I&amp;D map) both teams finished on a tie with [CA]asdf managing to cap the 3rd and final cap point right on the bell:<br><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2hgdaaw.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></p>
              <p>* sc5x_bonus_beta2 was a hide and seek map with cpz showing off his seeking prowess.<br>* civsawc pitted two HWGUYs against everyone else as a cilivian. Its a small map and the objective for the cilivians is to cap the flag, when they do this the civilians are given quad for a limited time to seek their revenge on the HWGUYs.<br>* axldrop7 is another murderball map with only 2 teams and is another Axl map. Half the fun in this map is surviving the initial drop, shooting the enemy team while falling and then landing safely on the platform below. Most people don't seem to know that you can air strafe to help you land safely. There is a quad powerup in the centre of the map and a resup room as well.<br>* rasen is another great I&amp;D map with a detpackable moat at the 3rd and final cap point. y0ink* had a spray that looks like a ladder and as I hadn't played this map in ages I fell for it as I tried to climb a hut(on top of the hut would have been a perfect place for an SG) that was located near the chokepoint next to the gates. It turns out I wasn't the only one tricked by y0ink*'s spray:<br><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2llj0px.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></p>
              <p>* tc_soldierball is another murderball map, perfect for small amounts of people. The only allowable class is soldier and there's 4 teams all competing for that one ball.<br>* nyroball is muderball map, great when tc_soldierball is too small but murderball_forever is too big. Its smaller size and no class restrictions allow for some great gameplay.<br>* high_flag is a fun CTF map to play. In order to reach the flag you you need to either conc, rocket, pipe, or gren jump your way to the flag. IF you have time you could try climbing the ladder but that is made next to impossible when you have enemy defenders shooting at you.<br>* area49_2 is a co-op escape map. It took us just over 2 hours to complete. There was about 10 of us playing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>While we didn't hit a full server this time we came close. We will be doing it again this weekend so if you missed out last time come join us this weekend starting from 6PM on Friday. This weekend I'm expecting a full server.</p>
