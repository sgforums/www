This is forum where one can choose NOT to agree. He is expecting everyone to give him a pat on his shaft and go Â“OoooohÂ…aaahhhhÂ….so many beautiful pictures of XboxesÂ”. Well I choose to NOT to agree and I was merely telling him what I think..<br><br>He told us in the Beslan threadÂ…..Â”Go sell flowers instead and donate the proceedingsÂ” (well not his exact wordsÂ…it was not so polite actually). Well I want to tell himÂ…..Â”Go BUY your limited edition XboxesÂ….no need to show us some stupid ONLINE JPEG XBOXESÂ” They are just wellÂ….Â”CLEVERLY (cut and paste) online jpeg xboxes to meÂ”<br><br>4)Â’HitlerÂ’ decided extermination was the only way to get rid of all scums that dare stands in his way, so he completely editied my second post and changed it to this:-<br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v347/peter_parker/the_spider2.jpg"><br><br><strong>Can you imagine a FORUM in which the thread starter can decide what and what not to be in his thread?

You edited some of the things Hitler said about me but I have to bring it up to let you see the true state of things. I have to restore the exact contents of that thread or my arguments in this thread I wrote to you and Gordonator will lose its meaning. This is the actual thread when I put in the complain.</span><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v347/peter_parker/the_spider3.jpg"><br></div>
