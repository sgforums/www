You will see situations that you encounter in everyday life, but you will handle them in over the top, extraordinarily violent ways.  Sure, you always have the option to be a pacifist open to you, but if you were intent on being a tree-hugger, chances are you would have bought a Michael Moore film, not Postal 2.<br><br>The game is the ultimate in satire, with little ditties such as a convenience store that doubles as an Al-Qaeda training camp, a confessional where the priest asks you if you made a donation before he absolves your sins, and cheap digs at credit card and insurance companies: "your parents are going to DIE!

First and foremost, the game's loading times keep it from being one you will want to play as sporadically as something like GTA 3, which is a shame, given that Postal 2 comes very close to realizing an FPS version of everyone's favorite crime sim.  You will learn to be mindful of switching between "load zones," which are marked with road signs, simply because you won't want to sit through them.  They're more of an annoyance than anything, but I hope future sequels reduce their numbers.  And while the sound work in the game is nothing short of hilarious, the graphics are a mixed bag.  A generally dated look offsets great flame effects and detailed characters.  Although it is running on Unreal 2 technology, the visuals often seem like a spruced up version of Half-Life.  Some gamers may also take issue with the fact that Postal seems to be less linear than your average FPS, though I think it can be as short or long as you want it to be, assuming you can put up with the load times.<br><br>In the end though, gameplay and atmosphere is where it counts, and Postal 2 has plenty of both.  It also has lots of pedestrians to kill, and you can kick their heads around like a soccer ball, or use your shovel and play hockey.  Postal 2 gets a hearty, blood soaked recommendation.<br></div>
