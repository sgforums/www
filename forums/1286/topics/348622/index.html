            <div class='col-md body'><p>     Bought the Onechanbara today , well just had my first try for half an hr . I find it quite fun although i couldn't execute some of the moves that they taught on screen . But graphics are good and clear , a good thing cos many of wii games are using low quality or cartoonish graphics . Will wait my bro to come to my house to try 2 player mode . Good and refreshing fun for me as currently most of my games are more to kiddy stuff . Only thing is having to swing my nunchuck n wiimote around during double sword mode is a bit hazardouse due to the wire flaying about . Most of the time i use only 1 sword mode . One thing i find troublesome is having to swing the blood off your sword quite troublesome cos sometimes you get so excited that you forgot to swing the blood off and it will reduce your killing power . And also having to touch a goddess to remove your sort of berserk mode also very troublesome . Cos i can't find the goddess .And i died from my berserk mode draining my health . Overall to me is good .:)</p></div>

Found that survival mode is really good for lvling up . Almost completed the game only to find that i'm playing the easy mode instead of normal mode .</p></div>

              <p><br>Sounds like an interesting game? Is it new in the market? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never play the agme before, but perhaps you can try it during PAUSE or something? Bytw, you don't have a manual for the game? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>     Yah its quite new , kana chopped abit by the shop cos i paid $52 for it but comic connection is selling for just $45 . The only way to pause the game is when you want to use items , other then that all the other buttons are used for moves or camera views . The manual doesn't say much also cos it read that when you enter the game from the title screen , it will prompt you to enter the difficulty setting that you want but i can't see it . I just unlocked a new character and also lvl up my main char quite far already so i really won't consider starting a new game unless its confirm that my current save data is corrupted .</p></div>
