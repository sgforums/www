              <p><br>GO Kart or "GK", is a fun and free-to-play massive multiplayer online racing game published by Garena. Race across the colourful maps while throwing items at your opponents to slow them down. Here is the good news about GO Kart, it has a plethora of useful props that can be used to leave your opponent behind the dust or give yourself a speed boost. GO Kart has a large selection of items available in its Shop, so the game certainly has a lot of playability. The game controls are clear and concise, all you need are 4 control keys to get started with Go Kart.<br><br>Though the race begins with different maps to choose from, a lot of fancy driving lies between the player and the entire selection of maps. Some parts of some maps require the use of speed boost to jump over to the other side, by doing so, it leads you to the shortcut. All this seems so exciting, just wait till you are in the race. <br><br>[IMG]http://i375.photobucket.com/albums/oo195/leehengleon88/1-1.jpg[/IMG]<br><br><br>[IMG]http://i375.photobucket.com/albums/oo195/leehengleon88/2.jpg[/IMG]<br><br><br>In GO Kart R&amp;R, you get to rest after a marathon of racing, whether it is to wallow on your defeat or celebrate your victory, this is where you can unwind and meet new friends.
