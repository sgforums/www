            <div class='col-md body'>from what i read in the papers, this year WCG will be something like a youth festival.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Adding more fun to cyber games</strong> </span><br><span class="small">World Cyber Games S'pore finals will have costume-play party and anime movies<br><br>By Chua Hian Hou<br>Jul 20, 2006<br>The Straits Times </span><br><br>UNLIKE previous World Cyber Games (WCG), this year's Singapore finals will be much more than just a bunch of Singaporean gamers hunched over their computers or Xboxes.<br><br>The four-day annual event to select the country's best gamers in the second week of next month will feature a dance competition, anime movie marathon, an extreme sports display, and a cosplay or costume-play party.<br><br>All these fringe activities, said WCG Singapore organiser Rapture Gaming's managing director, Mr Herman Ng, are aimed at transforming the game competition into a youth festival for gamers and non-gamers alike.<br><br>To achieve this, Rapture has set aside more than US$400,000 ($638,000) for this year's event, up from US$300,000 last year.<br><br>The megafest will be a 'great way to bring this geeky gaming thing out of the box, to show that gaming is not just teenage boys sitting in front of their computers', said Mr Danny Wong. He is the manager of the Singapore team Rage Faction, which came in second in the CounterStrike competition at the WCG last year.<br><br>The team-based shooting game CounterStrike typically attracts the most participants at gaming meets like this.<br><br>Mr Ng assured gamers that they will have plenty to look out for.<br><br>In fact, he added, a large chunk of the increased budget goes towards rewarding gamers.<br><br>Entry fees for the competition, for example, will be as low as $5 to $15 per game, compared to a flat $12 per game last year.<br><br>Part of the funds will also be used to fly eight top gamers to Italy to represent Singapore at the WCG Grand Finals this October. Last year, the grand finals were held here.<br><br>The opportunity to travel, said Mr Wong, is a great motivating factor for gamers to do well.<br><br>'How many people have the chance to travel to Italy for a world-famous tournament as representatives of their country?'<br><br>Gamers can also look forward to watching Singapore's gaming champions pit their skills against the best in the region, from countries such as China and New Zealand, at the new World Cyber Games Asian Championships segment. For the first time, WCG matches will also be webcast 'live', so those unable to make it to the event will be able to watch from home.</div>
