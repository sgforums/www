              <p>wow.. eh.. buy at wii shop alright la.. but the games are those old school GBA or what games.. and some classic GBC mario etc.. :P now USD price cheap ma.. should spend more! :D USD$10 bucks = 1000 Wii points. Typical decent game around 800 Wii points.</p>
              <p>And it's lifetime, they remembers your Wii! Lets say you lost all data, you can always download again once they registered you spent the points there.. :) so don't worry even if you pay and download half way dc or what.. :D</p>
              <p>I spent 500 points on the INternet channel.. quite alright la.. sometimes nua on sofa read sgf or play facebook. can also play Youtube all these. hehe.. convert the currency, considering lifetime, it's really a small sum to pay for the work of the nintendo staff..</p>
              <p>still got 500 points, been looking at some of the games there.. dun want to anyhow waste it.. in case I can stack up buy one good one!</p>

              <p>Try lurking and reading up around forums such as GBATemp.net, or MaxConsole. They're pretty helpful people, as long as you don't spam or act like a n00b. ^^</p>
              <p>Non-original games can be gotten mostly from those gui-gui-sui-sui stalls that sell pirated software and PS2/PC games and suddenly disappear like the next day. The shops sell Wii games too, but I didn't have a Wii back then, so didn't take much notice. Don't see them around anymore, though. Singapore Police must've busted a few rings or something. &gt;.&gt;</p>
              <p>I got my Wii set from SC Games at Jalan Besar Road. Was a tad more expensive than I expected, but they seem to know their stuff quite well. Quite a reliable place. Also, all those WiiSports add ons and extra Wii-motes/Nunchucks were cheaper than other places.</p>

              <p>With modification, (Ie. Soldering a chip into the Wii Motherboard), you can play nearly all games from all regions, and pirated/burnt games as well</p>
              <p>Some shops sell readily modified sets, but if you like a challenge, can buy the chip and go home to solder yourself. No guarantees, though. ^^;</p>

              too, but I didn't have a Wii back then, so didn't take much notice.

              <p>eh.. me not the one looking for mods or what.. just asking about it.. as I only read about mod on jap sets..</p>
              <p>anyway I won't be modding the set. I mean, I don't have time to buy and play that many games. and I don't play jap games, so I don't see the need for modding, to me.</p>
              <p>the Main reason why I support nintendo is for Zelda. been playing zelda since the gameboy days.. and I think Nintendo has done a great job bringing interactive unique gaming experience to us.  Before wii, people would wish they could do more with their controllers.</p>
              <p>I'm not rich, but I feel that sometimes, if you can afford it, we should support the creators. Even for music, I still buy cds of my fav artisties. if you're like still schooling, maybe some points I made can be overlooked. :P</p>

              <p>Wonder if the software which provides the 'upgrading' to play games from all regions almost the same thing as a modifying a set? And if it can be done using a software, why would they even bother with a chip installation in the 1st place?</p>

              <p>WAH. You make it sounds that loading Wii games from internet is really a bad option...? -.-"</p>

              <p>I think a typical US/local wii set should still be 600+ comes with a single wiimote and nunchunk.</p>
              <p>you can buy a second wii-mote together with wiiplay for around 70-80 bucks.</p>
              <p>if you don't understand jap, get a US/Local Set! :P since someone mentioned you can *ahem* any set anyway..</p>
