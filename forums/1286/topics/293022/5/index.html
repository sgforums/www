              <p>Anyone currently playing the Nintendo Wii ? May i get some reviews abt it like hows the game ? Issit fun and where to get cheaper wii if i were to buy 1 . And Is it worth it to modify my set to play pirated games and where ? I really think of buying one after my bonus but still dunno if the games are really good anot ley . Last but not least whats the different between jap , us or local set version ?</p>

              <p><br>us and local are the same... except that us do not have warranty while local one has.</p>
              <p>us/local consider ntsc/uc while jap is ntsc/j... there are also euro set... pal</p>
              <p>Anyway, only Jap I heard can modify and only some, not all... Regarding region breaking, there is something call free-loader to unlock the current sets so that it can load other region games.</p>
