              <p>Aiyo.....why SGforums become this format... Really hate it..</p>
              <p>I have being playing legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess for past 2 weeks. Quite Shiok.</p>
              <p>Over 40 hours of gameplay...still stuck in final dungeon...Sigh sigh...</p>
              <p>Either the my skill is getting worse or the game design is getting more challenging?? Hmm .. ....</p>
              <p>If can't win the game, mayb can go <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com">www.gamefaqs.com</a> to search for FAQ loh?? Mayb will have some tips?</p>
              <p>This is what I usually do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upgrading the system</span></strong> </p>
              <p>When I first play Mario striker, the nintendo wii couldn't detect my disc. I knownintendo wii couldn't detect my disc because, the music and image of the game didn't appear at the wii main page. (you know the images that appears after the CD is read?? 1st window top left of the screen) So I try my luck to click on the top left of the screen, see what will happen. Then there is this message prompts me need to update some system thingy. I click 'yes' . Then a message box saying the system is updating. I hold on for few seconds Then go back to main page. The wii is reading the disc coz I can see the images and music comes up in the top left hand corner as per normal. I think some game (esp. new ones) will require us to upgrade the system. I believe that the software is in the game disc itself. So whenever encounter problem, when disc can't be read, can click the top left hand window as per normal, see gt prompt you to upgrade or not.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using mircoSD card. </span></strong></p>
              <p>Anyone try playing MP3 or opening JPEG files using SD card??</p>
              <p>I using mirco SD. That means I put my mirco SD card into a adaptor then put inside WII. It says no picture/music file detected.How come?? Does WII oni accept a SD card and not a Mirco SD card?? Anyone try before using mirco SD card??</p>
              <p>I don't want to waste money buy a SD card when the problem actually lies in my wii system. Since I already have 2X 1G mirco SD card..    </p>

              <p>I've got Wii for about 5 months or so already.</p>
              <p>I have to say its a new gaming experience but personally, i think its not a worth it purchase for an avid gamer like me. Or maybe there aren't just enough games for Wii.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only thing good about Wii is it's ability to move the controller around. Or you can even convert the controller into a gun and play Medal Of honour Live or any shooting games u fancy. Its like playing time crisis 3!</p>
              <p>But if you are looking for racing games, you'd probably be turning your wrist often. Only game i've played is Need for Speed's Prostreet. Its a totally Rubbish game. But i'm not sure if there are any more new games coming up.</p>
              <p>Wii is great for family play. Not great for avid gamers.</p>
              <p>If u want me to rate from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best gaming console in time, i'd probably say 6 because its of a whole new gameplay. I would still go for Xbox or PS3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh btw, Wii can browse the internet. so why not? =)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>    Well i beg to differ that pple say wii is meant for grp fun as there are many games which can be played by one player and very fun too . Games like mario striker , resident evil 4 , battalion wars , mario galaxy etc can be played alone AND in groups ( except mario galaxy ) having much fun and also  i believe many pple don't like wii due to their graphics as it loses to xbox n ps3 and so look at wii in a biased view , the same way they look at nintendo ds and psp .

              <p>Read and ask around for reviews after you've spotted your title(s), it's easier that way.</p>

              <p>I've got Wii for about 5 months or so already.</p>
              <p>I have to say its a new gaming experience but personally, i think its not a worth it purchase for an avid gamer like me. Or maybe there aren't just enough games for Wii.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only thing good about Wii is it's ability to move the controller around. Or you can even convert the controller into a gun and play Medal Of honour Live or any shooting games u fancy. Its like playing time crisis 3!</p>
              <p>But if you are looking for racing games, you'd probably be turning your wrist often. Only game i've played is Need for Speed's Prostreet. Its a totally Rubbish game. But i'm not sure if there are any more new games coming up.</p>
              <p>Wii is great for family play. Not great for avid gamers.</p>
              <p>If u want me to rate from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best gaming console in time, i'd probably say 6 because its of a whole new gameplay. I would still go for Xbox or PS3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh btw, Wii can browse the internet. so why not? =)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I must admit that there's a limit in titles, especially if you're talking about local market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if you're looking for good graphics in most games and more 'standard' type of gaming, then Wii's probably not for you....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though I must say some of Wii's games do come with rather good graphics and with external adapter which allows for enhanced graphics with appropriate TV system...</p>
              <p>Last but not least... Wii's gonna open up a whole wide range of different gaming experiences... Though I must admit many of it's extra gaming components can be rather expensive and even not really worth their price at times... (especially of local market sense)</p>

              <p>Hi people,</p>
              <p>I am interested in Wii.. Can anyone elaborate the differences between Wii and other game consoles? What so special about Wii that attracts so many people to play with it? How about PS3, Xbox and etc...????</p>

              <p>   Well so far Wii is the only console to use the motion sensor in its controller fully as in able to swing one or both your controller to punch , swing your racket , cut stuff as in cooking mama ,etc . And the controller is also wireless except for the nunchuck which has a cable attached to the wii mote to draw power but still there are wireless nunchuck in the market also . And it can also detect the speed of your swing esp for playing the baseball game in wii sports . Its a big break from the other consoles of which you just sit there and press the buttons in a frenzy when you are excited . And also while you are swinging the wiimote , you are also exercising your arms and body while playing it . And whats else was it is best used to play those fps games like those resident evil and house of the dead where you can actually use your wiimote to aim directly at your tv screen much like the real stuff in arcade esp when there are adapters for you to slide your wiimote into it to use like an actual gun . I had alot of fun with my bro shooting zombies in resident evil . Whilst for other console games you would have to push your joystick or direction pad ard just to aim at the monsters . Wii is also wifi capable which means you can play with your friends online live with each other . The only drawback of wii was its low resolution which i also dunno why must they set it to such low resolution . In this aspect ps3 and xbox360 win it hand down . But however i know that xbox360 suffers from a red ring of death and gets overheated easilly . Ps3 well i personally also like its game but currently is still abit little games that attracts me but due to budget problem i won't buy ps3 .My reason to buy Wii was i can get some exercise at home should the whether be rainy and also It is more interactive playing wii and also the actions you have to make to play it are very realistic . Cos you actually swing your arm , punch etc to have the same action on your game . My bro also upon borrowing my wii set for 3 days , he and his wife also get 1 cos they too are tired of the usual sit on sofa n press buttons routine . Well thats all that i think of . If you still have more questions to ask feel free to ask .</p>

              <p>Actually from what I know... Wii system also allows for high resolution game play, but you'll need to purchase a separate adaptor for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, anyone actually know or have set up the online with a Wii system...? Cause I'm actually quite VERY INTERESTED but is not quite sure about whether it's workable or not....</p>
