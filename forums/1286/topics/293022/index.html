If modded do you kjnow how it is modded like for example a chip soldered in or just wires to bypass the circuitry or what ? And is the modification reversible ? I find that sg market very little wii games compared to JB  . I not reffering to the pirated games but rather is the legal games for wii . i really see more original wii games in JB then sg i wonder why .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I bought my wii system in Bangkok,Thailand. It is a europe model.<br>Cost around 700sgd free 10 non original games, one single controller. It is mod to play pirated games. However I have no idea what they do to mod it. I just pay then take.  So sorry.<br>I have check with friend that it cost about 500 sgd to purchase a wii in singapore. But it is a japan model. That means the interface is in  japanese , I bought it about 2 weeks ago, so the price might have flatuate.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wiiplay:</div><div class="quote_body">I found 2 shop selling the mod version (ie Jap model) Selling for $580 w/o the sports game. Anyone have the mod version?? Is it's worth to have it mod?? The salesman say only the menu is in Jap else will be according to the games in English.! true or not???</div></blockquote>I think he meant the game format would be the same as English version but most wordings, menu, introductions and conversations would be written in Japanese...?<br><br>I'm not sure... The other time I was also pretty tempted to buy a Japanese game, but after thinking through... I was afraid that it might be all Japanese and I'm not versed in it...<br><br>I also appreciate some of the attending staff in certain shops which gave me much information I needed regarding the games and such... Just encourages me to buy when I have more confidence in what I'm getting... (of course, if they lie to me and tell me sh|t which isn't true, I'll just go back... Make demands and f*ck them...)<br><br>I also believe I've got some answers to the internet connection thingy..? Though What I heard from the shop doesn't really sound right.. But hmm.. I shall try to find out more....?<br><br>Btw.. I also think that if you intend to buy a mod version... It's important that you can get a good supply of the games you're interested in.... See if you get get that, and check out the price of the Mod games before you jump into any purchase....?</div>

Then I believe PS3 or Xbox might be a better option for you...?<br><br>But if you're looking out for a different gaming experience... Something more 'healthy' and perhaps a more interactive game type which can be played among friends and couples.... Wii might just be what you're looking for? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well i am aware of the graphics that the PS3 and the Xbox360 can offer but i believe there are some of us who are tired of just sitting down there pressing buttons cultivating our belly .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Actually the nintendo Wii is also able to offer some decent graphics but of cos not as good as PS3 or Xbox360 but it stand on its own unique playability lor . As pple can both exercise and slim down while playing the game shaking n swinging its controller which is good for health also .</div>
