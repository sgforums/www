I'm not sure if one of the games I'm holding is the carnival one (but I don't think so?), olymics sports of Sonics and Mario seems ok... Others games would be like the Sports games which usually come with the set package... Other games would depends on what taste you and your family's into...?<br><br>Don't know about your brother, but from my experience with the fishing game in the arcade... I don't think it's really worth buying especially with the price it's going in Singapore.. Soul Calibur is more like a single player adventure game.. It allows for an extent of 2 players' adventure or versus mode... But I would say it's 2 players' fun capacity is limited, I have not really yet got the time to indulge in it's single's adventure yet.... Characters are quite limiting in a sense... (not sure if it's because I've yet to unlock characters, but it seems a numerous of the characters are already available to play with in co-operate and versus mode... So....)<br><br>Locally, Wii games are quite limiting and expensive... Though the market for the games is opening up a bit, but still.... I suppose the variety and price would be much more reasonable if you're getting them from overseas...?<br><br>Currently I'm playing 'Resident Evil - Umbrella Cooperate'... Or something like that....? It's a shooting game which allows 2 players' fun..... I must say the graphic is reasonably nice for a Wii game and also.. Quite shiok to play..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

With enhance graphics and some other feature that make use of the wii functions like breaking rocks with a chisels, or brushing dirt off walls for clues, swinging the nuchuke for the grapple hook. So it is be quite interesting for a tomb raider fan.<br><br>tenkaichi part 3's fighting system is slightly different. The story mode follows exactly the same route as part 2. (saiyan saga , freeza saga etc unti buu saga) the way you execute the moves in part 3 are more identical to the actual move. For example kamekameha in part 2 is pull back then push forward, part 3 is you have to hold the nuchuke and wiiote in one hand and push forward like the actual kamehameha. Graphic wise, part 3 is much better than part 2.<br>But I won't advise buying part 3 if you already own part 2. Better to use the money to try some other games. But if you really die hard DBZ fan, then must buy. Coz got some new stages and charactors.<br><br>regarding online system, sorie, i have yet to try le.<br><br></div>

I have in mind is the wii carnival games for family fun and is considering the soul calibur and my bro has his eyes on a fishing game which he dunno the name of it . And also anyone can tell me the name of the game where the player plays the role of the music conductor ? And also anywhere selling wii games alot and cheap ? I find that many shops stock very few or even little wii games as compared to psp/xbox/ps3 games . Ochard lucky plaza is a definite NO as one of the shop tried to chop me one big lump off the wii play game without wii remote quoting me $90+ . Crazy to buy from him .</div></blockquote>Rapala Fishing Tournament <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
