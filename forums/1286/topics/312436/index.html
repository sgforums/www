Remember that <a title="Final Fantasy, Dead or Alive females collide in fan-made movie" href="http://www.qj.net/Final-Fantasy-Dead-or-Alive-females-collide-in-fan-made-movie/pg/49/aid/104962">CGI tr from a few months ago</a> where hot babes from <span style="font-style: italic;">Final Fantasy</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead or Alive</span> were pitted against each other in one super kickass death match? Hellzyeah. We sure can't forget it indeed.<br><br>Now, here's the sequel to that: animator Monty Oum gives us Dead Fantasy 2.<br><br>The
              video picks up right where the previous clip ended, and from that point
              on, it's 11 full minutes of orgasmic action. More punches and kicks are
              thrown around, including the occasional magic too, with Rikku, Yuna,
              and Tifa representing the <span style="font-style: italic;">FF</span> fandom and <a id="tag" href="http://pspupdates.qj.net/tags/kasumi/3437">Kasumi</a>, Ayane, and Hitomi for the <span style="font-style: italic;">DoA</span> crowd.<br><br>Here's the catch though. Three new characters are added into the <a title="Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii" href="http://wii.qj.net/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/cid/278"><span style="font-style: italic;">Brawl</span></a> - err, brawl, rather. We won't spoil you - our own jaws dropped when
              the new challengers appeared in the arena. And by the time you reach
              the end, you're treated - and teased - with one heck of a cliff hanger.<br><br>Man,
              when's the next vid coming out? Monty Oum mentioned that there are at
              least five more installments to his little project and he promises that
              we're in for quite a ride in the coming episodes of Dead Fantasy.<br></span></p>

              <p>I wanna play Crisis Core!!! Argh!</p>
              <p>Coz ff7 disc was with my cousin and now its LOST! T_T</p>
              <p>I like 8's storyline...9 is kiddish but the theme was interesting...10 was sad but really meaningful..</p>
              <p>12 is a very political ff...something which i didn't expect much...as in too many controversies and politics...as compared to the previous ffs</p>
              <p>I still love the music though by Nobuo Uematsu...amazing guy who composes amazing soundtracks...you gotta love the man...</p>
              <p>Graphics wise i think it was a downgrade from 8 to 9...but 10 onwards was relatively ok though costumes and look headed more to the native pattern designs...overall the team still impresses me with their details =D</p>
              <p>But ff12 system is really different...so it takes some time to get used to...the bosses are more tricky to fight...and you need more "Strategy" based formations rather than the usual select and attack/magic/GF option...its very challenging</p>

              <p>yeah 10 was sad, but nice, although you can get the happy ending in X2. especially the scene where tidus and yuna are in the pond and they started playing suteki da ne.</p>
              <p>12 didn't appeal to me, from the characters looks to the trailers.</p>
              <p>9 was a cartoonish sort of fun, from the kidnapping plot to the usual save the world story. plus vivi is cute..</p>
              <p>yeah i agree, nobuo uematsu is a genius, but sad that FF decided to make him co produce with another guy on 12 was it? and he has since left i think.</p>

              <p>I found that 12 deviated alot from the usual FF that i've grown to love, but seeing the trailers of 13 i guess it would be continuing from there onwards. Even read that the usual turn based strategy would be slightly different. not sure why they wana change it too. tsk..</p>
              <p>Yeah the bgm of most FF's are what makes it nice to play especially during the boring parts, in ff8 i remember setting up the concert by selecting specific characters to play a certain instrument.</p>

              <p>I think the Ff13 battle system is similar to that of 12.</p>
              <p>aye most of the osts sold here in Singapore is either the malaysian rip or the taiwanese one. i guess the japan one is really impossible to get here unless you import. but i think if a fan really wants to collect should go for the original japanese version. i want to bring in also duno which website to buy from. ff9 itself has like 4cds, but since they did come out the cs for the concert 20022002 or sth liddat i'm guessing tour da japon should have. only where.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
