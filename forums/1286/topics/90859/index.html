If people don't buy original games, it means a dent in their earnings.<br><br>Outlawed chips<br><br>Piracy hurts the interests and intellectual property rights of game companies which put a lot of money into developing games, said Mr Alex Chua, home and entertainment division manager at Microsoft.<br><br>He declined to say how many Xbox owners here mod their consoles, but noted that a significant number of gamers are buying original games so they can log on to the Live multiplayer service.<br><br>For console owners, the good news is that the new rules are targeted at dealers. So people who already own a modded Xbox won't be breaking the law.<br><br>'As long as they do not commercially exploit, that is, sell or rent out, their modified game console, it is unlikely that they will be in breach of the proposed amendment to the law,' said lawyer Cyril Chua, who specialises in intellectual property.<br><br>But as with all copyright protection schemes, people who don't want to pay for software will be finding ways to get around the law.<br><br>Reflecting the 'bootleg mentality', an Xbox owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said he would just go to a neighbouring country to buy a mod chip if it is illegal in Singapore.<br><br>The question now is whether gamers will find new means to get their habitual dose of pirated fun. Or will they respect the value of intellectual property and pay for it?<br><br><img src="http://computertimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-08-25/news01a_040825.jpg"><br><br></div>
