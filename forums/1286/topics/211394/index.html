About the guns on the Sherman tanks, i believe im right. Most shermans have 75mm guns, some had 76mm which is the most powerful gun for the sherman. The other, known as Sherman 105, has a 105mm howitzer. Frankly speaking, i dont really use any tactics when i play it on skirmish missions. : <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  The only thing i used is the tank traps and barbed wire. So some tanks and infantries had to move in other directions, to which was my most heavily defended position, FlaK88s,AT guns ,bunkers and snipers. Flak 88s and AT guns took out most armoured units. The snipers and machine gun bunkers finished the rest. I hid the bunkers behind buildings, so the AT guns cant attack my bunkers and when they are in sight, the Flak 88s totally busted their butts! That's how i defended my place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Hmmm, everyone has their own tactics, there were no rights or wrongs. You can only say whether their tactics were ineffective or weak. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh hehe! That's my secret! I killed off all remaining soldiers and producing facilities, remaining only the machine gun bunker, so the game can go on. So i waited for one hour, i repeat, ONE HOUR! to charge my ammo. Then i produce the goliaths using three bunkers. Then i wait and wait, until the production of 60 goliaths is completed. I tell u, this is super powerful! If u intend to attack the base using this tactic, make sure not EVEN ONE GOLIATHS IS BEING DESTROYED! And if it is successful, the whole base will be gone in secs. Im dead serious! The explosion was so big that my whole screen lit up with the fire! Damn powerful! Hehe, next time try 100 den 150 ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>U mean i should read more books on tactics? About the guns on the Sherman tanks, i believe im right. Most shermans have 75mm guns, some had 76mm which is the most powerful gun for the sherman. The other, known as Sherman 105, has a 105mm howitzer. Frankly speaking, i dont really use any tactics when i play it on skirmish missions. :  The only thing i used is the tank traps and barbed wire. So some tanks and infantries had to move in other directions, to which was my most heavily defended position, FlaK88s,AT guns ,bunkers and snipers. Flak 88s and AT guns took out most armoured units. The snipers and machine gun bunkers finished the rest. I hid the bunkers behind buildings, so the AT guns cant attack my bunkers and when they are in sight, the Flak 88s totally busted their butts! That's how i defended my place.  Hmmm, everyone has their own tactics, there were no rights or wrongs. You can only say whether their tactics were ineffective or weak.<br></strong></blockquote>you gotta Try playing with the guys on the Internet....
