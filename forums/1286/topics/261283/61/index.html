As such, person B only needs to spend 500k to buy 50 units of tech.<br><br>Person A offers to pay 1.2 million for tech. He saves the cost of 1.8 million if he buys it from person B, rather than buying it from CN.<br><br>Person B agrees to buy tech and sells to person A since he will gain more than 100k of profits from tech selling. That is a huge sum for a newbie.<br><br>A middleman, person C, offers to be the middleman for 100k.<br><br>Person A, B, C agree to tech-trade.<br><br>Here is how tech-trading works:<br>1) Person A, the expert sends 1.3 million to the middle-man, person C.<br>2) Person C keeps 100k for himself for being middle-man and passes on 1.2 million to person B, the newbie.<br>3) Person B uses the 1.2 million person C sends to him to buy 50 units of tech.<br>50 units of tech for person B will cost less than 1.2 million.<br>4) Person B sends the 50 tech, which he uses person A's money to buy, to person A, the expert. Person B keeps the profits and uses it to buy infra.<br><br>In this way, person A, the expert makes 1.8 million since he saves that amount of money.<br>Person B, the newbie, makes (1.2million-800k to buy 50 tech=400k) of money.<br>Person C, the middleman makes 100k.<br><br>You don't have to need the money to buy tech to sell it. They money will be sent to you by person A to a middle man, person C, and person C will send the money to you.<br><br>Use the money person A send to you to buy the tech. Send person A the tech, and keep the profits for yourself. Even if you have no money, or you are a newbie, you can still do it. Hope that helps.<br><br>When I do tech-trading, I don't have the money to buy the tech either. I use the money the person who wants to buy tech sends to me to buy the tech and sends back the tech to him, while I keep the profits to myself.<br><br>One Word of Danger: Sometimes, someone attacks you before you can buy the tech, and you ends up losing the money to the somone in a war, and ends up unable to have the money to buy tech, and unable to pay person A the money he sends to you.<br><br></div>

But you must wait 10 days. My foreign aid slot is currently used up. I can only send you 10k 10 days or so later, so be patient. (I may send more(50k) if I win my fight in my wars, I am currently in 3 wars, but I don't promise. I am rather tight myself now since my alliance is in wars. )<br><br>Condition:<br><br>1) You can only use the 10k to buy infra, and nothing else. Infra is what built up your nation fast. (Trust me, land is pretty much useless.)<br>2) If in the future, you want to join an alliance, you are not allowed to join an alliance which is the enemy alliance of TPF(The Phoenix Federation). I will be happy, though, if you will join TPF, but it is not a requirement. Just not join the enemy alliance. (Legion, FAN, etc)<br><br>Suggestion:<br><br>1) Join an alliance temporally, even if you do not want to commit it to it, or you will get attacked by people, and may never have the chance to pay back the money to me.<br><br>How to pay me back the money:<br><br>When your nation gets bigger, and you manage to finally save up 10k, you can return back all the money I loan you by sending the money to one of the newbie in these alliances.<br><br>http://www.cybernations.net/stats_alliance_stats_custom.asp?Alliance=The%20Phoenix%20Federation (The Phoenix Federation)-- My alliance<br><br>http://www.cybernations.net/allNations_display_alliances.asp?Alliance=Christian%20Coalition%20of%20Countries (The christian coalition of countries)<br><br>http://www.cybernations.net/allNations_display_alliances.asp?Alliance=team%20Jesus (Team Jesus)<br><br>Both are mainly christian alliances that I support because some of the people in them are my RL friends.<br><br>If you are interested, PM me in the game. But you must wait 10 days, like I said, cos' my foreign aid is used up. ALL used up.</div>
