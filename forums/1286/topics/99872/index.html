            <div class='col-md body'>The defeat of the Covenant in the first Halo game was only a temporary victory, as the alien attackers have renewed their mission to wipe out all of humanity. Despite the human military force's and Master Chief's efforts, the Covenant have breeched the Earth's defenses and have left its inhabitants in a dismal situation. In the midst of desperation, players assume the role of Master Chief and lead the resistance against the Covenant to save the people of Earth from a gruesome demise. Halo 2 will feature an immense and epic single player mode, as the story picks up where it ended in the first game. In addition to the single player mode, Halo 2 will also feature a redesigned multiplayer mode. While the first game limited players to LAN connectivity, Halo 2 takes multiplayer missions online by way of Xbox Live.<br><br><img src="http://ai.pricegrabber.com/product_images/652000-652999/652765_640.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got the Halo 2 limited ed. in melbourne on lauch day. I must say that Bungie have squeezed out whatever they could from the x box. Some people may not be attracted to the story line probably because they wanted it to be more focused on the Master Chief's side. The game however switches in between the master cheif and the arbiter of the covenant. Personally, I very much welcome the alternating storyline, gives the whole game a more epic and fuller experience. Most people like to say.. oh... I dont like it because the X box graphics are dated and u can only do so much. If u do play this game, make sure you play Halo before hand... and take the game for what it is, dont compare because it simply is a genre by itself. Gameplay is straight forward, take weapons and shoot.  Multiplayer always rocks and asking a group of friends over to play deathmatch is sometimes more rewarding then playing cs.<br><br>What really makes the game stand out is the atmospheric soundtrack and oh my god ive never heard such great musical scores in a game ... absolutely inspiring. So if you have an xbox u must get this. If u havent got it, u dont now what you're missing.</div>
