              <p>Austrian Team Impact stood as winners
              after the finals of VISTA 2009 on June 11th. Out of 3 455 teams from 70
              countries 28 remained in the finals that took place in Volvo Trucks
              Training Centre in Göteborg, Sweden. In a tough field the Austrians
              impressed with both their practical and theoretical skills and claimed
              the title as winners of VISTA 2009.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Months
              of preparation and weeks of waiting were finally over when 28 teams
              from 26 countries met up in the final of the worlds biggest competition
              for workshop personnel. A true trial of strength took place during the
              day, and in the end Austria stood as winners.<br>"It feels completely
              amazing to win this prestigious event, and when Staffan Jufors, the CEO
              of Volvo Trucks called out our names as winner we thought it surely
              must have been a mistake", says Austrian team captain, Michael Marck.</p>
              <p>VISTA
              2009 started in September 2008 with the first of three theoretical
              rounds of competition, where over 13 500 competitors in 3 455 teams
              from 70 countries competed in theoretical problem solving. After two
              more rounds and eleven semifinals 28 teams went for the title in the
              world final in Göteborg.<br>"The finalists all belong to the best
              workshop personnel in the world and it really showed in the final. And
              I think everyone who was there could feel the concentration and the
              excitement in the air today", says Johanna Lundberg, executive project
              manager for VISTA.</p>
              <p>Staffan Jufors, president and CEO of Volvo
              Trucks handed out the trophy to the winning team, and was impressed by
              this years starting field.<br>"When I visited the competition today I
              was amazed by the  enthusiasm, the totally focused dedication and the
              teamwork. All 28 teams here today are worthy winners of the VISTA
              championship 2009," he says.</p>
              <p>"VISTA isn't just a competition and
              an education for our workshop personnel. It is also a great way to
              develop competence within Volvo Trucks. The competition corresponds to
              hundreds of thousands of hours of training and can hopefully inspire
              the entire service organisation in the search of excellence."</p>
              <p>The proud winners of Team Impact had no doubts about the decisive factor that put them over the top to win VISTA 2009.<br>"We
              have been working hard for this, and prepared all the way up until the
              finals. We also learned a lot during the competition and we look
              forward to defending the title here in Gothenburg again in 2011."</p>
