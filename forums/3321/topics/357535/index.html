              <h1>The new Mercedes-Benz Actros, has been elected International Truck of the Year 2009</h1>
              <p>This brings up the hat-trick for Actros in the commercial vehicle
              industry's most prestigious accolade. The first generation scooped gold
              in 1997, while seven years later Actros II took the prestigious trophy
              and now Actros III has completed the set for the German manufacturing
              giant.</p>
              <p>Actros fought off a strong challenge from the Iveco Eurocargo to
              take the trophy, while the new Volvo FH and Scania R Series with EGR
              engine shared the third position.</p>
              <p>The International Truck of the Year trophy is awarded to the truck launched
              in the previous 12 months which is deemed to have made the greatest
              contribution to road transport efficiency and in the case of the Actros
              the improvements made to the vehicle, particularly in the areas of
              safety and driver comfort scored a major hit.</p>
              <p>Many jury members commented on the fact Actros is now offered with a
              complete safety package including laneguard system, ESP and ACC which
              is made available to all customers, including their own CharterWay
              rental company. Safety of commercial vehicles and other road users is
              of primary concern to everyone involved in the sector and the jury
              welcomes the initiatives shown by Mercedes in this area. The Actros has
              benefited from a number of improvements to the driveability and
              efficiency of the truck and this was also commented on by the jury
              members when making their decisions.</p>
              <p>The addition of the new automated Powershift transmission, as standard,
              is a major step forward in driver comfort, as is the addition of the
              new bunk arrangement.</p>
              <p>New Actros brings a host of improvements to the driving and operational
              efficiency of the truck says jury chairman Andy Salter: "The whole is
              very much more than the sum of the parts and it's easy to see why
              Actros is building a strong reputation for itself among drivers and
              operators. This year was a particularly strong year for new vehicles
              and for Mercedes-Benz to scoop gold for the third time with Actros is a
              tremendous achievement".<br></p>

              <p>In
              the long-distance haulage sector, fuel consumption makes up the lion’s
              share of the lifecycle costs. Here, too, BlueTec® offers outstanding
              benefits. Further developed engines make such efficient use of the fuel
              that they not only have a higher output (depending on the engine
              variant) but also consume significantly less fuel.</p>
              <p>BlueTec® also gets
              top marks when it comes to service intervals: the technology is robust
              and requires only low maintenance. The impressive engines fitted in the
              new Actros deliver greater pulling power and efficiency – while
              offering potential fuel savings of up to 3 % in the case of
              straight-six engines and 6% in V8 engines.</p>
