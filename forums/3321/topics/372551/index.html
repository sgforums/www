              <p><strong>Tighter measures for companies who transport workers in lorries</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Companies who ferry their workers around in trucks will soon come under scrutiny. </span></p>
              <p><span> The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is putting in place more stringent control measures to ensure the safety of such workers. </span></p>
              <p><span> From next month, workers are not allowed to be seated at a height of
              more than 1.1 metres from the carriage deck. Currently, workers are not
              allowed to be seated higher than 3.2 metres from the surface upon which
              the vehicle rests. </span></p>
              <p><span> And from 1 January 2010, new lorries must be fitted with canopies and
              higher side railings if they carry passengers on the deck. This will be
              a requirement for all existing lorries in three years time. </span></p>
              <p><span> In addition, more space will be required per seated worker - as the
              minimum deck space required per seated worker will be doubled to eight
              square feet. </span></p>
              <p><span> Halimah Yacob, GPC Chair, Manpower, said: "Why does it take three years
              in order to introduce these measures. Can't it be much a shorter period
              because we're talking about the lives and limbs of people who come and
              work in our country?" </span></p>
              <p><span> Teo Ser Luck, senior parliamentary secretary, Transport &amp; Community
              Development, Youth and Sports, said: "It takes a little bit longer for
              the workgroup to come up with the recommendations, and it's because
              it's a very complex issue because you have to address not only the
              safety concerns but also the concerns of the business sector as well,
              and other stakeholders. </span></p>
              <p><span> The installation of the new safety features will cost about S$1,000-
              S$3,000. But industry players said it is a small price to pay for the
              convenience of a lorry. </span></p>
              <p><span> Simon Lee, executive director, Singapore Contractors Association, said:
              "When we carry goods, we need workers to work on the goods even
              unloading, loading and installation. So a lorry followed by a bus or
              followed by a van to transport these few more workers may not be so
              practical." </span></p>
              <p><span> Those who fail to comply with the new measures could face a fine, demerit points or even prosecution in court. </span></p>
