              <p>The factory gates open and the first
              Volvo FH16 700 appears. An eager Tore Aase from Norway is there to take
              delivery of the world’s most powerful series-manufactured truck. On
              Norway’s hilly west coast, the truck’s power will come into its own.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The
              truck will be used in long-haul operations in the west of Norway,
              hauling equipment for the oil industry. The 700 horsepower and massive
              3150 Nm of torque will be put to good use.<br>"The reason why we chose
              the FH16 700 is that we haul loads of up to 50 tonnes. The roads are
              often narrow and there may be kilometre-long gradients of between 6 and
              10 percent, so you can never really have too much power," says Tore
              Aase, owner of haulage company Spesial og Tungtransport AS, located in
              Förde 170 kilometres north of Bergen on the Norwegian west coast.</p>
              <p><strong>Higher average speed<br></strong>Tore
              Aase spends up to 200 days a year in his truck and his trips along
              Norway's demanding west coast test the truck to its limits. <br>"With
              our new 700, I will be able to maintain a far higher average speed on
              the long and steep gradients. I-Shift is also very important to me -
              not having to make constant gearchanges will considerably reduce my
              work behind the wheel. I've been driving trucks since the mid-seventies
              and I'm beginning to get a few aches and pains in my elbow."</p>
              <p>When
              asked how his colleagues will respond when he becomes the first
              customer to drive the world's strongest truck, Tore Aase replies with a
              knowing smile:<br>"Well, I'll be leader of the pack and this truck is sure going to attract a whole lot of attention!"</p>
              <p><strong>Roo-bars to protect against deer</strong><br>The
              new truck will become operational toward the end of July. Before that,
              it will be fitted with a variety of accessories, including roo-bars.
              Not that kangaroos are a common sight on Norwegian roads, but the
              region abounds with wild deer, elk and reindeer.</p>
              <p>Tore Aase is a loyal Volvo customer who has driven trucks of the same make for the past 18 years.<br>"I have tried other makes but I stick with Volvo. One important reason is that I get excellent service from my local dealer."</p>
              <p><strong>Unique performance and fuel economy</strong><br>The
              Volvo FH16 with 700 horsepower is the world's most powerful truck. It
              is built for the most demanding haulage assignments. Despite its 700
              horsepower, there is no increase in either its emissions or fuel
              consumption. On the contrary, nitrogen oxide emissions have dropped by
              40 percent compared with the previous model, so the new truck meets the
              forthcoming Euro 5 emission standards.</p>
              <p>"The FH16 700 is in a
              class of its very own on the world truck market. It offers a unique
              combination of performance and fuel economy. We have already noted
              considerable interest in the new model among customers who run
              particularly demanding transport operations," says Claes Nilsson,
              President of the Europe division at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <p><strong>Built at the Tuve plant<br></strong>The
              new Volvo FH16 700 is built at the Tuve plant outside Göteborg in
              Sweden. There hopes are high that the new model will become a success.<br>"We're
              really proud to have been given the job of building and supplying the
              world's strongest truck. Handing over the key to our first customer is
              a landmark event that speaks well for the future," says Johan Jinhage,
              Plant Director at Volvo Trucks in Tuve.<br><br><br><strong>Engine specifications<br></strong>Type designation D16G700 EU5SCR-M<br>Max power output at 1550-1800 r/min 700 hp (515 kW)<br>Max revs 2000 r/min<br>Max torque at 1000-1550 r/min 3150 Nm <br>Displacement 16.1 dm3<br>Compression ratio 17.3:1<br>Exhaust brake output at 2200 r/min 230 kW <br>Engine brake output (VEB+) at 2200 r/min * 425 kW<br>Dry weight (base engine) approx 1325 kg <br>*VEB+ is available as an option.</p>
