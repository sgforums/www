The workers had no proper safety harnesses to secure themselves to the vehicle. <br><br>“This is a clear breach of road safety regulations, especially in light of the weather and unsafe road condition. <br><br>“Employees are entitled to be protected by their employers in organised commutation for work purposes. <br><br>“Under these circumstances, they have the right to travel safely on public roads and at the very least, be properly sheltered from elements of the weather which can compromise their health -- and consequently, affect their performance at work, particularly if it requires physical rigour.”</div>

Instead, he was chatting to his friends at the market and taking his own leisurely time. <br><br>The STOMPer says: <br><br>“I was driving out from Whampoa Drive market at Blk 92, on July 23 at around 12 pm. <br><br>“When I reached the exit of the carpark, I saw a lorry blocking the exit so I horned to alert the driver. <br><br>“The driver walked towards the lorry only after I horned about three to four times. <br><br>“The worst thing is that the driver, who is circled in the picture below, told me to just go through the small opening at the exit or by the entrance, because he was unloading his goods, which he wasn’t. <br><br>“Later, he just walked off to the fruit stall again, chatting to others without moving his lorry away. <br><br>“I had no choice but to go out by the entrance, causing a jam and danger to others.”</div>

              <div>"This lorry was found parked in a yellow box around noon. <br><br>"It blocked vehicles wanting to turn into the one-way street on the left, as well as vehicles wanting to go straight from the back.</div>

              <div>"Cars wanting to go straight were seen turning right first, into oncoming traffic, and then turning left back into the lane. <br><br>"It's a double offense as seen clearly from the pictures as there is a continuous white line in the centre of the two-way road, which means parking is not allowed on either side of the road. <br><br>"A motorcyclist had to get the driver (eating at the 24-hour coffeeshop) to move his vehicle away so that he could drive into the one-way lane.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"If it were to be a car/lorry, more obstruction would be caused on both sides of the road, endangering other motorists."</div>
