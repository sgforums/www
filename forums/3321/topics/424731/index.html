              <h2>NEW MERCEDES-BENZ ATEGO RANGE LIFTS 2011 INTERNATIONAL TRUCK OF THE YEAR TROPHY AT 63rd IAA COMMERCIAL VEHICLES SHOW</h2>
              <p>Mercedes-Benz’s new Atego range has been elected International Truck of the Year 2011 
              by a group of 23 European commercial vehicle journalists, representing 23 countries 
              throughout Europe from Ireland to Russia, and Scandinavia to Greece.
              With a total of 127 votes, the new Atego range fought off the challenge posed by Volvo’s 
              latest FM/FMX Series, which collected 82 votes, while Scania’s powerful long-haul V8 
              fnished in third place with 45 votes.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.truck-of-the-year.com/images/Asso_Truck-2.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="231"></p>
              <p>According to jury rules, the ITOY award is presented every year to the truck launched 
                    in the previous 12 months which has made the greatest contribution to road transport 
                    effciency in terms of innovation, comfort, safety, driveability, fuel consumption and 
                    emission reduction.</p>
              <p>Building on the success of its previous model, Mercedes-Benz has 
              delivered a new 
              medium-duty truck with two distinct ‘souls’. The frst is that of a 
              well-tuned, conventionally-powered truck range with many of the ‘big 
              truck’ features previously found in Mercedes’ 
              heavier Axor and Actros models. The second, the 12-tonne Atego hybrid, 
              is now in series 
              production and in the vanguard of ‘alternative-driveline’ vehicles that 
              will increasingly 
              feature in road-transport feets over the coming years.</p>
              <p>On the outside, the latest Atego now has the same family ‘face’ as Mercedes-Benz’s 
              heavy duty truck models with its newly-designed front section and grille. While underneath 
              its cab, the Atego medium truck range now incorporates many of the features previously 
              found in the Actros and Axor. The result of that ‘technology transfer’ in the Atego is a more 
              comfortable and quiet workplace with better storage and neat steering wheel controls.</p>
              <p>From a safety perspective, the IToY jurors also appreciated the latest option of a 
              lightweight-yet-powerful auxiliary retarder that spares foundation brakes in most operating 
              conditions, keeping service costs down too. Equally praiseworthy, is Mercedes’ optional 
              ‘stop-start’ system that prevents long idling, cutting fuel consumption and emissions 
              in traffc jams.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the 12-tonne 1222 Atego Hybrid - now in series production - 
              opens a whole 
              new opportunity for the company in distribution trucks. With its ability
               to start off in electric 
              mode, thereby saving fuel, its ‘stop-start’ system and advanced driving 
              function at hi-speed (eco-roll), the Atego Hybrid answers, well 
              in-advance, the future need to cut fuel 
              consumption by 10-15%  as well as lower CO2
               emissions. And this will be a critical 
              issue for commercial vehicles operating in EU over the coming years.</p>
              <p>Having tested the Atego Hybrid twice in the previous 12 months, the jury was impressed 
              by how well Mercedes-Benz’s engineers have integrated the hybrid drive-train into the 
              Atego’s conventional driveline. This translates into an advanced, well-refned medium 
              duty truck that is easy-to-drive but requiring the minimum of training.</p>
              <p>Summing up the jury’s vote, the International Truck of the Year chairman
               Gianenrico Griffni 
              commented: “Mercedes-Benz has delivered a new, multi-faceted, 
              medium-duty truck. 
              Not only does the latest Atego now offer distribution truck drivers many
               of the features 
              previously found in heavier ‘premium’ long-haulage trucks, but its 
              advanced parallel-hybrid model also addresses the on-going problem of 
              reducing the CO2 footprint from commercial vehicles throughout the EU. 
              This truly is a truck with two souls.”</p>
