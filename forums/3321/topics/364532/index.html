              <div class="articleText_intro">When the Globetrotter cab was launched,
              Volvo expected to sell a few hundred cabs a year. But this niche
              product quickly became a success. This year, 30 years after it was
              launched, nine out of ten new Volvo FH trucks have a Globetrotter cab.
              Now, just like at the outset, the Globetrotter’s key concepts are
              driver environment and world class cab comfort.</div>
              <p>The Globetrotter cab was designed to provide
              a safer option for long-haul operations. Haulage from Western to
              Eastern Europe increased steadily during the 1970s. Journeys lasted
              several days, and it was common for two or more drivers to share a
              truck and drive in shifts. Often, the only accommodation solutions
              available were add-on plastic superstructures that left a lot to be
              desired in terms of safety. Volvo wanted to offer a safer, more
              comfortable option.</p>
              <p>Volvo's low sales projections were quickly
              shattered. The Globetrotter cab met a need that nobody could have
              foreseen. Instead of catering to a niche, Volvo opened an entirely new
              market.</p>
              <h2>Today's cab emerges</h2>
              <p>In the 1980s, Volvo was
              first to introduce a revolutionary development concept for truck cabs.
              Instead of being designed around the truck, the cab was designed around
              the driver. As part of Volvo's cab improvement project, a mock-up of a
              driver's cab was built and used to measure drivers' sitting positions
              at motor shows worldwide.</p>
              <p>Over 2,000 truck drivers helped
              develop the new cab by sitting in the mock-up and then answering
              questionnaires regarding different aspects of trucks. After eleven
              years of product development, the new Globetrotter cab was launched
              along with Volvo's new FH truck series in 1993.</p>
              <p>"There's no doubt
              that the Globetrotter cab has played a key role in Volvo's success over
              the years. Safety has always been one of our core values, and this is a
              prime example of how our safety efforts pay off," says Claes Nilsson,
              President of the Europe division at Volvo Trucks. </p>
              <p>The
              Globetrotter cab has been continuously refined and upgraded since then.
              In 1996, Volvo introduced the Globetrotter XL, the first truck with a
              full standing height of 193 cm inside the cab. The driver environment
              was given new seats and a new instrument panel in 2002, and a new audio
              and video system was introduced in 2008. Other new features introduced
              at the same time included a fold-up bed that offers a variety of
              adjustments and an optional swivelling passenger seat.</p>
              <h2>The future</h2>
              <p>Current
              truck regulations do not permit any changes to the cab's outer
              dimensions. However, constant efforts are underway to make better use
              of the available space and adapt the Globetrotter to new regulations.</p>
              <p>"The
              Globetrotter concept was a way of combining smart driver cab solutions
              and optimising the scope for creating a safe, comfortable working and
              living environment in a limited space - and this work still continues,"
              says Volvo Trucks' design director Rikard Orell. "And it's equally
              important to offer advanced safety and communication equipment. Thanks
              to Scandinavian design focusing on shape, function and quality, the
              Globetrotter concept will remain successful in the future."</p>
              <h2>Milestones:</h2>
              <p>1979:  
              The first Globetrotter cab is born. Volvo is the first manufacturer to
              offer a complete solution for driving and living comfort in a truck.</p>
              <p>1993:   A newly developed Globetrotter is launched for Volvo's new FH series, and quickly becomes Volvo's best-selling cab.</p>
              <p>1996:   The Globetrotter XL is launched as a variant, with full standing height of 193 cm from floor to ceiling.</p>
              <p>2002:   The driver environment is upgraded with features including a new instrument panel and new seats.</p>
              <p>2008:
                The cab is made more spacious. The audio and video system is
              upgraded, and a new folding bed is introduced that converts into a
              chair. A new swivelling passenger seat is offered as an option.</p>
