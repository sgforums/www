              </span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Scania takes eco-driving to a new level with its latest digital performance coaching technology</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Scania has developed an IT-based system that gives truck drivers direct feedback and tips on how to refine their driving style − and saves up to 10 percent on fuel. The system enables major cost reductions and environmental improvements. In a truck driven 200,000 kilometres per year, it can save more than SEK 60,000 (about EUR 6,000) and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 16 tonnes. <br><br></strong></p>
              <p>The system, Scania Driver Support, encourages drivers to keep an eye on their driving style, making them aware of mistakes and potential improvements as well as awarding clever driving via a rating system. The system helps drivers use their vehicle as safely and efficiently as possible. <br><br>Scania Driver Support continually analyses data from various electronic systems on the vehicle to monitor driver performance. The system assesses driving based on parameters that are fundamental in Scania Driver Training, gives the driver advice and hints while under way and produces an overall assessment of the driving style. <br><br>Scania developed the system in close collaboration with professional drivers. Test evaluations show that, once instructed how to use Scania Driver Support, even an experienced driver can improve fuel consumption by up to 10 percent with the help of the hints given. Variations in fuel consumption for the same driver were also dramatically reduced from 15-20 percent to around 5 percent, indicating a much more consistent driving style. </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">
              </span></p><h2 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 2.2em; font-weight: normal; color: #797777;">Bio-DME trucks from Volvo in field test</h2>
              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">In 2010, Volvo Trucks will be the first truck manufacturer to start conducting comprehensive field tests involving Bio-DME. This is a biofuel that generates very low carbon dioxide emissions. In the long term it has the potential to replace 50 percent of today’s diesel use for transport operations in Europe.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The field test is being made possible through a broad-based joint project involving, among others, the EU, the Swedish Energy Agency, fuel companies and the transport industry. The aim is to assess the potential of DME (Di-Methyl-Ether) as a vehicle fuel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME that is produced from biomass, known as Bio-DME, has both high energy efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions all the way from the source to the wheel. The raw material used is black liquor, an energy-rich, highly viscous by-product of the pulp industry. With Bio-DME instead of diesel as a fuel, carbon dioxide emissions are cut by 95 percent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks is participating in the project by contributing 14 Volvo FH trucks that will be tested by selected customers at four locations in different parts of Sweden between 2010 and 2012. Fuel company Preem will build filling stations so the trucks can be used in regular regional and local operations. The first field-test truck is being unveiled today in Piteå, where the production of Bio-DME will take place.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Same performance, minimal emissions</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvo's DME truck uses a regular D13 engine which, after some modifications to the tank system, injection system and engine management software, functions perfectly together with the biofuel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Behind the wheel, it's business as usual. Performance and driving properties are exactly the same as in the diesel variant. The difference and the major benefit with Bio-DME lies in its low carbon dioxide emissions," says Mats Franzén, Product Manager Engines at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">An ideal fuel for diesel engines</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Compared with a conventional engine, Bio-DME as a fuel in a diesel engine provides the same high efficiency rating along with a lower noise level. The combustion process produces very low emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides. Therefore, a simpler system can be used for after-treatment of the exhaust gases. The engine can also provide higher torque at start-up and thus improve driveability. All told, this makes Bio-DME an ideal fuel for diesel engines.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Modifications to the fuel system  </h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME is filled in liquid form and stored in pressurised tanks in a leak-proof system. The pressure keeps the fuel in liquid form all the way to injection. Common rail technology is used to create the optimum high injection pressure. The lower energy content of DME, just over half that of diesel oil, is compensated by fitting larger tanks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We are noting immense interest in alternative fuels among our customers and we feel that Bio-DME offers considerable potential. The field test will last three years and the subsequent evaluation will determine whether the project will lead to full-scale industrial production," says Claes Nilsson, President Volvo Trucks Europe Division.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">--------------------------</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Vehicle facts, Volvo DME truck</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tanks: DME is filled as a liquid via a special nozzle and stored in liquid form in the tanks. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Pump: a special fuel pump regulates the pressure in the common rail injection system. Injectors: special DME injectors have been jointly developed by Volvo and Delphi. Engine: the moving parts are identical to those in the diesel variant. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Engine management: the software has been modified to suit the different energy content.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">This is DME (Di-Methyl-Ether)</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME is a gas but it is transformed into liquid form at a pressure of just 5 bar. It is straightforward to handle in a process similar to that required for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The most common application today is as a propellant in spray cans. DME can be produced from natural gas and also from various types of biomass, in which case it is known as Bio-DME.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Bio-DME - future potential</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">From an EU perspective, Bio-DME has the potential for replacing just over 50%* of today's diesel oil in heavy road transport by 2030. The biggest challenge lies in creating an infrastructure for distribution of the fuel.</p>

              <p><strong>At its Capital Markets Day on 17 September (today), Scania presented its preparations for the next market upturn phase.<br><br>“We believe that the downturn has levelled off, even if the activity level remains low among our customers,” said Leif Östling, President and CEO of Scania. <br></strong></p>
              <p>At the event, Scania also unveiled the new R-series, which will ensure the company’s leading position in trucks for the vital long-haulage segment.<br><br>“We are working hard to reduce our costs in response to weak demand, but at the same time we are preparing for the next upturn phase. Today’s launch will further strengthen our product range. Together with continued streamlining of Scania’s production system and service network, this will provide a great opportunity for strong and profitable growth when the market eventually turns around,” Mr Östling said. <br><br>“The strong focus on costs and cash flow will lay the groundwork for a more efficient organisation going forward. Among other things, the experiences from our four-day week in the European organisation will contribute to more efficient working methods in the future. Implementing the principles for continuous improvements – Scania Production System (SPS) – will result in increased productivity at the offices as well as within the sales and services network.” <br><br><br>“We are increasing our production compared to the second quarter, but at the same time the third quarter is seasonally weak due to holiday periods in many markets,” said Jan Ytterberg, Scania’s Chief Financial Officer.<br><br>At the Capital Markets Day, Scania also presented its strategy for the bus and coach segment, which aims to further increase the degree of industrialisation in the production of complete buses and coaches by means of closer collaboration with selected bodybuilding companies. This will result in higher product quality and opportunities to increase service content, for example through service agreements.<br><br>Scania’s business unit Engines is also well-positioned for the future with engines complying with the new emission legislation for the off-road segments that will come into force in both Europe and the US as from 2011.<br><br>“As a result of the new range of SCR-engines that was presented earlier this year, we have received an increasing number of inquires from large OEMs from all over the world that today are not using Scania. Some of these OEMs have now chosen Scania engines for their off-road products as from 2011,” says Martin Lundstedt.<br></p>

              <p><strong>Today, 17 September, Scania unveils the new R-series. The new trucks will strengthen Scania’s leading position in the vital long-haulage segment.<br></strong></p>
              <p>“Our customers can now invest in improved total operating economy. The new R-series truck combined with Scania Driver Support will lower their fuel consumption even further. Since driver appeal is a strong Scania characteristic, the new cab environment has been extensively modified. This also helps attract the best drivers, which is another key factor in obtaining good fuel economy and low operational costs,” says Martin Lundstedt, Executive Vice President and Head of Franchise and Factory Sales. <br><br>Scania Driver Support is a new system that gives professional drivers real-time feedback and tips on ways to refine their driving style. <br><br>Among the news is also a new version of the gearchanging system Scania Opticruise. The system is now available fully automated, i.e. without a clutch pedal. Several new functions are integrated to further facilitate driving. <br><br>The launch of the new R-series is one element of Scania’s efforts to achieve sales of 150,000 vehicles per year by the peak of the next economic expansion. </p>

Within the framework of a broad-based joint project, field tests are being conducted with 14 trucks running on Bio-DME – a fuel that combines a low environmental imprint with high energy efficiency.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In August 2007, Volvo Group unveiled seven demo trucks from Volvo Trucks each running on a different type of biofuel, one of which was DME (Di-Methyl-Ether). This initiative showed that Volvo has the technical solutions for running the efficient diesel engine on virtually all existing renewable fuels.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Today, in a joint project with actors including the EU, the Swedish Energy Agency, fuel companies and the transport industry, Volvo Trucks is investigating the potential for large-scale investment in DME produced from biomass, a fuel known as Bio-DME.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks is participating in the project by contributing 14 Volvo FH trucks that will be tested by selected customers at four locations in different parts of Sweden between 2010 and 2012. The first field-test truck is being shown today in Piteå, where the production of Bio-DME will take place in Chemrec's plant. The Volvo Group, of which Volvo Trucks is a part, is one of the co-owners of Chemrec via its subsidiary, Volvo Technology Transfer.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">From a facility beside the Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner pulp plant, the project will produce four tonnes of Bio-DME per day. The raw material used is black liquor, an energy-rich, highly viscous by-product of the pulp industry. Through gasification of the biomass in the black liquor, what emerges is a particularly clean and energy-efficient fuel. The plant is being inaugurated today by the King of Sweden, who is renowned for his keen interest in environmental issues.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"From the holistic viewpoint, Bio-DME is one of the most promising second-generation biofuels. Bio-DME provides both high energy efficiency and low emissions of greenhouse gases. We value these two properties particularly highly as we analyse various possible alternative fuels," says Lars Mårtensson, environmental affairs director at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Compared with a conventional engine, Bio-DME as a fuel in a diesel engine provides the same high efficiency rating but also a lower noise level. In comparison with diesel fuel, Bio-DME generates 95 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions. What is more, the combustion process produces very low emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides. All this makes Bio-DME an ideal fuel for diesel engines.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The entire chain</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The field test gets under way in 2010 and encompasses the entire technological chain from biomass to fuel in trucks, in other words including distribution and filling stations. Fuel company Preem will build filling stations so the trucks can be used in regular regional and local operations. The other companies involved in the project are Chemrec, Delphi, ETC, Haldor Topsoe and Total who are contributing as partners.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Inspections and evaluations of the fuel, truck technology, customer perceptions and distribution system will provide answers as to whether Bio-DME may emerge as one of the fuels that can partially reduce dependence on diesel oil. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The project will continue for a specific period and its evaluation as well as the long-term decisions of the authorities will determine whether full-scale industrial production will become reality. The challenges facing new fuels lie primarily in taking a long-term view, producing sufficiently large quantities of biofuels, and handling distribution via a suitably large number of filling stations.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The field test will give us valuable new insight into the potential of Bio-DME as a future vehicle fuel. The project still requires many tests, larger-scale fuel production and an extended infrastructure. And, perhaps most of all, clear guidelines from the authorities on how they view the fuel," says Volvo Trucks' President and CEO, Staffan Jufors.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>

It is straightforward to handle in a process similar to that required for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The most common application today is as a propellant in spray cans. DME can be produced from natural gas and also from various types of biomass, in which case it is known as Bio-DME.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bio-DME - future potential</span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">From an EU perspective, Bio-DME has the potential for replacing just over 50%* of today's diesel oil in heavy road transport by 2030.

              <p><strong>Scania plays a prominent role at the ITS World Congress in Stockholm, Sweden, which will be inaugurated today by Sweden’s Minister for Communications, Åsa Torstensson. Scania provides speakers and expertise and presents ethanol fuelled distribution trucks and hybrid buses, as well as several support systems that promote road safety and reduce the environmental impact.</strong></p>
              <p>The ITS World Congress has attracted more than 3,000 transport researchers from all over the world to Stockholm International Fairs from 21 to 25 of September. The climate challenge is the main theme of the congress, which aims at finding efficient solutions that integrate the four different modes of transport.<br><br>Scania is one of the main sponsors of the congress, participating with an exhibition stand, expertise and vehicles. Hasse Johansson, Executive Vice President Research and Development, will be joining in the discussions on integrated transport solutions to reduce CO2 emissions.<br><br>The exhibition includes displays of Scania’s various support systems that promote road safety and fuel efficiency. One system is the new Scania Driver Support that gives truck drivers direct feedback and tips on how to refine their driving style − and saves up to 10 percent on fuel. The system enables major cost reductions and environmental improvements. In a truck driven 200,000 kilometres per year, it can save more than SEK 60,000 (about EUR 6,000) and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 16 tonnes. <br><br>During the congress week, Scania provides its ethanol hybrid buses for transporting delegates. In cooperation with Green Cargo, Scania also presents examples of sustainable combined transport operations.</p>
              <p><em>Scania is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of trucks and buses for heavy transport applications, and of industrial and marine engines. A growing proportion of the company’s operations consists of products and services in the financial and service sectors, assuring Scania customers of cost-effective transport solutions and maximum uptime. Employing 35,000 people, Scania operates in about 100 countries. Research and development activities are concentrated in Sweden, while production takes place in Europe and South America, with facilities for global interchange of both components and complete vehicles.

              <p><strong>Scania has signed a pan-European delivery agreement with the transport and logistics company DHL, which recommends Scania as a supplier of heavy trucks to the hauliers that act as contractors to DHL.<br><br>“The agreement opens the way for sales of about 1,000 new trucks per year,” says Urban Erdtman, Executive Vice President and Head of Scania Sales and Services Management.<br></strong></p>
              <p>According to the agreement, transport companies that act under the DHL PartnerStore programme are guaranteed access to trucks that meet DHL’s requirements and needs, for example in terms of the vehicles’ cargo capacity, equipment level and environmental performance. <br><br>“With Scania as their supplier, DHL’s transport operators will gain access to a comprehensive, cross-border range of services that will guarantee the best possible transport economy and profitability,” Mr Erdtman says.<br><br>The delivery agreement is available to the hauliers that DHL relies on for transport services in Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In Great Britain, a separate agreement also applies to purchases of trucks for DHL’s own fleet.<br><br>The range of standardised specifications includes distribution trucks featuring 9-litre engines and tractor units with 13-litre engines, all meeting Euro 5 emission standards. <br><br>DHL is one of the leading companies in international express deliveries, road transport and air freight services, as well as in maritime cargo and logistics solutions.<br><br>The agreement with DHL is being made by Scania’s corporate International Fleet Sales unit. This unit focuses on international and cross-border fleet sales, global account management and the coordination of added value service offerings from the Scania distribution network. By combining these resources, Scania can develop consistent and comprehensive solutions for its global customers.</p>

              <p><strong>This week Scania inaugurated its first distributor and service facility in Kazakhstan and opened a new head office and affiliated service workshop in Ukraine. <br><br>“A professional service network is an important element of Scania’s growth strategy in new markets,” says Urban Erdtman, Executive Vice President, Sales and Services.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Kazakhstan is the hub of Scania’s commitment to the markets of central Asia. The newly inaugurated sales and service facility − Scania’s first of its own in the region − is located in Almaty, southern Kazakhstan. It also houses the head office of Scania Central Asia, which was established in 2007. <br><br>The demand for western European vehicles in the region is limited today but is increasing as the central Asian economies grow and as road transport between South East Asia, Russia and Europe expands. Kazakhstan plays a vital role as a transit country for these transport services.<br><br>“The Almaty sales and service facility is the first of several that we expect to establish over the next few years, enabling us to meet increasing demand from national haulage companies that work with international long-distance service as well as satisfy the service needs of the operators engaged in transit traffic,” says Vladimir Smirnov, Managing Director of Scania Central Asia.<br><br>Scania also foresees greater potential for sales of city buses to the major urban areas in the region, which are introducing stricter emission standards in order to deal with environmental problems.<br><br>In Ukraine, where Scania has been represented since 1993, a new facility is being inaugurated today outside Kiev, strategically located along the important E40 European route. Aside from the head office of Scania Ukraine and Scania Credit Ukraine, the facility also houses Kiev-Scan, one of Scania’s eight dealers in Ukraine. <br><br>The service facility is one of Scania’s largest in eastern Europe. It will also include a training centre for service technicians, drivers and others as well as a central warehouse for the Ukrainian market.<br><br>The demand for servicing and quick availability of parts are becoming increasingly important as more Ukrainian transport companies choose to invest in western European vehicles offering better performance and higher uptime than domestic and Russian makes. <br><br>Ukraine, with a population of 46 million, is already a very important transport market today. The country borders four European Union countries to the west and Russia to the north-east.<br><br>“Our sales of trucks and buses for domestic service will increase, so we are planning to establish new service workshops in western and southern Ukraine during the next few years,” says Özcan Barmoro, Managing Director of Scania Ukraine.</p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Robust, aerodynamic, safe to drive, comfortable to live in – and preferably also attractive to look at. The design demands on today’s modern trucks are among the toughest in the world of product design. So what does it take to meet all these demands? Asok George and Rikard Orell at the Volvo Design Center have the answer.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tool, status object, vehicle, means of transport, mobile accommodation - a truck has a thousand faces. You get different perspectives depending on the person to whom you are speaking.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A driver hauling a full load up a steep Alpine gradient appreciates its power, size and spacious interior. A regional planner with responsibility for environmental issues would doubtless prefer to see more modest and more aerodynamic trucks than those currently on the roads. A child who is about to cross a busy road would perhaps prefer that there were no trucks at all.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"When we pen a new design, we consider two different types of end-users. First of all we have the customer, who usually knows exactly what he wants. To attract him to our brand, the design must express certain values and qualities. The other end-user of our products is society in general. The trucks we design operate everywhere. If people don't like them because they look frightening or ugly, they simply won't function in society. Which means we will have failed," says Asok George, Chief Designer at the Volvo Design Center.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At his workplace just outside Göteborg, a dozen or so designers from all over the world work on the creation of what in truck circles are some of the most dynamic products in the world: Volvo's fleet of heavy trucks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Designed with "a thousand faces" for almost as many different applications, these vehicles are the very epitome of functional design - design that must function in terms of both content and form. Or, to use Asok George's terminology, "design that is self-explanatory".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The lid of a jar looks like the lid of a jar and is designed to be opened in a certain way. You don't need to read an instruction manual to understand how to operate it. In the same way, the truck's appearance must communicate what it's intended for and how it is to be used," he explains.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Fairly straightforward, thus far. But it all gets far more complicated when you start adding in the context in which all the world's truck designers work. As laymen we might be tempted to picture a "designer" as something of an artistic bohemian genius whose unfettered imagination helps conjure new lines and functions out of thin air.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Nothing could be more wrong.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A truck is characterised by strict restrictions regarding height, width, length and shape. For instance, departing from the typical flat-fronted design that is the norm for European trucks today is out of the question.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Our starting point is a square-edged box that is designed to transport goods. There are detailed standards governing everything from the dimensions of the wheel housings to where the lights are to be fitted and how large the windscreen must be. And of course it's vital to make the inside as spacious and practical as possible, at the same time as the outside is made as small and slim as can be," says Rikard Orell, Design Director at Volvo Trucks and the person who heads the design operation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Coming as he does from car design at Volvo Cars and before that at Australian car manufacturer Holden, he admits that the firm restrictions on today's trucks can sometimes make the truck designer's job a bit frustrating.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"You have a much freer hand when designing cars. You draw a product that may have a production run of millions, where it is often the appearance itself that ultimately attracts the customers. This means that the resources and preconditions are on an entirely different level compared with working on trucks," he relates, at the same time as he emphasises that this firm focus on exterior design is not always a positive thing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The risk is that everything ends up being about traditional styling. A truck is far more complex than a car. There are major differences between the different variants and configurations and since everything is so firmly tied to the functional aspects, the work itself is much more exciting."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In other words, even within strict limitations there can be scope for innovation. If you take a close look at a Volvo, you can accordingly see that it really does stand out from the crowd. The way the lines along the side are drawn in towards the front, the clean body panels, the rounded contours and the classic profile - everything spells design that is typical of Volvo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"It's all about creating something that looks like and is perceived as a Volvo. The brand is the primary area for which we have clear-cut responsibility. Our job is all about communicating Volvo's core values - the environment, safety and quality - in the best possible way. Volvo's design is clearly inspired by the Scandinavian environment. It is simple, clean and straightforward," says Rikard Orell.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So from where does a professional designer draw his own inspiration?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"From everywhere: architecture, cars, product design, boats, mobile homes ... I have a 70 or 80 gigabyte database of pictures that I continuously update and look through," says Asok George. He's quiet for a few seconds, then adds:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"If you can keep the end-user in your mind throughout the design process, you already have access to the best source of inspiration there is. Just imagine you're developing the best possible tool for the world's most professional driver, at the same time as you visualise a little child riding his tricycle in a garden - with those two images playing through your mind you can't fail!"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For Rikard Orell it is the environmental requirements, such as fuel efficiency and alternative fuels, that will have the greatest influence on truck design of the future.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We work ceaselessly to improve aerodynamics within the strict frameworks we are given. The focus may be on optimising the radius of a curve in a body panel, getting rid of unnecessary detail or working on the underside of the truck to improve airflow. What it isn't about is to transform the truck into a Ferrari. After all, its job is to haul heavy loads."</p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">In 50 years’ time, the population of the world’s large cities will be greater than the present-day entire population of the world. Keeping these growing mega-cities supplied in an ecologically sustainable way is one of the crucial problems facing urban and regional planners today. In the hunt for efficient alternatives to fossil fuels, Volvo Trucks’ latest green solution, biofuel DME, plays an important role.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Forward-planning researchers are scarcely renowned for their unanimity on any issue, but on one point they are all in firm agreement: the world is moving towards the mega-city. Even today, there are more people living in large urban environments than in rural areas, and in another 25 years no less than 70 percent of the world's population will be living in mega-cities. Within that space of time, it is estimated that the world's total building density will have doubled.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This swift urbanisation means the world's urban and regional planners are facing gigantic challenges. Not least on the issues of the environment and climate since fast-growing cities impose considerable burdens on both.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The UN's aim of limiting global warming to two degrees has been adopted as the norm in this context. The EU has promised to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent before 2020 - increasing that figure to 30 percent if other countries also toughen their eco-targets. The same trend can be seen elsewhere in the world.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The question of how today's metropolitan centres can continue to grow bearing in mind these increasingly tough targets is answered by the experts with two words: increased density. After having grown laterally for decades, tomorrow's major cities will now start growing inwards, towards the centre.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"With a denser population structure, people have access to a wider variety of services and facilities within a shorter range. This in turn reduces travel requirements and increases the use of sustainable transport methods such as walking and cycling," says Sverker Hanson, civic engineer and transportation planner at international consultancy Sweco. He continues:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The same advantages of increased population density can be seen with regard to logistics. There is already a trend towards a greater number of distribution terminals in and around major cities. With more densely populated cities, in the future it may be possible to have one large reloading terminal per district, with electrically powered distribution trucks providing just-in-time delivery services to households and companies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Other trends are the coordination of long-haul and distribution transportation and the creation of public transport for goods.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, increased population density and increasingly well thought-out - and environmentally optimised - urban centres will not solve the other major problem facing the planners: how tomorrow's mega-cities will be kept supplied. The mathematics is simple: more people means a growing need for consumer goods and food - and a radical increase in the need for transport in to the cities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We are moving towards a situation where many of our reserves of fossil fuel, such as oil and natural gas, are beginning to dry up. This together with increased demand for energy will lead to rising energy prices. Linked to the climate issue, this means that the key for tomorrow's transport will be energy efficiency," says Lars Mårtensson, environmental affairs director at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">He feels that tomorrow's transport infrastructure must be based on increased synchronisation of all existing transport methods. Ships, railways and trucks will all need to work side by side.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The future is with a wide variety of transport methods. What we need to work on is improving the synergies between them. This is an area in which we have considerable potential for improvement," explains Lars Mårtensson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the area of road transport, there is already a clear trend towards increasingly large and heavy trucks for the longer routes. And it is these energy-intensive transports that are in focus in Volvo Trucks' most recent strategic environmental drive.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In a unique development project together with the EU, the Swedish Energy Agency, Danish chemicals specialist Haldor Topsoe, fuel giants Total and Preem and biofuel producer Chemrec, among others, there is a project under way to develop an entirely new type of biofuel: dimethyl ether or DME.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME is a gas that is transformed into a liquid under low pressure, which means it is relatively straightforward to handle. It is used today for a variety of purposes, among others as a propellant in spray-cans, as a fuel in cigarette lighters and as a base chemical in the production of plastics.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME can be produced both from natural gas and from a variety of biomass sources, in which case it is known as Bio-DME.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As a fuel in a diesel engine, DME provides as high an efficiency rating as a traditional diesel engine, but a lower noise level. The combustion process produces no soot, so a far simpler method of after-treating the exhaust gases can be used. What is more, the engine can produce higher torque when starting off, thus improving driveability.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">All told, this makes Bio-DME an ideal fuel for diesel engines.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvos' project involves the development of DME fuel from black liquor, a by-product of the forestry industry. Alongside the Chemrec plant in Piteå in northern Sweden, construction has started on a facility for extracting DME from black liquor obtained from the nearby pulp plant. The cooking chemicals produced by gasification of the black liquor are then sent back to the pulp plant, thus creating a closed circuit characterised by unparalleled energy-efficiency.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"From production of the fuel to its use in the engine, DME is the most efficient biofuel in existence. Each hectare of land produces five times the transport range with DME compared with biodiesel," says Per Salomonsson, DME project manager at Volvo Technology.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With a massive 95 percent lower climate impact than conventional diesel oil, DME is particularly suitable for transports that consume a lot of fuel - exactly the type of heavy long-haul assignment that will supply tomorrow's growing mega-cities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">However, there is nothing to prevent DME, if it becomes successful, from also being used for other purposes.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Since DME can be produced from all types of biomass, it may become viable even for countries without any significant forestry industry. For instance, it could be used for other purposes than just as a vehicle fuel. In China, for example, DME is used as an additive in liquefied petroleum gas for household purposes," explains Per Salomonsson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Within the framework of the project, which started in September last year and will stretch over a total of four years, 14 test trucks will be built for use in field tests throughout Sweden, starting in summer 2010.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"From the holistic viewpoint, DME is one of the most promising second-generation biofuels. The Bio-DME project creates exciting new possibilities for testing DME in realistic conditions among our regular customers," says Lars Mårtensson, environmental affairs director at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Facts DME</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME (di-methyl-ether) is a gas that transforms into a liquid under low pressure. It can be handled more or less like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Today DME is primarily used as a propellant in spray-cans.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">DME can be produced from natural gas and also from various forms of biomass. According to EU estimates, by 2030 Bio-DME has the potential for replacing more than 50% of the diesel oil currently used for heavy road transport.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When Bio-DME is made from biomass via black liquor in a pulp plant, the result is 95 percent lower carbon dioxide emissions compared with fossil diesel. At the same time, it is five times more efficient than biodiesel in terms of the transport kilometres obtained from each hectare of land used for cultivation of the raw material.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Together with the EU, the Swedish Energy Agency, Danish chemicals specialist Haldor Topsoe, Total, Preem and biofuel producer Chemrec, among others, Volvo Trucks is involved in a project to examine the potential of Bio-DME as a future vehicle fuel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The hub of the project is Chemrec's gasification plant in Piteå. This will take in black liquor from a nearby pulp plant, extract DME from the black liquor and then return some of the cooking chemicals to the pulp plant. The energy content of the black liquor, which today is used for heating and other purposes, will be replaced by other biomass sources in the form of logging industry waste that is not used in paper production. This biomass consists of forestry residue such as branches, at present not a resource that is fully exploited in the forest.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At present 14 test trucks are being built and from summer 2010 they will be field-tested in regular day-to-day operations by customers throughout Sweden. Preem will build fuel stations so the trucks can be used under entirely normal operating conditions.</p>

              <p>Volvo Trucks in Umeå showcases its successful environmental commitment</p>
              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro">The Volvo Trucks cab factory in Umeå, will soon be 
              an entirely CO2-neutral factory. This is being achieved by replacing propane 
              with DME and by cutting energy consumption through the use of an ice-cold 
              underground river to cool the production machinery. At the same time, 
              considerable environmental improvements in the paintshop have helped create the 
              world’s cleanest and most energy-efficient paintshop.</div>
              <p>In conjunction with the meeting of the European Ministers in Umeå, Sweden on 
              October 14-16, Volvo Trucks showcased its highly successful pro-environmental 
              work at the cab factory in Umeå. For several years now, the company has been 
              making major investments in improving the efficiency of its energy usage and the 
              goal is to have a carbon dioxide-neutral factory with locally produced energy 
              within a couple of years. Energy consumption has decreased by 30 percent per 
              manufactured cab over the past ten yeas, at the same time as there has been a 
              record increase in production volumes.</p>
              <p>Umeå's green focus echoes Volvo Trucks' over-riding environmental goals, 
              which among other things means that all the company's large production plants 
              are to be CO2-neutral by 2010.</p>
              <p>"For us, Umeå is a shining example and a symbol of our environmental 
              commitment. The factory has for many years worked very successfully with 
              environmental issues, generated highly innovative solutions and shown in 
              concrete terms that this commitment benefits both the company and the 
              environment," says Lars Mårtensson, environmental director at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <p><strong>Halving of propane consumption<br></strong>Today 90 percent of the 
              factory's energy consumption is renewable. The target is 100 percent. Of the 106 
              GWh of energy that the Umeå factory consumed in 2008, 13 percent still consisted 
              of propane, even though propane consumption has been halved compared with 2006. 
              The propane used for the painting ovens has been replaced with district heating 
              and today propane is the only fossil fuel being used. The district heating 
              system has also replaced oil as a fuel, and all told emissions of CO2 have been 
              cut by 8000 tonnes a year. Today energy is recycled to the tune of 80 GWh per 
              year. Now propane is being replaced by DME produced from biomass. This is taking 
              place in a joint project bringing together Umeå University, Umeå Energi, Ö-vik 
              Energi and Volvo Trucks. <br>"The DME project is a good example of how research, 
              business and society work smoothly together to find solutions that really work," 
              continues Lars Mårtensson.</p>
              <p><strong>Cooling from an icy underground river<br></strong>The most 
              spectacular energy saving is seen in the factory's cooling system. Close to the 
              Ume River and the Volvo factory there is an underground ice river that maintains 
              a constant cold temperature come summer or winter. The icy water from this river 
              is pumped via a two kilometre long pipe into the factory's own system. This 
              water is used in various cooling systems and has replaced many of the cab 
              factory's refrigeration plants which otherwise used cooling agents such as 
              freon. The biggest consumer of cooling water is the dehumidification of the air 
              that is fed to the paint-boxes in the paintshop. The first supply of ice-river 
              water reached the factory about a year ago, and its cooling effect corresponds 
              to 3000 kilowatts.</p>
              <p><strong>The world's cleanest paintshop<br></strong>Work on reaching the 
              environmental targets has also prompted energy savings and environmental 
              improvements in the factory's paintshop. The paintshop has been modernised and 
              production has been streamlined in several stages, thus also cutting the 
              consumption of paint and solvents and slashing emissions to the surrounding air. 
              In 1988, solvent emissions to the air were about 70 grams per square metre of 
              cab surface. Today emissions are below 10 grams, which is way below the EU's 
              limit of 55 grams per square metre.</p>
              <p>"We are now the world's cleanest paintshop as regards emissions of solvents 
              to the air, and it is our aim to maintain this lead in the future too," says 
              Anders Olausson, plant director at Volvo Trucks in Umeå. "We intend to continue 
              our drive to be even regarding both environment-impacting emissions and energy 
              consumption. We can see that what we're doing is good for the environment, and 
              also that it leads to better production economy for us," he concludes.</p>

              </span></p><p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>New Scania strategic partnership leads to world premiere for global coach model</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Today at the Busworld exhibition in Kortrijk, Belgium, Scania is launching a new coach: the Scania Touring. The coach is built in partnership with the Chinese bus bodybuilder Higer. Together the two manufacturers will produce buses in China for the world market, which is a first in bus manufacture.<br></strong></p>
              <p>“Scania has found a perfect partner for its global expansion strategy. The partnership with Higer provides Scania with a platform to satisfy the needs of new and existing markets. This also means that Scania Touring will be followed by other models in due course,” says Melker Jernberg, Senior Vice President Scania Buses and Coaches. <br><br>The Scania-Higer cooperation is a purely commercial partnership, where Higer stands for the bodybuilding expertise and Scania provides the chassis and the experience of international customer demands. Jointly with Higer, Scania’s team of stylists have created a coach with a distinct Scania character. <br><br>“Our relationship is a unique pairing of Western and Chinese industry. This is a powerful combination that combined with careful quality control in each step of the production process gives a robust and versatile coach with a quality that can compete with any brand in any markets,” says Mr Jernberg. <br><br>The Scania Touring is a Scania-branded product that is sold and serviced through the global Scania sales and services network. Also, parts supply will be secured via Scania’s regular service network. All in all, this will guarantee world-class product and service quality. <br><br>“We are now concluding preparations for the market introduction in early 2010 and aim to reach an initial annual volume of around 500 units. The sales will start in the central parts of Europe and gradually expand towards the west, south and north. There are also plans for an expansion into the Middle East and Africa, as well as some Asian markets,” concludes Mr Jernberg. <br><br>The Higer operations in Suzhou, Shanghai were established in 1998. With 4,000 employees, overall production capacity is 18,000 buses and coaches per year. Scania's cooperation with Higer started five years ago, and in 2006 a new production line in a separate Scania workshop was built for the assembly of Scania Touring and other forthcoming Scania models. The ultimate annual capacity is 3,000 Scania buses and coaches.</p>

              <p><strong>Scania has been commended by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which represents 475 institutional investors with USD 55,000 billion in assets under management, for its approach to climate change disclosure. <br></strong></p>
              <p>For the first time Scania is featured in CDP’s Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI). This index, a key component of CDP’s annual Nordic 200 Report, highlights the constituent companies within the Nordic 200 Index, which have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance in respect of climate change disclosure practices. Companies are scored on their climate change disclosure and high scores indicate good internal data management and understanding of climate change related issues affecting the company. <br><br>“Low carbon intensity is of increasing importance for all industries. Our customers require products and services that enable them to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 generation. Scania meets these demands by providing fuel-efficient vehicles and engines that can run on renewable fuels, as well as services like training drivers in fuel efficient driving and maintaining vehicles in top shape,” says Scania’s CEO and President Leif Östling. <br><br>“Energy efficiency should be at the heart of every business since it affects the bottom line. At Scania every saved kWh counts, as indicated by a 40 percent reduction in energy use per vehicle produced over the past 10 years. The achievement this last year is a saving of no less than 3,200 tonnes of CO2,” concludes Leif Östling. <br><br>Paul Dickinson, Chief Executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, commented: <br><br>“Companies recognised in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index are rewarded for high quality responses to CDP, which demonstrate a good understanding of how climate change is and will continue to impact their business. Companies which control their risks today, manage their emissions and seize the opportunities to produce low carbon goods and services, will be the best placed to prosper in a low carbon economy of the future.” <br><br>CDLI provides an evaluation tool for institutional investors. It is collected by SIRP (Sustainable Investment Research Platform) at the Umeå School of Business. The index comprises the top scoring twenty of companies in the Nordic 200, based on analysis of the responses to CDP’s 2009 questionnaire, which focused on greenhouse gas emissions, emissions reduction targets and risks and opportunities associated with climate change. <br><br>The Nordic 200 Report including names of companies featured in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index can be found at<a style="color: #0089aa;" href="http://www.cdproject.net/">www.cdproject.net</a>.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Now all Volvo Trucks models for regional and city distribution can be specified with automated transmission. The most recent addition is the Volvo FE which in distribution configuration is now available with Volvo I-Sync. This is part of the company’s drive to strengthen its position in the segment.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I-Sync is a manual gearbox that has been supplemented with software for automatic handling of gearchanges. Just like I-Shift, I-Sync combines the manual gearbox's operating reliability and low weight with the automatic transmission's driving comfort. However, while I-Shift has been developed for heavy transport operations, I-Sync was tailored for local distribution applications. It was launched in the Volvo FL in spring 2008 and has become a major sales success.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"So far, more than one-third of all FL trucks have been delivered with I-Sync. Distribution operations involve a fast pace and repeated stops and starts, and many customers want an automated transmission that offers convenient progress combined with lower fuel consumption. Now we are strengthening our offer by also introducing I-Sync on the larger FE model," says Anders Bellini, Business Area Manager for the Volvo FL and FE at Volvo Trucks.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Optimised for distribution</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the Volvo FE, I-Sync is combined with Volvo's 260 hp 7-litre engine.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"This is an optimal combination for local distribution and shorter regional distribution duties. You get alert response from the engine along with smooth and convenient gearchanging even in frequent stop-start conditions such as close-quarter manoeuvring," says Clara Werner Floberg, Product Manager for the Volvo FL and FE at Volvo Trucks. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since gearchanging is optimised, I-Sync also contributes to good fuel economy and thus also low carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As before, the Volvo I-Shift automated transmission is available on the larger trucks in the Volvo range, the FH16, FH and FM.</p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks took on the hybrid powertrain challenge as early as the 1980s. Years of research, development and testing has led to the cutting edge Volvo FE Hybrid. The solution: parallel hybrid technology using up to 30 percent less fuel.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One of the quintessential sounds of the city is the early-morning rumble of the diesel-powered refuse truck as it stop-starts up the street accompanied by the occasional tinkle of breaking glass from the trash in the compactor. But the backing track to urban life will start to change with the introduction of the hybrid engine.  At low speeds the hybrid truck will replace the diesel's growl with a muted electric hum. The Volvo FE Hybrid, which will be available for distribution trucks and city buses as well as refuse trucks, will be a significant stride forward for environmentally-friendly automotive technology. Besides the considerable noise reductions, the hybrid will reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption by 15-20 per cent depending on the application. Volvo has achieved reductions of up to 30 per cent with a plug-in superstructure for waste compression.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"This is the way forward for inner-city stop-start applications," says Henrik Kloo, who coordinated the Volvo FE Hybrid project for Volvo Trucks. "As fuel prices increase and awareness of climate change grows, everyone is asking what they can do. This is part of the answer."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While the Volvo FE is right at the cutting edge of hybrid technology, the idea of combining an internal combustion engine with an electric motor is nothing new. Indeed, the first patent for a hybrid engine was granted in 1899 to a young inventor by the name of Ferdinand Porsche. Volvo Trucks has been involved with demonstrators and theoretical studies of hybrids since the mid-1980s and has tested various technologies, from mechanical hybrids to hydraulic hybrids to electric hybrids.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In 2002 an advanced engineering project got underway to investigate which sort of hybrid solution would provide the best combination of fuel efficiency, robustness and cost effectiveness.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We ruled out quite a few configurations of hybrids because they were too expensive, and ended up with what is known as a parallel hybrid system, in which you use one electric machine and an automatically-geared mechanical gearbox," says Anders Kroon, who is director of hybrid technology at Volvo Powertrain, the Volvo Group's internal producer of powertrain systems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In 2006 the project resulted in a FM9 hybrid truck, the first test of a parallel hybrid. Unlike the more traditional series hybrid approach, where an electric motor alone drives the wheels and a combustion engine charges the batteries, a parallel hybrid uses either the electric motor or the combustion engine - or both together. There is a normal diesel engine and a gearbox, but in between the clutch and the gearbox sits the electric motor. It is a reliable construction and the diesel and electric motors can be used independently of each other.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"These two power sources work on the same axle through the gearbox and that drives the wheels," says Henrik Kloo. "That means that when you start the truck from standstill you engage the electric motor because it is better when starting off with heavy loads from zero: higher torque at lower revs. Then when you get up to higher speeds the diesel engine is activated and these two work together, or if the control system feels it is better then the diesel engine can take over. When you are running at high speed it behaves like a traditional truck, but at low speeds is behaves more like an electric vehicle." During braking, the electric motor works as an engine brake, reducing brake wear and recovering braking energy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While Volvo Powertrain has developed dozens of diesel engines over the years, the task of coming up with a hybrid solution for large-scale production threw up a number of challenges, several of them connected to the battery and its control system. The battery chosen by Volvo for the Volvo FE Hybrid is a lithium ion battery, with the same chemistry as the batteries found in mobile phones and laptops, but considerably larger - it weighs about 200 kg.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The battery is the Achilles heel in all hybrids throughout the automotive industry," says Kroon. "Even though there has been significant development with nickel metal hydride technology, lithium ion technology and super-capacitors as energy storage, there is still a lot of ground to be covered before we have a completely robust system."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The 600-volt system used in the Volvo FE requires hundreds of lithium ion cells in series. "The challenge is how to manage this to make it act as a robust system," says Kroon. "To handle these kinds of electric energy levels we have incorporated protective systems that shut down the battery and isolate it from the rest of the vehicle in case of an accident or someone doing something wrong when working on the system."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The result is an advanced system which analyses what is happening and takes appropriate action if needed. "It has to happen blisteringly fast and it has to function in all situations," says Kroon. "There are a lot of safety systems around the battery and the entire high-voltage system on board the truck."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As anyone with a three-year-old mobile phone or laptop can testify, lithium ion batteries have a limited lifespan. But Volvo is aiming for a lifespan of up to eight years for its batteries, depending on driving cycle. "That should resemble the lifetime of the truck, maybe with one battery change," says Henrik Kloo. "Here there needs to be a bit of a trade-off as you can have greater fuel savings if you compromise on the lifetime of the battery."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Once the issues surrounding the battery had been solved, the next step was finding suppliers. "This technology is new not just for us but for the supplier structure," says Anders Kroon. As there has been no large-scale production of these batteries, new factories have had to be built. "The major challenge facing the battery industry has been to stabilise production from these new factories to provide good reliability and good productivity to match that of the system integrator who provides us with the energy storage system."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks is currently carrying out field tests with test hybrids in commercial operations together with selected customers. Although considerable progress has been made from the technical viewpoint, the global financial crisis has affected both product development and the haulage industry's investment potential, so small-scale series production of the Volvo FE Hybrid will not get under way until 2012. At the same time, a hybrid solution for long-haul applications is being investigated. Although the potential savings in percentage terms are not as great as for urban stop-start driving, the distances covered mean that considerable emission and fuel consumption reductions are also possible on the open road.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Anders Kroon declares himself extremely happy with the outcome of the Volvo FE Hybrid project. "The result for the customer will be great," he says. "Once functionality and reliability have been proven, we will gain trust for these new technologies. I think the Volvo Group has a great product coming."<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">FACTS</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Here's how the Volvo FE Hybrid works<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></strong>Volvo's solution utilises parallel hybrid technology, which means that the diesel engine and the electric motor can work both together and separately. The electric motor has three tasks: to power the vehicle, to serve as an alternator when the vehicle brakes, and to act as a starter motor to fire up the diesel engine. Energy from braking is used to recharge the batteries. On uphill gradients, the electric motor can step in to assist the diesel engine to provide added power. Peripheral equipment such as the servo pump, air compressor and power take-off, which in a conventional truck are driven by the engine, can in a hybrid use small electric motors instead. This gives greater freedom in positioning the relevant components and they only consume energy when they are actually being used.</p>

              <p><strong>Scania’s new R-series range of trucks has been selected as the International Truck of the Year 2010, the most prestigious distinction in the European truck industry. The jury’s statement cites the aerodynamic design of the R-series, operational economy and the unique support system that spurs the driver to adopt more efficient driving habits.</strong></p>
              <p>“Continuous improvement is one of Scania’s strategic cornerstones, which also pervades our product development work. The fact that the new R-series is being awarded the International Truck of the Year trophy confirms the success of our ambition that every innovation launched by Scania shall contribute to greater productivity, lower operating costs and enhanced driver comfort,” says Scania’s President and CEO Leif Östling. <br><br>“The statement of the jury matches the positive reactions we are now getting from customers. The timing for the new R-series is spot-on,” concludes Mr Östling. <br><br>Jury chairman Gianenrico Griffini comments that “During this extremely challenging time for the entire automotive industry, and especially for Europe’s commercial vehicle manufacturers, Scania has delivered a ‘state-of-the-art’ truck that sets new standards in terms of fuel economy, driveability and overall efficiency.” <br><br>The International Truck of the Year 2010 award will be presented to Scania in December this year. The award is given to the truck model that has made the strongest contribution towards making road transport more efficient during the past 12 months. The statement of the jury, which consists of leading commercial vehicle journalists from 22 European countries, includes the following: <br><br>“Building on the success of the outgoing range – elected Truck of the Year in 2005 – the new R Series impressed the ITOY jury not least due to its continued evolution. <br><br>“In particular, the latest model features a more aerodynamic cab profile that not only reduces fuel consumption but also improves the flow of air through the engine compartment, thereby aiding engine cooling--a factor that will be especially important for the forthcoming, next generation of lower-emission ‘Euro-6’ diesels. Scania’s revised Opticruise automated gear-shifting system, launched on the new R Series, was also rated highly for its faster, smoother and more intelligent shift strategy. <br><br>“The ITOY judges further praised the Swedish manufacturer’s new Driver Support System (developed on the R Series) which was seen by the majority of the jury as an innovative learning tool capable of providing a continuous and pro-active assessment of a driver out on the road, rating their fuel consumption, driving efficiency and overall ‘road craft’ with a simple yet effective ‘star’ rating system which encourages a driver to excel. Last but not least the R Series’ highly-attractive new interior impressed the ITOY jury with its latest dashboard, high level of comfort and ergonomics.” </p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks is now launching an upgrade of the world’s first hybrid refuse truck. After a year and a half of initial field testing with excellent results, an upgraded truck is now being released with new components and software. The new refuse truck will be tested by Veolia Environmental Services in central London.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Up to 30 per cent lower fuel consumption, low emissions and a low noise level make this hybrid a very attractive choice. That's why we're keen to test and develop the technology in partnership with Volvo Trucks, with whom we have developed a very strong working relationship," comments Rob Stubbs, fleet director at Veolia, London and the UK's leading waste management provider. The company has ordered the new refuse truck.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Same concept, new components</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new truck is an upgraded version of the trucks field-tested in Stockholm and Göteborg, Sweden, over the past eighteen months. Like these trucks, the new refuse truck is what is known as a parallel hybrid. This means it has two separate drivelines, one for diesel and one for electricity, which can be used either separately or together. The benefit of this is that each fuel type can be used where it is most fuel-efficient: the electric motor at low revs and the diesel engine at high revs.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The basic concept is the same, but all the components and software have been updated," explains Fredrik Bohlin, Business Manager, Hybrids at Volvo Trucks. "Development is extremely fast, and the technology in our latest test vehicle is much closer to a production-ready solution."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new refuse truck has electric power steering, completely new control systems and refined battery management strategies to optimise the battery performance. Loading and refuse compaction are completely electrically powered by means of a plug-in compactor that is charged via the main electricity grid. The battery is also new, with improved reliability and a longer lifespan.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">According to Fredrik Bohlin, a small-scale series production of the hybrids will start in 2012 at the earliest, which is somewhat later than the original plan. The delay is related to the global financial crisis that has affected both Volvo's product development and customers' investment capacity.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Experience leads to optimised solutions</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The field tests currently underway have given Volvo Trucks' engineers important experience, which will be used when developing the new refuse truck. Making two drivelines work together has proved to be a balancing act.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"For example, if you want to minimise fuel consumption, you can maximise the use of the electrical power unit. However, this reduces battery life. So to achieve an optimal solution, many different properties must be weighed against each other," explains Fredrik Bohlin. "It's all about satisfying high demands for performance, lifespan, fuel consumption and operability."</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Fuel consumption reduced even further</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The initial results from all Volvo hybrid test vehicles show that the prediction of up to 30 percent less fuel and carbon dioxide emissions has been validated. Renova, a waste and recycling company in Göteborg, is among the customers that have been testing Volvo's hybrid refuse truck since spring 2008, and they can report an even greater reduction.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The hybrid has met our expectations and our drivers are highly satisfied," says Lars Thulin, vehicle development manager at Renova. "The electrical power system provides high torque from start-up, low noise level and emission-free loading and refuse compaction. In terms of fuel consumption and climate impact, our measured results are even better than expected. We've achieved reductions of a staggering 35 percent. On a annual basis, the hybrid saves us 5 250 litres of fuel compared to a traditional diesel engine...and we only drive single shifts"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The refuse truck now being delivered to Veolia is not the first Volvo hybrid in London. Six Volvo hybrid buses have been operating on the streets of London since summer 2009.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"This means we already have a very skilled and motivated local service organisation with the specific technical expertise required to service our hybrid vehicles," says Fredrik Bohlin. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"></p>

              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The delivered trucks are powered by Volvo D13 engines with 405 hp and 1450 lb-ft of torque, and Volvo I-Shift automated manual transmissions.  The trucks rank the cleanest trucks in the world, since they are certified without the use of emissions credits.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Talon Logistics is the transportation division of Giant Eagle, Inc., Pittsburgh, a grocery chain with stores in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland. Working with Volvo Trucks, Talon has been a pioneer in field testing advanced emission control technologies.  For the past seven years, the two companies have tested selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems in real world operation in Talon's fleet.  The company also inaugurated Volvo Trucks' EPA'10 customer field testing in September 2007. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">EPA2010 diesel emissions standards are the most stringent in the world requiring near zero-emissions. By using selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to reduce NOx, Volvo meets these standards as well as improves fuel economy and reduces emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2. The use of SCR is already wide spread in Europe among other markets. Volvo Trucks is the first truck manufacturer to have its heavy-duty 11 and 13 liter diesel engines certified for 2010 by both EPA and CARB. </p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">Volvo Trucks will be the first manufacturer with an efficient diesel engine fuelled by a mixture of methane gas and diesel. The engine meets the strict Euro 5 exhaust emission standards introduced in 2009. Field testing will start in Sweden and the UK in 2010. “This unique technology allows us to combine the advantages of gas with the diesel engine’s high efficiency rating, which is about 30-40 percent superior to that of the spark plug engine,” comments Lars Mårtensson, Environmental Director Volvo Trucks. “As a result, this truck consumes considerably less energy than traditional gas trucks do.”</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In August 2007, Volvo Trucks presented no less than seven driveable demo trucks adapted for different biofuels. Following further analysis, the company is now focusing on two renewable fuels: DME and methane gas + diesel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Methane gas is by far the most accessible fuel as an alternative to diesel. There are larger reserves of natural gas than oil. But above all, production of climate-neutral biogas is gaining momentum in many countries, which solves the most urgent problem - reducing CO2 emissions," says Lars Mårtensson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It used to be difficult to use methane gas for long-haul transportation. A truck with a spark ignited engine usually has a restricted range of operation (approximately 150-200 km).  Volvo Trucks solves this problem by combining methane gas with diesel and using this fuel in a diesel engine. This increases the operational range by over 50 percent, but when a liquefied gas is used, with higher energy density, the range will double. In addition, the diesel engine's driveability is better compared to a spark ignited engine.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">How Volvo Trucks' gas truck works</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The solution is based on Volvo's proven, reliable Euro 5 diesel engines. When the engines are converted for gas operation, special tanks are added for either liquid volume-efficient methane gas (LNG/LBG) or pressurised methane gas (CNG/CBG). In addition, a separate fuel system is added with gas injectors in the inlet manifold.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A small amount of diesel is injected and ignited by the compression, which in turn ignites the methane gas/air mixture. This saves the need for a spark plug and allows Volvo to make full use of the efficient diesel technology. As a result, the power and driveability are identical to that of a conventional diesel truck.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Processors continuously calculate fuel ratio according to the driver's current driving pattern. The optimum - i.e. the highest - proportion of gas is achieved during smooth, stable driving," explains Lars Mårtensson.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If the gas runs out, the truck can continue operating on only diesel. This is unique to Volvo's technology and makes this system a realistic option for many customers, even in areas where the gas distribution network is underdeveloped.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Field testing to optimise technology</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The amount of diesel required during operation varies, but Volvo Trucks aims to minimise the proportion of diesel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"We expect to be able to run on up to 80 percent methane gas once the technology has been refined and tested," says Mats Franzén, Manager Engine Strategy and Planning, Volvo Trucks. "Our field tests in 2010 will start with a mixture containing up to 70 percent methane gas. The remainder will consist of bio-mix diesel, i.e. fossil diesel mixed with diesel produced from renewable raw materials."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Calculated over the whole fuel chain, from production to use on roads, the new technology could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 percent in the long term compared to traditional diesel operation, if biogas and 100 percent biodiesel are used.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Strong interest from the market</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There are two main factors driving the increased market demand for gas-powered trucks. One is cost savings. Methane gas is currently a relatively cheap fuel in many markets. For example, Volvo Trucks' technology already offers a profitable fuel option for trucks undertaking long daily transport jobs and returning to the same filling station.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The other driving factor stems from the strict environmental regulations in many towns and cities, playing a crucial role in purchasing decisions, particularly in municipal companies. Volvo Trucks maintains a dialogue with several fuel companies to ensure that filling stations are constructed to keep pace with the increasing number of vehicles out on the roads. This will prepare the ground for broad market introduction in the future. To optimise and refine the technology, Volvo Trucks is also collaborating with technology companies Clean Air Power, Hardstaff Group and Westport.</p>

              <p>
              </p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px;">A truck’s axles are subjected to immense stress and strain every day, year after year. To ensure they are rugged enough to withstand the toughest situations without having to over-dimension them, Volvo Trucks is using an entirely new test rig for wheel axles in its product development. It is the largest of its kind in the world and can handle full-scale tests of axle assemblies up to 32-tonne bogies, making it unique in the truck world.</div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The new test rig is located at Volvo's facility in Göteborg, Sweden. In the space of a mere few weeks, it can simulate the stresses and strains that truck is subjected to throughout its entire lifetime. Equivalent tests took four times longer in the previous test rig.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The tests that we can now perform in six to ten weeks with the new rig used to take six to eight months, and involved testing the vehicles out on the track. The new rig also gives us better-quality test results," says Göran Johansson, manager of test operations at Volvo.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Quality assurance is a crucial and time-consuming part of Volvo Trucks' development and quality work. The entire product development phase has been shortened since important test operations can be conducted in just weeks instead of months. In the new test rig, it is also possible to carry out more advanced tests early in the product development cycle. The tests are one stage of product development for next-generation axle assemblies designed to optimise the vehicle's all-round construction.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"Optimisation is all about ensuring that customers can depend on the truck's various systems always functioning correctly, while simultaneously ensuring that the systems do not weigh or cost too much due to over-dimensioning," explains Göran Johansson.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Complex simulation of reality</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">To succeed in this equation, it is necessary to be able to test the various systems in complex cycles, and with considerable precision. In Volvo's new test rig, the entire axle assembly is subjected to vertical and horizontal forces as well as torque applied to the wheels. All this force and torque can be simulated individually and simultaneously. During the course of the test, input data can be gathered from more than a hundred measurement points. To achieve the required degree of simulation precision, the parameters in the test rig's control electronics can be updated more than 1,000 times a second.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The tests are run in real time; the axles are subjected to the same stresses and strains that occur in daily truck operation, only far more frequently. There are several basic programs for the various test cycles - long-haul, distribution operations and construction duties. Furthermore, the test cycles can be individually tailored for special driving conditions within each respective transport segment. The various test programs are based on the readings obtained from customer vehicles driven on the test track.</p>
              <h2 style="font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The world's largest test rig</h2>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.4em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Volvo's new test rig is the largest of its kind in the world and can handle full-scale tests of axle assemblies up to 32-tonne bogies, making it unique in the truck world. Large assemblies involve immense forces, so the rig is massively dimensioned. The test rig itself weighs 220 tonnes and stands on a concrete block (seismic base) weighing almost 1,000 tonnes. This block in turn rests on air cushions that absorb the test rig's reaction forces so as to shield the building in which the tests are performed. </p>

              <p><strong>The Scania Driver Competitions 2010 launch this week, starting a year long search across 28 countries to find the world’s best truck drivers. Over 45,000 drivers are expected to enter throughout the year. <br></strong></p>
              <p>Scania initiated the competitions in 2003, initially in Europe. They have since spread into a global campaign to highlight the importance of the skills and professionalism of drivers, as well as of driver training and development to enhance road safety awareness and eco-driving proficiency. <br><br>As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of heavy trucks and buses, Scania wants to demonstrate its commitment and responsibility to building a sustainable, robust and profitable global transport system that benefits all. To achieve this, the skills and attitude of the driver are critical. <br><br>“The driver is the single most important factor for economy, environment and safety. Skilled and committed drivers will deliver energy efficient transport, reduce emissions and contribute towards safer roads,” says Leif Östling, President and CEO, Scania. <br><br>“We set up the Scania Driver Competitions to put the spotlight on the drivers, celebrate their skills and highlight their valuable contribution to society. By this we aim to raise driver status and attract more young people into the profession.” <br><br>Platform for road safety discussions <br>The Scania Driver Competitions are once again being strongly supported by sponsors and partners. In Europe the competition is being sponsored by Michelin and endorsed by the European Commission and the International Road Transport Union (IRU). With this support Scania aims to raise awareness of some of the key issues affecting the global transport industry with a series of seminars and initiatives throughout 2010. <br><br>“The Scania Driver Competitions provide an ideal platform to discuss and address issues that help cut road accidents and increase profitability and sustainability within the industry,” says Erik Ljungberg, Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations, Scania. <br><br>Over the next few months driver competitions will be launching in countries as diverse as Australia, Malaysia, Brazil and South Africa, as well as across Europe. <br><br>Eighteen countries will host their own Young European Truck Driver competition (YETD 2010), the European version of the Scania Driver Competitions. Winners of each national YETD competition will then go on to compete for the overall YETD title at a European Final in Södertälje, Sweden on 8-9 October 2010. <br>Professional drivers who have the skills and determination to meet the challenges of the competition are being urged to enter via<a style="color: #0089aa;" href="http://www.scania.com/drivercomp">www.scania.com/drivercomp</a> and then click onto their country specific competition website for registration. <br><br>Taking part in the competition gives drivers an unforgettable experience. Not only is it an invaluable opportunity to improve driving skills, increase road safety awareness and energy efficiency, it’s also a great chance to meet other drivers and become part of a global driver community. For those who have the winning combination of exceptional driving skills, stamina, professional pride and a positive attitude, there is also the chance to become a champion.</p>

              <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">
              </span></span></p><div class="articleText_intro" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px; font-weight: bold;">In February, Volvo Trucks will be starting field tests of methane-diesel engines. The technology will be tested in commercial operation together with a number of Swedish customers. “We are doing this so as to offer the market a superior combination of environmental properties, energy efficiency, driveability and low maintenance costs,” says Gunnar Ekwall, product manager for Volvo Trucks in the Nordic region.</div>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">The first seven customers participating in the field test are Borås Energi &amp; Miljö, Ragn-Sells Sollentuna, Schenker-TGM Göteborg, Slaka Potatis Linköping, Svebol Logistics/Lidl Tumba, Viebke Åkeri Helsingborg and XR Miljöhantering Skövde. The eighth truck in the field test programme will be placed with a selected customer in the next few days. The trucks involved are two Volvo 7-litre models, the Volvo FL and Volvo FE.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">Increasing demand for better gas powered trucks</p>
              </strong>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">As the network of biogas stations continues to expand, the market is showing far greater interest in better gas-powered vehicles. With the unique technology that Volvo Trucks has chosen, the diesel engine runs on a mixture of methane gas and diesel oil. As a result, the benefits of gas power are combined with the diesel engine's roughly 35 percent higher efficiency rating compared with an engine using spark plug ignition. The truck thus consumes far less energy than conventional gas-powered trucks.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">Energy-efficiency and reliability</p>
              </strong>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">"In addition to lower fuel consumption, methane diesel technology also brings higher reliability and lower maintenance costs. What is more, the driver can always continue driving on diesel fuel alone, if no gas is available. This makes it a practical and realistic alternative for many customers even in areas where the gas distribution infrastructure is not yet fully in place," explains Gunnar Ekwall.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Volvo Trucks' FL/FE gas powered trucks work</span></p>
              <ul class="unindentedList" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
              <li style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; padding: 0px; list-style-image: url(http://newsandmedia.volvotrucks.com/Images/dir_smallRt.gif);">The solution is based on Volvo's proven, reliable Euro 5 diesel engines. When the engines are converted for gas operation, special tanks are added for pressurised methane gas (CNG/CBG). In addition, a separate fuel system is added with gas injectors in the inlet manifold. The trucks are converted for methane-diesel power in cooperation with Stadspartner using Hardstaff technology.</li>
              <li style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; padding: 0px; list-style-image: url(http://newsandmedia.volvotrucks.com/Images/dir_smallRt.gif);">A small amount of diesel is injected and ignited by the compression, which in turn ignites the methane gas/air mixture. This saves the need for a spark plug and allows Volvo to make full use of the efficient diesel technology. As a result, the power and driveability are identical to that of a conventional diesel truck.</li>
              <li style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; padding: 0px; list-style-image: url(http://newsandmedia.volvotrucks.com/Images/dir_smallRt.gif);">The amount of diesel required during operation varies, but Volvo Trucks aims to minimise the proportion of diesel.</li>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.4em; padding: 0px;">Both natural gas and biogas consist of methane. The difference is that natural gas is a fossil fuel, whereas biogas is produced from biodegradable material such as waste.</p>

              <p class="summary" style="margin: 15px 110px 15px 0px; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">With the new R-series, “Scania has delivered a ‘state-of-the-art’ truck that sets new standards in terms of fuel economy, driveability and overall efficiency,” said jury chairman Gianenrico Griffini when he presented the International Truck of the Year 2010 award to Scania in a ceremony at the company’s research and development centre in Södertälje, Sweden.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-size: 12px;">The International Truck of the Year award is given each year to the truck model that has made the strongest contribution towards making road transport more efficient. The award, which was established in 1977, is the most prestigious accolade in the trucking world. The jury consists of leading commercial vehicle journalists from 22 European countries.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px; font-size: 12px;">Scania’s new R-series, which was unveiled in September 2009, has been very well received in the industry. In addition to the International Truck of the Year 2010 title, for example, the Scania R 480 model won by a wide point margin in the extensive comparative 1000 Point Test organised by the German commercial vehicle trade press, whose results were recently published in several European trade magazines.</p>
