Calling yourself lim peiÂ… and calling others ke poh ji.... Please refrain from name calling because it definitely highlight the fibre of your character.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huaqing:</div><div class="quote_body">ask church leaders la...i am not so pro one mah...<br><br>btw dun try to create a mess here...this is a Christian forum, not a Catholic forum!</div></blockquote>Discussion of Mary,  of for that matter any Bible person,  is a Christian topic,  therefore,  it is correct to have it here. On the flip side,  discussion of,  say,  Prophet Mohammad or Mao Tse Tung  or Gautama Buddha will be out of place.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by loveholyspirit:</div><div class="quote_body">According to the Gospels, Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, a virgin, by a miracle of the Holy Spirit. The Gospel of Luke gives an account of the angel Gabriel visiting Mary to tell her that she was chosen to bear the son of God (Luke 1:26-2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. Catholics call this the Annunciation. Joseph, Mary's betrothed husband, appears only in stories of Jesus' childhood. With Jesus commending Mary into the care of John the Apostle during his crucifixion, it is likely that Joseph had died by the time of Jesus' ministry.<br><br>Mary remained a perpetual virgin, thus having no biological children.<br><br>Its just like Step-Mum and things like that. God used Mary the both to conceive Jesus, so the mother refered is as the person responsible for bring up Jesus.<br></div></blockquote>Galatians 1:19 saw none of the other apostlesÂ—only James, the Lord's brother. Paul specifically stated that James is JesusÂ’ brother. Other people around Jesus are called disciples,  and in some cases,  apostles. Of course you may wish to highlight the actual word in Greek to substantiate your claim.<br><br>According to Scripture,  at the time of birth of Christ,  Mary was indeed a virgin. There is NO record of Mary remaining in the virginal state. Again, if you have any prove showing otherwise,  please do so - from the Bible, not from Discovery, CNBC, CNN  whatever.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by loveholyspirit:</div><div class="quote_body">Notice this, questions keep coming after i provide at least a solution.
