The Roman Catholic Church does not consider her divine either, although she is highly venerated.<br><br>As a Protestant, I do not agree with the RCC's stand on a few doctrines, such as the Immaculate Conception of Mary (1854) and the Assumption of Mary (1950), for example. I do not find the Scriptural basis convincing at all.<br><br>As for her role in intervention, Catholics believe she can pray for us in the way you can ask your friend or pastor to pray for you. Catholics do not see death as a final event that prevents you from asking someone to intercede for you. Thus they believe they can ask long departed saints to pray for them.<br><br>There is a relatively recent movement to consider Mary as playing a crucial role in redemption along with Jesus. That move to make Mary a co-Redemptrix is supported by various people including Mother Teresa but the previous Pope had resisted that move. If the RCC make Mary Co-Redemptrix that will indeed be a major doctrinal departure from the rest of Christiandom and will raise questions of her divinity.<br><br>But at the moment, no....Mary is not divine, even as seen through Catholic eyes.<br></div>

My point of argument is merely from the scriptural angle whereby the gospels, plus a couple of other verses, state clearly the Mary is the mother of Jesus. The moment we get beyond that, than we will be stepping into the realm of the unknowns - then there is no answer.<br><br>But to humour you - why Mary? for that matter why woman? For the reason, only a woman can bear a human child? Then your point about DNA may not hold too much water afterall, seeing that the foetus will require the various conditions found solely in the human embryo (my medical terms are a bit rusty). Like you said, scripture is silent over this, but scripture is NOT silent about Mary's relationship with Jesus, one of mother and son.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Interested to know if that is what the thread starter means...<br></div></blockquote>I am too, but the newly promoted moderator is also very silent on this. All the mods can offer are just emotive postulating, ranging from just a mere "I don't believe" or "read the Bible" to an outright deletion of of threads. Doesn't this show a complete lack of knowledge of scripture plus the inability to answer any questions. It also shows a complete lack of maturity for these moderators to take on this role.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">As for his/her assertion that Mary was a perpetual virgin, that goes against the Bible's description of James who chaired the Jerusalem council as the brother of Jesus (Acts 15).

I also find it strange that the opinions of the moderator/s have no scriptural backing, are at best weird, at worst heretic.<br><br>Lesson to the moderators, have a good read at oxford mushroom's writing. His is a good way to present an opposing view, something that neither of you are capable of.</div>
