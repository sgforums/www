              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HDB launches almost 7,000 new flats in May sales exercise</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has launched 6,992 flats for sale under the May 2018 Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise, it said in a press release on Tuesday (May 22).<br><br>Of the total, 3,970 are BTO units and 3,022 are SBF units across various towns and estates, HDB added.</p>
              <p><strong>BTO EXERCISE</strong><br><br>The BTO flats are spread across four projects - two of which are in the non-mature towns of Sengkang and Yishun and another two in the mature towns of Toa Payoh and Tampines.<br><br>Eligible first-timer families can enjoy up to S$80,000 of housing grants, comprising the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) (up to S$40,000) and the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) (up to S$40,000). <br><br>"With these grants, buyers of 2-room Flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats could pay as little as S$4,000, S$112,000, S$196,000 and S$330,000 respectively," HDB said.</p>
              <p><strong>SBF EXERCISE</strong><br><br>In addition to the BTO flats, HDB will also offer 3,022 balance flats under the SBF exercise. <br><br>"They comprise 754 units of 2-room Flexi, 655 units of 3-room, 1,143 units of 4-room, 305 units of 5-room, 157 units of 3Gen and 8 units of executive flats across various towns/estates," HDB said.<br><br>The majority of the flats offered under the SBF exercise are reserved for first-timer families. Eligible first-timer singles may also apply for a 2-room flexi flat in non-mature towns. <br><br>Application for new flats launched in the May 2018 BTO and SBF exercises can be submitted online on the HDB InfoWEB from May 22 until May 28, HDB said.<br><br>HDB said it will offer about 4,300 flats in Punggol and Yishun in August 2018.</p>
              <p>Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday that the launch would help young couples - those who are still studying or serving National Service (NS), as well as those who have just completed their studies or NS - to buy their first homes sooner. <br><br>"We will allow them to defer their income assessment for housing grants and loan purposes," he said in the Facebook post.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong first announced the deferment of income assessment in March in Parliament, saying that the Government can "exercise some flexibility to support (young couples) in their marriage and parenthood journey". <br><br>These couples will be able to apply for their flat first, then have their incomes assessed for grants or loans just before key collection. <br><br>Mr Wong added that while waiting for the flat to be ready, couples can start working to build up their finances. <br><br>"With the various flat types and locations to choose from, I hope all home-buyers will be able to find a home that meets their budget and needs," said Mr Wong.</p>
