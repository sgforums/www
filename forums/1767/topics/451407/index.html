              Board (HDB) clinch its first international award for environmental 
              sustainability on Friday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The HDB said it was 
              awarded the Grand Prize for Excellence in Environmental Engineering in 
              the environmental sustainability category, presented by the prestigious 
              American Academy of Environmental Engineers (AAEE). </span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>My Waterway@Punggol,
               also known to some as the Venice of Singapore, is the only Asian winner
               for the Grand Prize under the Environmental Sustainability Category.<br><br>It won the award five months after it was launched.<br><br>The award ceremony was held in Washington DC on Thursday.<br><br>HDB's
               Deputy CEO (Building), Mr Sng Cheng Keh, said: "Right from the start, 
              we wanted to build a green, sustainable waterway, and using green 
              construction methods too. We are glad to have achieved both objectives.<br><br>"Winning
               this award is testament to Singapore's small contribution towards being
               responsible global citizens by constructing an environmentally-friendly
               waterway." <br><br>The HDB said the waterway has winning features such 
              as eco-drains to ensure surface runoff is cleansed before entering the 
              waterway.<br><br>It also has aerators, jet fountains and water curtains to enhance water quality. <br><br>The
               waterway was constructed using green practices. One of them was a 
              "cut-and-fill" method of excavation to fill the low-lying areas around 
              the waterway.<br><br>Earth excavated from the waterway was re-used to prepare surrounding low-lying areas for future developments.<br><br>Features such as the boardwalks, footbridges and areas around the plaza were built with recycled materials.<br><br>The
               HDB said the waterway is an outstanding example of a vibrant and 
              sustainable town with social communal spaces integrated seamlessly along
               the waterway. <br><br>It took efforts to preserve the memories and 
              heritage from old Singapore by artistically weaving in pieces of 
              history, such as the Kelong Bridge that captures the stilt houses of the
               past.<br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>
