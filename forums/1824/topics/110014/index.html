Considering that the human genome project has a very very very long way to go before anyone comes close to mapping every single gene, you cant prove that homosexuals arent born.<br><br>How about i tell you what i believe?  I believe that singapore is so fuckin gawddamned narrow minded that they segregate chicks and dicks in school.  of course in the bloody end, you get girls thinking that guys are dirty buggers, and guys thinking that girls are friggin biatches.<br><br>Im assuming that you adore the singaporean system and shower it with love and care, so why cant you accept what it breeds?<br><br>Why do you want homosexuals to be led "into the mainstream of society"?  Its all about conforming to rules and being a uniformed nation now isnt it?  You just want the whole gawddamned world to conform to your 'ideal beliefs'?</div>

I believe most bigots are not born one. the same can't be said of gays. I have many gay friends(both male n female) who did not have bad childhood experiences, all that happened was that all along they felt no attraction to the opposite sex and attraction to members of the same sex. By ignoring these cases and simply "believe" that most have had bad childhood experiences that made them gay, is just being too lazy to think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who cares if it is a preference or not. Discriminating against a person simply because they prefer to do things some other way is just wrong. Its not like anybody is hurt.<br><br>Re the argument that homosexuality harms society, how exactly does two guys going at each other up the arse harm anyone? All it results in is sore asses. Put another way: I fail to see how peter and john at #03-02 affects Jack and Jill at #05-03.<br><br>I think this discussion will boil down to the issue of Is the Concept of Marriage Outdated?<br><br>EDIT: If anyone wants to have sex with their pets, i'm uncomfortable with that idea, but i won't say they are "immoral". However, i do realize that my discomfort is not due to any innate sense of morality, but due to years of social conditioning.<br>Imo, the tabooing of sex with anything other than females is due to the fact that those sexual encounters have no chance of producing offspring. As such, if the "tribe" is to survive, sex should be with a woman. Its got nothing to do with morality. Under this argument then, once these is no threat to the survival of the species, the rules become obsolete and ought to be discarded. I'm sure you agree that the human race is in no danger of dying out due to underpopulation at anytime soon....</div>
