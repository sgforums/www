They don't work to get what they deserve. The society here pretty much don't give a damn about anything. A tug and a bone makes you king.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But what kind of education are gahment giving ppl?</span><br>IMO, basic useless stuff. As a result, the kids don't know what they want/to do in life. Just anyhow choose a course even tho they don't like it. And did I mention their general knowledge simply sux? So what if you can recite the periodic table backwards? If I get a dollar everytime I hear, "really meh?" , "i didn't know that" or some stupid qns... man, I might be sitting in Atlantis sipping a pina colada right now.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are we teaching ppl the right things? </span><br>Sure. We had ME(Moral Education) right? But who actually listens and abides them? Society influences and moulds its people into what they are. I've to say I'm lucky enough to fall out of the crib last time. Teaching alone is not enough, guidance have to be brought in.<br><br>And all these does not contributes to the lack of babies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Lack of babies = Lack of love.<br><br>~Where is the love?~<br><br>Anyways, 'Jack of all trades, master of none'.
