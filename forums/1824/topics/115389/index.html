Maybe the reason I didn't smoke as much as many sticks as most.<br><br>But anyway, those pple who are HEAVY smokers, I seriously do no advise to stop smoking immediately but instead cut down slowly. Cos your body system can't take the immediate change of "fresh" air. I have seen too many pple who are heavy smokers cut down suddenly and some died within months as their body system goes haywire...while some are literally sick.<br><br></div>
