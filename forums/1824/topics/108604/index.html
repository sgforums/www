Many SG employers are very very demanding and violent to their maids. Perhaps they are venting out their frus or stress on these poor maids.<br><br>However, to be fair, we must also realise that maids are foreigners with different cultural backgrounds, we dont really understand them, their educational levels, the way they think etc. Coupled with the fact that they might be mentally stressed or depressed to work in a foreign land, some maids might do crazy stuff even if their employers are nice to them.  There's no guarantee that being a nice boss, your maid will not do crazy stuff - we dont even understand how they think or the stress they have. Some of them cant even think rationally. I consider them to be very dangerous... they handle your food, drinks, your kids and grandparents maybe... dunno what they will suddenly do one fine day... scary....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

We find work in a company, and we can only pray that our employer is a good one and treats us well, if they don't, who is to blame? They're on a bond, they can't quit.<br><br>Its also in our culture to be kiasu. Since we have already paid money for the maid to do things, might as well as her to do as much as possible. Curtains that haven't been washed for years, are now being washed twice a month, etc.<br><br>Not to mention our local aunties, have you ever seen the bad side of some of them? *shivers*<br><br>But i guess its better than staying at their native country, where they can't find work, or work for less than SGD$100 a month.<br><br>Its all a big gamble actually..</div>

We dont know much about the maid's background. it's safe to bet that they think very much differently, some of them might not even think rationally.<br><br>sometimes after mixing with other maids, they get funny ideas. they may spread rumours or superstitious ideas on how to 'curb' your boss, etc, and actually do crazy stuff like adding extras to your food or drink - even if the boss has been good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
