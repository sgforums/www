            <div class='col-md body'>Why stop the casino???? The casino is not directed at us local Singaporeans, it's directed at the tourist.... and the rich..<br>You would have to pay $100 entrance fee to get in, only the rich and the tourist are allowed, so why are we against it???<br>And talk about gambling, i think it's all filled with hypocrites, if any of you want to stop gambling, then can you tell me you haven't betted in soccer before, or maybe gamble during Chinese New Year among your friends???<br>A person wants to gamble, they can gamble in anyway they want here, by horse racing, among friends, mahjong, soccer betting. They probably are not going to pay $100 on going inside a casino..<br>And talk about it, i don't like people who put morals and values into the picture, so if any of you think Singaporeans are so high in these values becos we don't have casinos, so you are saying that foreigners in countries like USA, Europe etc etc have no morals and values????<br>What have the casino there really done to those countries???<br>Let me tell you what it actually have seen since i've been abroad=&gt;<br>It has simply robbed more money of us Singaporeans, simply becos we Chinese are the ones that like to gamble. There were foreigners there, but they didn't bet that much, most of those sitting on the table are Chinese either from Singapore, Malaysia, HK, Taiwan etc...<br>Why should we let our money be given to foreign countries, why can't we pull it in??? All those lies about moral and values are just a prohibitance to what really is going to happen, i see no connection at all. I know someone who just lost his job becos of stealing due to gambling, and the casino hasn't been built yet. The casino would make minimal difference....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Snowflag,<br>1st thing that come across my head is this=&gt;<br>Will you stop judging others as immatured just becos their viewpoints differ from yours??? That's is the first 'Square' barrier that you would have to break....<br>I'm over 3x, probably older than you and have been around the world, if you want to know..<br>Your dad is a compulsive gambler and you suffer the hit of it, so you are probably antagonised by the casino issue, venting to put a stop to it. But did you realise that the casino hasn't been built and your dad is already a gambling addict!!! Then, do we need the casino to instigate gambling at all????<br>Is your dad going to pay $100 to enter in???<br>The reality of the situation is that gambling is already a part and puzzle of life in someway, where are we going to move on from there. You can't stop the compulsive gamblers from gambling, HK movies are already entertaining 'Du Shen' and many other gambling shows. A casino ain't going to make a difference other than channel more wealth to our country.<br>If the facts can't be seen, then let life show us the reality, if your dad is already facing the addiction, then he has to learn from the bitter lesson to learn, by blocking and banning doesn't curb his desires, by letting him go free then he can learn. Don't you know that people find things they cannot get more desirable, if they can get it, they wouldn't yearn for it as much. This is always the case, it's like a reverse psychology thingy.<br>As far as i can see, the casino is still for tourist, not your father anyway.... he'll probably still be going to Genting.<br>And if you want to know, i'm not a gambler.<br><br></div>
