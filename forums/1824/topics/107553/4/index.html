Btw, the regulars don't pay for the cruise and they eat free there as well, just because of the money they are handing over to the cruise companies. There is no stopping of hardcore gamblers.<br><br>I think the effects the casino have won't be that great on the current gamblers. It just offers them an alternative venue. Of course there will the recreational gambler and people who won't even bother to step into the casino.<br><br>I also don't think that having a casino means we are saying it is ok to gamble. If this is the case, legalising soccer betting means it is ok to gamble, and we should not have upgraded the Turf club and we should also get rid of 4D and Toto and make playing mahjong illegal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Problem being many people here lack self-control and the idea of responsible behavior.The majority of society knows not the meaning of saving and taking charge of what they do.They have a very short-term outlook regarding finances.We are not a people that has the ability to really look and tell ourselves that enough is enough.How often have we seen the sin of gluttony and greed show itself in the day to day lives of the population? </blockquote>Actually, Singaporeans are not too lack of self-control as compared with foreigners, in fact, we are probably too self-controlled. We lived in a very controlled environment, no to this, no to that, compared with other countries. Are you saying that we are worst of than other countries in our self-control???<br><br><blockquote>Having supported the casino, will you also play at the casino. if not, aren't you a hypocrite? </blockquote>I was in overseas for many years, where there was a casino which i could get in without paying. I was never a gambling enthusiast, so all i did was play a little, like 20-30 dollars once in a while. But that's not the reason i support the casino, i mentioned it's for tourist, not us. That i believe will increase our national finances.<br>And as i was with many friends, including malaysians and singaporeans overseas, i often went there just to look and see, like the rest of my friends. There were some within our group that will gamble more, but still with much self-control. And as for paying $100, i don't think my group of friends will do that. In case you didn't notice, there are many people who are in control of themselves as well, don't keep highlighting those few who are not in control. Don't tell me when you gamble, you go out of control????<br>There seems though a reckless behavior in those hardcore gamblers though, many of them i knew also race on motorcycles or deal with some gangsterism. These smaller percentage tend to get themselves into trouble somehow, so i don't think gambling is the only factor. However, these friends i knew who were like that have matured over the years and are now having their own businesses.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Dear Leader PM Lee Hsien Loong &amp; Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pang Howe said, times have changed. We now have to be flexible and adjust our way of lives.<br><br>Three years ago the 4 mega casino companies namely, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Venetian &amp; Wynn Resorts from Las Vegas were invited to Macau to develope 4 integrated resort casinos. They invested in the region of 6-7 billions US Dollars. Their projections were to get their investments back in 3-5 years, but to their surprise they got their investments back in 6 months.<br><br>The mainland Chinese wealth and their gambling habits are phenomenal. If we don't seize this opportunity to tap this source of revenue, our neighbours Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia will be more than happy to do so.<br><br>Just last week it was reported in the Straits Times that the world's 2nd largest hard disk manufacturer, Maxtor are shifting their operations to China. In the coming months you can expect to read more of such news. We just can't compete with China's cheap labour, land &amp; resources.<br><br>Without one or two integrated resorts/casino in S'pore, our tourism arrival will stagnate at its present level of 7-8 million visitors a year. Don't forget these figures include the huge number of foreign workers who arrive to work in S'pore.<br><br>Las Vegas 50 years ago was a desert town of 2,000 population. Today it's tourists arrival is in the region of 38 - 40 millions a year and it's the fastest growing city (current population - about 2.5 million) with the lowest crime rates in the US.<br><br>S'pore is strategically located to attract gamblers from the region. Also we have the infrastructure, logistics &amp; commuincation to support an international casino operations.<br><br>Giving our tourism a boost would also help the growth of our National Airline, SIA which otherwise has also reached its stagnation point.<br><br>Instead of worrying about whether casino will be set up or not, I suggest that we should focus our attention on investing our money on Temasek listed companies who are in JV with the mega casino companies bidding for the casino development.<br><br>To the successful operators &amp; S'pore it's a sure win-win situation. Gambling taxes in Macau has been levied at 40%, while in S'pore it's only 15%.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Casino employment blames for high school dropout in Macau  </strong><br>24/2/2005<br><br>Macau's education authorities have observed a sharp fall in the number of students in high schools, and held an increasing number of casinos to blame for the serious dropout phenomenon.<br>According to the latest figures from the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau, there were 95,485 students enrolled in Macau's 89 schools offering compulsory education in the new semester, which indicated a loss of 2,777 students over the corresponding period of last year.<br>Sou Chio Fai, director of the bureau was quoted by Thursday's Macau Daily acknowledging high school dropout problem was the primary cause to the decrease in addition to the dwindling number of birth rate.<br>The bureau estimated that some hundreds high school students left school to pursue jobs in casinos last year, when four casinos came on stream offering thousands of job opportunities.<br>Teachers in Macau held that it was a foreseeable result that the students were wooed by "fast-earning" money in casinos, since the government has designated the gaming industry as the city's economic backbone. However, they advised the students to take a more prudent thought, because it would more difficult to obtain an on-the-job training or advanced education after students walk into society than studying in school.<br>Currently, 56,008 students in school are enjoying compulsory education free of charges, which cost 425 million patacas (US$53 million) of the Macau Special Administrative Region ( SAR)government's budget last year.<br></div>
