            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Something to ponder about its effects on the world economy</span><br><br><strong>'Costliest' natural disaster</strong><br><br>Millions face hazardous future, says UN emergency relief coordinator<br><br>Tuesday Â• December 28, 2004<br><br>UNITED NATIONS Â— The earthquake and tidal wave that raced from South-east Asia to East Africa on Sunday shattered millions of lives and may be the costliest natural disaster in history with a price tag reaching billions of dollars, the UN emergency relief coordinator said yesterday.<br><br>Tens of thousands of people have been killed, injured or are missing, hundreds of thousands have lost everything, and millions face a hazardous future because of polluted drinking water, a lack of sanitation and no health services, Undersecretary-General Jan Egeland told a news conference.<br><br>The UN humanitarian chief, who is also in charge of emergency relief, said an enormous relief effort was on its way to countries affected by the earthquake and the wall of water it spawned. He urged people everywhere to be especially generous at the holiday season and open their wallets to help the millions who have lost everything, saying many of the richest countries were "far too stingy" in helping the poorest.<br><br>While the tidal wave was not the biggest in recorded history, Mr Egeland said, "the effects may be the biggest ever because many more people live in exposed areas than ever before" as a result of the population explosion in the last 50 years in countries around the Indian Ocean.<br><br>In order of magnitude, he said, the hardest-hit countries are Indonesia which was closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, the Maldives where one-third of the islands have reportedly disappeared under water, Malaysia, Myanmar and Bangladesh. East African countries along the Indian Ocean have also been affected, he said.<br><br>The International Red Cross reported 23,700 deaths and said it was concerned that waterborne diseases like malaria and cholera could add to the toll.<br><br>The United Nations knew of 16,000 confirmed deaths but Mr Egeland said the toll "must be bigger", citing communities with 10,000 to 20,000 people that have not been heard from, including areas of Sumatra, Indonesia, closest to the earthquake's epicentre.<br><br>"We may only know the full effects of this tremendous emergency in weeks from now," Mr Egeland said, stressing that "more and more disasters" are being uncovered as rescue officials reach new places.<br><br>The unfolding disaster may be the costliest in history, probably "many billions of dollars", he said.<br><br>Hurricane Mitch in 1998 "is probably the most comparable disaster" because it affected millions of poor people in Central America, Mr Egeland said. "The cost of that was estimated by the World Bank to be US$5 billion. I am confident, unfortunately, that this will be bigger."<br><br>"We cannot fathom the loss," he said. "Most of those who have lost their livelihoods were poor people with very little reserves of any kind."<br><br>Two dozen UN disaster experts are heading to the affected countries and have already arrived in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.<br><br>UN relief officials met in Geneva yesterday with senior officials from the Red Cross and non-government organisations to coordinate emergency international assistance, Mr Egeland said.<br><br>"A lot of aircraft are being loaded. Some are already airborne and going to hardest-hit countries like Sri Lanka ... Many search and rescue teams are on the way," he said. "I estimate that there will be hundreds of relief aircraft from two dozen countries within the next 48 hours, just from indications we have."<br><br>What has been done so far by the countries themselves Â— civil defence, military, police, social workers, local authorities, the Red Cross and non-government organisations Â— to help victims has "been clearly remarkable", Mr Egeland said.<br><br>He stressed that national disaster relief efforts "are much, much better organised than they were just a few years ago". But he said there was no warning system in the Indian Ocean for tidal waves.<br><br>Local and national efforts must now be coordinated with the international response, with one government ministry in charge and incoming aid flights coordinated to avoid unsolicited aid and give priority to desperately needed items including water and sanitation equipment.<br><br>Mr Egeland complained that none of the world's richest countries gives 1 per cent of its gross national product to international assistance. Many give just 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent, he said.<br><br>"We were more generous when we were less rich," he said. "And it is beyond me why we are so stingy, really."<br><br>Fifty-two nations contributed to help victims of last year's earthquake in Bam in south-eastern Iran and he expressed hope that Asian and Gulf nations with growing economies would join the global response to the latest disaster.
