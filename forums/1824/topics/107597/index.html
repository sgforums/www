The risk is still for a much stronger decline in the IT sector than we expect. If it does, then it will have a big impact on the potential growth in Singapore and the rest of the region which is heavily dependent on electronics," said analyst Sani Hamid.<br><br>And there are also questions over the highly volatile pharmaceutical sector.<br><br>In recent months, output in this sector has been erratic as manufacturers shut down plants for maintenance and product changes.<br><br>Even though the biomedical sector has a very significant effect on headline GDP, economists say it will have very little impact on domestic consumption.<br><br>They expect the sector to continue to be volatile as it is still dominated by a few international companies operating here.<br><br>But perhaps the biggest question mark lies over oil prices.<br><br>US crude futures are now trading at some 18% below record highs set in October - but they're still up some 30% since the start of the year.<br><br>G K Goh's regional economist, Song Seng Wun, said: "As long as the nominal price for oil stays at this current level, between US$40 and US$50, then I don't think it will do much to global economy in the next 12 to 15 months. It is when nominal prices reach somewhere around US$60 or more, then in real terms that will have more of an impact on business and consumer expectation. And, that could affect demand and economic activities."<br><br>Other major downside risks include developments in the US and China.<br><br>Singapore's economy - which is is heavily dependent on exports - will be hit by any slowdown in the US or a hard-landing in China. - CNA<br></div>
