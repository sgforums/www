"The problem is bad preparedness."<br><br>Influenza is highly contagious and has killed millions over the past 100 years. It has traditionally moved in cycles, and some scientists say a major outbreak is already overdue.<br><br>The 1918-1919 Spanish Flu outbreak killed up to 40 million people around the world, many more than World War I. There also were major outbreaks in 1957-58 and 1968-1969 that killed more than a million people each. The most virulent strains hit about every 30 years.<br><br>WHO has warned that 7 million could die in a new outbreak and that governments must do more to prepare Â— and try to cut the death toll.<br><br>"We're living on borrowed time," said Stohr. "But that gives us a chance to do things we should perhaps have done before."<br><br>Besides developing vaccines to combat new, potentially deadly flu strains, health authorities worldwide must boost surveillance, said WHO. The agency also called for better emergency plans that can be put in place fast if there is a pandemic Â— with clear quarantine rules and screening of departing passengers at airports, for example.<br><br>"Vaccines are often mentioned as the first line, but they are not," said Stohr. "They are just one pillar of the response."<br><br>The three flu pandemics that hit in the last century, and the ones that came before them, spread around the world before health officials had the chance to even identify the strain Â— let alone make and distribute vaccines to combat it.<br><br>Fears of a new global outbreak have been spurred by last year's epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which struck hardest in Asia. The flu-like disease killed nearly 800 people worldwide.<br><br>Worries also have been stoked by bird flu, which swept through farms across Asia this year, ravaging the poultry industry as more than 100 million birds were culled in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.<br><br>The disease also jumped to humans, killing 12 people in Thailand and 20 in Vietnam. There is no concrete evidence yet of human-to-human transmission, but experts fear the virus could mutate to a form that could spread among humans, sparking the next global pandemic.<br><br>WHO also wants governments to boost cooperation between medical and veterinary authorities because of fears that animal flu could jump the species barrier.<br><br>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/26/health/main657843.shtml</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peter Cordingley (PC) is the spokesperson for the World Health Organization, or WHO Western Pacific Office based in the Philippines, and he tells Melanie Yip why.<br><br>PC: <span style="color: darkred;">If you look back to January this year, when the first report of this virus began to come out, the country in question was Vietnam. There were some people who thought that, perhaps you know, this was a simple problem that could be stopped through surveillance, the killing of infected chickens, and the establishment of sanitized zones around infected areas. Now, we are 11 months down the road, and this virus has spread to nine countries. At the moment, it is quiet, we do not hear many reports of outbreaks, although there are signs of the virus popping up occasionally, but they were quickly put under control. But we think that when the winter comes, which is when flu viruses are more active. We will find that despite what we're looking at the moment, a large part of Asia may well be on the fire with this virus in poultry. </span><br><br>Why is Asia more prone to the bird flu pandemic than other parts of the world like North America and Europe?<br><br>PC: <span style="color: brown;">We think the answer to that is something to do with the fact that there is growing prosperity in Asia. People at one time were happy to eat just vegetables and rice. They became more prosperous, there was more money in the family budget, they turned to meat and in the case of Asia, it has largely been chickens. So we've now seen the growth, enormous growth of chicken farming across South East Asia, particularly in Southern China. These chicken farms have shot up with absolutely no considerations for environmental controls or hygiene. People are living with their chickens, they're mixing with the chickens, they're doing something which they should never do, and that is to mix chickens and ducks because of the dangers of the transfer of virus. So we now have an animal husbandry out of control in this part of the world. </span><br><br>The World Health Organization had said that it is only a matter of time before the next influenza pandemic erupts, and Asian authorities may be powerless to stop the deaths of up to 50 million people. Is there a specific time period the WHO is referring to?<br><br>PC: <span style="color: darkred;">We don't know when this is going to happen, we're fairly certain that it is going to happen. I can give you a couple of reasons why this is going to happen. One is that this virus is embedded in large parts of South East Asia, and Southern China. Second reason is that this virus, at one time, infected only chickens. Now it infects chickens, pigs, cats, tigers, we've now even seen it not only in ducks, but in ducks that show no signs of illness. So you can imagine the potential for the spread of virus. The third reason is that flu pandemics, historically from the 19th to 20th centuries, have come around every 30 or so years. Nature doesn't do things by whim, the last flu pandemic was in 1968, we're well overdue now to have another one. </span><br><br>Source:<br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/analysis/view/122414/1/.html</div>
