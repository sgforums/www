            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">What can be done to this problem?<br><br>1) I suggest hospitals to take the details of the girl n boy when the girl go for abortion n forward the details to AWARE.<br><br>2) Schools to organise yearly pregnency checks on the girls to be conducted by polyclinics which will sent them for counselling by qualified counseller.  So schools will not know, saving the pregnent girls some embarrassment.<br><br>3) Sex education by female doctors for the girls on avoiding underage sex.<br><br>4) Sex education by the male doctors for the guys on avoiding underage sex.<br><br>5) Put up laws so that the media will not promote underage sex through their shows.</span><br><br><strong>SINGAPORE : Underaged sex or having sex below 16 seems to be getting out of hand, says the Singapore Planned Parenthood Association.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>There were 14,000 abortions last year, of which half were by those under 20.</strong></span><br><br>But is dating at a young age the problem?<br><br>Young couples may just hold hands, but should they even start to pair up at such an early age?<br><br>"Young kids should date at about 15 to 16 because that's when they start to get mature."<br><br>"Kids nowadays should date 18 years and above.....children younger than 12 should not date too early because they will not find their true love yet."<br><br>"Depends on the parents side. If they agree, 16 should be the age. So, 16 is the day you graduate so you get some of your freedom."<br><br>But some parents want them to start dating at a later age.[b]<br><br>One father said: "They are working, their mentality is quite matured enough, I think it should be no problem. But they must know what they are doing and with who they mix around."<br><br>A mother said: "I keep on telling my girls - 'please don't start the relationships too early because you are both very young' - and I don't think they know what is love."<br><br>And with Valentine's Day round the corner, some counsellors are concerned that youths might just plunge deeper into their relationships without thinking twice.<br><br>"As long they don't have sex and kiss in public, I think holding hands should be okay."<br><br>John Vijayan, Singapore Planned Parenthood Association, said: "What leads from hand holding, petting, kissing, you may end up with a very early stage of sexual intercourse for which they may not know the dangers."<br><br>The issue is not how young should couples date but more importantly what couples do when they go out on dates.<br><br>Whether the couples are in the right frame of mind to handle relationships and are mentally prepared for any consequences resulting from the relationships.<br><br>John Vijayan added: "If you are going to be overcome by emotions over this weekend, my suggestions to them is if you are not ready for any form of intimacy, stay away, respectfully tell the other party, 'I'm not ready, we will do it when you are ready' and if you want to engage in something then be prepared for the consequences."<br><br>And so, counsellors say couples can express their love in more ways than one.....like having a meal together or watching a movie. - CNA</div>
