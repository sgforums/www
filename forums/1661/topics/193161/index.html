It used to be very rare to see female gang members behaving in a violent way and that is more common now."<br><br>Earlier this year two 14-year-old girls from Liverpool were accused of murdering taxi driver Youbert Hormozi.<br><br>And in London, 16-year-old Chelsea O'Mahoney was jailed for eight years for her role in an orgy of violence by a gang known as "happy slappers", responsible for attacks on eight people, including a barman beaten to death.<br><br>Professor Garbarino told a parenting conference this week in Adelaide that research dating back 40 years had proved a link between child exposure to TV violence and increased physical aggression. But while girls were initially found to be "immune" to the "contagious" effect of TV<br><br>violence, researchers had seen a significant shift since the 1980s. "That immunity had disappeared," he said.<br><br>Some studies had shown in some circumstances that girls now display a greater tendency than boys to be aggressive, particularly when they can do so in an anonymous way such as in a gang.<br><br>Professor Garbarino said children start life with a capacity for aggression.<br><br>"Most kids unlearn aggression. In the past that process has worked more effectively and more comprehensively for girls [than boys]."<br><br>But the powerful message that girls don't hit has been compromised, Professor Garbarino, author of See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About it, said.<br><br>He pointed to characters such as Hermione, who is the "perfect daughter" but in the third Potter movie punches Harry's enemy Malfoy.<br><br>"Afterwards she says 'Boy, that felt good' and she is cheered on by her friends," Professor Garbarino told the Parenting Imperatives II conference. "To tell a girl after seeing that movie that girls don't hit is preposterous. Girls hit, it feels good and people appreciate it -- that's the message."<br><br>Professor Garbarino said the "good news that more girls were active in sport had produced side effects and unanticipated consequences."<br><br>He said traditionally boys playing contact sports had been taught how to be aggressive without crossing the line into violence. They had been taught to then back off, shake hands and be friends. But girls found this more difficult.<br><br>"I think it's mostly because girls have not had this taught to them," Professor Garbarino said. - <span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><br><br></div>
