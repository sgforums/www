            <div class='col-md body'>From Contactmusic.com:<br><br><blockquote>NEW POPE HITS OUT AT HARRY POTTER BOOKS<br><br>New Pope BENEDICT XVI has blasted JK ROWLING's HARRY POTTER books for "undermining the soul of Christianity".<br><br>Nicknamed 'GOD'S ROTTWEILER', Pope Benedict is set to confuse Catholics across the world because his predecessor JOHN PAUL II praised the multi-millionairess for her Christian lifestyle.<br><br>Benedict, formerly CARDINAL JOSEPH RATZINGER is grateful to HARRY POTTER - GOOD OR BAD author GABRIELE KUBY for revealing the hidden agendas behind the popular children's books.<br><br>He says, "It is good that you explain the facts of Harry Potter, because this is a subtle seduction, which has deeply unnoticed and direct effects in undermining the soul of Christianity before it can really grow properly."<br><br>Leading Christian theologian UTA RANKE-HEINEMANN, 77, comments, "The Vatican feels it has the copyright on what is good and what is evil and it does not want anyone else infringing its right to this monopoly.<br><br>"It will condemn anyone who tries to enter this territory without its permission."<br><br>24/04/2005 21:40  </blockquote>This does not bode well for us Harry Potter fans. John Paul II had lauded it for emphasis on moral values in the past. Now his successor has reversed his endorsement. Damn!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels - Signed Letters from Cardinal Ratzinger Now Online<br><br>RIMSTING, Germany, July 13, 2005 (LifeSiteNews.com) -  LifeSiteNews.com has obtained and made available online copies of two letters sent by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was recently elected Pope, to a German critic of the Harry Potter novels.  In March 2003, a month after the English press throughout the world falsely proclaimed that Pope John Paul II approved of Harry Potter, the man who was to become his successor sent a letter to a Gabriele Kuby outlining his agreement with her opposition to J.K. Rowling's offerings.  (See below for links to scanned copies of the letters signed by Cardinal Ratzinger.)<br><br>As the sixth issue of Rowling's Harry Potter series - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - is about to be released, the news that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger expressed serious reservations about the novels is now finally being revealed to the English-speaking world still under the impression the Vatican approves the Potter novels.<br><br>In a letter dated March 7, 2003 Cardinal Ratzinger thanked Kuby for her "instructive" book Harry Potter - gut oder bÃ¶se (Harry Potter- good or evil?), in which Kuby says the Potter books corrupt the hearts of the young, preventing them from developing a properly ordered sense of good and evil, thus harming their relationship with God while that relationship is still in its infancy.<br><br>"It is good, that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because those are subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul, before it can grow properly," wrote Cardinal Ratzinger.<br><br>The letter also encouraged Kuby to send her book on Potter to the Vatican prelate who quipped about Potter during a press briefing which led to the false press about the Vatican support of Potter.  At a Vatican press conference to present a study document on the New Age in April 2003, one of the presenters - Fr. Peter Fleedwood - made a positive comment on the Harry Potter books in response to a question from a reporter.    Headlines such as "Pope Approves Potter" (Toronto Star), "Pope Sticks Up for Potter Books" (BBC), "Harry Potter Is Ok With The Pontiff" (Chicago Sun Times) and "Vatican: Harry Potter's OK with us" (CNN Asia) littered the mainstream media.<br><br>In a second letter sent to Kuby on May 27, 2003, Cardinal Ratzinger "gladly" gave his permission to Kuby to make public "my judgement about Harry Potter."<br><br>The most prominent Potter critic in North America, Catholic novelist and painter Michael O'Brien commented to LifeSiteNews.com on the "judgement" of now-Pope Benedict saying, "This discernment on the part of Benedict XVI reveals the Holy Father's depth and wide ranging gifts of spiritual discernment." O'Brien, author of a book dealing with fantasy literature for children added, "it is consistent with many of the statements he's been making since his election to the Chair of Peter, indeed for the past 20 years - a probing accurate read of the massing spiritual warfare that is moving to a new level of struggle in western civilization. He is a man in whom a prodigious intellect is integrated with great spiritual gifts. He is the father of the universal church and we would do well to listen to him."<br><br>English translations of the two letters by Cardinal Ratzinger follow:<br><br>Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger<br>Vatican City<br>March 7, 2003<br><br>Esteemed and dear Ms. Kuby!<br><br>Many thanks for your kind letter of February 20th and the informative book which you sent me in the same mail.  It is good, that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because those are subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul, before it can grow properly.<br><br>I would like to suggest that you write to Mr. Peter Fleedwood, (Pontifical Council of Culture, Piazza S. Calisto 16, I00153 Rome) directly and to send him your book.<br><br>Sincere Greetings and Blessings,<br><br>+ Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger<br><br>=======================<br><br>Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger<br>Vatican City<br>May 27, 2003<br><br>Esteemed and dear Ms. Kuby,<br><br>Somehow your letter got buried in the large pile of name-day , birthday and Easter mail.  Finally this pile is taken care of, so that I can gladly allow you to refer to my judgment about Harry Potter.<br><br>Sincere Greetings and Blessings,<br><br>+ Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger<br><br>Links to the scanned copies of the two signed letters by Cardinal Ratzinger (in German) - In PDF format:<br>http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005_docs/ratzingerlet...<br>http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005_docs/ratzingerper...<br><br>See LifeSite's Harry Potter resource section at:<br>http://www.lifesite.net/features/harrypotter/<br><br>jhw<br><br></div>
