            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROEDER RESERVES JUDGEMENT ON DYER</strong><br><br>Caretaker Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder will make a late decision on whether to hand midfielder Kieron Dyer a Barclays Premiership start at Aston Villa.<br><br>The 27-year-old played a 60-minute practice match earlier this week and suffered no ill-effects, although he remains short of match fitness.<br><br>Defender Craig Moore returned from his hamstring injury for the reserves on Thursday night, but the game could come too soon for him, while Michael Owen (foot), Steven Taylor (shoulder) and Stephen Carr (hernia) are all still out and Amady Faye is yet to return from the African Nations Cup.<br><br>DyerÂ’s injury woes have limited him to just four appearances all season, and Roeder has challenged the winger to revive his World Cup dream by helping his club out of its current problems.<br><br>Â“In life, everyone has to have a goal, and I said to him Â‘your goal has got to be the World Cup. You have got to reach for the stars, KieronÂ’,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s not as if heÂ’s never played for England and heÂ’d be unproven. HeÂ’s played well for England, so the manager knows what heÂ’s capable of.<br><br>Â“Being out this time for a long period, I feel, has hit him and has made him really realise how much he loves football.<br><br>Â“If you had seen him in training, the professionalism he showed during the sessions, the effort he put in - he was flying, it was terrific.Â”<br><br>Roeder also backed striker Alan Shearer to bring the glory days back to Newcastle as manager - but not just yet.<br><br>Shearer has ruled himself out of the running to become Graeme SounessÂ’ successor, insisting he is not ready for such a big job, but Roeder believes the current captain will take over one day and make a success of it.<br><br>Roeder, who is being assisted by the 35-year-old as chairman Freddy Shepherd searches for NewcastleÂ’s next manager, said: Â“When he eventually takes the job, Alan will bring success to Newcastle United because heÂ’s a winner.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s got that charisma and heÂ’s one of those people who - Kevin Keegan certainly had it and the best coach I ever worked for, Terry Venables, certainly had it - can walk into a room and you notice him straight away.<br><br>Â“You are ready for him to say something and you sit up and take notice. There a very few people in life who have that ability - and they donÂ’t have to work at it, they are born with it.<br><br>Â“When Alan decides he feels the time is right - you have to wait for the opportunity, but there will be an opportunity - he will make a success of it.Â”<br><br>Aston Villa are without midfielders Gavin McCann and James Milner for the Villa Park clash.<br><br>McCann is serving a one-match ban after collecting five bookings while Milner is unable to play as he is on loan from the Magpies.<br><br>Lee Hendrie will return to the starting line-up while teenage midfielder Craig Gardner, who signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract this week, is on alert to make his first start, given that Eric Djemba-Djemba has also still to return from Africa.<br><br>Striker Milan Baros is fit to return after missing last weekendÂ’s 4-0 win at Middlesbrough with a hamstring strain.<br><br>OÂ’Leary has no reservations about turning to 19-year-old midfielder Gardner in the absence of McCann and Milner.<br><br>OÂ’Leary, who handed Gardner a new three-and-a-half year contract earlier this week, said: Â“Craig will start along with Steven Davis and will form one of the youngest central midfields ever seen in the Premiership.<br><br>Â“They go up against two big names, Scott Parker and Emre, and whoever wins control of the midfield will win the game.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve no other alternative but to play Gardner as Gavin is suspended and it is a massive test for him.<br><br>Â“Personally, I hope the boy does well. You will not get anyone who wants to be a top footballer more than him. His attitude and willingness to learn is unbelievable.<br><br>Â“It would give me the utmost pleasure if the boy plays well and I hope the crowd get behind him.<br><br>Â“He has shown his potential as a strong midfield player with two good feet but the Premiership is a different grade entirely and we will have to see how he performs against world-class players.Â”<br><br>OÂ’Leary, who will play Lee Hendrie wide on the right in place of Milner, admits he is shocked to see where Newcastle are at the moment.<br><br>The Irishman said: Â“Newcastle are a club with the potential to win the Premiership as they are up there with the top clubs.<br><br>Â“They have been able to go out and buy some great players. They can buy someone for Â£5million or Â£6million whereas we have to buy five or six players for that sort of money.<br><br>Â“What sums them up is that they are able to go out and buy someone like Michael Owen.<br><br>Â“The chairman has always backed his managers with their wages and transfer fees and that is why I thought they would be in the top six this season.<br><br>Â“I do not think Newcastle is an impossible job because, if you have the money they have, then it is down to the judgement of the manager to make it a success.Â”<br><br>Villa, beaten only twice in their last 16 games, are looking for three points to take them into the mid-table comfort zone for the first time this season.<br><br>For 19-year-old Moore, there will be no resting on his laurels after his heroics in the 4-0 win at Middlesbrough.<br><br>OÂ’Leary added: Â“He has to build on the form he showed at Middlesbrough. He will now be judged on how he plays and how many goals he scores.<br><br>Â“He is a frontman who can lead the line and he is looking to make good runs and hopefully take his chances.<br><br>Â“If he is going to be a star striker he has to go on to score goals consistently and only time will tell if he will do that.<br><br>Â“He is a quiet, unassuming lad. He does not get emotional and every day is the same for him. He is good to manage.Â”<br><br>OÂ’Leary will also be looking to the influence of Gareth Barry, who will be making his 300th appearance for Villa at the age of just 24.<br><br>Aston Villa (from): Sorensen, Taylor, Hughes, Delaney, Mellberg, Ridgewell, Samuel, Barry, Davis, Angel, Baros, Phillips, Moore, Gardner, Whittingham, Hendrie, De La Cruz.<br><br>Newcastle United (from): Given, Harper, Ramage, Babayaro, Elliott, Bramble, Boumsong, Parker, Solano, Emre, Dyer, NÂ’Zogbia, Luque, Clark, Bowyer, Brittain, OÂ’Brien, Shearer, Ameobi, Chopra.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MAGPIES APPEAL BABAYARO RED CARD</strong><br><br>Newcastle United are to appeal against Celestine Babayaro's sending-off against Aston Villa in the Magpies' 2-1 Barclays Premiership victory on Saturday.<br><br>The Nigeria defender was dismissed after fouling Milan Baros to concede a penalty, which the Czech Republic striker subsequently hit straight at goalkeeper Shay Given.<br><br>Â“Baros went down too easily, but strikers can do that,Â” Babayaro told the clubÂ’s official website, www.nufc.co.uk.<br><br>Â“I was saying to the referee that it was not a sending-off. If he was saying it was a penalty, then fair enough, but it was not a sending-off.<br><br>Â“He (Baros) was going away from the goal, Shay Given was coming out and there were other players around.Â”<br><br>The sending-off would earn Babayaro a one-match ban but, having been handed a three-game suspension after a clash with Everton's Tim Cahill in the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park in November, the punishment could be doubled.<br><br></div>
