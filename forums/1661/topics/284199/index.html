            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rowena Ravenclaw:</strong><br><br>According to the Sorting Hat..."Ravenclaw came "from glen," which, according to Lexicon reader Ian, probably means somewhere in Scotland, such as Glencoe or the Great Glen where Loch Ness is.<br><br>She had a daughter named Helena, now known as The Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw House at Hogwarts.<br><br>Her Famous Wizard card tells us that "(i)t's thought that she came up with the ever-changing floor plan. She's best remembered for her intelligence and creativity."<br><br>She possessed a diadem (tiara) inscribed "Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure" which bestows wisdom when worn. Stolen by her daughter Helena, who ran away to Albania and hid the diadem in a tree. It was later found by Tom Riddle who made a Horcrux with it and hid it in the room of Requirement. The diadem was destroyed by Fiendfyre.<br><br>Rowena was dear friends with Helga Hufflepuff.<br><br>According to Jo's website, Ravenclaw was "the most brilliant witch of her time," who, according to legend, died of a broken heart. She is said to have stated: "We will teach those whose intelligence is surest."<br></div>

The entrance is a door at the top of a tightly winding spiral staircase that leads up from the fifth floor. The door has neither handle nor keyhole, but a talking bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Rather than asking for a conventional password, the knocker will ask a question; if answered correctly, the knocker will compliment the person on the answer and the door will swing open.<br><br>The common room, like the other House common rooms, is decorated in House colours (blue and bronze silk wall hangings, in this case, and a midnight-blue carpet decorated with stars). The room is wide, circular, and very airy, with a domed ceiling painted with stars, and walls with graceful arched windows that provide a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. There are bookcases, tables, and chairs, and opposite the entrance is another door leading to the dormitories. Beside this door is a plinth on which stands a life-size statue in white marble of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her diadem.<br><br><strong>Ravenclaw Quidditch team:</strong><br><br>blue robes<br><br><strong>Known Ravenclaws, Past and Present:</strong><br><br>(years unknown, but near-contemporary with the Founders)<br><br>Helena Ravenclaw, The Grey Lady<br>(years unknown)<br><br>Flitwick, Filius<br>(ea. 1940s)<br><br>Moaning Myrtle<br><br>(1990s)<br><br>Bradley (male)<br>The earliest possible year for Bradley is two years above Harry while the latest is three years below, because Bradley was on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team in Harry's fifth year.<br>Chambers<br>The earliest possible year for Chambers is two years above Harry while the latest is three years below, because Chambers was on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team in Harry's fifth year.<br>Fawcett, S.<br>No more than a year below Harry since she was at the Duelling Club.
