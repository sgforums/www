            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newcastle fans top of the table for making sacrifices</span><br><br>independent.ie<br><br>Wednesday September 26 2007<br><br>MOST people wouldn't agree with Bill Shankly's tongue-in-cheek claim that football is more important than life or death -- but many fans admit to putting their teams before family, friends and holidays, according to new research.<br><br>More than 10 per cent of Premier League season ticket-holders claim to have passed up job opportunities to continue following their teams, and most would be prepared to make even greater sacrifices if they knew that it would bring success to their clubs.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A survey, carried out in August by Virgin Money reveals that followers of Newcastle United are most willing to give up quality time with loved ones at home to watch their loved ones in black and white stripes. Despite not having seen their team win a trophy since 1969, 47 per cent of Newcastle fans regularly attend matches rather than staying in with the family -- unless they're at the game too.</span><br><br>After Newcastle come supporters of Birmingham City (35 per cent) and Sunderland (34). Chelsea, whose fans are often accused of being Johnny-come-lately glory-hunters, are in a surprising fourth-place with 32 per cent. Wigan Athletic, whose small numbers mask their fervour, are joint sixth with Manchester City.<br><br>About 93 per cent of fans surveyed admit they had made sacrifices because of their football club. Two thirds have rearranged their social life to fit in with matches, while 45 per cent say they spend less on other forms of entertainment in order to buy match tickets and 42 per cent say they give up time with their partner in favour of watching football. About 28 per cent say they spend less time with their family and children to go to games. And 72 per cent say they would sacrifice even more to see their team win the Premier League or Champions League. Eight per cent of supporters claimed they would give up "anything" to see their club become Premier League champions or win the Champions League.<br><br>Four per cent would forgo their holidays and three per cent would even give up alcohol. "If you want a definition of the word dedicated, then football fans fit the bill perfectly," said John Franklin, of Virgin Money. "The financial cost of following a team continues to rise and rise, but that doesn't seem to deter fans.<br><br>"It is more than just a money game, though, for fans, as many of them seem to base their lives around the game. Friends and family come second to the game for many and some will even give up job opportunities to continue to keep backing their team.<br><br>"Clubs are genuinely lucky to have such dedicated fans. Modern fans can hardly be dismissed as glory-hunters as most clubs in the Premiership don't get that close to glory nowadays."<br><br>Nevertheless, for some supporters enough is enough. Twenty-eight per cent of those questioned feel their current level of sacrifice and expenditure is more than sufficient, and no wonder.</div>
