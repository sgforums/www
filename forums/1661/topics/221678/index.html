            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TAYLOR SEALS MAGPIES PROGRESS</strong><br><br>Local hero Steven Taylor made sure his first Newcastle United goal was a crucial one as he fired the Magpies into the knockout stages of the UEFA Cup.<br><br>The 20-year-old central defender had a part to play in Fabian CanobbioÂ’s ninth-minute opener for Celta Vigo but after Antoine Sibierski had cancelled out the UruguayanÂ’s strike with a 36th-minute equaliser - his fourth goal in a black and white shirt and his third in Europe - Taylor powered a header past goalkeeper Esteban Suarez from Albert LuqueÂ’s corner four minutes from time to send Glenn RoederÂ’s men into the last 32.<br><br>The victory, coupled with FenerbahceÂ’s 3-0 win over Palermo, means the Magpies head for Eintracht Frankfurt knowing anything they collect there can only improve their finishing position in Group H with a maximum nine points already banked.<br><br>It also extends their unbeaten run in cup ties this season to 11 games, and they have not lost in their last four in all competitions.<br><br>Roeder was indebted not only to Taylor and bargain buy Sibierski but former England midfielder Nicky Butt, who put in a determined display in central midfield, and Peruvian Nolberto Solano, who was employed as an emergency right-back.<br><br>However, for 30 minutes the worry was that it was the Barclays Premiership underachievers who had taken the field.<br><br>Perhaps not surprisingly for a team which had a right-winger playing at right-back, a central defender at left-back and no recognised striker on the pitch, the Magpies were disjointed at first and struggled for any kind of coherence.<br><br>It took an early setback to spark the home side into life.<br><br>Roeder had warned of CeltaÂ’s counter-attacking style but they did not need to hit their hosts on the break in the opening stages as Brazilian striker Baiano, supported by wide men Nene and Angel Lopez, made life intensely difficult.<br><br>Indeed, when the visitors took the lead with just nine minutes gone, it was hardly against the run of play.<br><br>Taylor headed a seemingly harmless Angel free-kick out of goalkeeper Shay GivenÂ’s hands and when the ball was recycled Canobbio skipped past EmreÂ’s weak challenge and curled a superb left-foot shot past the goalkeeper.<br><br>It was not until former Manchester United midfielder Butt began to stamp his authority on the game that the Magpies forced their way into it and they equalised from their second attack of any note, Luque having dragged a shot across the face of goal with just 20 seconds gone.<br><br>There were 36 minutes on the clock when James Milner picked up possession wide on the right and flighted a cross towards Sibierski at the far post, and he jumped unopposed to head firmly past Esteban.<br><br>Titus Bramble might have put the home side in front on the stroke of half-time but he could not keep his header down from an Emre free-kick.<br><br>Newcastle returned knowing a second-half clean sheet would see them through but they were not about to settle for a point.<br><br>It took a last-ditch block by full-back Diego Placente to cut out MilnerÂ’s cross after a mazy run into the box.<br><br>However, as Baiano in particular kept the home defence on its toes, nothing could be taken for granted.<br><br>As time ran down, it was the home side who looked the more likely to snatch victory, substitute Obafemi Martins giving Charles NÂ’Zogbia a run at goal and then seeing his own shot blocked 14 minutes from time.<br><br>However, it was defender Taylor who provided the decisive touch, thumping a header past the stranded Esteban from LuqueÂ’s 86th-minute corner before sprinting the length of the St JamesÂ’ pitch in celebration.<br><br></div>
