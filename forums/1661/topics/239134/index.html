            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WIGAN ATHLETIC v NEWCASTLE UNITED, 1-0 Sun 25 Feb 2007</strong><br><br>Paul Jewell celebrated becoming the longest-serving manager in Wigan Athletic's history with a priceless victory.<br><br>Jewell, in charge for his 250th league game to surpass the record set by Bryan Hamilton, watched his side regain a six-point cushion to the relegation zone.<br><br>Ryan Taylor scored the only goal of the game five minutes before half-time with a stunning free-kick, just moments after John Filan had saved a penalty from Nolberto Solano.<br><br>It was TaylorÂ’s first goal for the club since October 2005, albeit after spending virtually all of last year on the sidelines as he broke first a metatarsal in an FA Cup tie with Leeds last January, and then his right leg in a reserve match against Newcastle in April.<br><br>It has been a long road back for Taylor, with this goal helping complete his rehabilitation and offer further hope the Latics can survive.<br><br>But Jewell also has Filan to thank for the win as he rolled back time with a performance which belied his 37 years.<br><br>In the absence of Chris Kirkland and Mike Pollitt through injury, Filan has superbly stepped into the breach.<br><br>The veteranÂ’s recall for WednesdayÂ’s 1-1 draw at Watford was his first game for Wigan for 10 months, and it was as if he had never been away.<br><br>Certainly Filan kept Wigan in this match before Taylor broke the deadlock, first denying Damien Duff with an outstretched left hand in the 23rd minute after the Republic of Ireland winger attempted to dink a shot over the advancing Australian.<br><br>Two minutes later NewcastleÂ’s livewire frontman Obafemi Martins let fly with a swerving 25-yard drive, but again Filan was equal to the chance.<br><br>It was Filan who kept the heads of his team-mates high in the 28th minute when they felt aggrieved at the penalty award.<br><br>Following a delightful backheeled pass through the legs of Emmerson Boyce and onto Antoine Sibierski from Martins, the midfielder went down under Taylor's challenge.<br><br>Referee Alan Wiley pointed to the spot, following which Filan confronted Sibierski, earning a booking for his protests.<br><br>But he dived full-length to his right to keep out SolanoÂ’s spot-kick effort.<br><br>A minute later FilanÂ’s heroics continued as he was again at full stretch, tipping away a downward header from Martins after the Nigerian rose to meet a right-wing cross from captain Scott Parker.<br><br>It proved a turning point because within two minutes Taylor netted the winner.<br><br>A foul from Oguchi Onyewu on Leighton Baines teed Taylor up for his chance just outside the left-hand edge of the area.<br><br>But the 22-year-oldÂ’s execution from the free-kick was precise, curling a 28-yard right-foot effort into the top left-hand corner beyond Shay Given, back in goal after five weeks out with a groin injury.<br><br>It could have been 2-0 in first-half injury-time, only for Given to beat away a powerful header from Lee McCulloch.<br><br>It was the Scotland internationalÂ’s third chance of the half as he was initially caught unawares by a 20-yard Josip Skoko shot which had spun off the heel of Caleb Folan.<br><br>At the far post, McCulloch could do no more than spoon a soft shot into the welcoming arms of Given, following up soon after with a sliced effort from 16 yards after being teed up by Heskey.<br><br>The second period was heart-stopping stuff for Jewell, although Filan did not have another save to make, including through five minutes of added-on time.<br><br>There were chances late on for Folan and Henri Camara, who came on as a 62nd-minute sub for Antonio Valencia for his first game after two months out with a knee injury, but fortunately it did not matter.<br><br>The only downside for Jewell was that he had six players booked, incurring an automatic Â£25,000 fine - but it is only a small hindrance given the magnitude of the three points.<br><br></div>
