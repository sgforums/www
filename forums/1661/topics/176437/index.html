            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BARTON TO FACE NEWCASTLE</strong><br><br>Midfielder Joey Barton has been included in Manchester CityÂ’s squad to face Newcastle United.<br><br>The former England Under-21 international had a transfer request rejected by Stuart Pearce on Monday and the Blues boss fully intends to select Barton against the Magpies.<br><br>"I see no reason why he should not be in the squad," said Pearce.<br><br>"We have always said we would make the right decisions for Manchester City, because the club is bigger than any individual.<br><br>"If Joey doesn't play against Newcastle, do I leave him out against Everton, Charlton and the games after that?"<br><br>Georgios Samaras, CityÂ’s new Â£6million striker, is set for a spot on the bench, although young defender Matthew Mills will probably miss out despite completing his move north from Southampton.<br><br>Nedum Onuoha is being sent for a scan on a minor knock, while Ben Thatcher (chest) is also missing.<br><br>Newcastle boss Graeme Souness will leave Michael Owen to decide when he feels ready to make his comeback from a broken foot.<br><br>The Scot hopes his striker may resume training within a fortnight, but accepts it could still be up to eight weeks before he is fit again.<br><br>Souness reported Owen - who had his protective boot removed on Monday - will be the man who dictates when he is ready.<br><br>Â“He had his boot off and he was having another scan, and then itÂ’s just a case of stepping up his training,Â” said Souness.<br><br>Â“But we have not put a time on it, because the best one to decide that would be Michael on how his foot feels.<br><br>Â“The recovery period is still, I think, anywhere between six and 12 weeks - six weeks would mean he is ready in a fortnight. But 12 weeks would be a long, long time away. I donÂ’t want to think about that.Â”<br><br>Owen, 26, suffered the injury during the 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on December 31.<br><br>Souness saw Scott Parker, Emre and Shola Ameobi return to action in SaturdayÂ’s 2-0 FA Cup fourth-round victory at Cheltenham.<br><br>The chronic injury list finally seems to be improving, although freezing temperatures in the north-east this week have hampered his efforts to get midfielder Kieron Dyer back fit.<br><br>The 27-year-old was back in training on Monday after managing just three appearances this season because of hamstring and health problems.<br><br>Frozen training pitches having limited the work he has been able to do but Dyer could return to the bench against Portsmouth on Saturday.<br><br>Â“This weather has hurt Kieron a wee bit. We hoped he was going to have a really hard week of training this week - but with the pitches frozen, thatÂ’s been limited somewhat,Â” said Souness.<br><br>Â“We are hoping Kieron can be on the bench against Portsmouth. But a lot can happen between now and Saturday - IÂ’m sitting here with everything crossed.Â”<br><br>The Magpies head to the City of Manchester Stadium looking for a first Barclays Premiership victory in six attempts and knowing that City, who lost 1-0 at St JamesÂ’ Park in September to OwenÂ’s lone strike, will provide stern opposition.<br><br>Goalkeeper Shay Given is in line to make the 300th league appearance of his career at City, all but 24 of them for the Magpies.<br><br>But Stephen Carr (hernia), Steven Taylor (shoulder), Craig Moore (hamstring) and Lee Bowyer (illness) are all missing, while Amady Faye is away with Senegal at the African Nations Cup.<br><br>Manchester City (from): James, Weaver, Sun, Dunne, Distin, Mills, Richards, Jordan, Sinclair, Ireland, Barton, Musampa, Croft, Riera, Sibierski, Cole, Vassell, Wright-Phillips, Samaras.<br><br>Newcastle United (from): Given; Harper, Ramage, Babayaro, Elliott, Bramble, Boumsong, Parker, Silano, Ameobi, Emre, Clark, N'Zogbia, Brittain, Shearer, Luque, Chopra.<br><br></div>
