            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEWCASTLE UNITED v WIGAN ATHLETIC, 2-1 Sat 19 Aug 2006</strong><br><br>Shola Ameobi rose to the challenge of replacing Alan Shearer as Newcastle United launched the new Barclays Premiership campaign with a hard-fought victory over Wigan Athletic.<br><br>The 24-year-old fired home the winning goal on 64 minutes to hand Glenn RoederÂ’s men three points just as it looked as though they had surrendered at least two of them.<br><br>Skipper Scott Parker had headed the Magpies into a 38th-minute lead but NewcastleÂ’s defensive frailty struck once again 14 minutes after the break as Lee McCulloch levelled.<br><br>But with his side struggling, Ameobi converted after Chris Kirkland could only block Charles NÂ’ZogbiaÂ’s stinging drive to claim victory in front of a crowd of 51,569.<br><br>The visitors, who had earlier hit the post through Henri Camara, seen Shay Given keep out a McCulloch header and Nolberto Solano hack an Arjan de Zeeuw effort off the line, will feel they should have left with at least a point.<br><br>However, AmeobiÂ’s intervention justified RoederÂ’s belief in his team with new signings in the pipeline.<br><br>The big talking point on Tyneside all summer has been the task of replacing retired skipper Shearer and the injured Michael Owen, and while Roeder remains optimistic for a successful campaign, there was a sense of trepidation at St JamesÂ’ Park as torrential rain heralded the start of a new era.<br><br>By the time the half-time whistle sounded, some, if not all, of the fansÂ’ fears had been quelled.<br><br>A half played on a treacherous surface saw Ameobi lead the line well, new signing Damien Duff cause problems and Given once again at his excellent best.<br><br>There was also a place for midfielder Nicky Butt, starting his first Barclays Premiership game for the club in 16 months.<br><br>The former England internationalÂ’s days at St JamesÂ’ seemed to have drawn to a close when he was sent out on loan to Birmingham City.<br><br>However, he was applauded warmly from the pitch when he was forced to make a premature exit after a clash of heads.<br><br>Perhaps most significantly, Parker, the man handed the armband in the wake of ShearerÂ’s swansong, took over the Geordie legendÂ’s mantle in more ways than one.<br><br>Not only did he lead by example but made the decisive contribution seven minutes to put his side ahead.<br><br>Ameobi did well to control Stephen CarrÂ’s long ball on his chest and then twist and turn before delivering an inviting cross from his captain to plant an emphatic header past Kirkland.<br><br>The on-loan Liverpool keeper had earlier tipped away a long-range Parker drive and a Nolberto Solano header but the Magpies did not have it all their own way.<br><br>Wigan, with six new arrivals in their starting line-up, held their own for much of the half with record signing Heskey and Camara causing problems.<br><br>Camara was unfortunate not to level two minues before the break when his header came back of the foot of the post and Given had earlier had to claw away a McCulloch effort.<br><br>Newcastle re-emerged determined to kill the game off and they might have done so within two minutes when Solano met EmreÂ’s quickly-taken free-kick with a lob which sailed just over KirklandÂ’s crossbar.<br><br>Dutchman Denny Landzaat might have dragged his side back into it on 53 minutes after substitute Steven Taylor fouled Heskey 20 yards out, only to drill his free-kick over the bar.<br><br>Solano had to come to the home sideÂ’s rescue two minutes later when de Zeeuw climbed high to head a Landzaat corner towards goal and he hacked the ball off his own line.<br><br>The reprieve proved to be only temporary and when Carr made a mess of clearing a long ball, Heskey headed down for McCulloch to curl an equaliser through a crowded penalty area and past Given.<br><br>Just as Wigan sensed an opportunity with Newcastle in disarray, Ameobi chose his moment to strike.<br><br>Substitute Charles NÂ’Zogbia surged forward before unleashing a long-range effort which Kirkland could only parry, and the striker supplied a Shearer-like finish to raise the roof.<br><br>However, the game was far from over and Landzaat might have spoiled the party had he kept his shot down from CamaraÂ’s 80th-minute cross.<br><br>The pressure was intense as time ran down and Camara saw an 84th-minute shot deflected just wide and a penalty appeal against Tirus Bramble waved away, but the Magpies managed to hold out to claim the points.<br><br></div>
