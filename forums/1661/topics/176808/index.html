            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SHEARER BREAKS MILBURN RECORD</strong><br><br>Alan Shearer wrote his name into Newcastle United folklore with his 201st goal for the club to break Jackie Milburn's record.<br><br>Fittingly, the former England striker brought up the landmark in front of his adoring fans at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>With Newcastle leading 1-0 against Portsmouth, Shearer latched onto a Shola Ameobi backheel in the 64th minute to be one-on-one with goalkeeper Dean Kiely and he calmly slotted the ball past the Pompey keeper right-footed to send the Geordie hordes delirious.<br><br>After the match Shearer admitted he wished Graeme Souness had been there to see his record-breaking strike which wrapped up a first Barclays Premiership victory for the Magpies in seven attempts.<br><br>That run cost Souness his job on Thursday, but there was an air of optimism around St JamesÂ’ Park ahead of kick-off and Shearer was in no mood to miss out.<br><br>Â“The goal was a big, big goal for me, obviously, but you have to believe me, the biggest relief was that it helped us get the three points,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“I couldnÂ’t have wished for it to come at a better place and at a better time. We needed it and we needed it in a performance form everyone , and we got that.<br><br>Â“I wish Graeme was here to see it because whatever anyone thinks of him, heÂ’s an honest, decent, hard-working, genuine man.<br><br>Â“It didnÂ’t work out for him. He knows - you donÂ’t have to tell him, heÂ’s a big boy - that we are in a results-driven business and we didnÂ’t get the results because of an horrendous injury situation.<br><br>Â“But you saw here - we took Emre off, Scott Parker off, Nolberto Solano off and put Kieron Dyer on, Lee Bowyer on and Lee Clark. Graeme didnÂ’t really have that luxury for a lot of the time.<br><br>Â“But he would have wanted us to win because heÂ’s that type of bloke. HeÂ’s not bitter, heÂ’s honest.<br><br>Â“We went out and put in a performance that has been coming, and we needed to do it under pressurised circumstances.Â”<br><br></div>
