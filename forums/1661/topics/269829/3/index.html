            <div class='col-md body'>I finished the book last night. Some of my thoughts:<br><br>Remus/Dora: Age gap too big. What's more, Remus was her uncle's best friend. Technically, Teddy and Harry belong to the same generation as their fathers went to school at the same time.<br><br>Snape killing Dumbledore: Snape actually <strong>euthanised</strong> the old man, who allowed his indiscretion to get the better of him with regards to the Peverell ring. Dumbledore knew Draco was tasked to kill him, so he decided to plan for Snape to do the dirty work instead so that Draco may be saved.<br><br>Snape/Lily: Can't believe James and Sirius were such dickheads when they were young. Also, Sirius seems to be like a typical teenage rebel from his interest in motorcycles and swimsuit models.<br><br>Voldemort taking over MoM: It was just like the Nazis occupying France during WW2. The sentencing of Muggles to the Dementor's kiss reminded me of the Holocaust.<br><br>Deathly Hallows symbol: It is in the same league as the swastika. A religious as well as an offensive symbol.<br><br>All in all, the  ending was exactly what I wanted. Harry/Ginny and Ron?Hermione living happily ever after. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pq321:</div><div class="quote_body">for the elder wand part, harry was the 'true master' of the elder wand, thus the wand would not have killed harry potter anyway, the expelliarmus was to get Harry's wand back(the elder wand) as u read they will say the elder wand flew over towards harry. It was also to deflect the curse which the wand would not kill it's own master.<br><br>Muggles were affected = = they just weren't significant enough to be mentioned compared to wizard deaths. The fight occured in hogwarts because Voldemort knew that harry was hunting horcruxes and Alecto told voldemort harry was at hogwarts. Also harry was finding the diadem.<br></div></blockquote>Ah yes, the bit regarding Rowena's lost diadem. Finally the Grey Lady makes her appearance. We only know about her existence because JKR said so in an interview.</div>
