            <div class='col-md body'><strong>READING v NEWCASTLE UNITED, 1-0 Mon 30 Apr 2007</strong><br><br>Michael Owen finally made his long-awaited comeback but the England striker's presence could not prevent Newcastle United slipping to a 1-0 defeat at the Madejski Stadium.<br><br>All eyes were on Owen, who has been out for 10 months since rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in last summerÂ’s World Cup, but it was Reading marksman Dave Kitson who stole the show.<br><br>Kitson buried Seol Ki-HyeonÂ’s cross in the 50th minute for his second Barclays Premiership goal in an injury-hit season to clinch the RoyalsÂ’ third straight victory.<br><br>A cool seventh-minute finish also saw Owen, making only his 11th start for Newcastle since arriving from Real Madrid in August 2005, put the ball in the net but the goal was ruled out for offside.<br><br>Magpies boss Glenn Roeder had been able to select the Â£17million signing just once before Monday night - bringing him on as a second-half substitute against Birmingham in April last year.<br><br>But Owen completed the match and did not look too far off the pace to soften the blow of yet more injury problems for Roeder.<br><br>Antoine Sibierski withdrew shortly into the second half with a suspected broken arm and soon after Emre was stretchered off in considerable pain following what appeared to be an innocuous tackle.<br><br>Shola Ameobi, who has been out since November after undergoing hip surgery, replaced Sibierski to give Roeder more options for the two remaining games.<br><br>But it was Reading manager Steve CoppellÂ’s Midas touch which continued as the Royals climbed to seventh in the Barclays Premiership with a victory that catapulted them back into the UEFA Cup reckoning.<br><br>CoppellÂ’s side were nearly caught out early on though, when with barely a minute on the clock Owen dashed in to meet EmreÂ’s cross, only to fall inches short with a flag also raised for offside.<br><br>Owen had the ball in the back of the net in the seventh minute following a beautifully-worked move but once again the linesman came to ReadingÂ’s rescue.<br><br>Sibierski found Martins and the former Inter Milan marksman threaded a perfect ball through to Owen who raced clear and found the goal, only for NewcastleÂ’s celebrations to be silenced by a raised flag.<br><br>Reading had a penalty shout turned down when Titus Bramble sent Kevin Doyle tumbling with a robust shoulder-barge but referee Mike Riley waved play on.<br><br>Doyle then fired inches wide after a poor clearance from goalkeeper Steve Harper landed at his feet and moments later defender Michael Duberry blazed over the crossbar.<br><br>Nicky Shorey and Dave Kitson combined to good effect but NewcastleÂ’s defence recovered in the nick of time with Doyle lurking.<br><br>Hunt was booked for a rash challenge on Nolberto Solano as the chances at both ends dried up.<br><br>James Milner burst from midfield, easily evading a tackle by Seol and then escaping Duberry before hitting the top netting with a well-struck shot.<br><br>A crafty free-kick saw Owen release Kieron Dyer down the right with the England midfielder then squaring the ball dangerously across the face of goal, but keeper Marcus Hahnemann came to the rescue.<br><br>Reading broke free in the 44th minute but Doyle, who was being well marshalled by Solano, ran down a dead end with Kitson waiting on the edge of the area.<br><br>Dyer fired wide after being teed up by Owen shortly into the second half but Reading then breathed life into a game that had fizzled out after a bright opening.<br><br>Seol did the damage with a floated cross which fell perfectly for Kitson after John Oster had ducked to allow the ball to reach his team-mate.<br><br>Kitson made no mistake from 15 yards out, rifling home in emphatic style for his fourth goal in an injury-hit season and the 50th of his Reading career.<br><br>Sibierski was replaced by Ameobi after sustaining a suspected broken arm but the former England Under-21 international made a hash of a great chance moments after arriving on the pitch.<br><br>He was picked out by Milner but despite being unmarked and having time to compose himself, he directed his header straight at Hahnemann.<br><br>NewcastleÂ’s problems increased when Emre was stretchered off in the 61st minute following a strong tackle from Kitson.<br><br>The Reading hitman then nearly made it two for the home side after Doyle pounced on DyerÂ’s mistake, but he blasted just wide.<br><br>Martins was off-target with a routine header and Seol powered wide with a useful shot.<br><br>Newcastle finished the stronger side as they went in search of the equaliser but they could not deny Reading their 16th Barclays Premiership win of the season.</div>
