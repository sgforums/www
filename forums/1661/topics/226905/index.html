            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Borders Taking Reservations for 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'</strong><br><br>ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Harry Potter devotees were given a holiday surprise today as author J.K. Rowling unveiled the title of the seventh book in the popular series -- "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." Despite the fact that before today, no title had been announced, and there still remains no specific publication date or price, Borders began taking reservations for the highly anticipated book as of Dec. 8 in its stores nationwide.<br><br>In addition, since that time, Borders has featured a link on its <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bordersstores.com/</a> web site at http://www.bordersstores.com/features/feature.jsp?file=harrypotter7 allowing customers to sign up for email notification as soon as the book is ready to reserve online. This link will be emailed directly to millions of Borders customers today as well.<br><br>"We understand the deep devotion our customers have to Harry Potter and know that anticipation for this book has been building since the sixth book was released in 2005," said Borders Senior Vice President Linda Jones. "That's why in early December we began taking reservations in our stores for the seventh book and also began offering customers the opportunity to sign up for email notification as soon as the book is available to be reserved online as well. Borders is taking the lead with Harry Potter and we are sensing real excitement from our customers in response, even though we do not yet know when this book will be released. That's the kind of passion readers have for Harry Potter and we share their anticipation!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Punters placing bets on Harry Potter perishing Tue Dec 26, 11:35 AM ET</strong><br><br>LONDON (AFP) - The evil Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter himself are leading the field in betting on who will kill the schoolboy wizard in the last of the popular book series, British bookmaker William Hill has said.<br><br>Author Joanne "J.K." Rowling said last Thursday that the final instalment of the adventures is to be called "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", sparking speculation that the hero will meet his end.<br><br>"J.K mentioned that Harry might be killed off and the general consensus seems to be that... to ensure that Voldemort dies he will need to be sacrificed," said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams on Tuesday.<br><br>"Most of the early money has been for Harry, who has been cut from 10-1 to 6-1 and Voldemort remains the odds-on favourite (at 4-5)."<br><br>The first time William Hill opened a book on a "whodunnit?" was for the US television series "Dallas", with betting on who shot Texas oil baron J.R Ewing.<br><br>That proved so popular that wagers on the possible culprit outstripped money placed on horse racing in the last days of betting.<br><br>Also at 6-1 to pot Harry were his nemesis Draco Malfoy and his ginger-haired best friend Ron Weasley.<br><br>The bookmaker has pledged that all bets will be void and stakes returned if Harry survives.<br><br>It also revealed that money has been placed on Ron Weasley and school swot Hermione Grainger getting married with Harry as best man; Ron and Hermione to have a child called Harry; and Ron to kill Draco Malfoy in a duel.<br><br>The first six books in the Potter series have sold more than 300 million copies worldwide and been translated into 63 languages, making Rowling Britain's highest-earning woman.<br><br>The first four books have been adapted into hit films starring Daniel Radcliffe as the bespectacled boy wizard.<br><br>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", the fifth movie in the series, is currently being filmed and is due for release next year.<br><br></div>
