            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROEDER: OWEN'S BEST STILL TO COME</strong><br><br>Glenn Roeder has warned defenders around the world that Newcastle United and England striker Michael Owen has yet to produce his best form.<br><br>The 26-year-old has this week been given the go-ahead to step up his training as he recovers from the fractured metatarsal which has sidelined him since the turn of the year.<br><br>However, caretaker boss Roeder, who worked with Owen when he launched his international career as a teenager, believes there is more to come from a man who, fitness permitting, will embark on his third World Cup finals campaign this summer.<br><br>Asked if he feels just one or two games for his club at the end of the season would be enough to prepare Owen for the tournament, he replied: Â“Without doubt.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s naturally a very fit player and heÂ’s still very young.<br><br>Â“At times, I genuinely forget how young Michael still is. I said to him after he scored the two goals against Argentina 'We have waited a long time for that - since France 1998'.<br><br>Â“He said: 'Glenn, itÂ’s unbelievable, itÂ’s seven or eight years ago', and of course, he was only 18 then.<br><br>Â“What is he, 26 now? It seems as if heÂ’s been around forever and a day, but of course he hasnÂ’t.<br><br>Â“In fact, you could easily argue that for all Michael has already achieved, he could achieve even more in the future.<br><br>Â“I still donÂ’t believe you are at your very, very best, and I donÂ’t think you peak as a striker, until you are 26, 27.<br><br>Â“I think Michael, as unbelievable as it sounds, over the next few years is going to peak as a world-class striker.<br><br>Â“As long as he stays fit, there is even more to come from him and if I were a defender still, I would be very scared of that.Â”<br><br>Owen will again be missing as Roeder takes his side to Middlesbrough on Sunday, but his recovery is going so well that he is expected to start ball work over the next few days.<br><br>Â“We donÂ’t set dates because if you donÂ’t reach that date and heÂ’s not out training when he says heÂ’s going to be or playing, thereÂ’s hysteria all around the country,Â” said Roeder.<br><br>Â“All I know is, having seen Michael this week, heÂ’s very happy with the way things are progressing.<br><br>Â“He had another very good report from the surgeon at the beginning of the week and he told him to push on now, get back on the training ground and start working with the ball from the end of this week or the beginning of next.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s very positive on MichaelÂ’s situation.Â”<br><br>Magpies midfielder Kieron Dyer returns to the squad for the derby trip after being rested last weekend.<br><br>Dyer, who has missed most of the season through injury and illness, will be included provided he has no setbacks in training and he will be joined by defender Titus Bramble after he shook off a hamstring problem.<br><br>Celestine Babayaro (thigh), Scott Parker (glandular fever) and Steven Taylor (shoulder) are all still out.<br><br>Steve McClaren believes the quality of the Middlesbrough squad could make all the difference in the Tyne-Tees derby against their local rivals.<br><br>Boro claimed a dramatic 4-1 aggregate win over Basle to secure a place in the UEFA Cup semi-finals but only after vital goals from their substitues Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Massimo Maccarone.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s as great game to have because the supporters will demand a performance, the players will from themselves and each other,Â” McClaren said.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s good competition now for places - you have seen our bench and they are coming on and making a difference.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s important. ItÂ’s a squad game now and we will use that squad on Sunday against Newcastle.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a big game for us. This is a big week for this club - we have started it well, letÂ’s continue.Â”<br><br>However, Hasselbaink has warned his team-mates not to get to excited as they have not won anything yet.<br><br>Â“We are in the semi-final and to be fair, it was an historic night,Â” he said. Â“But we have done absolutely nothing yet.<br><br>Â“Yes, we are in the semi-finals, but now is the time to go to the final and to put on a great performance in the final and try to win it.<br><br>Â“Now we are so close we have to give our all and go to the final.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know anything about Steaua (Bucharest), but they must be a great side because they are in the semi-finals, so we cannot under-estimate them.<br><br>Â“We will see where it gets us.Â”<br><br>Boro defender Franck Queudrue is a doubt after Thursday nightÂ’s heroic UEFA Cup fightback.<br><br>BORO THROUGH AFTER STUNNING COMEBACK<br><br>The Frenchman, who also suffered a head injury, was substituted after aggravating a dead leg and he is likely to be joined on the sidelines by 18-year-old Lee Cattermole (ankle) who missed out against the Swiss side.<br><br>McClaren will take a head count before naming his squad but Emanuel Pogatetz (facial fractures) and Gaizka Mendieta (fractured metatarsal) are out for the season.<br><br>Middlesbrough (from): Schwarzer, Jones, Parnaby, Taylor, Southgate, Riggott, Ehiogu, Davies, Bates, Boateng, Doriva, Downing, Parlour, Rochemback, Morrison, Yakubu, Hasselbaink, Viduka, Maccarone.<br><br>Newcastle United (from): Given, Harper, Carr, Ramage, Moore, Bramble, Boumsong, Elliott, Solano, Bowyer, Emre, NÂ’Zogbia, Dyer, Clark, Faye, Brittain, OÂ’Brien, Shearer, Ameobi, Chopra.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi took advantage of a weakened Middlesbrough defence to fire his side to victory at the Riverside.<br><br>The 24-year-old set up the opener, an own goal by George Boateng, before sealing the points with a strike on the stroke of half-time, and he could have had more if he showed more composure in the early stages.<br><br>It meant back-to-back victories for Newcastle while Boro - who pulled a late goal back through Boateng - can concentrate on the two cup competitions they are still in.<br><br>The north-east derby fell three days after BoroÂ’s UEFA Cup exploits against Basle and three days before their FA Cup clash with Charlton Athletic.<br><br>With Gareth Southgate rested ahead of the tie against the Addicks, BoroÂ’s defence struggled against a lively attacking performance from Ameobi, supported by Alan Shearer.<br><br>Shearer did not have the chances of his strike-partner enjoyed, but it was clear the veteran wanted something from his last Tyne-Tees derby, throwing himself into tackles and using his frame to disrupt Boro defenders.<br><br>Franck Queudrue and Ugo Ehiogu were both sporting head bandages from kick-off, and NewcastleÂ’s powerful attacking pair immediately tried to take advantage of the patched-up Boro defence.<br><br>After four minutes Emre found Nolberto Solano in room on the right and the Peruvian crossed for Ameobi six yards out at the far post, but the striker flashed wide after his initial header failed to find Shearer.<br><br>Solano then tried his luck from long range, although his drilled effort flew over the bar and failed to trouble Boro goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.<br><br>Solano was seeing plenty of the ball on the right flank early on, and he caused panic in the Boro penalty area with a low cross, but Ameobi failed to capitalise when Ehiogu trod on the ball and temporarily lost his bearings.<br><br>Ameobi should have scored after 15 minutes when Solano chipped a ball to him behind the Boro defence. With the hostsÂ’ defenders expecting but not getting an offside flag, Ameobi flashed his volley wide and over.<br><br>Aiyegbeni Yakubu created the first Boro chance of note after exchanging lofted passes with Fabio Rochemback in the 20th minute, but the Nigerian striker could not get any power on his header as he ran through with just Shay Given to beat.<br><br>With the game always on the brink of becoming a heated encounter, Emre did little to help the situation with a heavy challenge on Boateng.<br><br>Referee Alan Wiley initially allowed play to continue before booking the Turkey international.<br><br>Ameobi was in the thick of the action, almost playing Lee Bowyer through in the 29th minute before Ehiogu cleared.<br><br>From the resulting corner Newcastle took the lead, Ameobi heading SolanoÂ’s set-piece to the far post where Boateng appeared to get the last touch as Bowyer and Titus Bramble challenged.<br><br>The visitors appeared to grow in confidence, with Charles NÂ’Zogbia off target twice with long-range efforts, the latter getting deflected for a corner.<br><br>Ameobi also thought he should have had a penalty, too, when he went down under the challenge of Chris Riggott in the area after Stephen Carr had pulled the ball back from the right.<br><br>Wiley waved play on but Ameobi was not made to wait long get on the scoresheet.<br><br>On the stroke of half-time Solano chipped a ball for Carr to surge into the penalty area and although the full-backÂ’s progress was halted, Ameobi drilled the loose ball into the far corner.<br><br>McClarenÂ’s response was to bring on Andrew Taylor and Mark Viduka at half-time for Queudrue and Adam Johnson, yet Boro were still frustrated, illustrated by Andrew DaviesÂ’ foul on Ameobi in a harmless area of the pitch.<br><br>Solano had a dangerous free-kick deflected for a corner after 54 minutes, with Shearer heading over the resulting set-piece.<br><br>Ameobi was eager to pounce on any indecision in the Boro defence, although he picked up a booking after 57 minutes when he robbed Doriva but went crashing into Boateng.<br><br>Bowyer was fortunate to escape sanction, however, three minutes later for his high challenge on Davies.<br><br>Davies, who had sustained an injury in a challenge from Bowyer, was replaced by Massimo Maccarone who received an ovation from Boro fans following his late goal against Basle.<br><br>Boateng pulled a goal back with a volley that deflected in off Bramble, but Newcastle held on for three points.<br></div>
