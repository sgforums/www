            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LIVERPOOL v NEWCASTLE UNITED, 2-0 Wed 20 Sep 2006</strong><br><br>Dirk Kuyt opened his account for his new club and Xabi Alonso scored a stunning goal from his own half to send Liverpool back into the top half of the Barclays Premiership.<br><br>The Holland striker rounded off a sweeping move by the home side in the 29th minute before Spain midfielder Alonso lobbed Newcastle UnitedÂ’s Steve Harper from 65 yards in the second half to secure a deserved win at Anfield.<br><br>AlonsoÂ’s brilliant effort was the second time he has scored from his own half in his Liverpool career after doing the same thing against Luton in last season's FA Cup third-round.<br><br>The win eased LiverpoolÂ’s anxiety after back-to-back league defeats to Everton and Chelsea and ended a scoreless run of three games.<br><br>Much of the pre-match debate centred around Liverpool boss Rafael BenitezÂ’s team selection and the role of captain Steven Gerrard.<br><br>Benitez chose to change his starting line-up for 92nd consecutive game, with Luis Garcia and Fabio Aurelio coming in.<br><br>The inclusion of Luis Garcia in place of Jermaine Pennant allowed Gerrard to switch from the unfamiliar left midfield slot he filled against Chelsea to the right.<br><br>He was soon racing up the centre of the field, however, as Kuyt played an inviting ball in the second minute but Harper, deputising for the injured Shay Given, was alert to the danger.<br><br>NewcastleÂ’s first opportunity came in the 10th minute when Liverpool half-cleared a corner but Jose Reina dealt comfortably with Scott ParkerÂ’s shot.<br><br>Liverpool were dominating the early possession and Craig Bellamy had an opportunity against the club he left in acrimonious circumstances last year when Luis Garcia played him through in the 13th minute. Harper was sharp and denied him from a tight angle.<br><br>Aurelio lined up a fierce shot from distance but Parker dived across to block and the Spaniard lost possession again to the same player when well-placed soon after.<br><br>Aurelio tried his luck again from a free-kick but the wall did its job and Harper coolly collected Luis GarciaÂ’s effort on the rebound. Luis Garcia had another opportunity after 26 minutes but Harper was again untroubled.<br><br>Newcastle were on the back foot and the hosts got the break they deserved in the 29th minute when Xabi Alonso played in Steve Finnan and the full-back crossed for Kuyt.<br><br>The strong-running Dutchman, without a goal since his move from Feyenoord last month, timed his run well and slid in to beat Harper from close range.<br><br>Kuyt tried to grab a spectacular second from a corner shortly before the interval but his ambitious bicycle kick from the edge of the area went high and wide.<br><br>Newcastle had a penalty claim turned down early in the second half when Shola Ameobi fell under pressure from Daniel Agger.<br><br>Liverpool responded to win a free-kick outside the area but Luis GarciaÂ’s cheeky attempt to push AlonsoÂ’s cross into the net with his hand did not go unnoticed by referee Mark Halsey.<br><br>Luis Garcia was booked but the Spaniard was back at his best seconds later as he pulled the ball across goal only for Kuyt to shoot wide.<br><br>Bellamy missed a glaring opportunity to add a second after 55 minutes when Gerrard pressured Peter Ramage and the Welshman raced in on Harper.<br><br>The home fans were ready to celebrate as Bellamy lifted the ball over the keeper but to his horror it rolled wide.<br><br>Aurelio curled in a dangerous free-kick just after the hour following a foul on Kuyt by Craig Moore but Harper palmed it past the post.<br><br>Liverpool were creating chance after chance and were again unlucky when Gerrard chipped in a fine ball for Luis Garcia but the Spaniard shot against the post.<br><br>Celestine Babayaro escaped an appeal for handball when Bellamy pulled the ball back from the byline and Kuyt headed wide from an Aurelio cross.<br><br>A second goal was no more than RedsÂ’ play warranted and it came in remarkable fashion as Alonso struck from his own half of the field for the second time in his Liverpool career.<br><br>Alonso tried his luck from 65 yards out and Newcastle watched in horror as Harper stumbled and fell as the ball drifted over his head into the unguarded net. It was the SpaniardÂ’s first goal since scoring from his own half against Luton in January.<br><br>Gerrard went close to adding a third but shot straight at Harper from a free-kick.<br><br>Newcastle had little to offer in response and Liverpool shut them out to claim their first Barclays Premiership clean sheet this season.<br><br></div>
