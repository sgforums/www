I know he's supposed to be dumb but he had the same expression every scene, then yeah it was choppy and  i dunno, some parts were quite good, i think it was the music composer, they should fire him. he ruined certain parts, which could have been better if they didn have music. bring back john williams please.<br><br>i thought i really like the cinematography or whatever it is, person. the part where they were being chased by the rain or dementors or whatever and the part at the end where harry was chasing bellatrix. <span style="color: white;">I KILLED SIRIUS I KILLED SIRIUS</span><br>and the part it went all silent where padfoot snuffed it<br><br>anyway i really like bellatrix, she was better than in the books!! you dare say his name you filthy halfblood! she was good!!<br><br>and it was better the 2nd time i watch it, i dunno why but i thought the pacing felt better. maybe it's just me cause it was exactly the same thing.<br><br>the death scene was too rushed, too sudden and it wasnt an avada kedevra in the book.<br><br>too many DA scenes they should have included other important scenes and where's the mirror sirius gave harry???<br><br>the duel scene at the end was spectacular! Grawp looked too fake, bad work on the CGI part, and the howler was horrible too, the COS howler looked better, this one was fake looking.</div>
