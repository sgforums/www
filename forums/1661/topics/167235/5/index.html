We probably got it right on the 30th take.Â” Katie, 19, said: Â“Daniel was a good kisser. I had so much fun filming it. We were a bit nervous, but I think after the first few takes we started to thoroughly enjoy ourselves.Â”<br><br>Daniel also revealed he has no idea what happens in the seventh and final Harry Potter novel Â— but said heÂ’d ordered a copy online.<br><br>Producers, meanwhile, are still looking for two actors to join cast for the sixth film, Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince.

Environmentalists look for plagues of rogue jellyfish in the Sea of Japan. And for a clue to the Japanese box office, Hollywood scrutinises the unforgiving Narita Index Â– the number of screaming women who greet a given star at the airport.<br><br>When he last landed in Narita for a Japanese premiere five years ago, Daniel Radcliffe was greeted by a hysterical brigade of 2,300 fans. WednesdayÂ’s arrival by the teenage actor Â– admittedly quite early in the morning Â– drew an emaciated platoon of just 30 autograph-seekers.<br><br>And, in Japan especially, Warner Brothers has plenty riding on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth instalment in its chronicles of the worldÂ’s most successful fictional character.<br><br>Related Links<br>Another spell in flicks for Potter fans<br>Student calls in Harry Potter to pay fees<br>Last Potter book signed under moon<br>Domestic films narrowly out-grossed Hollywood in Japan and ended a 21-year dominance by American movies. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the sole offering that prevented a total washout for Hollywood in 2006.<br><br>Collectively, Hollywood has decided that it might be time to treat its Japanese audiences with a little more respect. Hence, the latest Harry Potter film was the third Hollywood world premiere (after Spider-Man 3 and Pirates of the Carribean: Dead ManÂ’s Chest) to be held in Tokyo in three months.<br><br>On Thursday, in a lacklustre al-fresco cavalcade of special effects, a single beaming starlet and youthful glamour, you could see that the effort was being made. For their part, a relatively sparse throng of JapanÂ’s die-hard muggles at least pretended to take the tinseltown bait hook, line and sinker.<br><br>The film itself is a solid, occasionally spectacular, wizarding romp which struggles unsuccessfully to give us the thrills and fun we have not already had in previous instalments. It is far crueler than its predecessors and begins to introduce properly the idea that we are no longer in an amusing magical playground, but are en route to an epic confrontation with real victims.<br><br>The main story at this stage in the cycle is Harry and DumbledoreÂ’s quest to persuade an increasingly paranoid and uncomfortable wizarding world that its unspeakably vile nemesis, Voldemort (played by Ralph Fiennes), has returned. The acting skills of Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione) have improved, but not enough to truly flesh out the characters and provide the narrative depth this transitional, plot-advancing film needs. They have got Â“angryÂ” and Â“determinedÂ” down pat at this point, but struggle somewhat on the more nuanced grimaces. HarryÂ’s bellowing cod-psychoanalysis of Voldemort is jarringly awful.<br><br>Of the adult actors, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge - DumbledoreÂ’s usurper at Hogwarts - is exquisitely dislikable. Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is a shining but underused talent.<br><br>The director, David Yates, has inserted some lovely touches, including the Weasley twinsÂ’ explosive transfer from the world of academia to the world of retail. But overall there is a shortage of those joyful little glimpses of the wizarding worldÂ’s furniture that punctuated and perked up the previous films.<br><br>The fifth Â– and longest Â– book on which the film is based plays a crucial but faintly turgid role in the saga. Much is explained, much is left hanging and there is nothing like the pace of action that readers had grown accustomed to in earlier episodes (especially The Goblet of Fire). The book pulled this off because it was tantalising in what it didnÂ’t tell us. The film, meanwhile, a necessary digest of the 800-page book, leaves us faintly annoyed that the true denouement of the cycle is now two movies distant.<br><br>The chief problem, though, cannot be blamed on the film but on the near universal Potter-literacy of its prospective audience. Most Potter fans are now laser-focused on the release of the climactic seventh book in three weeksÂ’ time and its promise to resolve the countless loose-ends . As the waiting for the final book grows unbearable, there are moments when this otherwise enjoyable film, though nicely made and through no fault of its own, feels like a chore.<br><br>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is released in the UK on July 12 </blockquote></div>

Radcliffe, dressed in a white suit, said in simple Japanese.<br><br>"Order of the Phoenix'' was directed by David Yates, a Briton best known for the multilayered TV thrillers "State of Play'' and "Sex Traffic.''<br><br>The film opens as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is undergoing a gradual takeover by the bureaucratic Ministry of Magic and its emissary, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).<br><br>A sense of impending doom is heightened by a series of nightmares that link Harry (Radcliffe) ever more closely to the devilish Voldemort, bringing Rowling's saga into even darker territory.<br><br>There's also a new love angle: Harry's first kiss with fellow student Cho Chang (Katie Leung).<br><br>The Harry Potter books have been translated into 65 languages and sold more than 325 million copies since the first volume, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,'' was published in 1997.

Radcliffe and co-stars Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who play Harry's friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, have been at the center of the Potter storm for almost half their lives.<br><br>"It's just absolutely brilliant. He's an icon,'' said 17-year-old Radcliffe, explaining why he's been playing Harry for such a long time. "He is somebody whose character has gotten his generation of kids into reading. So it's an honor to play him.''<br><br>All three stars have signed up for the final two Potter films.<br><br>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' a Warner Bros. Pictures release, opens in the United States on July 11 and in Britain the next day<br></blockquote><img src="http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070628/i/r1169084784.jpg?x=279&amp;y=345&amp;sig=YWUSorFYwm6FYm5VwcCMuw--"><br><img src="http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070628/i/r486220173.jpg?x=380&amp;y=240&amp;sig=fqzbX4pXHO1OWwVow0fuFQ--"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more articles on the trio and hp.<br><br><strong>Daily Mail</strong><br><blockquote>The The Daily Mail has a interesting article called "Move over Hermione - there are three new girls vying for Harry Potter's attentions", this article touches Harry's story and also the actors from this movie:<br><br>"Today, though, there is nothing naive about Daniel Radcliffe, who is 18 in three weeks. He walks confidently into the room in a grey suit, black shirt and silver tie which give him more of a touch of Al Capone than Harry Potter.<br><br>Compared to Rupert, the same age, who lopes along beside him, all shaggy red hair, jeans and T-shirt, Daniel seems aeons ahead in sophistication. Perhaps appearing naked for the recent sell-out run of Equus in London's West End has led to Daniel's startling new maturity and stature.<br><br>Emma, the daughter of two lawyers and the only one of the three main characters still at school - she is at the Â£11,000-a-year Headington School in Oxford where she is studying for A levels - said: "You have your first cigarette or glass of alcohol in a safe environment with friends, or you choose to do it in a nightclub and you come out and you can't walk.<br><br>Emma says: "If I'm having boy troubles I'll occasionally track down Rupert and say, 'What is going on here, I don't understand.'" Daniel quickly interjects: "Don't ask what she means by boy troubles!"<br><br>Daniel, an only child, who lives with his parents - his father is a literary agent, his mother a casting agent - in Fulham, West London, is said to be likely to come into the Â£20 million fortune he has earned through his acting on his 18th birthday on July 23. That's just two days after the final book is published.<br><br>But one thing's for sure, Harry the heartthrob will work his magic."</blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/06/29/nosplit/bfpotter129.xml&amp;DCMP=ILC-traffdrv07053100" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/06/29/nosplit/bfpotter129.xml&amp;DCMP=ILC-traffdrv07053100</a><br><blockquote>How Harry Potter and friends grew up<br>Last Updated: 12:01am BST 29/06/2007<br><br>Who is Daniel Radcliffe's acting hero? How does Emma Watson rate her abilities? And why has Rupert Grint bought an ice-cream van? The Harry Potter stars talk to John Hiscock<br><br>Harry Potter homepage<br>In pictures: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br>Watch the trailer for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br>Video: Daniel Radcliffe on Harry Potter<br>Your view: is the Harry Potter franchise magic or malign?<br>They have spent almost half their lives on Harry Potter film sets, growing up in the magical but fictional world of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br>The Harry Potter cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson<br>But now, as the final book of J K Rowling's seven-part series is about to be released and the fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, arrives in cinemas on July 12, a world without Harry Potter is looming for the films' three young stars.<br><br>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint took time this week - production on the next film does not start until September - to ponder their pasts and speculate about what the future holds when they leave Hogwarts.<br><br>Radcliffe, 17, has already briefly shed his Harry Potter wizard robes for a well-received West End stint as the troubled young man who blinds horses in Equus. He has a film, The December Boys, awaiting release and is due to begin work on another, My Boy Jack, soon.<br><br>His height - 5ft 6in - would probably preclude a career as an action hero, but then his ambitions lie elsewhere. He has a keen sense of humour and a quick wit and, with Peter Sellers as his role model, has his sights on dramatic and light-comedy parts.<br><br>advertisement<br>"It was fantastic to do Equus but I'm not under the false impression that doing one different role will make people suddenly see me as an actor in my own right rather than the actor who plays Harry Potter," he said. "I think if I continue to do other interesting roles, hopefully people will start to see me differently."<br><br>Daniel was talking in a suite at Claridge's Hotel, having slipped virtually unnoticed past the paparazzi, dressed in a black T-shirt with the slogan: "Flying Saucers for Everybody". "It would probably be my policy if I was to run any kind of government," he deadpans.<br><br>"Somebody asked me today what I would do if I was a leader of a country and it would be flying saucers and unicycles - everybody needs a unicycle in life."<br><br>He has, he says, been plagued by strange dreams lately, although he cannot lay the blame at Harry Potter's door. "I've dreamt I'm being stalked by an England cricketer. I don't know what prompted it - although I've been watching huge amounts of cricket - but for some reason Andrew Strauss was being paid to stalk me. I woke up with a cricket bat in my hand."<br><br>On July 9, Radcliffe will cement his stardom by placing his hand prints on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, but he still finds the idea "really bizarre". "It's one of the things I get embarrassed about because it's such a massive honour. It's a very exciting prospect."<br><br>Despite having been in the eye of the Harry Potter storm for most of their childhoods, Radcliffe and his two co-stars seem remarkably well-adjusted and down to earth. "People ask me if I think I've had a normal childhood - and if a normal childhood is being healthy and happy, then I have," he says.<br><br>"I don't feel I've missed out on anything. Perhaps I've grown up slightly faster than some other people my age simply because from the age of 11 I've been surrounded by more adults than kids. I've had a working relationship with adults and that does change how you develop and mature. You possibly do grow up slightly faster.<br><br>"The other day, somebody said the last Harry Potter film will probably be released in 2010. I don't know how true that is, but if it's the case then that will have been 10 years of my life and that's a huge chunk, so I'll be sad because it will be the end of an era in a way. But I equally imagine it will be quite exciting to be out of that world."<br><br>Daniel is as interested as any of the millions of Harry Potter fans in finding out Harry's fate when the seventh and final book in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is out. "I have no idea what will happen," he says. "There's certainly a possibility that Harry might die. I've been told that people in Las Vegas are placing bets over whether he'll live or die, which is hilarious. Will it make me sad? No. I think if Harry dies in a heroic way, it's a good way for him to go."<br><br>Emma Watson, at 16 the youngest of the trio, has grown into an attractive young woman over the course of the films, but she is probably the least confident in her own abilities. While she sees a lot of her Hermione Granger character in herself - "We're both very stubborn, determined, loyal, academic feminists" - she believes any acting talent she has is instinctive and is unsure whether it will be enough to carry her on in after Harry.<br><br>"I'll feel a bit lost when it all finishes, I guess," she says. "It's hard to imagine life without Harry Potter. It's made up such a big part of my life and dominated so much time. It'll be really weird.<br><br>"Never having done an audition before and never having done any professional acting and going into the biggest film franchise of all time, I've kind of come from nowhere and gone straight in at the top. Where do I go from here? I feel like I need to backtrack and work my way through again. I'd be really interested to kind of train properly because I feel I shouldn't be here. I should have done so much more."<br><br>What she has gained, however, is valuable experience, and she had grown sufficiently in confidence to ask David Yates, the director of Order of the Phoenix, whether she was contractually obliged to do so many takes. (Yates, who likes 30 or so takes, gave a polite yes.)<br><br>"I got thrown in the deep end on the first one, but the Harry Potter films have been a pretty amazing acting school," she says. "When I got the part, the only thing I had apparently was some natural acting ability. I didn't know anything about making a film, and there was so much technically I had to learn and understand.<br><br>"I spent the first two films just constantly being in awe, not really knowing if I was doing it right, if I was any good or why I was there.<br><br>"I've worked with four directors now, all of different nationalities, ages and personalities and I've worked with animals, with huge amounts of special effects and stunts. And I feel like I've seen and done a lot, so I'm quite lucky and I feel I'm pretty well set up for any other project I take on. This is my fifth time around, and I feel so much more confident in my ability as an actress."<br><br>Watson, who was wearing blue Diesel jeans and a pink Chanel top, is being paid a reported Â£2 million for each of the final two films in the series, but insists that her drawn-out contractual negotiations were not money-motivated. "It was more about juggling my A-level exams, going to university and doing the movies," she says.<br><br>Apart from clothes, her biggest expense so far has been a laptop, although she will be buying a car as soon as she has passed her driving test. "I'm taking lessons, but it's so hard," she groans. "I had no idea."<br><br>She, too, is eagerly awaiting the final book. "It feels as if I've been waiting for ever. I really want to know what happens. There's a guy who claims he's been able to hack into J K Rowling's account, and he's saying that Hermione's gong to die, and I found myself getting sad. I hadn't contemplated her dying."<br><br>Watson, whose parents divorced when she was five, plans to take a gap year, go to university. And then, if things go as planned, with Hermione Granger behind her, she will return to acting. "I'm still growing up, changing all the time, and I hope I'm talented enough to take on another character. I guess that will be a test of whether I can really act."<br><br>Of the trio, 18-year-old Rupert Grint, who plays Ron Weasley, appears the least concerned about the end of the franchise.<br><br>He has appeared in two other films - Thunderpants and Driving Lessons - and, since leaving school at 16, he has spent much of his time on the golf course when not on the Harry Potter set.<br><br>"Cool" is his favourite adjective; it applies particularly to the ice cream truck he has bought and drives around Hertfordshire.<br><br>"I don't know why I bought it, but it's really cool," he says. "I've always had an interest in the ice cream industry. It's really cool; it's got a freezer in the back and a big kitchen with sinks. It's got a bell that plays a tune. It's really cool.<br><br>"The last few years have just been really fun all the time. I've enjoyed every moment of it. I suppose socially you miss out on a bit, like you don't get as much free time with your mates, but when I'm on the set I'm working with people I'm really close to because we've been doing it for so long now. I just have a good time doing it.<br><br>"I've learned a lot of set stuff because when I first started I'd only done a few school plays. If I can, I'd like to sort of carry on with acting."<br><br>He finds it "cool" that people recognise him in the street, although, he says, "It's something I'm still trying to get my head around." For the happy-go-lucky Grint, a death scene for Ron Weasley in the final film would also be "cool", but it is not something that he has thought too much about.<br><br>"It would be quite cool to have a death scene if it was a really cool battle scene, but I don't have any theories," he says. "It's going to be really sad when it all ends, and it's going to be weird because it's been a big part of my life.<br><br>"But I've got to do other things after Harry Potter so I'll just see what happens. I've still got my ice cream van if it doesn't all work out, so I'll be all right."<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>British teen actor Daniel Radcliffe has joined the lofty ranks of the highest paid film stars of all time. Joining the likes of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp, Dan just penned a deal that will pay him $50 million to star in the final two wizard films, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."<br><br><a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23402333-details/%2450+million+boy+Daniel/article.do" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23402333-details/$50+million+boy+Daniel/article.do</a><br><blockquote>Daniel Radcliffe has signed a $50 million deal to star in the final two Harry Potter films.<br><br>He will be paid $25 million to shoot penultimate book Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, and the same amount for the movie of J.K. Rowling's Potter finale, The Deathly Hallows.<br><br>Of course, after taxes, commissions to lawyers, agents and managers, he won't see that much of the cash, but it at least allows him to explore and experiment with his acting.<br><br>The money's also a nod towards the fact that the studio can't do the next Harry Potters without him - plus an acknowledgement that the boy wizard tag could harm him in the future.<br><br>In any event, he's cleverly carving out a post-Potter career and, as he proved with Equus on the London stage this year, he's serious about his chosen profession.<br><br>Daniel didn't miss a single performance at the Gielgud Theatre, insisting he go on even when incapacitated with flu.<br><br>All his preparation to play the troubled teenager Alan Strang in Equus (over a year before he did it on stage) informs his work - his best to date - on the latest Potter movie, The Order Of The Phoenix.<br><br>As I watched the film, I sensed a certain stirring quality about it and I kept thinking of Shakespeare's Henry V, particularly when Harry talks in the film about having "something worth fighting for".<br><br>Daniel, 18, laughed and said that, funnily enough, he had watched Kenneth Branagh's Henry V film "so I could work out the leadership thing".<br><br>It's a strong, engaging performance (as are those of his cast mates) and very different, of course, from when he first played Harry in The Philosopher's Stone six years ago.<br><br>"I don't recognise that boy," Daniel said.<br><br>But the actor had a certain charm about him even then, which is why audiences care so much about what happens to Rowling's boy wizard.<br><br>It's also to his credit that he doesn't care much about the money, but he's aware that, as one of his friends observed to him, "it will give you manoeuvre".<br><br>Daniel added: "Obviously, I'm in a very fortunate position where I don't have to do things for the money. I can simply do them because there's an interesting character and a good director involved."<br><br>He continued, without acknowledging or discussing an amount: "The money is absolutely fantastic and I'm very grateful, but it's not the main thing that drives me. Being on Fortune [magazine] lists is all very nice, but I am my own person. What people write about me doesn't make me who I am."<br><br>After he launches Harry Potter And The Order of Phoenix in Tokyo, London Los Angeles and New York, he will join David Haig and Kim Cattrall in World War 1 drama My Boy Jack, for Ecosse Films.<br><br>He then begins preparing to film The Half-Blood Prince, again with director David Yates - somehow scheduling in Equus on Broadway as well as shooting The Deathly Hallows.<br><br>Daniel is being because the Harry Potter films may end up consuming all his time.<br><br>But he knows it would be the opportunity of a lifetime for a teenage actor to star on the New York stage.<br><br>"It would be very hard to turn it down, certainly," he said.<br><br>A wizard of a young man.</blockquote></div>
