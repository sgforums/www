            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United began life after Alan Shearer in the same way as their talisman's career had ended as a resounding victory over West Bromwich Albion maintained their late charge for Europe and left the visitors near-certainties for relegation.<br><br>On the day the 35-year-old Magpies skipper confirmed his career had been brought to a premature conclusion by a knee injury, Nolberto Solano and Shola Ameobi took up the baton to fire their side to a comprehensive win.<br><br>The PeruvianÂ’s 30th-minute strike set the ball rolling and AmeobiÂ’s penalty nine minutes later capped an impressive first-half display by the Magpies.<br><br>West Brom rallied after the break but were propelled to the brink of relegation by NewcastleÂ’s fifth successive league win as Ameobi sealed the victory in injury time.<br><br>That form could yet see them rewarded with European football next season and land caretaker boss Glenn Roeder the job on a permanent basis.<br><br>Chairman Freddy Shepherd has been hugely impressed by a revival which has seen his side take 28 points from a possible 39, two more than Graeme Souness managed from 69 before he was sacked in February.<br><br>It was perhaps fitting that the game which marked the start of ShearerÂ’s retirement also saw 20-year-old midfielder Matty Pattison, who has already had to fight his way back from two serious knee injuries, make his first senior start.<br><br>ShearerÂ’s status on Tyneside is such that, with vital Barclays Premiership points and a European place up for grabs, the Geordie nation turned up to salute their hero for the last decade.<br><br>There is little doubt the former England striker will be missed badly, but in his absence for the first time since confirming his premature retirement there were other men ready to step up and take over his mantle.<br><br>Shearer was joined on the sidelines by Michael Owen, Scott Parker, Emre, Steven Taylor and, with a hamstring injury which seems certain to end his season and his World Cup hopes, Kieron Dyer, six men whose names would be among the first on the team-sheet.<br><br>Despite NewcastleÂ’s relative lack of strength, they overwhelmed the visitors before the break.<br><br>It was Michael Chopra, who scored his first top-flight goal for the club at Sunderland on Monday, who created the first, cutting in from the left to fire in a low drive which defender Neil Clement could only block to Solano.<br><br>The Peruvian, who had earlier rattled Tomasz KuszczakÂ’s crossbar with a dipping shot, steered the rebound into the empty net to give his side a deserved lead.<br><br>Clement was booked for a trip on Amady Faye as he raced in on goal, and then pushed Chopra in the 39th minutes as the pair challenged for a through-ball, referee Howard Webb pointing to the spot after glancing towards his assistant.<br><br>Solano has taken penalties before when Shearer has been missing but Ameobi grabbed the ball and hammered it low to KuszczakÂ’s right to make it 2-0.<br><br>Baggies boss Bryan Robson opted for radical change at the break, withdrawing Diomansy Kamara, Kevin Campbell and former Magpie Steve Watson and sending on Nathan Ellington, Junichi Inamoto and Kanu.<br><br>With Ellington and Kanu teaming up in attack, West Brom had a more positive shape and both Nigel Quashie and Inamoto fired in long-range efforts within the opening five minutes of the half.<br><br>A somewhat lethargic Newcastle were forced to endure an uncomfortable spell and skipper Shay Given was relieved to see a 57th-minute Zoltan Gera header fly wide after he met Jonathan GreeningÂ’s near-post corner.<br><br>The Magpies were unable to reproduce the flowing football they had served up before the break as they scrapped their way through a testing spell but, as West Brom faded again, they stepped up a gear.<br><br>Ameobi saw a 72nd-minute shot blocked by Curtis Davies but ShearerÂ’s brief emergence from the dug-out three minutes later sparked a crowd of 52,272 into full voice.<br><br>Chopra was unable to direct AmeobiÂ’s 80th-minute cross towards goal, but the home fans were already celebrating and gave Pattison a warm ovation when he was replaced by Lee Clark seconds later.<br><br>But it was left to Ameobi to further his claims on the now vacant number nine shirt with a third in injury-time as an emotional day came to a satisfactory end.<br><br></div>
