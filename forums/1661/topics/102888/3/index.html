            <div class='col-md body'>11 July 2005<br><br>EXCLUSIVE: GROWTH SPELL<br><br><strong>Harry Potter week: How movies' child stars became teen idols</strong><br>By John Hiscock<br><br>HE WAS just a geeky kid with a scarred forehead when he burst on to our cinema screens four years ago.<br><br>Since then little Harry Potter has turned from a shy schoolboy into a heroic young wizard who battles baddies and casts fabulous spells in a series of fantastic adventures.<br><br>And in an exciting behind-the-scenes visit to the set of the latest Â£65million blockbuster, it's evident the change in actor Daniel Radcliffe has been just as dramatic.<br><br>From an 11-year-old newcomer who hoped his voice wouldn't break before the end of filming, Daniel, now 15, has matured into a dashing young heart-throb.<br><br>He is one of Britain's richest teenagers, with an estimated fortune of Â£5.6million, and gets 1,000 fan letters a day.<br><br>Today the handsome young actor has taken time off from filming Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, the fourth film based on JK Rowling's stories, to talk about growing up on screen.<br><br>"Because I'm growing up alongside Harry I've got to know him very well," he says. "But I don't think I'm as like him as I was when I started."<br><br>Daniel is a keen golfer, enjoys pizza with his mates, watching football and listening to the Sex Pistols and the Stranglers.<br><br>And in November he starts filming his first film since Harry Potter, playing an orphan in 1960s Australia in December Boys. "I just love acting because it's the only thing I've really been good at," he says. "I have more confidence when I'm acting than when I'm doing anything at school, like writing and sports, which I've never been particularly good at."<br><br>Harry's pals Ron Weasley, played by Rupert Grint, 16, and Hermione Granger, played by Emma Watson, 14, have grown up too.<br><br>Bashful Emma likes Destiny's Child and playing tennis. She is reading the Philip Pullman trilogy His Dark Materials and never wears make-up except during filming.<br><br>"My parents are very careful that I cling on to normality, and when filming is over I go back to school with all my normal friends and do everything that I used to do," she says.<br><br>And Rupert, who has left school, says of his fame: "I had no idea things would be this big, so it was a bit of a shock at first. But you sort of get used to it and it seems normal after a while. I get recognised occasionally but it's not too bad."<br><br>Like the others, he gets plenty of fan mail. "The most interesting things are the gifts that people send me," he says. "I get quite a lot of pyjamas. It's a bit weird."<br><br>Working with teenagers has its drawbacks, and filming the latest movie, due for release in November, hit problems when the three main stars suffered an outbreak of acne. Producers had to bring in an expert to airbrush the spots from the final cut.<br><br>The sixth book, Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, is out on Saturday and movie bosses hope Daniel, Rupert and Emma will star in the film version of that, too.<br><br>But for now they are focusing on the fourth Potter story, Goblet Of Fire. It is darker, scarier and more magical than the first three. It has a violent and emotional ending, with the death of one of the characters and Harry has a face-to-face battle with Voldemort. Our hero also has to overcome another big challenge - teenage love.<br><br>Harry fixes his lovestruck eyes on a stunning young Oriental student named Cho Chang, played by Scottish-born Katie Leung. Daniel relishes his romantic new role.<br><br>"Harry is growing up and discovering girls and becoming a teenager," he says. "He's also coming to terms with a lot of demons he is being forced to face. He's a lot more vulnerable in this film." Ron looks on jealously at the budding romance. He has his eyes on Hermione - but she falls for a handsome international Quidditch star.<br><br>"He finds it really hard to get a date and he has some embarrassing situations when he asks girls out," says Rupert. "He's also really miserable because he's jealous of Hermione." Emma smiles: "Hermione is totally swept off her feet and that's nice. She doesn't know what's happening to her."<br><br>The young actors are talking during a break in filming at Leavesden Studios, a former Rolls-Royce aircraft factory in Hertfordshire. The entire airfield has been converted into the world of Harry Potter: the Great Hall, the Gryffindor common room and dormitory, Hagrid's Hut, the Clocktower Courtyard, Quidditch stadium and the town of Hogsmead.<br><br>The area is so vast that everyone uses golf carts, scooters or bicycles to get around.<br><br>One major addition to the set is a giant water tank - the biggest in Europe. It was built for Harry's underwater fight with the "mer-people" who take Ron hostage.<br><br>Daniel trained for seven months, starting off in his local swimming pool with scuba tanks. "I learned to take the tank off and share air and clear my goggles and things like that," he says. "So after all that training I got the hang of it and I was pretty much ready to dive."<br><br>He did so well that for Christmas the stunt department gave him a diving log book containing a record of all the dives he did for the film and the time he spent under water.<br><br>"It came to more than 41 hours, not counting the training, so I was pretty pleased with that," he beams.<br><br>T HE movie's dragons, werewolves, gigantic spiders and other magical creatures have all been created in a workshop on the airfield, but there are also some new human faces.<br><br>Miranda Richardson plays nosy newspaper reporter Rita Skeeter, who is determined to dig up the dirt on Harry. Ralph Fiennes is Voldemort and Brendan Gleeson plays a new Hogwarts teacher, Mad-Eye Moody.<br><br>There is a school dance at which the music is provided by the wizard rock band Weird Sisters, consisting of Jarvis Cocker from Pulp and Jonny Greenwood and Phil Selway from Radiohead. Cocker, a Potter fan, wrote three of the songs for the film.<br><br>As an ever-changing cast of extras wait hours for the cameras to roll, they fill in the time by doodling in notebooks - and some of the girls' thoughts are X-rated.<br><br>"They tend to get carried away," laughs Tom Felton, 15, who plays Draco Malfoy.<br><br>Like his co-stars, Felton has grown since the first film, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone. "The older he gets the more threatening and dangerous he becomes," he says. "He's a physical threat rather than being an annoyance."<br><br>Despite their growing pains, producer David Heyman expects Daniel, Emma and Rupert to be in all the films based on the seven books JK Rowling has promised to deliver, although their original contract was for four.<br><br>"There may come a day when the kids make a decision that they want to move on, but we haven't reached that point yet," he says.<br><br>"In the books the children continue to grow. So by the seventh book they will be 17 or 18 and so will Daniel, Rupert and Emma."<br><br>The new book..5 days to go<br><br>EVERY day this week, I'll be bringing you up to date with the Harry Potter saga, so you'll be raring to go when the sixth book is published on Saturday. Today, the first book in the series, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone.<br><br>ORPHAN Harry Potter lives with his only surviving relatives, the dreadful Dursleys, and leads a very miserable life.<br><br>One day a giant called Hagrid appears and tells Harry he's a wizard and is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br>He boards the Hogwarts express on the secret platform 93/4 at King's Cross and meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Hermione is my favourite character because I think I'm just like her.<br><br>The trio step into a magic world with ghosts, strange creatures and a game on broomsticks called Quidditch. Harry makes an enemy, Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts, the friends stumble across a trapdoor guarded by a giant three-headed dog. He is protecting the Philosopher's Stone, which can make you immortal. Someone is trying to steal it.<br><br>Poor Harry learns that a dark wizard called Voldemort killed his parents and tried to kill him when he was a baby. But he has lost a lot of his powers and needs the stone to regain his strength.<br><br>The friends race against time to get to the stone first. It's protected by spells and enchantments, but they manage to bypass them. Harry is then faced with a final battle with Voldemort. Protected by a charm from his mother, Harry wins the battle, gets the stone and because of their bravery the friends win the school cup for their house Gryffindor.<br><br>When filming's over I go back to normal life<br><br>- EMMA WATSON (HERMIONE)<br><br>THE Harry Potter films have grossed more than Â£1.35billion. Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets was the UK's fastest ever selling DVD.<br><br>JK Rowling is the world's first billionaire author and, the richest woman in Britain apart from the Queen. - mirror.co.uk</div>
