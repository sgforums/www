            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEWCASTLE UNITED v CHELSEA, 0-0 Sun 22 Apr 2007</strong><br><br>Newcastle United tipped the title race back into Manchester United's favour after they held Chelsea to a goalless draw at St James' Park.<br><br>A day after derby rivals Middlesbrough had opened the door for the reigning champions, the Magpies slammed it shut to leave United three points clear at the top.<br><br>Glenn RoederÂ’s side were more than good value for their point after limiting the Blues to only one effort on target, and that came 10 minutes from time.<br><br>However, Jose MourinhoÂ’s side may live to regret misses from Frank Lampard, Salomon Kalou and at the end, substitute Joe Cole, as they rallied after the break but could not extend their run of nine successive Barclays Premiership victories.<br><br>But things could have been even worse for Chelsea had goalkeeper Petr Cech not got down to block Kieron DyerÂ’s 59th-minute shot, and the Magpies left the field to warm applause from a crowd of 52,056 after a second successive home draw against one of the top-four sides.<br><br>Chelsea arrived on Tyneside knowing victory would take them to within a point of United a day after they were held 1-1 at Old Trafford by the MagpiesÂ’ derby rivals Middlesbrough.<br><br>However, they did so knowing that was something they had not managed to achieve in the league at St JamesÂ’ Park in four visits.<br><br>Newcastle have had an intensely frustrating capacity this season to save their best for the Barclays PremiershipÂ’s big guns, and having taken all three points from Liverpool and one apiece from United and Arsenal already, they were determined to extend that record.<br><br>For 45 minutes, they looked more than capable as RoederÂ’s men made the double champions look distinctly ordinary and limited them to two attempts on goal, neither of which troubled goalkeeper Steve Harper.<br><br>John TerryÂ’s wayward 36th-minute header and a wild long-range striker from full-back Wayne Bridge on the stroke of half-time were as near as the Blues, who lost Michael Ballack to injury after just 18 minutes, came to calling Harper into action.<br><br>That was due in the main to a spirited display from the Magpies, for whom captain Nicky Butt was tenacious in midfield and central defender Steven Taylor little short of faultless as he marshalled Didier Drogba to such an extent that the striker started to lose his composure as the game wore on.<br><br>For their part, Newcastle created few genuine chances, but always looked the more likely scorers.<br><br>Antoine Sibierski caused problems for both Cech and full-back Paulo Ferreira with a second-minute header, while Dyer saw a shot deflected wide eight minutes later.<br><br>Obafemi Martins went close with another effort which flew behind off a Chelsea leg and then whistled a 25-yard drive past the post with the home fans sensing an opportunity to have a major say in the destination of the title.<br><br>However, Chelsea returned in determined mood and had two opportunities to take the lead within three minutes of the restart.<br><br>Lampard shot over in the 47th minute after Kalou had twisted his way past Solano and Titus Bramble to lay the ball back into his path.<br><br>Kalou caused problems again seconds later to pick out Shaun Wright-Phillips, but when he pulled the ball square for Drogba, his attempt to curl a shot into the top corner was woefully high and wide.<br><br>Mourinho replaced Wright-Phillips with Cole on 55 minutes, but the Magpies went close four minutes later.<br><br>Dyer was given the benefit of a marginal offside decision to run on to ButtÂ’s through-ball, but Cech made a vital block.<br><br>Martins headed over from MilnerÂ’s corner, but the drama switched swiftly to the other end when Cole found himself in space on the left on 62 minutes.<br><br>LampardÂ’s effort from his low cross was blocked and Kalou miskicked as he slid in, allowing Butt to tidy up.<br><br>Sibierski headed over from MilnerÂ’s cross two minutes later, but it was Chelsea, aided by the arrival of substitute Andriy Shevchenko, who finished stronger.<br><br>They got their first attempt on target when Drogba flicked in a header at the near post, but Harper was equal to the task.<br><br>Martins headed over from a Milner cross and substitute Andy Carroll blasted across the face of goal in injury-time.<br><br>However, Cole might have snatched victory in the final seconds when he got a touch on Paulo FerreiraÂ’s cross, only to see his effort spin agonisingly wide of the far post.<br><br></div>
