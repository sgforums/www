            <div class='col-md body'><strong>WESTERVELD SET FOR EVERTON DEBUT</strong><br><br>On-loan goalkeeper Sander Westerveld will make his debut for Everton at Newcastle United on Saturday.<br><br>The former Liverpool keeper has joined on a 28-day deal from Portsmouth because Nigel Martyn and Richard Wright are injured and Iain Turner is suspended.<br><br>Phil Neville, Tony Hibbert and Duncan Ferguson are also banned while Nigeria defender Joseph Yobo returns to the squad after the African Nations Cup.<br><br>Westerveld, who will become only the 14th man to play for both Everton and Liverpool since the war, has fallen out of favour at Fratton Park and played just seven first-team games this campaign.<br><br>The Dutchman said: Â“I havenÂ’t been playing much and I had a difficult time at Portsmouth.<br><br>Â“This is an opportunity for me and I am hoping to help the team. And I hope they help me and it will all be very positive.<br><br>Â“When you are with a team at the bottom there is pressure and everything is very difficult. So it is good to step out of that into an environment that is a lot more positive.<br><br>Â“I had an opportunity to go on loan to Championship clubs, and I didnÂ’t like that situation. For me this is perfect with a Premiership club who are doing well at the moment."<br><br>Westerveld added: Â“I have a lot of friends around Liverpool, I enjoyed my time at Anfield and it is good to be back in the city.<br><br>Â“I have had a few interesting derby matches against Everton - I was sent off once - but this new move is something I am looking forward to.Â”<br><br>Everton, who are unbeaten in seven league games and in a much healthier position than before Christmas, are beginning to look towards Europe rather than the relegation battle.<br><br>And manager David Moyes said: Â“The league table makes better reading than it did a few months ago, but I aim to get us into the top 10 and stay there.<br><br>Â“We are going to need to win most of our last 12 to get us into a position to even compare with last season.<br><br>Â“We want to keep this run going, and the way we have been playing I believe we can do it.<br><br>Â“I havenÂ’t been re-assessing targets just because we have been doing well. The season has been so up and down for us, we have gone five games without a win and then won several.<br><br>Â“We are finding it difficult to really understand where we are, but we are certainly happier with our current form and position.<br><br>Â“We have 12 games to go, and if we can maintain this level of consistency we will end up in a very decent position."<br><br>Newcastle captain Alan Shearer will be given until the last minute to prove his fitness ahead of the St James' Park clash.<br><br>The 35-year-old has missed the last two games with a calf problem and remains a major doubt, while Kieron Dyer and Titus Bramble (both hamstring) are definitely out and could be for up to three weeks.<br><br>Full-back Celestine Babayaro returns after suspension, but Michael Owen (foot), Stephen Carr (hernia) and Steven Taylor (shoulder) remain on the casualty list.<br><br>Caretaker boss Glenn Roeder revealed he is only looking at three points against Everton as speculation over the identity of the next Newcastle United manager increases.<br><br>The clubÂ’s Academy manager, promoted by Graeme SounessÂ’ sacking earlier this month, has managed three wins and a draw in his four games in charge to date.<br><br>As he prepared his players for a vital game, big money was being wagered on fansÂ’ favourite Martin OÂ’Neill, while Wigan Athletic boss Paul Jewell sought to distance himself from the vacant post.<br><br>However, Freddy Shepherd is expected to take his time to make an appointment, and that could mean the wait will continue for some time yet.<br><br>In the meantime, Roeder will simply get on with a job he admits he is enjoying, although he does not know for how long.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s a case of after the first game, just get the second game organised and get through the second game, and then the third, then the fourth,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“As far as IÂ’m concerned, my remit is to get the team organised and motivated and hopefully, we go and win the game on Saturday against Everton.<br><br>Â“What happens next week for the club and for me, who knows? I havenÂ’t looked any further than Everton.Â”<br><br>Asked if his success to date had changed his mind about seeking the job on a permanent basis, he replied: Â“I donÂ’t see why thereÂ’s any reason to change my mind. IÂ’m just concentrating on winning the next game.<br><br>Â“It (the speculation) doesnÂ’t make anything more difficult for me. IÂ’m not surprised these names are being bandied around because they are top-class managers.<br><br>Â“But it doesnÂ’t make one iota of difference to me whatsoever. As a player, I was very calm, and now as a manager or coach, IÂ’m a very calm person.<br><br>Â“All I have got to concentrate on now, myself and the boys, is getting a result against Everton. There isnÂ’t anything else worth thinking about as far as Newcastle is concerned.Â”<br><br>Roeder's assistant Shearer freely admits he much prefers playing to occupying the seat he has in the dug-out for the last two games, but Roeder is convinced that is where he will eventually end up.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’s looking the part and waiting to be the part, which IÂ’m sure heÂ’s going to be,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Being around him every day, I can see no reasons why he canÂ’t become a top manager as and when he moves on to the management side.<br><br>Â“I certainly agree with his decision not to push himself forward too soon - that could be a big mistake, but again because of his intelligence, he knows that.<br><br>Â“I think he will go away, gain experience and bring himself forward at the right time.<br><br>Â“He will know when that is, just as he knows when itÂ’s the right time to break into the box and score a goal.Â”<br><br>Newcastle United (from): Given, Harper, Ramage, Boumsong, Elliott, Babayaro, Parker, Emre, Solano, NÂ’Zogbia, Bowyer, Clark, Brittain, Pattison, Shearer, Ameobi, Luque, Chopra.<br><br>Everton (from): Westerveld, Yobo, Weir, Stubbs, Ferrari, Nuno Valente, Arteta, Cahill, Davies, Osman, Kilbane, Naysmith, Carsley, McFadden, Beattie, Ruddy, Anichebe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nolberto Solano brought Everton's unbeaten Barclays Premiership run to an abrupt halt to hand Newcastle United a fourth victory in five games under caretaker manager Glenn Roeder.<br>The Peruvian slid home Charles NÂ’ZogbiaÂ’s 64th-minute cross to open the scoring, and produced a stunning finish 14 minutes from time to take his goal tally for the season to five.<br><br>It was a strike of which injured skipper Alan Shearer would have been proud as David MoyesÂ’ men tasted defeat for the first time in eight league outings and only the second in 12 in all competitions.<br><br>But despite Turkey midfielder Emre twice having to clear David Weir headers off the line before the break, the Magpies were good value for their victory as they kept a fourth clean sheet under former defender Roeder to delight the bulk of a crowd of 51,916.<br><br>With ShearerÂ’s name once again missing from the team-sheet, the home fans arrived wondering where the goals were going to come from against a side which had won six and drawn one of their last seven league games.<br><br>On Wednesday night, the Magpies enjoyed more than their fair share of possession against Charlton Athletic, but failed to create enough chances to win the game, Shola Ameobi squandering the best of them 14 minutes from time.<br><br>Caretaker boss Roeder again asked Emre to provide the support to lone striker Ameobi but, in the event, his most crucial contributions in the opening 45 minutes came on his own goal-line.<br><br>Twice the former Inter Milan star hacked Weir headers off the line as a makeshift Newcastle defence, which was coping reasonably well in open play, lost their bearings from Mikel ArtetaÂ’s corners.<br><br>It was the Spaniard too who forced Shay Given into his only save of the half with a minute remaining, the Irishman tipping a dipping free-kick over the bar as it sped towards him on a bitterly cold Tyneside wind.<br><br>However, for all that the visitors created three excellent chances to take the lead, the home side had more than their fair share of possession and might themselves have gone in ahead at the break.<br><br>Four opportunities fell to Lee Bowyer alone as he dragged a left-footed shot just wide, saw another effort deflected over and then fired across goal and headed over the top.<br><br>But NewcastleÂ’s best chance came in first-half injury-time when NÂ’Zogbia escaped from Joseph Yobo on the left and squared for Solano, whose shot was palmed away by loan signing Sander Westerveld in the Everton goal.<br><br>But having finished the first half strongly, the home side started the second beset by a strange lethargy as the visitors pinned them back again.<br><br>That changed when Scott Parker and Solano combined well on the edge of the Everton box before the Peruvian found Ameobi, although his shot was charged down.<br><br>As play switched quickly from end to end, Leon Osman saw the whites of GivenÂ’s eyes two minutes later, but his right-footed snap-shot flew wide of the keeperÂ’s left post.<br><br>There was little to choose between the sides, although Bowyer might have done better with a first-time effort after NÂ’Zogbia had cut out YoboÂ’s clearance and played the ball into his run on 59 minutes.<br><br>Robbie Elliott had to block a Tim Cahill shot after Celestine Babayaro had neglected his defensive duties, but the breakthrough finally came at the other end with 64 minutes gone.<br><br>Emre did well on the left to hold the ball up and the lay it into NÂ’ZogbiaÂ’s path, and the Frenchman cut into the box before delivering the perfect low cross for Solano to slide home the opener from close range.<br><br>It could have been 2-0 within seven minutes when, after Westerveld had prevented Bowyer from finishing off a flowing attack, Parker thumped a volley just wide from the resulting corner.<br><br>Cahill, who had earlier been injured in a challenge with Parker, was replaced by Lee Carsley with 16 minutes remaining, but the home side were pushing to kill the game off.<br><br>And they did so in superb style with 14 minutes remaining when Bowyer rolled the ball into SolanoÂ’s path and the South American curled a shot beyond Westerveld with the outside of his right foot.<br><br>Yobo might have pulled one back with an 86th-minute header from ArtetaÂ’s free-kick, and James Beattie fired wide at the death, but the clean sheet was just reward for a committed Toon performance.<br><br></div>
