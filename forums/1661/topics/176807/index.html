            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has launched a search for the fifth manager of his reign after asking skipper Alan Shearer to help drag his side out of a relegation fight.<br><br>ShepherdÂ’s decision to sack Graeme Souness came within hours of Wednesday nightÂ’s 3-0 Barclays Premiership defeat at Manchester City, which left the Magpies 15th in the league table and just six points clear of third-bottom Birmingham City.<br><br>Academy chief and former West Ham United boss Glenn Roeder will be in charge for SaturdayÂ’s vital league clash with struggling Portsmouth at St JamesÂ’ Park, with 35-year-old Shearer having taken a further step towards the hot-seat after being asked to assist the caretaker boss.<br><br>Â“I am obviously saddened at the way things have worked out at St James Park,Â” said Souness in a brief statement. Â“I have enjoyed living and working in Newcastle, and my family and I have been made to feel particularly welcome by the Geordies.<br><br>Â“I wish the club, the players and the supporters good fortune and success going forward.Â”<br><br>The ScotÂ’s departure was confirmed on Thursday morning in a brief statement from the club.<br><br>Â“Newcastle United today (Thursday) announced that the employment of Graeme Souness has been terminated with immediate effect,Â” it read.<br><br>Â“Glenn Roeder will take charge of first-team affairs for the immediate future. Roeder will be assisted by captain Alan Shearer and will be caretaker manager for SaturdayÂ’s home Premiership game against Portsmouth at St JamesÂ’ Park.Â”<br><br>Roeder insists he and the side must now focus on Saturday's clash.<br><br>"All our thoughts, and all our energies will be directed at beating Portsmouth," he told official club website www.nufc.co.uk.<br><br>"All we can do is gather ourselves and go and pick a team that is going to beat Portsmouth on Saturday afternoon."<br><br>"It won't be easy but we will lift the spirits and be very positive about the whole thing."<br><br>After the defeat to Manchester City, Souness admitted he was feeling the pressure due to the Â“passionateÂ” support Newcastle receive.<br><br>Â“It's common knowledge in football that the supporters up here love their football club and it means so much to them. They are madly, madly passionate for their football club,Â” said the Scot.<br><br>Â“That makes it so attractive, but when you are not winning games, that can mean there's a big downside to it as well, and you have to accept that.<br><br>Â“But it's a special place to be involved in the football at Newcastle. I think there are only two or three other clubs in the country where that passion exists.Â”<br><br>Souness has been beset by injuries this season and having club record summer signing Michael Owen sidelined has been a major blow in recent weeks as the goals he scored after his arrival had given the Magpies a boost.<br><br>Other high-profile signings were made during SounessÂ’ time on Tyneside but failed to have the desired effect.<br><br>Albert Luque was signed from Deportivo La Coruna, defender Jean-Alain Boumsong cost Â£8million last season and several other summer signings such as Scott Parker and Emre were recruited.<br><br>But ultimately results did not pick up, and SounessÂ’ downfall came with the Magpies languishing in 15th place, facing the prospect of a relegation scrap rather than securing the European place their expenditure demanded.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Feb. 3, 2006<br>Shearer rules himself out of Newcastle job<br><br>Newcastle striker Alan Shearer has ruled himself out of the running to succeed Graeme Souness as the Magpies' next manager.<br><br>Souness was sacked by Newcastle after a dreadful run of results that has left the club facing the possibility of a relegation fight in the Premiership.<br><br>Former England captain Shearer is to assist caretaker manager Glenn Roeder as the club look for a long-term successor to Souness but he has no intention of applying for the job full-time.<br><br>The 35-year-old, who also said Roeder does not want the post, told The Sun: 'This is my club, I will always be black and white. But let me say here and now that I do not want to be the next manager, the time is not right for me or the club.<br><br>'That is not meant as a slight on the club. I am just thinking of what is best for Newcastle United and, right now, it would not be the best thing to have Alan Shearer as manager.<br><br>'I have stood up and said that to the players and Glenn has ruled himself of being the permanent boss too.<br><br>'Things are set up for someone to do well. I hope that someone is the next manager. I just know it will not be me.<br><br>'Hopefully I won't get the chance for a while because that would mean the man in charge was doing a good job.'<br><br>Shearer admitted he was sorry to see Souness go and felt he had been badly affected by injuries to key players.<br><br>He said: 'I can only have sympathy for Graeme. He worked his socks off trying to get things right here.<br><br>'But he was hampered by a horrendous injury situation that no team could have coped with.'<br><br>The Magpies have claimed just one point in their last six Premiership matches and are just six points above the relegation zone.<br><br>But Souness expressed his disappointment at being forced out, saying: 'I'm saddened at the way things have worked out.<br><br>'I have enjoyed living and working in Newcastle, and my family and I have been made to feel particularly welcome by the Geordies.<br><br>'I wish the club, the players and the supporters good fortune and success going forward.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from soccernet.<br><br>Updated: Feb. 3, 2006<br>Lawro: Souey paid price for faith in Boumsong<br><br>Sacked Newcastle manager Graeme Souness has walked into a broadside from his former Liverpool team-mate Mark Lawrenson.<br><br>The BBC pundit has criticised Souness signings Jean-Alain Boumsong and Celestine Babayaro, branding Boumsong 'the biggest joke in the Premiership'.<br><br>Lawrenson wrote in the Daily Mirror: 'The worse Boumsong became the more pig-headed and determined Souness was to dig his heels in and keep on playing him - even though it was costing the team goals and points.<br><br>'Boumsong has become the biggest joke in the Premiership.<br><br>'Souness had assembled a half-decent midfield and his attack is good but they stand no chance with such a poor defence. The Frenchman has become one of the worst players in the Premiership.<br><br>'And it doesn't stop there. Fancy bringing in Celestine Babayaro to strengthen your defence. He doesn't know the meaning of the word.'<br><br>Newcastle caretaker manager Glenn Roeder, who will be assisted by Alan Shearer, has spoken of the brain tumour he had removed two and a half years ago - and his commitment to the Magpies cause.<br><br>He said: 'I'm not going to recommend anyone to go through what I went through. But if there has been any good to come out of it it is that I do not waste time worrying about things any more.<br><br>'My operation and what I went through allowed me to put things into perspective more than I ever had before.<br><br>'I don't know if this will be for one game, one month or the rest of the season but however long it lasts I know it is a big challenge.<br><br>'Alan [Shearer] has a key role and I couldn't wish for anybody better to assist me. His knowledge of football is absolutely first class. Everyone has got to move forward. I have to get my head down and come up with some answers.'<br><br></div>
