            <div class='col-md body'>Phil Holland<br><br>If someone does you a favour by trying to help you out of financial difficulty it really isn't the done thing to make unreasonable demands of them a little further down the line. It certainly isn't the done thing in real life, but then this isn't a story about real life, it's a story of a fallen footballer and the man who paid for him.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Newcastle United chairman Freddy Shepherd has threatened to get a court injunction to prevent Michael Owen from playing for England in either June's friendly against Brazil, or more controversially, in the vital Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia.</span><br><br>Why? Well, the saga began last year on June 25th during England's World Cup campaign when Owen fell awkwardly against Sweden and ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee; an injury from which he has yet to fully recover.<br><br>Since that day Newcastle's Â£17million ($34million) club record signing has been unavailable for selection - in fact, since joining the Magpies in August 2005 he has played just 11 games for the first team as a result of injuries, despite netting an impressive 7 goals.<br><br>Shepherd believes that the FA owes Newcastle money to help cover costs relating to Owen's rehabilitation and also wouldn't say no to at least part of the Â£10million cost of replacing him with Obafemi Martins. So incandescent is Shepherd that he is prepared to go to court over the matter.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Not only is this an unprecedented and aggressive stance to take, but when you factor in the financial assistance the FA has already provided, it also smacks of ungratefulness.<br><br>For example, Soho Square officials flew to Switzerland making a personal representation on Newcastle's behalf at FIFA headquarters which directly resulted in a Â£2million compensation deal from the world governing body's insurance fund for players injured at the World Cup. Plus the FA's own insurance covers half of Owen's weekly Â£120,000 wages because he was injured while on England duty. </span><br><br>However, for Newcastle, whose own insurance covers the other half of Owen's salary, this is not enough support.<br><br>'They [The FA] have not paid the price of even an aspirin for Michael since he left their care', moans Shepherd. 'They have refused point-blank to pay us, despite it costing us well over Â£150,000 to aid his recuperation', a figure relating to the cost of two operations at the Colorado clinic of expert surgeon Dr Richard Steadman.<br><br>Of course, one can appreciate Newcastle's frustration at losing an expensive player while on England duty, one you had hoped could get you 20 goals a season; but to round on the FA in such a way, particularly when they have helped to soften the financial blow, is surely not a wise move politically.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The interesting denouement to this story relates to Owen's insurance cover. Under the terms the 27-year-old's wages can continue to be paid until the anniversary of the injury being sustained, meaning that the club could make a considerable saving if the player does not return this season. </span><br><br>Owen had been targeting a return against Chelsea at St James Park on Sunday. But despite playing 70 minutes of a reserve game against Gretna last week, Owen has been withdrawn from this week's reserve game against Middlesbrough.<br><br>With Shepherd and manager Glenn Roeder's insistence that Owen will not be rushed back coming against a backdrop of arguments over money, it is all too easy for the cynic to draw a correlation with the player's stalled comeback. <span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><br><br><a href="http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=422734&amp;root=england&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab1pos1&amp;cc=4716" rel="nofollow">http://soccernet-akamai.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=422734&amp;root=england&amp;lpos=spotlight&amp;lid=tab1pos1&amp;cc=4716</a></div>
