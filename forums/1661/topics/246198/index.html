            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle United have announced plans to increase the capacity of St James' Park to more than 60,000 as part of a planned Â£300million development scheme.<br><br>Under the Number 1 St JamesÂ’ Park project, which is yet to be submitted to planning chiefs, a three-phase programme would see a major conference centre, hotels and luxury apartments built at the ground.<br><br>Funding for the development would come from outside the club.<br><br>Chairman Freddy Shepherd told official club website www.nufc.co.uk: Â“What we are proposing is something not just for the football club, but for the whole city and the people of Newcastle.<br><br>Â“Having a conference centre would allow Newcastle to attract top events in all fields, and the whole project will stand as a monument to the vibrant development of the city in the new millennium.Â”<br><br>The announcement comes three days after the clubÂ’s latest interim figures revealed an operating loss after player trading and amortisation of Â£6.9million.<br><br>In addition, a 1-0 home defeat by Manchester City on Saturday left the Magpies in 11th place in the Premiership.<br><br>However, while Shepherd is determined to get things right on the pitch, he is equally keen to keep pace with the clubÂ’s competitors off it.<br><br>The new development could bring 1,500 jobs to the city and complete the regeneration of St JamesÂ’ and the adjacent area.<br><br>Capacity at the stadium was expanded from 36,000 to 52,000 in a scheme which began in 1999, but the new initiative is more wide-ranging.<br><br>Under phase one, a 140-bedroom hotel complex would be built on the site of the former Magpies SupportersÂ’ Club with a second hotel also in the blueprint.<br><br>Phase two will involve Â“superiorÂ” apartments behind the Leazes End of the stadium.<br><br>Development within St JamesÂ’, which would take the capacity to at least 60,000, would take place at the Gallowgate End.<br><br>The land above the St JamesÂ’ Metro Stadium has been earmarked for a casino in a joint-venture with MGM Grand, although the future of that development rests with the Government.<br><br>But a purpose-built conference centre would complete the scheme and establish St JamesÂ’ as a major venue.<br></div>
