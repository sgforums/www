            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEWCASTLE UNITED v MIDDLESBROUGH, 0-0 Sat 3 Mar 2007</strong><br><br>Newcastle United's European hopes took a dent as they failed to make the most of their dominance over derby rivals Middlesbrough.<br><br>In a game of few genuine chances, the Magpies made and squandered the best of them on a frustrating afternoon at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>Winger James Milner hit the bar with a 51st-minute free-kick and skipper Scott Parker forced Mark Schwarzer into a vital last-minute save.<br><br>But Obafemi Martins passed up three good opportunities as Glenn RoederÂ’s men repeatedly put Boro under pressure, but simply could not make it tell in front of a largely disappointed crowd of 52,303.<br><br>The Teessiders were virtually anonymous as an attacking force and rarely looked like claiming their first top-flight double over their neighbours since 1977/78, but defended resiliently enough to extend their run to just one defeat in 14 games.<br><br>Boro arrived with their strikeforce of Mark Viduka and Ayegbeni Yakubu in top form to take on a defence which has again proved the MagpiesÂ’ Achilles heel this season.<br><br>In the event, it was at the other end which most of the significant action occurred as Newcastle set about their opponents with some gusto.<br><br>With Milner giving full-back Andrew Taylor a torrid time down the right and the fit-again Charles NÂ’Zogbia keeping Stuart Parnaby on his toes on the opposite flank, the home side always looked the more likely to open the scoring.<br><br>However, they were too often guilty of failing to find a final ball which gave front two Martins and Kieron Dyer any chance of troubling Schwarzer.<br><br>Emergency right-back Nolberto Solano, included after missing training with the virus which prevented Damien DuffÂ’s participation, was particularly culpable as a series of promising openings went begging.<br><br>For all their pressure, Newcastle created only two genuine opportunities, and they might have done better with both.<br><br>Nicky ButtÂ’s astute 19th-minute through-ball allowed Martins to run away from the Boro defence, but he delayed his shot until Schwarzer closed down the angle, and the keeper made a good one-handed save.<br><br>The Australia international was far less taxed 10 minutes later when full-back Steven Taylor met MilnerÂ’s corner with a solid header, but he directed straight at Schwarzer.<br><br>With Titus Bramble doing an excellent job on Yakubu and former Boro target Oguchi Onyewu just about holding firm despite being fully extended by Viduka, Boro threatened only fleetingly, although finished the half with a flourish.<br><br>The two strikers linked almost for the first time in the half on 40 minutes for the Australia international to send a shot on the turn just wide, and Shay Given had to race from his line on the stroke of half-time to punch clear from the same man after Julio Arca had played him in.<br><br>In an untidy start to the second half, the home side continued to make the running, but were unable to shake off their wastefulness.<br><br>They came within inches of taking the lead on 51 minutes when, after Emanuel Pogatetz had tripped Dyer, Milner curled a free-kick beyond Schwarzer only to see it hit the crossbar.<br><br>The home side were making their big push, but having seen his men hold firm for the best part of an hour Boro boss Gareth Southgate made his move on 59 minutes when he replaced the combative Lee Cattermole with winger James Morrison.<br><br>Newcastle went agonisingly close on 62 minutes when Dyer turned SolanoÂ’s pass into the path of Parker, who drilled a low shot inches past the far post.<br><br>Morrison was followed onto the pitch by South Korea international Dong Gook Lee as the ineffectual Yakubu made way, although it was defender Pogatetz who provided an unlikely threat on 66 minutes.<br><br>The Austria international broke up the field after ParkerÂ’s drive had been charged down, but with Lee in acres of space, he tried to take on Solano and lost out.<br><br>Boro almost cracked 19 minutes from time when Martins got on the end of TaylorÂ’s knock down deep inside the penalty area, but the strikerÂ’s first touch was poor and Schwarzer was able to claim with the help of a deflection off Pogatetz.<br><br>Referee Steve Bennett waved away DyerÂ’s appeals for a 79th-minute penalty after he was bundled to the ground by Arca as he ran on to OnyewuÂ’s knock-down with the Magpies desperate to find a late breakthrough.<br><br>Newcastle battered away at the visitors as the clock ran down and Parker saw a last-minute diving header saved, but they simply could not find the cutting edge which had deserted them all afternoon.<br><br></div>
