            <div class='col-md body'><strong>EVERTON v NEWCASTLE UNITED, 3-0 Sat 30 Dec 2006</strong><br><br>Victor Anichebe enhanced his burgeoning reputation with a devastating double to upstage compatriot Obafemi Martins as Everton destroyed Newcastle United at Goodison Park.<br><br>The 18-year-old scored either side of the break to put Everton 2-0 ahead, before captain Phil Neville wrapped up an emphatic victory with his first goal for the club.<br><br>Neville's 62nd-minute goal sent Goodison Park wild - but not even his spectacular strike could eclipse Anichebe's exploits.<br><br>The rookie striker, who was born in the Nigerian capital of Lagos before his family moved to Merseyside when he was a one-year-old, was simply outstanding throughout.<br><br>Anichebe, who qualifies to play for Nigeria and England, found the net in the ninth minute and doubled his tally in the 58th minute.<br><br>He always posed a greater goal threat than countryman and Newcastle's summer signing, Martins, who blazed a penalty over the crossbar on the stroke of half-time to add to the visitors' misery.<br><br>Glenn Roeder's side were again hit hard by injury, but goalkeeper Shay Given returned in one of three changes to the side which lost 2-1 at Bolton Wanderers on Boxing Day.<br><br>Given, passed fit after a groin injury, replaced 38-year-old Pavel Srnicek - while Emre and Nolberto Solano came in for Antoine Sibierski and teenager David Edgar.<br><br>Neville returned after a one-match ban for Everton. Nuno Valente and Andy van der Meyde also started - with Simon Davies, James McFadden and Gary Naysmith dropped.<br><br>Everton began brightly in the Merseyside drizzle - and in the second minute Neville launched a quick, long throw down the flank which Anichebe raced on to in a flash.<br><br>The teenage powerhouse sent in a dangerous cross for Andy Johnson to head firmly but over the bar.<br><br>Everton found themselves ahead when some neat interplay between Mikel Arteta, Johnson and Anichebe forced a corner.<br><br>Arteta played the ball short to Neville, and his whipped cross was met by Everton defender Joseph Yobo.<br><br>The clearance from rookie Newcastle left-back Paul Huntington was weak and quickly seized upon by Anichebe who fired a low, left-foot shot into the corner from six yards.<br><br>Everton continued to hold the upper hand, and their dominance was in no small part down to Neville's steadying influence on the right flank.<br><br>After Emre and Huntington had both earned themselves yellow cards from referee Dermot Gallagher following late challenges on Yobo and Arteta respectively, Neville again displayed his attacking prowess.<br><br>Shortly before the half-hour, the former Manchester United utility man produced a superb cross which Johnson and Van der Meyde somehow contrived to miss.<br><br>Newcastle, who again deployed Kieron Dyer behind Martins, carried precious little attacking threat in the opening period.<br><br>But 11 minutes before the break Martins arched himself into position to plant a firm header towards goal from James Milner's deep cross.<br><br>The effort looked to be heading wide of Tim Howard's goal, but the on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper was in fact required to make a smart save to tip the ball around a post.<br><br>Newcastle's cause was not helped by an injury to Peter Ramage seven minutes before the break - and with no obvious replacement, Sibierski was called into action.<br><br>Two minutes before the break, Newcastle had an opportunity to draw level when Leon Osman hauled down Dyer - and Gallagher had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot.<br><br>But Martins failed to make the spot-kick count as he blazed his attempt high over Howard's goal.<br><br>The visitors should then have drawn level nine minutes after the restart.<br><br>Milner embarked on a weaving run and cut in from the right to hit a left-foot shot which looked destined for the top corner.<br><br>Howard proved equal to the effort with a flying save, and Martins and Steven Taylor collided as they sought to bury the loose ball.<br><br>In the 58th minute, though, the MagpiesÂ’ cover was blown as Anichebe claimed his second.<br><br>A right-wing corner from Arteta was met by Johnson's flicked header which was nodded goalwards by Anichebe.<br><br>His effort came back off the bar - but he showed great awareness to fire home the rebound from inside the six-yard box.<br><br>Four minutes later, Goodison Park erupted as Neville hit Arteta's low free-kick first time with a mis-hit, dipping effort from 20 yards which flew over Given and into the far corner.<br><br>With the points effectively sealed, Anichebe left the field to a standing ovation as Everton were left to celebrate a victory which provided plenty of reasons for optimism heading into 2007.<br><br></div>
