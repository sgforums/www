            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROEDER: BOUMSONG HAS TO LEARN HIS LESSON</strong><br><br>Newcastle United defender Jean-Alain Boumsong has been ordered to learn from his mistakes as he attempts to put his Liverpool nightmare behind him.<br><br>The 26-year-old Frenchman was criticised for his error-strewn display in last SundayÂ’s 3-1 home defeat by the Reds which culminated in his 52nd-minute dismissal for a poor challenge on Peter Crouch.<br><br>Caretaker boss Glenn Roeder allowed him to return to Paris to be with his pregnant wife this week with a one-match ban ruling him out of Wednesday nightÂ’s FA Cup quarter-final defeat trip to Chelsea.<br><br>With Robbie Elliott facing a match on the sidelines after being red-carded in the 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge and Celestine Babayaro having joined Titus Bramble on the injury list, Roeder will have little choice but to play the Â£8million defender at Charlton Athletic.<br><br>Â“I allowed him to go home and be with his wife rather than staying over here and worrying about what was going on in Paris,Â” said Roeder.<br><br>Â“It was the right thing to do. He came in on Thursday and he seemed fine. He trained on Thursday and I think he left his mark on one or two people.<br><br>Â“He has got to pick himself up. There are two things you can do, stay down or get up, and he will get up.<br><br>Â“I am sure he will have learned from that mistake against Liverpool and that will never happen again.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s the important thing. You are allowed to make mistakes but you are not allowed to carry on making mistakes, especially as a defender.<br><br>Â“You need to learn from them and make sure they donÂ’t happen again and thatÂ’s what he has got to do in this instance.Â”<br><br>The defeats by Liverpool and Chelsea came on the back of a 2-0 reverse at Manchester United which was nowhere near as close as the scoreline suggests.<br><br>After five wins and a draw under Roeder those three defeats have come as a blow.<br><br>However, Roeder is adamant their final eight Barclays Premiership fixtures should be played out as if they were the first and is in no mood to allow a disappointing campaign to fizzle out to a drab conclusion.<br><br>Â“Part of my job to make sure that does not happen to the players,Â” he said. Â“But they have also got to meet me halfway and be very self-motivated.<br><br>Â“We have got plenty of self-motivation and we would be selling the fans very short if we didnÂ’t put on eight excellent performances.Â”<br><br>The Charlton match will mark Alan ShearerÂ’s 400th appearance for the club, a remarkable achievement for a man who has had two serious injuries during his time at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>Â“It is a fantastic achievement, absolutely phenomenal,Â” said Roeder.<br><br>Â“Just look at the sums - heÂ’s played 400 games in 10 seasons, which means he averages 40 games a season over the time he has been at the club.Â”<br><br>Top scorer Darren Bent is CharltonÂ’s main concern.<br><br>The England international has been hampered by an ankle problem and played through the pain barrier on Thursday as the Addicks drew 0-0 with Middlesbrough in the FA Cup quarter-finals.<br><br>ADDICKS AND BORO SHARE CUP DRAW<br><br>Fellow forward Marcus Bent is back in full training after a back injury gave him hamstring problems and sidelined him since the beginning of the month but he is unlikely to start.<br><br>Charlton defender Chris Powell believes it is about time the goalscoring burden was lifted from Darren BentÂ’s shoulders.<br><br>The 22-year-old has enjoyed a superb debut season after a Â£2.5million summer switch from Ipswich, with that fee now looking like a bargain.<br><br>He has 19 goals to his name so far and is keen to continue in that vein to persuade England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson he is worth a place in his World Cup squad.<br><br>But Bent is toiling with his ankle problem and has to play on because no-one else seems to be able to find the back of the net.<br><br>Fellow frontmen Marcus Bent, Shaun Bartlett, Jay Bothroyd and Jason Euell have contributed just seven goals between them, while Jonatan Johansson and Kevin Lisbie are out on loan.<br><br>It was time therefore for the goals to be shared among the squad reckons Powell.<br><br>He said: Â“We have been trying to add some attacking quality to our game but it just so happens Bent has been getting on the end of most of the chances.<br><br>Â“It would be nice to share the goals around and with Newcastle coming up this gives us a chance to get firing again.Â”<br><br>Manager Alan Curbishley revealed BentÂ’s fitness had been a concern for a while.<br><br>He said: Â“He was 50-50 for the cup game. He is so desperate to play every week but has been suffering for the last two or three weeks.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s nothing too serious but it is there and if he catches a ball wrongly he can feel it. But he can run around so it is just something he has to work his way through.Â”<br><br>Curbishley was pleased there were no other casualties apart from the Bent duo at a time when a European place remains up for grabs via two different routes.<br><br>He said: Â“If Marcus gets himself fit then I will have a clean bill of health and I have never had that in a run-in. So I may be able to change things round a bit. Another win in the league and I may be able to prioritise, who knows?Â”<br><br>Charlton Athletic (from): Myhre, Young, Perry, Hreidarsson, Powell, Kishishev, Holland, Hughes, Thomas, Ambrose, Bartlett, D Bent, Bothroyd, Euell, Andersen, Spector, Rommedahl, Sorondo, Fortune, M Bent.<br><br>Newcastle United (from): Given, Harper, Carr, Ramage, Boumsong, Moore, Parker, Emre, Solano, NÂ’Zogbia, Bowyer, Faye, Clark, Brittain, Pattison, OÂ’Brien, Shearer, Dyer, Ameobi, Chopra.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Charlton Athletic made it four defeats in a row for Newcastle United with a comfortable 3-1 victory at The Valley.<br><br>A penalty from Darren Bent, a bizarre own goal from former Charlton man Lee Bowyer and a late header from substitute Jay Bothroyd sealed the win for the Addicks, who are still unbeaten at home in the Barclays Premiership in 2006.<br><br>Ex-Charlton man Scott Parker silenced the boos from some sections of the home crowd with a fine equaliser for Newcastle in the 35th minute, but slack defending once again proved to be the Magpies' downfall.<br><br>It was even start to the match, but the Magpies had the first serious attempt on goal in the fifth minute.<br><br>Alan Shearer played a one-two with Shola Ameobi that ended with the rangy forward firing a 20-yard shot that home goalkeeper Thomas Myhre spilled but was able to claim at the second attempt.<br><br>Charlton, however, created the first clear opportunity of the game - and it was Jean-Alain Boumsong, back in the team after suspension, whose mistake in the 11th minute almost let them in.<br><br>The French centre-back failed to cut out the excellent Radostin Kishishev's angled pass from inside his own half, allowing Darren Bent to race into the box and hit a left-foot shot that Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given did well to save with his legs and divert behind for a corner.<br><br>Against the run of play, Charlton won a penalty in the 23rd minute after Craig Moore - making his first start of an injury-hit season after joining from Rangers last summer - was adjudged to have brought down Jerome Thomas, and Darren Bent struck his 20th goal of the season into the bottom-left corner from the spot.<br><br>The goal lifted Charlton's confidence visibly, but Newcastle proved they could still threaten in attack in the 32nd minute.<br><br>Nolberto Solano found Stephen Carr on the right, and the Peruvian timed his run perfectly to collect Carr's low cross inside the penalty area - but could only guide an angled shot wide of the left post.<br><br>Parker then silenced the home fans with an exhilarating strike in the 35th minute.<br><br>Collecting Shearer's square pass from the left, Parker hit a perfect shot into the Charlton top-right corner from 30 yards before racing the length of the field to celebrate in front of the Newcastle fans.<br><br>But the delight was short-lived, as Charlton regained the lead in comical fashion 60 seconds later.<br><br>After Hermann Hreidarsson had won Chris Perry's free-kick in the air, Moore whacked his clearance against the back-tracking Bowyer, who could only watch in horror as the ball cannoned into his own net from six yards.<br><br>Kieron Dyer was brought on in place of Solano for the second half, and was involved quickly, setting up Parker for a 25-yard shot that went high and wide.<br><br>The match continued to produce plenty of chances. In the 48th minute, Boumsong could only head Bryan Hughes' left-wing corner to Marcus Bent at the far post, and Given was forced to make another brave stop to keep out the hard-working striker.<br><br>Dyer looked lively in the early stages of the second period, and in the 50th minute he set up Bowyer for a 15-yard effort that Hughes did superbly to block, before a deflection took the sting out of Ameobi's follow-up strike and Myhre claimed with ease.<br><br>Roeder's men came even closer to levelling for a second time in the 54th minute. Myhre could only push away Emre's low 25-yard shot and, when Shearer turned the ball back into the centre, Perry put an attempted clearance inches wide of his own post.<br><br>Dyer had added verve to Newcastle's attack, and he was only narrowly offside in the 60th minute when he ran onto Emre's reverse pass and shot against the outstretched leg of Myhre.<br><br>Newcastle were enjoying most of the possession, but Marcus Bent missed a fantastic chance to put Charlton two goals clear in the 62nd minute.<br><br>Bent beat the visitors' offside trap and controlled Matt Holland's lofted pass on his chest, but he somehow steered well wide of the left post with only Given to beat.<br><br>Alan Curbishley's team continued to attack in the final phase of the match, and scored their third when substitute Bothroyd - with his first touch - headed in a near-post cross from fellow sub Dennis Rommedahl two minutes from full-time.<br><br></div>
