            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NEWCASTLE UNITED v WATFORD, 2-1 Sat 16 Dec 2006</strong><br><br>Newcastle United striker Obafemi Martins enhanced his blossoming reputation with a superb double to kill off stubborn Watford.<br>The 22-year-old Nigeria international snatched victory four minutes from time with a blistering drive from substitute Damien DuffÂ’s cross to deny the Hornets a precious point on Tyneside.<br><br>Martins, who now has eight goals since his Â£10million switch from Inter Milan, had headed the home side in front in the 49th minute to set the stage for what his side hoped would be a comfortable victory.<br><br>However, Hameur BouazzaÂ’s 57th-minute equaliser sparked a Watford fightback which might have amounted to even more before the NewcastleÂ’s new number nine took a leaf out of predecessor Alan ShearerÂ’s book to claim the headlines at the death at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>Much has been said about the muscular approach adopted Adrian BoothroydÂ’s men, but they played enterprising football which never allowed the hosts to relax and will count themselves unfortunate to have left the north-east empty-handed.<br><br>The news that NewcastleÂ’s 37-year wait for a trophy may have ended - the Magpies are awaiting official confirmation that they will be awarded the Intertoto Cup after surviving longer in the UEFA Cup than any of the other qualifiers - cut little ice at St JamesÂ’ Park.<br><br>Manager Glenn Roeder, while happy to accept any silverware that might come his way, played down the achievement, although the fact that SaturdayÂ’s game was his sideÂ’s 30th of the season dating back to July 15 illustrated just how hard his players have worked to keep fighting on all fronts despite crippling injury problems.<br><br>However, the momentum Newcastle have established in recent weeks brought the home fans to St JamesÂ’ Park brimming with confidence as BoothroydÂ’s side, without an away win since their return to the top flight, headed north.<br><br>The return of both Kieron Dyer and Emre from injury, with skipper Scott Parker and Duff on the bench, simply served to increase the anticipation, although there was an air of frustration around the stadium by the time the half-time whistle sounded.<br><br>That the scoreline was 0-0 was perhaps no surprise - the Hornets had scrapped out goalless draws in each of their last two games - but the fact that the Magpies had struggled to break them down, and then failed to trouble goalkeeper Richard Lee unduly when they did, was a disappointment.<br><br>Only once was Lee in real trouble, saving with his legs as DyerÂ’s swerving 16th-minute shot almost caught him wrong-footed.<br><br>The home side showed flashes of their best form as Dyer, Emre and Martins linked well down the left, but genuine chances were few and far between.<br><br>The Nigerian poked a weak shot straight at Lee after a thrilling build-up and Nicky Butt blasted a drive wide of the far post after bursting into the box, but there were few real scares for the visitors despite RoederÂ’s men enjoying the greater share of possession.<br><br>Indeed, Shay Given had to be at his best to turn over Darius HendersonÂ’s dipping 39th-minute shot and 19-year-old Paul Huntington, once again playing at right-back, saw a little more of Bouazza than he would have liked.<br><br>The visitors re-emerged in determined fashion as both Alhassan Bangura and Bouazza went close in quick succession, but they fell behind with 49 minutes gone.<br><br>Butt picked out James Milner in space on the right and his cross was tailor-made for Martins, who had pulled away from Danny Shittu, to head powerfully past Lee.<br><br>However, Watford refused to throw in the towel and Given had to make a good save to deny Bouazza in the 54th minute after he had turned Steven Taylor.<br><br>And they got their reward three minutes later when Henderson flicked on Ashley YoungÂ’s corner and Bouazza stabbed the equaliser home from close range.<br><br>The goal simply served to increase the visitorsÂ’ confidence and Newcastle were forced to endure something of an onslaught as the game wore on.<br><br>Given saved twice from Henderson within seconds as the Hornets pushed for a winner with the game opening up.<br><br>Milner had a glorious chance to snatch victory 15 minutes from time when he was played into space on the right, but he could not keep his well-struck shot down.<br><br>With Duff and Parker both having joined the fray, hopes of a rousing finish were high, and Martins duly obliged four minutes from time when he controlled DuffÂ’s pass and blasted a shot into the roof of the net to send the home fans home happy and relieved.<br></div>
