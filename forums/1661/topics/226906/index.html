            <div class='col-md body'>Georgia mom vows appeal after Board of Education rejected request<br><br>ATLANTA - The Georgia Board of Education voted Thursday to uphold a local school boardÂ’s decision to leave Harry Potter books on library shelves despite a motherÂ’s objections.<br><br>The board members voted without discussion to back the Gwinnett County school boardÂ’s decision to deny Laura MalloryÂ’s request to remove the best-selling books.<br><br>Mallory, who has three children in elementary school, has worked for more than a year to ban the books from Gwinnett schools, claiming the popular fiction series is an attempt to indoctrinate children in witchcraft.<br>Story continues below ↓ advertisement<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s mainstreaming witchcraft in a subtle and deceptive manner, in a children-friendly format,Â” said Mallory, who is considering a legal challenge of the boardÂ’s ruling. Â“The kind of stuff in these books Â— murder and greed and violence. Why do they have to read them in school?Â”<br><br>Gwinnett school officials have argued that the books are good tools to encourage children to read and to spark creativity and imagination. Banning all books with references to witchcraft would mean classics such as Â“MacbethÂ” and Â“CinderellaÂ” would have to go, they said.<br><br>J.K. RowlingÂ’s Harry Potter books, published by London-based Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, have been challenged 115 times since 2000, making them the most challenged texts of the 21st Century, according to the American Library Association.<br><br>The challenges most often claim that the series encourages children to question adult authority and promotes witchcraft, said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, the deputy director for the associationÂ’s Office for Intellectual Freedom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Harry Potter Case Â– Myth vs. Truth</strong><br><br>By LAURA MALLORY<br><br>Published on: 01/28/07<br><br>Today's generation faces evil like no other in history, with its bombardment by violent, sexual and occult images through our modern mass media. I think perhaps we are so desensitized, we couldn't recognize evil even if it were on the plate in front of us.<br><br>My efforts in this case only address one facet of that evil, which is being spoon-fed to our children, even in the public schools. With the deceptive, exciting, children-friendly packaging of witchcraft in the Harry Potter series, our youth today view witchcraft not only as good and fun, but also as harmless fantasy.<br><br>I'd like to clear up some misconceptions about the case and then just share my heart for a minute.<br><br>Myth: We are trying to ban Harry Potter.<br><br>Truth: This case first began when we noticed the books in our son's elementary school classroom. We were then told by the school that anything in the school library may be used in the classroom. The original request of August 2005 asked that the books be removed from the classrooms and libraries due to the extreme evil and violent content, the promotion of witchcraft (Wicca) and the age-inappropriateness. We are not trying to ban Harry Potter. The books may of course be purchased in bookstores or checked out at public libraries, but need not be encouraged, assigned and read aloud in our children's schools and classrooms. Are they ready to put the Bible and prayer back in our schools and classrooms and read it aloud?<br><br>Myth: This is a one-woman fight.<br><br>Truth: I have never been alone in this "fight." There are hundreds and even thousands of other parents who have stood up against the Harry Potter series and its paganization of this generation. The American Library Association reports Harry Potter books rank No. 1 on the list of most challenged books of the 21st century, having received more than 3,000 challenges nationwide. Additionally, there have been numerous people who have become dear friends who have written, called and helped with their love, encouragement, prayers and donations. Without them, I could not have continued this case.<br><br>It has not been an easy path to take, but one in which I know I must not quit. God has been with me, answering specific prayers and reassuring me of His will and His Word, and my husband of nearly 13 years has supported and stood with me Â— I'm enormously grateful. This has never been a one-woman fight; if it were, believe me, I would have quit long ago.<br><br>Myth: Witchcraft is just harmless fantasy.<br><br>Truth: This is perhaps the greatest myth of all. America's desensitization to the occult is not only sad, but dangerous. We are in serious need of revival and a return to the traditional Judeo-Christian roots upon which our blessed country was founded.<br><br>I cannot count the times I have been told that these books are "just fantasy." But if you would like to know the truth, please keep reading and do your own research.<br><br>Not only is witchcraft a real religion, subtly intriguing and luring our children and teens in unprecedented numbers, but it is also a dangerous one, often leaving its followers in darkness, depression and even suicidal. This was verified by a teenager from Lawrenceville and Mrs. Marsha McWhorter, a registered nurse and certified marriage and family therapist, both of whom testified at the Gwinnett County hearing on April 20, 2006, coincidentally, the anniversary of the tragic shootings at Columbine High School.<br><br>At that hearing, I had planned to read a portion of the testimony by the father of Columbine martyr, Rachel Joy Scott, but due to the hearing's time restraints, I was unable to do so. That father, Darrell Scott, spoke before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime in Washington, D.C. on May 27, 1999.<br><br>Here is a small portion of that speech, a poem and an expression of what was in his heart and is also in mine.<br><br>Your laws ignore our deepest needs,<br><br>Your words are empty air.<br><br>You've stripped away our heritage,<br><br>You've outlawed simple prayer.<br><br>Now gunshots fill our classrooms,<br><br>And precious children die.<br><br>You seek for answers everywhere,<br><br>And ask the question "Why?"<br><br>You regulate restrictive laws,<br><br>Through legislative creed.<br><br>And yet you fail to understand,<br><br>That God is what we need!<br><br>When the Bible and prayer were removed from our schools, in effect, God was expelled. So we've raised a generation not to know Him. Now our schools and society are filled with violence, drugs, gangs, addictions, perversions, and we wonder why?<br><br>We need God in America again. He's the One who says don't lie, steal or murder Â— for our own good. Likewise, He's the One who says witchcraft, including the casting of spells, is an "abomination," meaning: detestable, repulsive, loathsome, vile, abhorred, (Deuteronomy 18:10-13), and we call it good reading material?<br><br>May God forgive us, open our blind eyes and deaf ears and send revival.<br><br>Please see our Web site for further information, research and articles on this issue and case: www.HisVoiceToday.org.</blockquote>I see another Taliban-style organisation in the making. The only difference is that this group has not shed any blood so far. Other than that, their views are equally extreme.<br><br></div>
