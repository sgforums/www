Already Harry was in shock from witnessing Cedric's horrible death. I can't blame him if he wants to banish this unpleasant memory from his mind. Cho was being an irritant, a real pest.

Author JK Rowling, 39, is especially anxious that the identity of the half-blood prince is not revealed to fans before they buy the book.<br><br>An employee at the plant said, "It feels like we are dealing with a manual on how to start a nuclear war instead of a children's book. We have all been photographed and we must wear special badges at all times. Two guards are positioned permanently in the space dividing the bookbinding department from the printing presses. And there are always four outside the main entrance checking everyone in and out.<br><br>"Security staff are even riding shotgun on the container filled with shredded waste when it is driven to be emptied. We heard the British publishers wrote a clause saying we would be liable for something like Â£2million is one single word of the book leaked out."<br><br>The plant is about 70 miles from Germany's POW castle Colditz. The first batch of 250,000 Half-Blood Prince books will be ready within two weeks.<br><br>JK plans a break before writing the seventh and final book.<br></div>

The bets were refused by one chain of bookmakers which claimed it was "obvious" the manuscript had been read.<br><br>Claims that Dumbledore would die were sparked when author JK Rowling hinted about a death in Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince. Now a mysterious series of events in Suffolk suggests the secret may be out.<br><br>A cluster of Â£50 bets have been placed on Dumbledore being the victim - and it would not take the powers of the boy wizard to deduce what has happened. Most of the bets have been placed in the town of Bungay - which just happens to be where the new Harry Potter adventure is being printed.<br><br>Ed Pownall, of the internet betting site Blue Square told The Sun: "We have taken nearly Â£6,000 worth of bets on Dumbledore in the past seven days. All have been played in Bungay or nearby Beccles. A lot of punters have opened new accounts and placed a maximum bet of ?50 each on what is an obscure market. That made us sit up and take note."<br><br>As a result Blue Square slashed the odds for Dumbledore - played by Sir Michael Gambon after the death of Richard Harris - from 2/1 a week ago to 4/6 before they suspended betting last night. And Warren Lush of Ladbrokes said: "We weren't foolish enough to take the bets. There are obviously people out there who have read the manuscripts."<br><br>Printers Clay of Bungay are believed to be helping with the printing of the new book - due to be published on 16 July - although publishers Bloomsbury moved some of the printing to Germany.<br><br>-thisislondon.co.uk</blockquote>Is Dumbledore really biting the dust so early?

Two books were recovered and they are currently being held in secure circumstances as evidence by Northamptonshire police."<br><br>No weapon has yet been found, according to a Northamptonshire police spokesman.<br><br>Chief Supt Dean Smith of Northamptonshire police paid tribute to the Mirror for reporting the incident last night:<br><br>"The Daily Mirror has behaved exceptionally honourably in bringing about the arrest of these people. It is as a result of information supplied by the Daily Mirror that we've made these arrests. One man was apprehended close to the premises where the books were found, and the other man gave himself up.<br><br>"Armed officers were deployed after we were told by the Mirror that suspected weapons were seen by its journalists. There were problems taking possession of the books because of a Rottweiler dog within the flat. That situation was dealt with and the books are now under lock and key."<br><br>The last edition of the bestselling Harry Potter series, The Order of the Phoenix, was found in a Suffolk field and handed over to the Sun, which duly returned it to the publishers.<br><br>Security surrounding the latest book tight<br><br>Security surrounding the latest book is extremely tight - according to the Sun last week, 40 guards backed by CCTV cameras have been brought in to scan production lines at a secret Potter plant in old East Germany.<br><br>Staff are scrutinised on the way in and out of the printing works, with mobile phones and recording devices also banned to prevent the contents of the book being read out or photographed.<br><br>The book is also said to have been produced in separate chunks to stop workers leaking the plot before its official release. - The Guardian</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From pressgazette.co.uk:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Harry Potter's secret</strong><br>Published: Thursday, June 9, 2005<br><br>By Dominic Ponsford<br><br>Attempts to sell copies of the new Harry Potter book to journalists have led author JK Rowling to issue a wide-ranging injunction to protect the bookÂ’s secrecy.<br><br>Last Friday, Sun reporter John Askell was shot at trying to take a copy of the book which had been offered to him for Â£50,000. Two men have since been arrested on police bail following the incident in Kettering, Northants.<br><br>Now Rowling has issued un unusual "John Doe" injunction to ensure the plot of her book remains a secret until its official publication date of July 16.<br><br>David Hooper, from law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, said: "This far-reaching injunction applies to anyone who has, or has had, possession of all or part of the book without the consent of Bloomsbury Publishing and JK Rowling.<br><br>"This type of injunction is known as a John Doe order because those to whom it applies are not named. It doesn't just apply to the two named people who were attempting to sell copies of the book. It catches anyone who is in unauthorised possession of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.<br><br>"This injunction is much wider in scope than the John Doe order obtained for the previous Harry Potter book."<br><br>According to Hooper, the order also stops anyone who may come into possession of all or part of the book from disclosing it or any information in it to any third party and requires immediate delivery up of the book or any copies of it to the publisher. He said that anyone with notice of the order is liable to be imprisoned or be fined for contempt of court if they breach its terms.</blockquote></div>
