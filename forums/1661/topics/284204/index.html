            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Salazar Slytherin:</strong><br><br>Salazar Slytherin believed that only pure-blood witches and wizards should be allowed to attend Hogwarts. He got into an argument with Godric Gryffindor about this and eventually left the school. There was a legend that Slytherin built a secret chamber somewhere in Hogwarts that only his true heir would be able to open. This chamber, called The Chamber of Secrets, contained a monster that would finish his "noble purpose" of killing all the Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. As Slytherin's heir, Tom Riddle did open the Chamber and released the monster, a basilisk. Harry Potter defeated the basilisk with the help of Fawkes the phoenix and the sword of Gryffindor (CS).<br><br>Slytherin was one of the first recorded Parselmouths and an accomplished Legilimens (JKR).<br><br>He possessed a heavy gold locket carrying his own mark (an ornate serpentine "S"). The locket was inherited by Merope Gaunt Riddle, pawned during her pregnancy to Borgin and Burkes, purchased by Hepzibah Smith, and subsequently stolen by Tom Riddle upon Smith's murder (HBP20).<br><br>Harry Potter has many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students: Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination - a certain disregard for rules.<br><br>According to the Sorting Hat, Slytherin came from the fen. In the UK, fens are located in the eastern portion of England, East Anglia and in particular Norfolk which is North East of London.<br></div>
