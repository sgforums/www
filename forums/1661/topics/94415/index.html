Rowling receives thousands of letters from adoring fans, but one letter touched her more deeply than any other. In an article titled Â‘The Rowling Connection,Â’ Brian Bethune of MacleanÂ’s magazine told the story in the November 6, 2000, issue.<br><br>In Toronto, nine-year-old Natalie McDonald was dying. Â‘She was obsessed with the Harry Potter books.Â’ Remembers family friend and political activist Annie Kidder. Â‘They had been her respite from the hell of leukemia. And because IÂ’m the sort of person who thinks there must be something I can do, I badgered RowlingÂ’s publishers in London, sending them a letter and an e-mail and a fax for her.Â’<br><br>Passed on by the publishers, the letter arrived at RowlingÂ’s Edinburgh home a day after the author had left for a holiday in Spain. Â‘When I came back two weeks later and read it, I had a bad feeling I was too late,Â’ Rowling told MacleanÂ’s. Â‘I tried to phone Annie but she wasnÂ’t in, so I e-mailed both Natalie and her mother, Valerie Â– because Annie hadnÂ’t told Valerie what she had done. Â‘Rowling was right in her foreboding Â– the e-mails were received the day after Natalie died on August 3.<br><br>Â‘JoÂ’s e-mail was beautiful,Â’ Kidder says. Â‘She didnÂ’t patronize Natalie, or tell her everything was Ok; she addressed her as a human being who was going through a hard time. She talked about her books and her characters and which one she liked best.Â’<br><br>The story might have ended there, but Valerie McDonald wrote back, in thanks. Â‘That letter touched deep,Â’ Rowling says slowly, trying to explain the esteem in which she holds NatalieÂ’s motherÂ…. So a regular correspondence began, and an unexpected friendshipÂ….<br><br>But even before that, the author had quietly commemorated the reader she never met.<br><br>On page 159 of Goblet of Fire, the famous sorting hat of Hogwarts Schhol of Witchcrafts and Wizardry sends first-year student Natalie McDonald Â– the only real person in any of RowlingÂ’s novels Â– to HarryÂ’s own Gryffindor house.<br><br><strong>Taken from Â‘People in the News Â– J.K. RowlingÂ’ by Bradley Steffens. </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that is very nice of J.K. Rowling to include Natalie McDonald in her book, to think that some people actually accused J.K. Rowling of preaching santanism ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'd prefer MacDonald to have been sorted into Hufflepuff. This house generally gets little mention in the books. Furthermore, we seldom see Hufflepuffs of calibre or substance save for the late Cedric Diggory.</div>
