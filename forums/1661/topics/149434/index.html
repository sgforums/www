title="Idea"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE GOBLET OF FIRE</strong></span><br><br>'A thousand years or more ago,<br><br>When I was newly sewn,<br><br>There lived four wizards of renown,<br><br>Whose  names are still well known:<br><br>Bold Gryffindor, from wild more,<br><br>Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,<br><br>Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley braod,<br><br>Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.<br><br>They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,<br><br>They hatched a daring plan<br><br>To educate young sorcerors<br><br>Thus Hogwarts school began.<br><br>Now each of these four founders<br><br>Formed their own house, for each<br><br>Did value different virtues<br><br>In the ones they had to teach<br><br>By Gryffindor, the bravest were<br><br>Prized far beyond the rest;<br><br>For Ravenclaw, the cleverest<br><br>Would always be the best<br><br>For Hufflepuff, hard workers were<br><br>Most worthy of admission;<br><br>And power hungry Slytherin<br><br>Loved those of great ambition<br><br>While still alive they did divide<br><br>Their favourites from the throng,<br><br>Yet how to pick the worthy ones<br><br>When they were dead and gone?<br><br>'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,<br><br>He whipped me off his head<br><br>The founders put some brains in me<br><br>So I could choose instead<br><br>Now slip me snug about your ears,<br><br>I've never yet been wrong,<br><br>I'll have a look inside your mind<br><br>And tell where you belong!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE ORDER OF PHOENIX</strong></span><br><br>In times of old when I was new<br><br>And Hogwarts barely started<br><br>The founders of our noble school<br><br>Thought never to be parted:<br><br>United by a common goal,<br><br>They had the selfsame yearning,<br><br>To make the world's best magic school<br><br>And pass along their learning.<br><br>"Together we will build and teach!"<br><br>The four good friends decided<br><br>And never did they dream<br><br>That someday they might be divided,<br><br>For were there such friends anywhere<br><br>As Slytherin and Gryffindor?<br><br>Unless it was the second pair<br><br>Of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?<br><br>So how could it have gone so wrong?<br><br>How could such friendships fail?<br><br>Why, I was there and so can tell<br><br>The whole sad, sorry tale.<br><br>Said Slytherin, "We'll teach just those<br><br>Whose ancestory is purest."<br><br>Said Ravenclaw, "We'll teach those whose<br><br>Intelligence is surest."<br><br>Said Gryffindor, "We'll teach all those<br><br>With brave deeds to their name."<br><br>Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach the lot,<br><br>And treat them just the same."<br><br>These differences caused little strife<br><br>When first they came to light,<br><br>For each of the four founders had<br><br>A House in which they might<br><br>Take only those they wanted, so,<br><br>For insistance, Slytherin,<br><br>Took only pure-blood wizards<br><br>Of great cunning, just like him,<br><br>And only those with sharpest mind<br><br>Were taught by Ravenclaw<br><br>While the bravest and the boldest<br><br>Went to daring Gryffindor.<br><br>Good Hufflepuff, she took the rest,<br><br>And taught them all she knew,<br><br>Thus the Houses and their founders<br><br>Retained friendships firm and true.<br><br>So Hogwarts worked in harmony<br><br>For several happy years,<br><br>But then discord crept among us<br><br>Feeding on our faults and fears.<br><br>The Houses that once, like pillars four,<br><br>Had once held up our school,<br><br>Turned upon each other and,<br><br>Divided, saught to rule.<br><br>And for awhile it seemed the school<br><br>Must meet an early end,<br><br>What with dueling and with fighting<br><br>And the clash of friend on friend<br><br>And at last there came a morning<br><br>When old Slytherin departed<br><br>And though the fighting then died out,<br><br>He left us quite downhearted.<br><br>And never since the founders four<br><br>Were whittled down to three<br><br>Have the Houses been united<br><br>As they once were meant to be.<br><br>And the Sorting Hat is here<br><br>And you all know the score:<br><br>I sort you into Houses,<br><br>Because that is what I'm for,<br><br>But this year I'll go further,<br><br>Listen closely to my song:<br><br>Though condemned I am to split you,<br><br>Still I worry that it's wrong,<br><br>Though I must fulfill my duty<br><br>And must quarter every year<br><br>Still I wonder if sorting<br><br>May bring the end I fear.<br><br>Oh, know the perils, read the signs,<br><br>The warnings history shows,<br><br>For our Hogwarts is in danger<br><br>From external, deadly foes<br><br>And we must unite inside her,<br><br>Or we'll crumble from within<br><br>I have told you, I have warned you...<br><br>Let the Sorting now begin.<br><br></div>
