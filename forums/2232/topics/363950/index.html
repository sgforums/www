              <p><em>Friday, June 12, 2009</em><br><br>There won't be anymore waiting in the 
              dark at this campus bus shelter. New flexible solar cell technology developed by 
              a group of engineering researchers at McMaster University has been installed to 
              power lighting for night-time transit users. <br><br>The researchers are also 
              hoping that the prototype will help boost efforts to commercialize the new 
              technology. The bus shelter is located on the west side of University Avenue 
              between the John Hodgins Engineering Building and the Life Sciences Building. 
              <br><br>"Our goal is to provide a clean, affordable power source for bus 
              shelters that will let transit companies run Internet-based scheduling updates," 
              said Adrian Kitai, a professor of engineering physics at McMaster who guided the 
              project. "The solar technology can also be used to light up bus shelter signage 
              and provide lighting for general safety." <br><br>The flexible solar cell 
              project started as a master's thesis for Wei Zhang, who subsequently worked as 
              an engineer in the Department of Engineering Physics. Julia Zhu, a research 
              technician in the department, and Jesika Briones, a master's of engineering 
              entrepreneurship and innovation graduate, also helped develop the initiative. 
              <br><br>The ability to bend the solar cells to fit the curved roof of the bus 
              shelter is one of the main features of the technology. The flexibility is 
              achieved by tiling a large number of small silicon elements into an array, 
              mounting them onto a flexible sheet, and connecting them through a proprietary 
              method. The two solar strips installed on the McMaster bus shelter are about 90 
              centimeters long and 12 centimeters wide. Each strip has 720 one-centimetre 
              square solar cells and generates up to 4.5 Watts of power. <br><br>With the help 
              of Facility Services at McMaster, a solar strip was mounted at each end of the 
              bus shelter roof and connected to two energy-efficient, multi-LED, light 
              fixtures. Each light fixture uses only 600 milliwatts of power and produces 
              about the same light output as a three watt regular tungsten bulb or what a 
              small night light would use. The lights are bright enough for easy reading. 
              <br><br>The solar cells capture sunlight during the day and convert it to 
              electricity to recharge batteries located in each lighting unit. The batteries 
              can hold enough charge to light the shelter for the better part of a night. 
              <br><br>The solar cell research team is monitoring the installation to determine 
              how much solar power is required to fully recharge the batteries based on 
              weather conditions. Winter months will be a particular focus as shorter and 
              overcast days, snow and cold can affect the charging ability of the solar cells 
              and batteries. <br><br>Funding for the initiative was provided through an NSERC 
              strategic grant and an NSERC I2I grant. <br><br>The team is interested in 
              hearing from transit riders about their experience with the lit bus shelters, 
              and any suggestions they may have. <br><br>### <br><br>McMaster University</p>
