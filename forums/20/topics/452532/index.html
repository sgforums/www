My project which I thought was to be with guidance was by the professor was chock full of advanced computer notations which nobody could understand and which I suspect his American collobarator was a fraud lah. His paper looks very shallow man. Let's do not try to mention names if not hell will break loose. That professor normally very friendly and full of mega-projects. It does not help further when I quoted a Stanford paper as a result. Who wants extra details?</p></div>

Under the stress, I quitted and later I tried to reappeal back but they do not allow. I mean what would you do when you see a Stanford paper in front of you, right? It does not help when the paper was relatively sub-par. I wasn't kicked out. They just refuse to readmit me in. Sigh. I do not make story up what else you want to know and how can you help?

              <p>First, I think you should not use harsh words like scam and associate it with an entity without solid evidence. I assume if you had solid evidence, you would have sued their asses off and get what you wanted, but the fact that you posted here without seeking legal counsel suggests you do not have solid evidence.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you want a way out of this situation, the best people to talk to are those who have the authority to help you out. I feel that by airing your grievances online, it may do more harm than good for you personally.</p>
              <p>If you really think there's something really fishy going on and you have proof and for some reason don't want to seek legal advice, then go to the media for help, and justify your case to them.</p>
