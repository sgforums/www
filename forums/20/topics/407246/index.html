              <p><span>NTU students including foreign students are getting
              increasingly peeved at the inconveniences they have to put up lately
              due to the Youth Olympic Games. NTU is the site of the Youth Olympic
              Village. </span></p>
              <p><span>Over the last few days, we have received numerous complaint
              letters from NTU students about the disruption in their daily routine
              brought about by the YOG.</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Janet Pang,</strong> a 2nd year student from the Engineering Faculty wrote:</span></p>
              <p><span><em>“August is usually a slack period for us, but because of
              the YOG preparations, we are forced to finish our assignments and
              projects early. There is plenty of re-scheduling of lectures with many
              brought forward. Some of the lecturers are poorly prepared because of
              the rush to complete the lessons on schedule. Our studies have suffered
              as a result of the YOG. To be frank, we rather not have it.”</em></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Christina Lye</strong> concurred:</span></p>
              <p><span><em>“Hello, because of YOG, our assignments, presentations and
              exams are all pushed forward and is affecting our result. Semester one
              is supposed to end in another month, but because of YOG, everything is
              being pushed forward and we are all stressed up. We lost our sleep for
              more than two weeks. Do we actuall deserve this?”</em></span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Lau Ting Ting</strong>, a student from Hong Kong added:</span></p>
              <p><em><span>“</span><span><span>All thanks to YOG, there are so many
              reconstruction going on and road blocks set up in NTU. NTU has
              literally transformed into a prison.  During this period, you cannot
              imagine how much inconvenience the YOG has brought to ppl working here.
              All internal <span>shuttle bus has been shut down, public bus no longer comes into NTU because the Jalan Bahar exit of NTU is totally shut down!”</span></span></span></em></p>
              <p><span><span><span><strong>Dan Lim</strong>, from Malaysia said:</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><em>“NTU has been turned into a high-security
              prison! Can’t imagine what will happen when the YOG officials and
              athletes arrive. We are just here to study. Why should we put up with
              so many inconveniences?”</em></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>Despite the extensive publicity given to YOG by
              the state media, the response from Singaporeans has been lukewarm so
              far. In an online poll conducted by Channel News Asia, a shocking 88
              percent or 5,639 respondents indicated that they are “not interested”
              in YOG at all.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>Public disaffection and disdain for the YOG continues to snowball with more than 600 Singaporeans joining the </span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#%21/group.php?gid=106184679437182&amp;ref=ts">“I hate YOG”</a> Facebook to protest against it.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>Unfortunately, the PAP regime is unlikely to
              listen to the concerns of NTU students as it is busy indulging in is
              self-created “vanity fair” to showcase itself to the world.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>In the words of PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporeans (and maybe now foreigners) are all CHAMPION grumblers. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><strong>EDITORS’ NOTE:</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><em>NTU students, how has the YOG affected you?
              Are you happy that NTU has been chosen as the site for the Youth
              Olympic Village? Are you looking forward to YOG? Please share your
              views with us here or email us directly. You do not have to suffer in
              silence. Let the world knows the truth about YOG!</em></span></span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Slightly over a week ago, a senior member of the diplomatic corps asked me, “Do Singaporeans care a hoot about the Youth Olympic Games?”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“To be very honest,” I replied, “No.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I then put it out of my mind, my own interest level running on empty — like most of my fellow Singaporeans.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">* * * * *</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="color: #2277dd; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_60.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1561" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; float: right; display: inline; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" title="pic_201007_60" src="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_60.jpg?w=300&amp;h=400" alt="" width="300" height="400"></a>It’s the affective divide again, in the famous words of writer Catherine Lim, who in the 1990s was rapped by the prime minister for undermining public confidence in the government through her plain speaking. But it’s true: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There’s a gulf between citizens and the government. As soon as something is seen as being important to the government, especially if it is seen as important to the ego of the government, the average Singaporean keeps his distance. There’s that sense of alienation all over again.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lately, the government has been trying to use sports as a platform for cranking up nationalism, but<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> the more ministers get involved, the more Singaporeans stay away from the projects they sponsor.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It’s like how very few Singaporeans fly the flag for National Day.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> What flags you see are not put out by individuals, they are organised by neighbourhood committees, communist party-style. That accounts for the orderly way they have been put up.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Youth Olympic Games project suffers the same fate. The fact that huge billboards have to be put up to feign popular enthusiasm says it all. Here’s a billboard that proclaims “Residents of Holland-Bukit Timah town celebrate” the games, put up by the government:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="color: #2277dd; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_63.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1578" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" title="pic_201007_63" src="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_63.jpg?w=480&amp;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360"></a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Not more than 50 metres away is another billboard, this time for National Day, complete with likenesses of members of parliament lording it over citizens:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="color: #2277dd; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_62.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1579" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" title="pic_201007_62" src="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/pic_201007_62.jpg?w=480&amp;h=360" alt="" width="480" height="360"></a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Same same. They’re both government projects. Same same, both aver “enthusiasm” from top down.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> From bottom up, it’s indifference and ennui.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">* * * * *</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">A few days ago, I bumped into a friend who was a school teacher. “You look rather stressed out today,” I said. She always looks stressed out, and that seems to be my opening line each time I see her.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“I have to reschedule so many classes for next month,” she explained.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Naturally I asked “Why?”  but before she had a chance to reply, a thought hit me out of the blue. “By any chance has it got to do with marching orders for all students to attend the Youth Olympic Games?”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“Aargh,” she went, flinging her arms up in despair. “I’ve said enough, I’ve said enough. I’ll say no more.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“Am I right or not?” I persisted.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">“I’ll say no more. I don’t want to lose my job.”</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Attempting a more indirect tack, “How are students going to pay the ticket prices? How can parents be expected to pay? Not all parents have money to throw about. . . ” <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">My voice trailed off as I thought about the the budget for the Youth Olympic Games ballooning from the initial estimate of S$122 million to S$387 million.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/alienation-scores-gold-at-youth-olympic-games/">http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/alienation-scores-gold-at-youth-olympic-games/</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">As long as PAP is the ruling power in Singapore, Singapore can never progress as a nation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">45 years, yet the nation building is still so weak.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This is Lee Kuan Yew's greatest failure.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This is what happens when you fuck up the culture of a society and rule through fear and repression.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hopeless as national leader.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SINGAPORE is a "freak", because it is lacking in terms of geopolitics, economics, size, population and culture, said former communist leader Fang Chuang Pi, dubbed the </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Plen" by Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added that, in his assessment, the country had "narrow room for manoeuvre in various areas and will run into difficulties in future".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He gave this assessment of Singapore as an unnatural country, a freak of history, in an interview with Malaysia's Chinese-language newspaper, Nanyang Siang Pau, in which he disclosed that he had discussed the Republic's prospects with the Senior Minister when they met in Beijing in August 1995.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/plenwife.jpg" alt="Mr Fang and his wife in Thailand" width="200" height="114"><br><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #808080; font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Mr Fang and his wife at the interview in<br>Thailand. Pic/ Nanyang Siang Pau</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He told Mr Lee: "I said that Singapore was a 'freak', but a 'freak' was often a genius, and most geniuses died young. For in terms of geopolitics, economics, size and population, Singapore is congenitally deficient."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The two men also discussed the issue of culture, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I said that using a certain language to create a culture, the culture created can at best be a commercial culture, or technology culture, or we may call it pasar culture. It has no roots, and identifies itself with a certain material interest. It is the product of expediency.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/duck.gif" alt="Like duckweed, floating at the harbour" width="194" height="46"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"It is like duckweed, floating at the harbour. When it absorbs fertilisers, it will flourish very quickly. But once it rains and floods set in, it will perish," he said in an interview conducted in a restaurant in Haadyai, near the Thai-Malaysian border</span></strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mr Fang, 71, was a powerful linkman for the now-defunct Malayan Communist Party (MCP) in the 1950s and 1960s. He held several secret meetings with Mr Lee, one of which led to the cooperation between the MCP and the People's Action Party (PAP) in fighting against British colonialism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He became a legendary figure for his ability to "disappear" and avoid arrest and was reported to have left Singapore in 1961 for Indonesia, from where he directed the MCP's underground activities.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/mystery.gif" alt="No longer the mystery underground man" width="162" height="80"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He and more than 20 Singaporeans who were ex-MCP members now live in Thailand, following a peace accord signed in 1989 by the MCP, and Thai and Malaysian governments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Nanyang's editor Lee Soo Puang and senior feature writer Kua Kim Teck, who interviewed him, described him as "no longer the mystery underground man or the guerilla fighter", noting that he had worn a long-sleeved shirt and long pants, and carried a handbag.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"His simple attire made him look like a retiree," said the interviewers, adding that "his mind remains alert and he is also sharp-tongued".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Fang acknowledged the economic progress that Singapore had made over the past three decades under Mr Lee and his People's Action Party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The country was "economically advanced", he noted, adding that it might not have achieved this progress if the leftist forces had taken control in the 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"If we look at the experiences of communist countries, Singapore could be chaotic and its economy very bad today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But I will dispute this statement: If there was no Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore would sink. This was only a possibility.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Singapore now is economically advanced, but politically backward ... If they (Mr Lee and PAP) were not there to rule, Singapore's politics could be very active and vibrant," he said in the interview, published in several parts over the past week in the Malaysian newspaper.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/merger.gif" alt="Merger now" width="131" height="26"></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked about the merger between Malaysia and Singapore in 1963, he said that the issue had created a "serious sense of distrust" between him and Mr Lee because it was raised suddenly. All along, he had believed the merger was "merely an objective, not an item on the agenda", he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">He added that Mr Lee had explained when they met in 1995 that he had not lied or misled him intentionally. But when the Tengku agreed to cooperate suddenly, he decided to go ahead with the plan for a merger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Asked what he thought of a merger now, he said: "I think Singapore and Malaysia must merge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"It was an illegitimate split. The brief period of merger during 1963 showed that conditions were not conducive then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Thirty years have passed and both Singapore and Malaysia have since developed in their own directions. It looks like the separation is final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"But more people will begin to realise that a merger will benefit both countries as well as their people. If both sides are separated, both parties are being weakened."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* On the Republic:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"Singapore was a 'freak', but a 'freak' was often a genius, and most geniuses died young. For in terms of geopolitics, economics, size and population, Singapore is congenitally deficient ... I think that Singapore has narrow room for manoeuvre in various areas and will run into difficulties in the future."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #ff8000; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* On progress made by Mr Lee and the PAP:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">"If we look at the experiences of communist countries, Singapore could be chaotic and its economy very bad today. But I will dispute this statement: if there was no Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore would sink."<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* On merger with Malaysia:</strong></span></p>
