            <div class='col-md body'>hi...no NTU is not that bad...ppl here are actually quite nice. Then again, when u are choosing between courses like Engineering, u do have a dilemma between NUS, NTU and in the case of business, SMU. The only courses available in NTU which are unique are 1) Accountancy, 2)Comm Studies the rest are pretty much a choice between choices.<br><br>Keep in mind that if u wanna do business, then know that after the first year NTU offers specialisations in IT, Financial Analysis and Banking, Actural Science, Economics, Marketing. While NUS offers business administration, which consists of a mixture of subject combinations covering most of the above courses, it produces wat u call "a jack of all trades but a master of none". That is food for thought.<br><br>In addition to the basic engineering courses, NUS offers Chemical. Dun worrie about ur grades...most of the time, u get into the course u want (unless u set too high expectations and waste ur choices...)btw, i was refering to entering NTU...not NUS...<br><br>Comm studies is pretty much exciting, u go through a four year course with an attachment during the final year first semester...<br><br>besides that, all i can offer is  - join ur interest, not the market demand of jobs out there...coz u will only make ur life ultimately miserable...good luck in ur selection!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huh? easy to score in NTU? ha! u got rocks in ur head man sunnyday.....the papers here are much tougher than NUS as a whole...not only that, NUS has a grading system that rewards students with grades from a range of A+ to A to A-...hence, u find that students over there are more likely to get "better grades" than us who only have straight-forward A, B, C grades<br><br>No, the format of the papers in NUS are also custom-made to help the students for example, in first year electric circuits, the NUS students need only to form the basic loop analysis equation and then put it in matric form to get the full marks. In NTU, students have to actually solve the tedious and usually irritating simultaneous eqns and get a numerical solution before they are awarded the due credit and this portion of solving is where ppl make the most errors...not to mention time consuming in an exam too!<br><br>Now is NUS students really much better than us? i suppose if u look at the statistics, the stereotyping in selecting vasities and the professional degrees offered in NUS...then YES...they are "better" than us. However, that is all. Technically speaking, an NTU student vs an NUS student in comparative courses will be on par in terms of knowledge, give or take.<br><br>so being an NTU student, do try not to downplay our strengths just yet...unless with  all that u've said, u are still breezing through with straight As...then well, i've got nothin' to say. *snigger*</div>
