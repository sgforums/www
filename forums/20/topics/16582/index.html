            <div class='col-md body'>wat's the use of posting our displeasure in this forum? it wouldn't produce tangible results...<br><br>All i want is justification - justification that is simply lacking, justification that isn't there at all.<br><br>SAO are simply a bunch of leg shaking money mongers at times. When we file complaints, they bury us in paperwork instead of offering sympathetic action. But when there's a chance (for watever reason) to raise prices, they jump at the opportunity.<br><br>And this coming so soon after the NTU admin informed that they were upping the course fees. Again this was more of a statement rather than an attempt to explain the reasons behind the hike. But strangely, why wasn't any formal black and white mailed to us? I had to read it from the papers, which meant they didn't bother to explain themselves to the one ppl who were directly affected - the student population.<br><br>If i were to arm myself with a picket and protest outside cham tao soon's office, he'd just as soon boot me outta campus rather than consider my request. Our student union, rather than forcefully voicing our obvious disappproval, has gone for the more passive but ultimately futile approach of doing a survey on the price hike. What will that accomplish?<br><br>As if our union had any credibility after they posted an official apology to former president Jonathan Pang for inappropriate accusations made during his short term of office.<br><br>Right now action is needed, not posting in this forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">MoodyBluz &amp; BillyBong</span></strong>,<br><br>Indeed, the public feedback in Forums may not be useful sometimes and actions are needed to turn around &amp; amend a organisation's unpopular decisions. However, it may be useful in some cases to voice out certain "genuine concerns".<br><br>If there is something that needs public opinions, we can try to comment what should be done or how both parties can come to a compromise.<br><br>A recent example: Look how the "Chek Jawa" reclamation case was resolved (see <strong>footer*</strong>): <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/habitatnews/message/155" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/habitatnews/message/155</a><br><br>Everybody likes to be in a "win-win" situation.
