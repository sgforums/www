            <div class='col-md body'>I think the demand for engineers (esp general ones) is, in economic terms, that of elastic. It's likely engineers have to face a rollercoaster ride when it comes to their career outlook. When the economy is gd, the demand will be high. Of course, since the economy is bad now, the demand is down.<br><br>Maybe its time to upgrade skills, to make urself stand out more than ur competitors.<br><br>Accountants are privileged in the sense that there is always a demand there. This is becos all kinds of firms, regardless big or small do require some sort of accounting personnel around .</div>
