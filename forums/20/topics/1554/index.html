            <div class='col-md body'>As above, the way NTU EEE allocate final year projects to final year students is so f*&amp;^$% up man.. SO stupid !!!<br>For those who dun understand why is it so, here is the way it allocates projects....<br><br>First, the lecturers will recommend projects to the final year project committee.<br><br>The committee will then compile a list of projects and allow the students to choose 10 options.<br><br>Then the projects will be allocated to students through balloting.<br><br>For those unlucky students who did not even managed to any of the projects, they will have to choose another 10 projects from those LEFTOVERS projects. THIS IS SO UNFAIR TO THEM.... The leftover projects are those which no students want to take up one. So how can the committee ask the unlucky students to choose them ????? Are they being fair to them ??<br><br>The students also already very damn unlucky not to get any one of the 10 project which they have chosen. Think of this, u tried so hard to choose 10 projects and end up u did not even get 1 of them... Wah lao.. what type of stupid system is that... unable to give even one of the projects to the students...<br><br>What's more, the projects allocated to the students are so unbalance.... only about 100 students are in the micro-electronics options and there are about 150 micro-electronics projects... then there are about 200 students in the computer engineering option and there are ONLY 90 projects for the computer engineering students. What kind of stupid way to allocate projects ?? Dun tell mi that the FYP committee did not take note of how many students are there in each specialisation and give projects according to the quantity ???<br><br>To make things worse, they allow students of different specialisation to choose projects which is not their specialisation. Think of this, a lot of micro-electronics students chooses the computer engineering projects,as the projects are comparatively easier than the computer ones, then what projects can the computer engineering students choose ???? Dun tell mi that the students have to choose micro-electronics projects.. which is totally not related to their course of study... This resulted in a lot of micro-electronics projects left over for those computer students who did not get any of their 10 choices and no computer projects !!!!! and they have no choice but to choose the micro-electronics projects... and die.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> .... The committee do not even add in projects for the students.... and when the students consulted them... the committee just tell the students to choose from the LEFTOVER projects.. what type of committee is that man... They do not even listen to the students...<br><br>Is this way letting the students put what they have studied to practical use ???? What will the students tell the company which they find in future as why they go to computer specialisation (for example) and they do a micro-electronics projects??<br><br>NTU EEE better change the way they allocate projects to the students... This is definitely not helping the students... It is ruining the future of the students who did not get the projects which they want... What type of stupid balloting system!!!! Always ballot one... please lah.. change the balloting system lah.. so stupid and unfair.. to leave our future to the hands of some stupid system and luck..... what a stupid way of studying university .....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh... you didn't get the project of your choice issit?<br><br>Think about it this way.... it's always easier to complain about how a system sucks.. well.. when it comes to attempting to satisfy a few hundred students.. there is no one way that can satisfy everyone.<br><br>Maybe YOU would like to suggest a practical way. If they don't allow you to choose from outside your specialisation you complain about how rigid they are.<br><br>They can give you 1000 choices, so what? Only a handful will be attractive and popular, be it because of ease or relevance, you will still have that same number of people fighting over those few.<br><br>For NTU, it's always a case of 100 people making the same 10 choices out of a possible 200.<br><br>Don't complain so much.... you're starting to sound like a sore loser...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harlow Enigma.... If you get your choice, of cos u will be the one saying this.. but if u dun get it.. will you still be here saying this stupid things...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> .... Please, I am not a sore loser man.. The system is so stupid that they have to do this through balloting....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Please lah.. if they want.. they can always reserve a second set of totally new projects with a balanced number for each specialisation for the unlucky students mah.. and not let them choose from those projects which no students want... At least the students will be given another chance to choose the projects which they are interested in.. and not choose from the LEFTOVER projects which most of them are not of the unlucky students' specialisation...<br><br>YOU think I did not suggest a practical solution ??? OF COS I did, but do the lecturers listen to us students ?? NO .. THEY dun even care a bit of the students.. Just want an easy way out and that's it... Complete their job can liao...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Please also, if they are taking in 1000 students, they must be prepared to handle all the 1000 students request.. and not just take in and take in students and dun even bother about them.....<br><br>And also, I AM NOT saying that they give us 1000 choices can liao.. They must make sure that the projects quantity must be balanced for the students... Not 150 projects for just 100 students whoc specialise in them and 50 project for 200 students...<br><br>Of cos.. YOU are saying this now cos you are not in the unlucky students shoes.. if YOU are in their shoes.. I dun think you will be saying this....<br><br>Sore loser.. hah... I am not competing for anything.. so why should I be a sore loser... This is just something which concerns my future and I dun think I can just leave my future to some stupid computer balloting.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Complain.. ??? Of cos I am complaining.. I dun deny that.. Please the school should at least spare a thought for students and not leave everything to computers...<br><br>Dun complain.. if you are in my shoes.. I dun think you will be sitting there happily typing these comments now....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>You get your project,happy lah, so please keep your mouth shut man... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sighz.... some people just don't get it....<br><br>Not everyhing is as simple as it seems.. sure you may have suggested a few solutions, which may be good... but then is it's implementation easy?<br><br>A whole new set of options? They need to allocate supervisors to projects, not only do they need to balance things for students, they need to do it for the lecturers as well. you can't have 1 lecturer with 4 students while some sit around with none.<br><br>A least i don't sound as agitated as you.. and I did not ask you to shut up. I got my choice, yes, but that's because I chose a topic which is difficult and not very popular among the students.<br><br>Don't keep harping on how some specializations only have 50 to choose from, if I remember correctly, you mentioned that the school encourages students to choose from outside their specialization as well.<br><br>Sometimes, topics are also based on supervisors capabilities, if NTU has more lecturers in a certain field naturally they'll be more FYP options in that field.<br><br>Even if you are agitated do TRY to sound polite at least. I'm only trying to reason here and tell you that in your state of anger your views are flawed. Do sit down and think about it.<br></div>
