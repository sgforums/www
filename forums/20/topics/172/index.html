            <div class='col-md body'>i know this may sound lame to some but i am trying every means i can get thru to.<br><br>on 9/2/02, saturday afternoon, i was going home from hall. the bus 199 came n thre were few ppl on it. I was walking to the back of the bus when i cant help noticing this girl. she was just sitting right at the back looking out of the window. But as i take a second look, i realised that she was teary-eyed, staring out of the window, and talking on the phone at the same time.<br><br>i sat a few seats away to give her privacy, and my mind went elsewhere. but as we alighted, somehow my eye caught her eye and her forlorn look just struck me. despite the expressionless face, she was incredibly sweet looking. like a doll.<br><br>as u can guess, for days after i thought abt her occasionally. i dun normally think of her for no reasons, but wat bothered me was that i dreamt of her a couple of times, and has any of u experinced the feeling of waking up after a really vivid dream and feeling very moved by wat u dreamt of? although i cant really rem the details of the dreams, i know tt she left a v deep impression in my heart, and i dunno y.<br><br>anyways, coincidentally i saw her a few times on campus, all of which she was v far away. the more i c her the more i cannot help falling. she usually look dreamy, like she dunno where she's going, and it nv fails to bring a smile to my face. but sometimes when she's talking n laughing with her frens she look so lively.<br><br>i want to get to know her but there is nv a chance. i know that she must b living in halls 12-15, and most prob from NBS. she seems to like the colour pink alot..<br><br>and guess what, i saw her on vday itself, with this incredibly gd looking guy. but they were not holding hands or anything, and i seriously dun think they are a couple, then. they were in marina, and i pointed her out to my frens, and they FINALLY understood wat has been putting me to a daze lately. anyways, she was all dressed up and she was beautiful.<br><br>ppl out there are gonna think i'm stupid, gif it up, some might say. but i can't. at nite i still can picture the lovely face n the teary eyes, or that sweet sweet smile she sometimes dorns. i dunno if she's attached, but tt also means however slight, there i STILL a chance. i really wanna know her. so, hopefully fate(?) will bring her to read this, and leave a msg for me.<br><br>btw any of u guys know of other forums ntu ppl might visit? the more the merrier. pls help me out. this loon is silly, but he is sincere.<br><br>------------------<br>Ryan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear <strong>Ryan, ("OverTheParadise")</strong><br><br>Know more about her! Notify her of your feelings! (but don't purposely follow her, it will NOT be very nice to stalk others, maybe can find out from YOUR hostel's friends in halls 12 to 15, etc)<br><br>Life is NOT only about <strong>EXAMz</strong>. School-work is important but you have also many other 'important' priorities in life to worry too.<br><br>In the Bible, (<strong>Genesis chapter 24</strong>):<br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Abraham's servant was tasked to find a wife for his master's son, Isaac.  The servant has to ensure that the future wife must not be chosen from the Canaanites, who're their neighbours,  but must be taken from Abraham's relatives. The servant prayed to Abraham's God to help him in searching for Issac's future wife and finally the servant found Rebekah who came out of the hut to offer the servant a drink and to draw water for the camels too, who turn out to be Issac's wife eventually"</span><br><br><strong>Lesson to draw from:</strong><br>The servant has to travel miles away to search for an unknown spouse for his master's son, Issac but he did not give up just because it's a <strong>difficult but important</strong> task.<br><br>In choosing a life-long spouse, the servant has to make 110% assurance that she should be virtue, kind-hearted and have the same goals as her husband (in this case:it's the common goal of worshipping the <strong>same God</strong>).<br><br>Hence Ryan, ("OverTheParadis"), do you have such future plans to ponder over, besides your other priorities? <strong>If this matter is bothering you too much to the extent that you cannot sleezz, try to get over it fast by reasoning out whether this romance can really take place or not.</strong><br><br>Think over it and see if it's worth it.<br>It's a <strong>personal</strong> and important decision, nobody can decide for you because the <strong>future outcome will be your responsibilty</strong>.<br><br>You can also find other <strong>Alumni's links</strong> below: (check if she's there) <a href="http://www.aimoo.com/forum/categories.cfm?id=322370&amp;CategoryID=14903&amp;zb=5847359" rel="nofollow">http://www.aimoo.com/forum/categories.cfm?id=322370&amp;CategoryID=14903&amp;zb=5847359</a><br><br>Feel free to <strong>express your message at link above</strong> too, hope the lady in pink sees your message &amp; reciprocate.<br><br>All the best to you.<br><br>===================================================<br><strong>Other possible advices:</strong><br>Give her a card if you know where her hall is, drop it at her mail box but don't embrass her by letting everybody know you like her and things like that.<br><br>However, you must play it soft not to be too persistant in your approach. I think nobody likes a pushy person ...<br><br>===================================================<br><br>------------------<br>Yours Sincerely,<br>Alan Chow<br><br>****************************************<br><strong>2nd Hand Garage Sales + Campus Discussions:</strong><br><a href="http://www.aimoo.com/ntu" rel="nofollow">aimoo.com/ntu</a><br>****************************************<br><br>[This message has been edited by ntuforum (edited 01 April 2002).]</div>
