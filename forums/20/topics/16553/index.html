            <div class='col-md body'>chey! u guys think it's only that? actually some of the lecturers r excellent in MPE, not to mention some completely condemned  cases. But wat pissed me off mostly was wat the dean said during the 2nd yr student and divisional staff meeting at the beginning of the term.<br><br>Wat he said really made me irritated abt the system. After some students mentioned about some ground problems faced, he announced that he was only interested in the "Big Picture"; in short, he wasn't here to listen to the nitty gritty. Wat he doesn't realise is that the small problems are the ones that need some major correction!<br><br>For example, he toks abt having a world class school in MPE and makes constant references to "star wars"...not that i wish to mock him or scoff at his ideals, but he should wake up and smell the juice! His own school tutors, some of which cannot even teach, are employed..how does he expect us to do well when we dun even understand the damn subject. Self-study? yeah well, in that case, can i be excused vasity fees? If u cannot teach me, i might as well go study on my own.<br><br>Apart from that, his approach method during the talk struck me as rather aloof. I've heard that he has set a decree that "if a student deserves to fail, fail him". Is that true? i wonder wat kind of pressure the various professors are under. I agree that sometimes a no-nonsense approach is required, but he could certianly have explained it to the students. We are a thinking society of mpe undergraduates, not brain-dead slaves to be whipped at a moment's notice.<br><br>From wat i can see as a student, he cannot even get the small picture right and he wants to tok only abt the big picture?<br>It's the stuff of dreams, and dreams r for people who sleep...<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 23 March 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by controversay (edited 23 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have to get ur perspective right. Ntu is more of an financial institution than a educational institute. It has more research projects to cater to than listening to us lowly students. I mean, which official educational institute would not have summer school for students to catch up? All the lecturers and tutors are involved in some research programmes or company outside. $$$$ is the word in NTU. Giving us students degrees is just a part time thingy for them. The main aim is to gather talents(if there is any) to work for them on the pretence of doing something 'noble'&lt;----teach. Tell if if l'm wrong.</div>
