              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">I found the following paragraphs on NTU's website:<br><br>"The university has a distinguished lineage with roots that go back to 1955. We began as Nanyang University (Nantah), the first Chinese-language university in Southeast Asia, through donations from all walks of life, with the Yunnan Garden campus donated by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. <br><br>Nanyang Technological Institute was reborn on the same campus in 1981 with government funding to educate practice-oriented engineers for the burgeoning Singapore economy. In 1991 we became Nanyang Technological University with the absorption of the National Institute of Education." <br><br>source: <a style="color: #0044cc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/publicportal/...+us/history.htm">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/publicportal/...+us/history.htm</a> <br><br>First of all, anyone who is old enough can tell you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nantah was founded by late Tan Lark Sye in 1953 but unfortunately closed down by Lee Kuan Yew in 1980.</span></span></strong> (PAP supporters among Nantah alumni always insist that Nantah was "merged" with Singapore University to form the NUS -- make it more palatable to public perception). On the other hand, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">NTU was founded by Lee Kuan Yew in Nantah's old campus as NTI in 1981 initially and upgraded to NTU in 1992. </span></span></strong><br><br>Secondly, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">don't forget that Nantah was a real CHINESE university (the only Chinese university outside of China and Taiwan so far)</span></span></strong> while NTU is an English university with a non-significant "Department of Chinese". (NUS has one too, nowadays, which decent university in the world does not have a Chinese Department?). <br><br>So you see, other than sharing the same premise, the two universities have no commonality AT ALL, what "lineage with roots" are they talking about ? <br>NTU did NOT began in 1955 and<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> NTU did NOT begin as and never been a “Chinese-language university” as claimed in the passages on NTU’s website.</span></span></strong><br><br>Here is the fact: <br><br>the property of now defunct Nanyang University was confiscated and given to NTU, the whole campus was ransacked and almost demolished, the old buildings torn down and replaced by new ones, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the beloved Nantah Gate was defaced and cut off from the campus by the highway (They wanted to tear down the Gate but no contractors dared to take the contract). </span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">After Nantah was closed down in 1980, no one heard about Nantah or Tan Lark Sye on media until early 1990’s when someone in PAP sensed that China</span></span></strong> was going to be reckoned with as another powerful country on earth. They started to see the economical value of Nantah's name (which they hastenly discarded in 1980) in pursuing the Chinese business, but it is an historical fact that<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">the regime had been most unkind to Nantah and Tan Lark Sye</span></span></strong>, the big question was how could they erase this historical blackmark in people's mind ? The whole PAP propaganda machinery with the help from media has been working on this single idea ever since. They seemed to have found the ideal solution to their problem, namely, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to modify and distort the history of Nantah and NTU ... </span></span></strong><br><br>First they changed the Chinese abbreviation of NTU from LiDa to NanDa (i.e. Nantah) on Chinese media which created an illusion on the mind of Chinese readers and audience as if Nantah was still alive. Later, Dr. Su Guaning started to push renaming of NTU's official name to "Nanyang University" which naturally did not go well with the silent Chinese community in Singapore and met vocal opposition Nantah alumni on web (you of course did hear a lot of opposition on Chinese media and you know why). <br><br>Consequently the idea was dropped in 2004 (the rumor has it that Lee Kuan Yew was annoyed by comments made by oppositions of renaming and requests by some supporters of renaming to rehabilitate his most despised enemy Tan Lark Sye) while they were planning a huge ceremony to be held in June of 2005. <br><br>With name-change or no name-change, now they just want you to believe that this angmo NTU is the same Nantah built in 1953 by Tan Lark Sye with the help from Chinese people of southeast Asia, and it has been operating since 1955, as if nothing had happened in the year of 1980 ("No, no, no, we never closd down Nantah, what happened in 1980 was just your imagination, honey"). <br><br>A Nantah alumnus gave me a metaphor to aptly describe the fabrication by NTU: "Someone killed your poor Chinese mother and confiscated your little atap hut. A twenty-ish Angmo woman comes along and moves in the hut. they now tell you in their <img style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; vertical-align: middle;" title="Mad" src="http://singaporeforums.com/forum/images/smilies/mad.gif" alt="">straight-face that this "50 years" (really? but she looks like in her 20s) old angmo jarbo is really your old mother you so dearly missed and the good news is that she never got killed!" <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How can people believe such shameless fabrication and distortion of history? (Don't tell me Singaporeans and NTU students are so gullible and stupid to put up with such nonsensical political propaganda. Are they?)</span></span></strong></span></p>

As a student in Chung Cheng (Main) he almost got expelled for disciplinary problems.</p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Fortunately, his principal was merciful and Mr Low eventually enrolled in Nantah, majoring in both Chinese Language and Literature and Government and Political Administration.</p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">It was his interest in the latter and the desire to read Western political thinkers like Plato and Max Weber that spurred Mr Low to brush up his English in university. But by the time he was to pursue honours in the newly opened NUS, he was still not confident enough in his English.</p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Thus, the political science department’s warning that theses would be marked down for poor English coupled with the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> discrimination he felt from the department towards the Chinese-educated pushed him to do his honours in Chinese Studies instead.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">After graduation, he became a Chinese-language teacher at Pei Dao Secondary where he encountered the final straw that led him into politics. “To face a student everyday, knowing they are not slow learners but they will not make it because of the system, I can’t tell the student that,” he said.</p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Seeing his normal stream students demoralised by the system frustrated the young teacher. “Are they slow learners? </span></span></strong>Today, after so many years, I am proven right because many of them are very successful.” he said.</p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"><a href="http://enquirer.sg/2009/01/19/overcoming-the-deafening-silence/">http://enquirer.sg/2009/01/19/overcoming-the-deafening-silence/</a></p>
              <p style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #333333;">After his graduation, though, Tang began to be active in the Chinese community. He taught at a Chinese village school for five years. By the end of that time, though, he had decided that he wanted to do something more. "I was very influenced by Confucian thinking," he says. "I wanted to pursue my education."</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The University of Singapore did not accept graduates from Chinese schools, but Nanyang University had recently opened and so, in 1962, Tang joined there. </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">The following year, though, things were different. Singapore University became open to him in a sort of pilot project Lee Kuan Yew had initiated in order to "let a few piranhas (man-eating fish) in the goldfish tank" to climatise and season the English educated. Tang graduated in 1967 and joined the bar the following year at the age of 38.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Tang became more active in the Chinese community. He was the chairman of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts for many years, and sat on the board of management of Singapore Chinese High School, Hwa Chong Junior College, and a few other schools.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">In the 1990’s, at an age when many people might have been considering their retirement options, Tang became concerned about an emerging problem: Too few Chinese had any mastery of Mandarin. "Many younger generation Chinese can’t even read the menu in a Chinese restaurant, let alone Chinese newspapers," Tang says. "Many Chinese students loathe learning Chinese language. Isn’t there something wrong?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Singapore is 77 percent Chinese, and you need a ‘Speak Mandarin Campaign’ to remind Singaporean Chinese to use the language. </span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">How pitiful! In addition, the campaign is in fact a deliberate attempt to arouse fear among the non-Chinese and in turn the PAP use that fear to club the Chinese community in the name of maintaining racial harmony.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> Do you need a Speak English Campaign in England or America to maintain the continual use of English? LKY has succeeded, which the British colonialists failed, to make many Singapore students hate learning their own language and culture."</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He was not alone in his concern. Together with a group of Chinese intellectuals, he drew up a memo on the problem and suggested several new policies.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> As a result, Tang was profiled in the Straits Times and, says Tang, misquoted. His friends, outraged, drafted letters in response, but Tang told them it wasn’t worth bothering with. "It did not occur to me that I would one day participate in politics," he says. "Never!"</span><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">
