              <p>Moka, Yes indeed. But it was caused by those mlm managment. I signed the packages in their HQ Tanjong Pagar. They have 4 branches belongs to them , their management changed , their salons relocated they never inform customers. am considered myself lucky , many middle age aunties can;t get their $$$ back. They invested a lot more than $5k.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Euguene, I never report to CASE. Initailly i wanted but then treat it as a lesson to myself. And treat it this $ is for those who con my $ to buy a coffin. They can save it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The person in charge is Lionel, he won;t answer calls as too many customers are searching for him high &amp; low.</p>

              <p>Eugene: Yes, I may consider that , will go down to CASE one of the weekend. I received a call from Coslab , they mentioned that those mlm management has passed down some of the customer packages signed to those franchise coslab to do a favour to CUSTOMER to do the facial. But then it's just only a few sessions. And it's a kind of take it or leave it.</p>
              <p>They mentioned, If i don't take up the deal they asked me to take away the card back home and go to any coslab and see if they want to accept me as a customer in doing a favour for the mlm managment.</p>
              <p>Imagine that a 20 sessions cost you $3k plus but then they are only returning back to you 5 sessions which only cost $1200.</p>
              <p>Damn Shit ! I pity myself and those under the same boat as me.</p>

              there.<br> <br> I was thinking if we all go to Straits Times to report, do you
              think it would work? Provided all of us here, who are cheated are
              ON with this.</div>
              <div>I even have his address of him and i think another 1
              is his sister who run the company as i need produce this document
              for Small Claims.<br> <br> Any comments? Thanks &lt;!--IBF.ATTACHMENT_2669955--&gt;</div>
              <p>&lt;!-- THE POST --&gt;</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>reading from that post which you have written, am i right to presume that they (coslab) is not financially stable to substain it's business operations anymore with its high advertising fees?</p>
              <p>i think it's best to get it featured in Chinese program FrontLine News that type, whereby you post them the proof and story, then they will seek professional help if you have the numbers and evidence to proof and backup the claims.</p>

              <p>If you're doing business, don't believe them..</p>
              <p>Look at the big to small businesses. Big businesses hire their own lawyer, accountants, etc while the small biz let others control them..End result..look at who's earning more money..</p>
              <p>Believe in yourself and do your homework..that is the upmost important thing thus in the event of being tricked, misled whatsoever, the owner cannot push the blame to others except for their own failure to spot the flaw/loophole.</p>
              <p>Take things into your own control, else other people will control or have partial control over you removing your say in anything.</p>
              <p>Control, it's all in our own hands.</p>
              <p>Note: This is just my perspective looking at it from business point of view and not as a consumer.</p>
              <p>As for consumers, just learn from the lesson..the next time, read the terms/clause in details for refund policy etc.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am glab that i found a place where similar victim like me is able to voice out our unhappiness about this, and hopefully some chance to recover back our money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was a victim of the coslab mlm scheme where i sign up their lifestyle packages with 5K, and was promise to get back the inital investment with a "agreement" . This was also entitle us to enjoy free facial services of up to 30 times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, things started to change when they told us that they are shifting their HQ in tanjong pagar, and we have to do out facial in Marine Aq and suntect instead. However, shortly after a few month, we will told that the outlet in marine sq and suntec is going for renovation and will be closed temp ( Which in fact is closed down). We will told to do our facial in their new marine parade outlet which was also closed after 2 month in operation.</p>
              <p>The only telephone no which i can get hold of is a mobile which belong to lionel , ( Which is now not working anymore), i also tried calling their JB Outlet which seem that they are not operating anymore too. Only some of the franchise in singapore is still running, and i really pity them that they had to bare the bad name that coslab has established.</p>
              <p>I am at loss now what i can do to recove back my money, and i am so suprise that these evil cheater is not bough to justice like what the mastermind in SUNSHINE EMPIRE had now.</p>
