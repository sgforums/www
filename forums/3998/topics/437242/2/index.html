              <p>More and more, you sound like macho man who was just released from prison and was in prison for physically-injuring a boy-child. Not accusing you of anything, just expressing my impression of you. If you were really a woman, you wouldn't try to justify the bullying of boy-children. Women usually treat children equally, it's men who favor girls over boys. Since you fit the latter category, it's obvious you're a man.</p>

              <p>Chen doesn't have the aggression in him to defend himself or comment/question anyone/anything. It's part of his mental disability. Besides, if he does report the abuse, the male staff will just laugh at him for being beaten up by a girl. More imporantly, Xinyi can always retaliate by lying that he "molested" her and every1 will believe her causing him to be executed in public. Don't you understand? Chen is trapped, there isn't a thing he can do. Give the sweet boy a break. He doesn't choose to be in this situation.</p>
              <p>Just because Chen is born a boy does not mean society should expect him to handle unbearable pain from anyone -- including a girl. He should not be expected to defend himself either, society should protect him because, at 15, a boy is still a child. Children of any gender deserve protection from abuse.</p>

              <p>1. It's a very convincing story, from what I can tell. The men of society give a girl power over a boy, so she viciously-exploits it. Cold-hearted Xinyi does exactly that to sweet Chen in front of his helpless mother.</p>
              <p>2. Jiani is a man who is at least 18 years of age. One can easily figure this out from the content of his messages.</p>
              <p>3. I don't know if all girls in Singapore are like Xinyi, but she has tainted my impression of them.</p>
              <p>4. I'm not racist. I may have been born and raised in USA but my ancestors are from Singapore.</p>
              <p>5. I've been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. Please bear with me.</p>

              <p>1. I'm not Chen but I do identify with the underdog in ALL circumstances. A sweet boy like Chen doesn't deserve the abuse -- leave alone execution -- he suffered at the hands of Xinyi. Children are children regardless of gender. To make matters worse, Chen is born with a severe neurological disability.</p>
              <p>2. Jiani is NOT mature in the *least*. He is part of the problem which causes so much harm to defenseless boys like Chen. A mature person realizes that the average girl-child is no more innocent, weak, vulnerable, or sensitive than the average boy-child of the same age. Instead Jiani further traumatizes Chen and calls him a "wimp" because he has a handicap that impairs his ability to defend himself. What should Chen do? What can Chen do in such a debilitating situation? Jiani is a heartless bully. If Jiani has any hint of maturity in him [as you claim], he will show some compassion and sympathy for tender sweethearts like Chen and retract his hurtful insults he made against Chen.</p>
