            <div class='col-md body'><p>The year is 1950. In Singapore a severe case of schoolyard bullying takes place. There is a boy named Chen and a girl named Xinyi. They are exactly a year apart in age with Chen being older and Xinyi being younger. Chen is 15 and Xinyi was 14. They attend the same secondary school and have the same classes. They even sit close to each other.<br><br>Both have the following identifying characteristics:<br>Hair color: black<br>Hair shape: straight<br>Eye color: brown<br>Eye shape: Chinese<br>Skin color: Similar to that of the average Singaporean individual<br>Ethnicity: Chinese-Singaporean<br>Body size: Skinny<br><br>Chen specifically has the following identifying characteristics:<br>Head shape: square<br>Face shape: square<br>Chin shape: square<br>Hair length: Just short enough to be appropriate for boys – not longer, not shorter<br>Birthdate: March 15th of 1935<br><br>Xinyi’s hair length is at least long enough to be appropriate for girls. Her birthdate is March 15th of 1936.<br><br>Chen is born with a neurological condition that causes not to possess any elements of the following in any time of his life: <br><br>1. Anger <br>2. Aggression <br>3. Boredom <br>4. Silliness <br>5. Humor <br>6. Pleasure <br>7. Drama <br>8. Romance <br>9. Sensuality <br>10. Sexuality<br><br>Chen has no desire to question or comment on anyone or anything. He has no annoying qualities either. He has the following characteristics:<br><br>1. Polite <br>2. Innocent <br>3. Serious <br>4. Calm <br>5. Passive <br>6. Sensitive <br>7. Humble <br>8. Warm-hearted <br><br>Chen maintains perfect hygiene throughout his life and has the maturity of an adult with the innocence of a child. He is deep into his studies, always minding his own business, and never gives trouble to anyone.<br><br>Chen’s hair and skin are soft, smooth, silky, creamy, elastic, non-oily, non-shiny, clean and dry. <br><br>Xinya’s personality is the polar opposite of Chen’s. The following happens 14 days after their birthdays on March 22nd:<br><br>Xinyi is very cold-hearted and cruel to Chen. She has a crush on him but simply uses him as a toy. Her hygiene is atrocious. <br><br>The climate in Singapore is hot and humid. Xinyi never uses deodorant or takes a shower. She stinks badly and continuously torments Chen with her noxious body odor for her own sick pleasure. In addition, she bullies him by doing the following just to amuse her evil self:<br><br>1. Whispers taunts and threats into his nose with her foul-smelling breath. <br>2. Slaps, punches, pushes, smacks, &amp; hits him until his arms, wrists, back, neck, face, and shoulders are bruised.<br>3. Pulls &amp; plays with his hair, massages his arms, and squeezes his cheeks – often commenting on how soft they are -- until he bursts into tears and sobs.<br>4. Hugs him against his will<br>5. During meals, she often chews and spits food – mixed with her saliva – into his mouth. Whenever she feels like it, she spits and blow mucus from her nose into his mouth. <br><br>As a result, Chen is terrified of – and disgusted with – Xinyi. <br><br>Chen is at the mercy of Xinyi and has to let her do whatever she wants to him. He also has to do whatever she ordered him to do. This is because she threatens him that if he doesn’t let her have her way with him, she will openly-accuse him of molesting her – which will lead to his public execution. <br><br>Paralyzed with extreme fear, Chen allows himself to be Xinyi’s slave. Chen has no way of defending himself due to his aforementioned mental disability as well as legal and societal reasons.<br><br>Xinyi often perpetrates all of the above acts of degradation to Chen in front of his helpless mom. <br>Chen’s mom is usually in tears and desperately begs Xinyi to please leave her son alone. Xinyi doesn’t listen. Xinyi feels enormous pleasure from ruining Chen’s existence and causing an equal amount of distress to his mom.<br><br>Here is why Xinyi is so mean to Chen. Her dad spoils her rotten. He always gives her what she wants. At no point does he not give into her demands. <br><br>Xinyi has also been taught by her dad that she can do whatever she wants to a boy and that the boy has no right to defend himself against her. <br><br>Being a frail, sweet, defenseless, and innocent boy, Chen falls prey to Xinyi’s horrifying sadism despite the fact that he is bigger and older than her.<br><br>Xinyi continues tormenting Chen until he can no longer bare it. It is 14 days before Chen’s 16th birthday. Xinyi pushes him to the final and lethal limit with her physical attacks. She punches him repeatedly on the back of his neck. This severely injures his spinal cord causing him to collapse. <br><br>Once again all of this happens in front of Chen’s poor mother. As Chen lay bruised, he softly utters his last words – “I love you mom”. Xinyi sadistically giggles as Chen’s mom goes hysterical.</p></div>

              <p>Chen has a disability. If anything, Xinyi is a wimp for picking on a handicapped child. What if Chen were your son? Would you laugh if something like this happened to your child? Unless you're a subhuman animal, you definitely would do otherwise.</p>

              <p>BTW, you should probably re-read the story to 
              find out more about Chen's devastating disability. It's macho jerks like

              Shame on you.</p>
              <p>You and your macho type are a parent's worst nightmare. Also, you act like an immature teenager. Grow up.</p>

              <p>So you insult a child for being born with a disability, of everything, a disability that makes him innocent and helpless? What kind of monster are you? What should a child in Chen's situation do? What do you suggest? And don't say "suicide".</p>
              <p>OMG, if only could Chen in my arms are rescue him from that evil Xinyi.</p>
              <p>It's because men like you, that girls develop into devils like Xinyi.</p>
              <p>BTW, Chen has not interest in having a girlfriend, boyfriend, or any intimate parter -- due to his disability.</p>

              <p>I think this is a sad story. No child should have to experience what Chen had to go through. I'm just breaks my heart that a girl could be so evil to such a sweet boy.
