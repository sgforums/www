              <p>Yes. I totally forgive Xinyi. However, I still feel sorry for Chen. Chen is sweeter than the most sugary dessert and softer than the most tender rose petal. His personality is like butter and cream -- so smooth and silky. I really wish I could take this precious flower into my arms and show him there is good in this world.</p>

              <p>That's what I suspected. Sweet Chen is a precious angel. Bitter Xinyi is an evil demon.</p>
              <p>Xinyi has too much pleasure her life. Dad and most of the men of society have spoiled Xinyi into the monster she is. That is what significantly contributes her her horrifying abuse of Chen. Xinyi has always gotten her way and has never in her life experienced any pain or discomfort -- physical or psychological -- to any extent. Hence, she exploits her advantages and bullies Chen to death. She gets an enormous amount of pleasure from tormenting and executing Chen in front of his helpless mom.</p>
              <p>Of course, society is just as evil as Xinyi. Society encourages Xinyi to do as she does. The community gains sick pleasure from the fact that a girl is savaging such a sweet boy out of existence. Sadly, this is how society works.</p>
              <p>Jiani is one of these evil blood-thirsty macho men who are part of society and gain pleasure from the suffering of sweet boys like Chen when such horrors are inflicted by demons like Xinyi.</p>
              <p>Macho men -- such as Jiani -- condemn Chen to a life of misery because Chen doesn't have the capability to conform to the evil standards of the macho culture. Chen is seen as unmasculine simply because he doesn't have the physical and psychological qualities associated with "manliness". As a result society abuses him with weapons like Xinyi. It just shows how backwards and barbaric society is. If society is as "civilized" as it claims to be, it will treat children in a genderless manner so that saints -- such as Chen -- don't suffer in the hands of sadists -- like Xinyi.</p>
              <p>Somebody with more guts than me needs to publicly speak up for sweet boys like Chen and make it clear that bitter girls like Xinyi should not be given the right to mistreat others simply because they are of a different gender.</p>

              <p>Come on. It is just a story, and should not be used as a blanket rule. It is supposed to be set in the 1950s, therefore Xinyi should have been spelled  as Chin Yee. You are getting too carried away by a tale.</p>

              <p>More and more Jiani is proving what a macho man he is.</p>
              <p>The following are characteristics of this overly-masculine man:</p>
              <p>1. Deeper-voiced than the average adult male</p>
              <p>2. More muscular than the average adult male</p>
              <p>3. Thick-skinned -- physically and emotionally</p>
              <p>4. Physically and psychologically very rough, tough, and hard -- more than the average adult male</p>
              <p>5. Higher pain threshold than the average adult male</p>
              <p>6. Cold-hearted</p>
              <p>7. Sadistic</p>
              <p>8. Free of emotions</p>
              <p>9. Dark humor</p>
              <p>10. Popular among bullies like Xinyi</p>
              <p>11. Narcissistic</p>
              <p>12. Neurotypical</p>
              <p>13. Bigger and taller than the average adult male</p>
              <p>14. Cruelly charismatic -- a common trait among bullies</p>
              <p>15. Socially-adept -- a skill he exploits to increase his popularity among cold-hearted bullies like himself</p>
              <p>16. Other qualities socially-associated with "masculinity" but are not appropriate for discussion</p>
              <p>Jiani frequents clubs, bars, lounges, and other "manly" locations to impress others with his masculinity. He is heavy into sports -- such as boxing and wrestling.</p>
              <p>Jiani's personality is extremely immature. This is one significant reason why he finds the suffering of sweet boys like Chen to be humorous. When he was in secondary school, he was one of the bullies who would torture and execute innocent little boys while verbally-abusing them with transphobic taunts -- such as "sissy", "wussy", "girly-boy" and other insults. He found -- and still finds -- such cruel behavior funny.</p>
              <p>In all reality, though, Jiani is a coward who simply picks on those who can't defend themselves. It is very unlikely he would ever confront someone his own size.</p>

              <p>Oh, I love that poor boy soooooo much. Too much. I really wish could rescue him from bitter girls like Xinyi and macho men like Jaini.</p>
              <p>Chen is sooooooooooooooo:</p>
              <p>1. Soft</p>
              <p>2. Cute</p>
              <p>3. Sweet</p>
              <p>4. Tender</p>
              <p>5. Creamy</p>
              <p>6. Silky</p>
              <p>7. Smooth</p>
              <p>8. Adorable</p>
              <p>9. Cuddly</p>
              <p>10. Slim</p>
              <p>Chen = fresh cream + sugar + rose petals</p>
              <p>Chen is my baby. I wish I could take him in my arms and show him some sweetness.</p>
              <p>I would like to show him affection by doing the following with him:</p>
              <p>1. Hug him</p>
              <p>2. Kiss him</p>
              <p>3. Caress him</p>
              <p>4. Massage him</p>
              <p>5. Carry him</p>
              <p>6. Coddle him</p>
              <p>7. Feed him a mixture of fresh-cream, sugar, &amp; rose-petals</p>
