              <p>1. I'm not Chen but I do identify with the underdog in ALL circumstances. A sweet boy like Chen doesn't deserve the abuse -- leave alone execution -- he suffered at the hands of Xinyi. Children are children regardless of gender. To make matters worse, Chen is born with a severe neurological disability.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Jiani is NOT mature in the *least*. He is part of the problem which causes so much harm to defenseless boys like Chen. A mature person realizes that the average girl-child is no more innocent, weak, vulnerable, or sensitive than the average boy-child of the same age. Instead Jiani further traumatizes Chen and calls him a "wimp" because he has a handicap that impairs his ability to defend himself. What should Chen do? What can Chen do in such a debilitating situation? Jiani is a heartless bully. If Jiani has any hint of maturity in him [as you claim], he will show some compassion and sympathy for tender sweethearts like Chen and retract his hurtful insults he made against Chen.</span></strong></p>

              <p>1. The only thing "wrong" with me is that I'm a compassionate individual</p>
              <p>2. So what if Chen doesn't currently exist? It doesn't change the fact that the life of an innocent child is lost to the disgusting cowardly monster Xinyi.</p>
              <p>3. Yes, Chen is a soft sweet boy. You feel sick because you are an insecure macho man who can't handle when a boy displays weakness or sensitivity. Such display reminds you of the fact that you also have a weak side despite being male. You've been brainwashed by society into believing that boys should always be tough and endure lethal amounts of pain while girls should be protected. Just admit it, you are a macho man pretending to be a young girl. No one is fooled.</p>
              <p>4. Aging does not mitigate the neurological and psychological trauma cause by abuse experienced when the individual is a child.</p>

              <p>1. Chen goes into neurogenic shock from the spinal cord injury and passes away.</p>
              <p>2. Xinyi never faces any legal or social consequences because she is a girl and her victim is a boy. She falsely-claims he "molested" her and that she executed him in "self-defense". Society believes her and -- she is seen as a "hero" -- despite damning evidence to the contrary. Sweet Chen no longer exists to tell his side of the story and his poor mom is devastated. Most of the community knows Xinyi is lying but they don't care. The public still sides with Xinyi and commends her for being a "strong girl".</p>

              <p>I personally feel it is wrong for society to force a male of any
                                      age to treat a girl-child "better" than a boy-child of the same age if/when such treatment is provided solely based on the gender of the children.</p>
              <p>By "better" I
                                      mean one or more of the following:</p>
              <p>1. More compassion<br> 2. More sympathy<br> 3. More respect<br> 4. More gentleness<br> 5. More easiness<br> 6. More empathy<br> 7. More cleanliness<br> 8. More protection<br> 9. More luxury<br> 10. More personal space<br> 11. More privacy<br> 12. More security<br> 13. More freedom<br> 14. More modesty<br> 15. More decency</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>On average, the adult woman:<br> <br> 1. Is physically weaker than the adult man<br> 2. Is more emotional than the adult man<br> 3. Is better behaved than the adult man<br> 4. Is far more likely to be a victim of opposite-gender violence
                                      [e.g. violence may be sexual, domestic, or spousal abuse] than the
                                      adult man<br> 5. Can get or be pregnant whereas the adult man can't<br> 6. Is physically more delicate than the adult man<br> <br> Also, it is likely natural for a man to want to treat an adult
                                      woman partially over an adult man -- this is seen in many mammalian
                                      species. For example in many species of large mammals -- such as
                                      bison --, the adult males are rough with each other but tender with
                                      the adult females.<br> <br> I therefore understand that:<br> <br> 1. Women need - and should be provided with - more protection
                                      against men, than visa versa<br> 2. Women need - and should be provided with - more protection
                                      against men, than adults of the same gender from each other<br> <br> However, the same does not apply to boy-child vs. girl-child.<br> <br> I believe males of all ages should treat adult women "better" than adult
                                      men. This will give men/boys a respect for adult women and will
                                      help prevent these males from perpetrating domestic violence
                                      against their wives and girlfriends. However, males -- of any age
                                      -- should never be taught to treat girl-children better than
                                      boy-children because this will cause boys to develop an intense and
                                      life-long hatred for young girls and a hatred for the macho men who
                                      teach these boys to defer to girls. This sexism against boy
                                      children will likely cause boys to also despise society and it's
                                      irrational norms.<br> <br> The average girl is no more weak, innocent, well-behaved, delicate,
                                      vulnerable, or sensitive than the average boy of the same age.</p>
              <p>It is due to this pro-girl sexism that I don't want to have any
                                      children. I don't want my potential son being brutalized by society
                                      just because he is a boy -- like Chen. I don't want my potential daughter
                                      turning into a vile monster -- like Xinyi -- who goes out of her way to mistreat
                                      boys just because she knows she'll get away with it.</p>
              <p>Boy = male who is under 18 years of age</p>
              <p>Woman = female who is 18 years of age or older</p>
              <p>Man = male who is 18 years of age or older</p>
              <p>Girl = female who is under 18 years of age</p>
              <p>I've probably said this before and I'll say it again...</p>
              <p>...Women -- both in public and private -- usually treat children in a genderless manner. Men, however usually treat girls "better" than boys -- especially in public. This is what leads to tragedies like that experienced by Chen.</p>
