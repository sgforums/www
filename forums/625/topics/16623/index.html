            <div class='col-md body'>Lexelle, you're right. Strange that while guys in uniform are adored in other countries,... e.g. US Navy, Marines, etc... NSmen haven't been given that same treatment.<br><br>I think if the girl has got bros who've gone through NS before, then the chances of them freaking out when their boyfriends enter the army are slimmer (just a generalization)...<br><br>well, I hear that girlfriends are like prized possessions in the army... is that true?<br><br>But what for get girlfriend when after the sweetness of the birth of a new relationship fades, there are heartaches and pains to bear that if you knew the intensity of the pain now, you'd think twice about complicating your already complicated green service to the nation. Sometimes it can be more of an additional pain than a relief.<br><br>U think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. well,<br><br>Think it's really difficult to get a girlfriend in NS .. the matter lies a lot on the time you have to invest.<br><br>And for those who went thru army.. or still in army.. guessed all of us noe that personal time can be a luxury unless you are doing 8-5 kinda vocation.<br><br>And since naturally, relationship need time to nurture.. and gals will definitely prefer their boyfriend to be more than just on the other side the phone, NF guys is at a obvious disadvantage.<br><br>not only is hard to find one.. it's hard to maintain one too.<br><br>The bottom line .. Dun get one because you are sexual deprived from it... if so, as the army saying goes.. "Go f**k the wall"<br><br>:Ãž<br><br>------------------<br>Â°-V-Â°<br>Â°-I-Â°<br>Â°-Z-Â°</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If relationships with NSmen are really so terrible becoz of time constraint and them being only available at the other end of the phone, what about long distance relationships???<br><br>Very important are the character &amp; personalities and commitment of both parties. If the girl is really self-centred and is only looking for her needs to be met and constant 100% undivided attention showered on her, then the guy is better off without her. Would the guy be worried that if he cannot be there with her, then her attention seeking nature would lead her to seek other men?<br><br>The grass will always look greener on the other side if you're not happy where you are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I personnally think that NSF guys finds difficult in having a GF,can be of the time as mentioned earlier in this topic. Secondly, the NSF pay is as low that you can't even have your GF desires fulfilled.<br>Most importantly, Nowadays the Singapore gals are more materialistic. So it's even difficult to even having a steady GF!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, there's always the so called psychological effects of NS....<br><br>I've friends who formerly were very lively, talkative, and overall pretty fun to be with, but after they went into NS..... Well, they're more or less just stare, idle, dun talk, stone, or plain don't wanna go out.<br><br>I mean, from a girl's point of view, the guy isn't the same guy that she was in love with anymore.<br><br>Of course, there's a lot of other factors involved, but this is one of them.</div>

Girls need someone to care for...they are humans too....why can't NSmen be more considerate?GFs waited for u guys every saturday jus to see u n you guys gave such answer.</div>
