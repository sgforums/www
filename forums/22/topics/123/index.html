            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I've been a wiccan for 4 years and I still get stares from ppl at my pentacle until i have to wear it hidden inside. You don't know how hard it is to be a wiccan in Singapore. People think we worship the devil even though that is connected to christianity not wicca. We embrace nature and we connect with Mother Earth in ritualistic ways. We are just like normal people but sometimes we are more than just humans. It is sad that people treat us like freaks or wannabes because there are people who truly belong to this religion but have to hide their real identity. People are afraid of things they don't know and wicca isn't evil at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, this is sort of late, but I couldn't help adding. I am a practising solitary Wiccan-- nearing one year, and yes, I am 13. young, huh? but I've had enough of the conversions and charmed/harry potter wannabes already! No, I am NOT cavorting with the devil, NO, i do not believe in the devil, NO NO NO i cannot fly and make energy forms out of nothing in front of me and NO, stepping on my cat's eye crystal will NOT put a curse on you. There. happy now?<br><br>Sheesh.<br><br>This place really reminds me of mystic wicks.<br><br>No, I do not bother to hide my pentacle once out of school-- jewellery without registration with the principal is outlawed, and I simply can't be bothered. I don't understand how a beautiful symbol like the pentacle can be twisted into a depraved repulsion like the baphomet. Wicca/Witchcraft is a beautiful religion, and the oldest. It predates Judeo-Christianity by 25 000 years, give or take a few thousand. See? hmph.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I'm a new member of the Singapore Forum. I do not practise 100% witchcraft, but i come form a healer family (my mom's side) and we all have at least one form of spiritual communication. I work specifically on crystals and a bit on herbal teas and essential oils. I treat these forms of magic more as a form of technology, like Atlantis' eletrical and magnetism powers ( to learn more, go to <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/atlantis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/atlantis.html</a>  ), and I'm currently in search of an eternal youth formula (and not too far away from success!) as I fancy remaining a young boy forever. I am glad to see that Singapore isn't a country that neglects spirituality other than a lay practise of any religion.</div>

The -baphomet- is the upside pentacle/pentagram which depicts a goat with horns. And the pentacle signifies the four elements, uppermost point for spirit, and the circle around it for unity. That is what I know and understand. No, you don't need "spiritual concentration" to see the goat's head-- just some imagination and aforehand knowledge. Nor is the baphomet the only sign-- there is also the inverted cross or the symbol of three sixes intertwined together, or just the number six hundred and sixty-six.<br><br>The pentacle also stands for "The Perfect Man/Woman", signifying a person spread-eagled. Don't ask me why they call it that, I'm just a student.</div>

I suspect you are talking about blood-sacrifices, not witchcraft. There is such a thing as "The Law of Three" and the Wiccan Rede, which prevents witches and wiccans from doing any intentional harm. Those who do so intentionally are not called witches/wiccans. The Law of Three-- Three times what thou sends out returns to thee. Wiccan Rede-- "Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfil, an ye harm none, do what ye will". See? The Law, and The Law of the Power as well, states "harm none" as one of the most basic rules. So essentially, I think you're pinpointing the wrong group altogether.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I want to say that i totally agree with everything pebbles and nosterella have said (including the bit about the grammar). i don't do much practical wicca at the moment because i don't feel that at this stage in my life i can give it the time commitment it requires and deserves. but at my top choice of university there are many wiccan students, so i hope to practise it there. i have been researching it a lot, and reading about it. to angelena, i recommend silver ravenwolf's publications as a good place to start your research. as i read i realised that without being concious of it, my mother and i had to an extent being practising wicca for a long time. i'd always labled myself a free thinker, when in fact all my beliefs ran unknowingly parallel to wiccan beliefs and laws.<br><br>the devil has absolutely NOTHING to do with wicca. come on, the devil is a creation of the cristian faith, wicca is a completely separate religion. and the devil in the pentacle? i'm sorry, but i'm sure if you focused hard enough, you could see the devil in anything. the only time i've ever felt the presence of anything evil or connected to the devil is when i was in church. take that as you will.<br><br>here's a question of curiosity for you wiccans:<br>do you put down wicca as your religion on official forms? for example your ic? i mean, how truthful are you/faithful are you?<br><br>i put free thinker down on mine, because i wasn't absolutely sure i wanted to pursue wicca at that point. even now, i think wicca can be kept private, and there's nothing wrong with being private or public about it, because it's personal more than anything else.<br>what do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know i already wrote a lot, but there's one more thing i wanted to add. those of you who seem really enthusiasthic about becomeing wiccan......no offense but it sounds to me like you are going into this on a whim, as a fad. i'd just like to say be cautious, follow the laws of respect, and don't do anything stupid!<br>personally i think ouiji boards are stupid, if that's any guideline.</div>
