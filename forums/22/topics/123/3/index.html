            <div class='col-md body'>ok to those ppl out there who are talking about white or black magick let me clarify things up.<br><br>Firstly i am a witch/wiccan and yes i am not embarasse abt tat i am a witch. I am expierence and initiated so i am qualify to be a high priest and i run a coven which is something like a christian cell group.<br><br>There is no such thing as black or white magick. Its jus magick and it depends on how one wans to use it. So if one witch does evil and go into so called " black " magick it doesn mean all the witches and wiccans in singapore and the world do tat.<br><br>And to Mazohyst who is passing remarks at wicca, please do not passed any further as we are not doin the same to ur religion watever it is. And with that i thank thee.<br><br>And to all those who are intrested in wicca feel free to sent me an email to Sacredflamer@hotmail.com<br><br>Merry meet and merry part , Blessed be<br><br></div>

Trees were put on earth not to be hugged, but to provide Oxygen, fruits etc. Not a nice warm hug. Thats what a spouse is for. Are you gonna marry a tree?</div>

If I had the mindset of hugging a tree instead of hugging a human because it's easier to find a tree, then wouldn't i be treating the tree as a prostitute? Forgive me if my reply seems weird beacuse I actually cannot comprehend what you mean by " Is it more frequent then u can find a tree ?? "</div>

And if i din remember wrongy i did not insult u nor ur religion. N please check out wicca properly first, we do believe in God and Goddess and of course magick.<br><br>And may i say this, did ur god gave u power to comment and judge us ?? And if i'm not wrong in the bible god said he loves every body no matter if he's " normal " or not. And Jesus says love ur neighbours as u love thy self. Are u following what ur religion is telling u ??</div>
