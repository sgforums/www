I had enough with your fucking comments, Mazohyst. Christian is not the true religion of God. Islam is. But you fucking Christians can't accept the fact that the the religion of God is brought to you by someone who is not of Jesus's lineage (Muhammad). So what did the faggy-do-dah-dae high priests did? They took advantage of the situation and defame Muhammad. They also took advantage of the illiterate followers of Christians by rewriting holy phrases and teachings of the ORIGINAL BIBLE. The OLD TESTAMENT was CREATED by mere man just so that Christianity won't die to Islam. That's what you are Mazohyst, just a follower. You can't think for yourself, not daring to question the bible written by man.<br><br>i'm not yet a full-pledged wiccan. so i'm now lashing out at only MAZOHYST. I'm not degrading Chritianity although i seem to have done so. But the truth hurts. Find out the truth first before you say anything. And if you can't prove me wrong, Mazohyst, don't even think of replying to this. And if you think by quoting me in other forums based on what i had said. well by all means please do. That's the truth and i'm not afraid of it. But your battle is with me on this topic. don't involve the wiccans group in this.<br><br>To the wiccans, i'll understand if i'm not accepted. but that's the way i am.</div>

Unless of course u do not proclaim ur faith in wicca when u are in church. But this two religions don match, it just doesn and its not we wiccans are not accepting christians into our faith but its Christians who are not accepting us.<br><br>I came from a christian school and there are wiccans in my school but we must go hush hush about it course if not, we will have church members and the pastors running after us with a bible. I ever encounter one such case, i was sitting down in the canteen then the pastor came up to me and said, " Are u involve in witchcraft ? " I had to say no even though 3/4 of me wanted to scold him and ask him wat so wrong about tat, but thinkin of expulsion made me think twice.<br><br>So u see, its not tat we wiccans do not wan to proclaim our faith but its becaz of christians out here who are stubborn and not willing to understand other religion and keep thinkin tat christianity is the one true way. Tats the diffrence between Wicca and Christianity.<br>And hopefully as the years past, we wiccans can go out in broad daylight and proclaim our faith and not be bothered and labelled as " Satanic " by others. Bless all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi pple.<br>Everyone would most probably think that their religion is the true one and that they would be closer to the Divine one than others, thus i would understand of their strong objections to Wicca(esp. the Christians). Still, pple still think of modern Wicca as devil's religion. well, wrong... The people of today are beginning to think of wicca as a religion that does not necessary involve the worship of evil. I chose wicca even though i was born into a Christian family.<br>Y?<br>B'cos of wat i believe in- as long as you are of kind intent, you would not rot in hell or be punished by the Divine one.<br><br>I do not believe that God would forgive a Christian who commits all kinds of sins and send a kind soul to hell just b'cos he/she doesn't believe in him.<br><br>I feel better being a wiccan.<br><br>I would not question any religion as long as evil is one of its purpose. As long as you are happy in your religion, why care abt wat others think abt u. Be firm in your belief.<br><br>Be free, feel free!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
