            <div class='col-md body'>Your religion is something to be proud of. Just because there are people out there who believe that wicca is evil or a form of satanism, wiccans know different. Who cares what other people think? They might hate you because of it, but they are in the wrong, not you. I don't think that anyone should hide their pentacle/pentagram just because other people don't approve. Christians wear their cross out in the open without people glancing at them distastefully, so why can't we with our religious symbols? Let them think what they like.[/b]<strong></strong><span class="large"></span><span class="large"></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Don't be ashamed!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't help but post my comments on this topic even if it has been dormant for quite some time. Ancient Magick is wat Charmed and Buffy been using. Its kinda hard to find the exact ingredients to duplicate what the TV series did. One thing for sure is that most of the original Ancient Magick Spells were destroyed decades or even centuries ago. Even if there is still some spells left, they are guarded very sacredly either to protect it or use it for their own selfish reasons.<br>I want to come into contact with the wiccans that are here in SG. Maybe we can learn from each other. How abt contacting each other through this forums mailbox.</div>
