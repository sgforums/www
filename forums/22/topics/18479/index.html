            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, it's me again. i think, there should be a balance between both career and relationships. but well, if u really wanna say importance ah.....eh...most probably i'd say it's relationships. lose ur career, can find another one what. lose friend, or family, not so easily recovered.<br><br>thou' i may say this, but  well, s a student, tt's my career, nmy duty is to score well in the examinations. so in this case, i dun put relationships. i won't exactly neglect it, but i dun put it my top priority. for instance, if i did something wrong, something to offend a friend of mine, i'll try to get it settled in the shortest time possible. a time limit will be given more or less. so if it takes longer than tt limited time to mend, i'd just give up n try to salvage it after everything. negative attitude right? well, tt's me. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... this tread needs some boost.<br>*Flex his fingers for a mega typing session*<br><br>Sorry lex, I know you are not going to like this, I'm too lenghty for your liking. Anyhow, thanks for the support.<br><br>To me, my family plays a ver important part in my life.(Maybe due to the fact that my family history have many major hiccups in it.) but it is because of this that I want to develope my career to the fullest, before I commit. Strange? Well look at it in my piont of view.<br><br>One of the major causes for fanily problems presnetly is money. The husband got to work so he spend less time with the family, and then because of that the wife and children is unhappy and then the complaint fro mthe husband comes that the family does not understands him. But if the husband spend less time at work and more with the family, the family might have finacial problems and that too lead to unhappiness, in this aspect we are asking ourself a very generic question of the chicken and the egg. which comes first.<br><br>So in my POV, I would rather solve them one by one, rather then have the 2 crash me together. How? well, easy, dun get married before you are sure that your finacial status will be able to support your family even if say you spend your majority of your time at home rather than at work. In this way, you will have less finacial worries, and you can carry on and go for that holiday every year with your family as and when you like it. you too, will not have problems about spending time with your family, because in this case most of your time will be spend at home.<br><br>Then am I saying that, you dun get married until you are like 50 years old or something like that? Well, of course not, look at it from another prespective, it is because you devote your time to building your career, and finacial stability(much more that other people) that you have a higher chance of retiring earlier. you might say retire at 35 if you are really that good. But I am not talking about being greedy here, it is always good that you set yourself a guildline as to what is enough, $1,000,000? $20,000,000? Well it is up to what lifestyle you are looking at, but remeber to set a target or you never know when to stop. And set the timeframe, say by 35yrs old I must have this and that. this will help you plan your moves better.<br><br>Once you have reach your target, it is time to maintain it, and make sure that the money will earn itself, fixed deposite? Insurance? shares? it is up to you, just make sure that you will be able to maintain the money and your lifestyle so that your children will still have money after you pass away, educate them about money, or they will not know how to keep your fortune after you die. pls note that this is for your family interest and not for your own.<br><br>After all this is done, you can spend the rest of the time with your wife, lovingly walking into the sunset without so much hiccups. and your family will have 1 less thing to worry about. NOTE that I am not saying that money will solve everything, but just that you will have something lesser to worry about. And that is one major thing might I say, and after you can devote your time to solving other thing in life like educating your children and grooming them into fine individuals in life.<br><br>So note that I might seem very career minded, but the basis of my motivation to become successful lies on the fact that I want my family to be a happy one when I finally settle down, I am no money-minded personnel if you know me well enough, but I think I got my own priority and philosophy in life. I do still feel the need to fullfil the basics needs of a family.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi callan:<br>yeb, it's moi replying again......<br>well, firstly, i do agree with u saying that u want a stable career and income before marriage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> it's nice of u to think that having the financial capabilities to support the family's every need will make the family happy. no doubt it will. i gather from here that u prefer ur wife to stay at home and look after the kids and enjoy life?<br><br>anyway, one point i don't agree with, is that if u don't have enough money to support ur family, they won't be happi. i think, ur wife will go thru' thick and thin with u, if not, how can she even call herself ur wife. u think that being able to provide ur wife a comfortable life is ur responsibility. right? well, i think ur wife would be gladder than anything to be able to share the family's burden with u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> of course, what i have said does not apply to the whole of the female population.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>well, wish u luck in ur career.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess I better make myself clear here, It's not that if you dun have money then you will be unhappy, but life would be better wouldn't it? There would be one less concern to think about. And yes, I believe that my wife would one who would go through thick and thin with me, but because it is so, all the moreI do not want it to happen, she would be too good to go through that.<br><br>By the time, I have amass whatever fortune I want, I will be able to then commit most of my energies to nurturing my children together with my wife at the same time. Also I will be able to truly appreciate my wife, and spend more quality time together even after marriage. The simple reason I am able to do so being I have already solve a mjor problem in my life namely $$$.<br><br>This might not be the conventional way of doing things, but I believe that this would be a better way. Though it might be diffcult especially when you see your friends around you starting their families while you are still fighting for your career. The thought of having all the time in the world with the family you want to build after I have build my career, would only spurn me on. I believe in looking and planning far. and thus my reasons for my actions and thought. I believe that Temporal happiness in a "conventional" marriage will most probably last 1-2 years before problems like money starts to comes in. But in my case I hope that my family will be saved from the finacial aspects of problems.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regard to that, I think relationships r more important. No doubt $$ &amp; career does make life more comfortable in material terms, but we as humans r sentimental animals..we need friends, family etc etc...<br><br>In real times of need, if u maintain a good relationship with others, they r the ones who really help, not ur career n in certain cases, no amt of $$ will help.<br><br>Relationships r mostly long-term..we need to invest in them. Once lost, no amt of time or $$ can bring it back.<br><br>Careers on the other hand, can be changed or built up with time n effort. They only last 20-40 yrs...the rest of our lives r usually based on relationships...<br><br>Sorry if I'm talking nonsense. *blur blur*</div>
