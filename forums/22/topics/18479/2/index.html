            <div class='col-md body'>I can't resisting posting in this thread even though I'm quite reluctant to post in this forum.... what the heck.<br><br>Personally, I want to believe that career and relationships cannot be separated as much as you want to. You need to work hard at your career, but there is no need to put feelings for another person aside. As well, you might be lumping career, marriage (aka settling down) and having kids all into one basket. If that is the case then I have to disagree.<br><br>You can put a lot of effort and of yourself in a career, but you need to share the rest of the time, precious quality time, with your honey (not neccesarily wife). Or in your case callan, honeys. I think you MUST be able to squeeze out some time, otherwise you are working too hard for your own good, maybe to the point of diminishing returns.<br><br>You are also ignoring the age factor. There is just something about getting into relationships when you are younger compared to when you are older. I can't explain it, because I've not experienced it.<br><br>Wait here wait there, it takes forever to wait till the conditions are right for each part of your life. I think I rather work at each different part of my life slowly along the way, because life cannot be segragated into different compartments that easily. It takes time for things to progress in each of those areas, and our life would be much more enriching and well spent if we could put part of ourselves in different aspects of it all the time, rather than just all of ourselves in different areas some of the time.<br><br>Personal thoughts people.....</div>

Well, I suppose it would be good to give you some space for now, and for me to have soem space with tired. She can share our juicy details with you...<br><br>Tired:<br><br>I am not offended in anyway, rather, I would love it if you can dance for me under the moonlight for me then, parquet floors are goo to dance on, well, I have it at home, you can choose to come over and dance on it when you feel like it. I will just sit vack and enjoy oyur great performance.<br><br>Tet:<br><br>You know something? If I have know you earlier I would have gone crazy for you, for you are a woman after my own heart. *laffs* But nonetheless, I do still admirer ambitious woman, go ahead, and achieve your dreams, do nto wait for them to come to you, for yu do not move they will never come. I wish you the best for your future and the same to your bf.<br><br>Pac:<br><br>Well, I agree with you on the fact that it is difficult to segragated life into diffrent segments, it is almost impossible. But my intentions is not to be deviod my time totally of business or of relatioships, it is just the pirority I take at that point in time. I would definitely place a lotm ore emphasis on my career now and relatioship will take second place, but that doesn't meant that I will not be in any relationships, it just meants that I would prefer to invest my time in my career whenever possible, rather than the relatioship. And vice-versa after I have my career built. If there is a need to carry on with my career then, I would be doing it on a part time basis, just a few hours in the office a day to make sure that things are in place, and the ability to not go to work anytime I want. I think this should explain by POV better to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As they say....no man's an island...<br>Men are social animals. We can never do without relationships...be it family, love or friends....<br><br>Sadly, our society has also evolved to become materialistic, so you can't do w/out a career too. And as Callan had put it, sometimes no financial security can lead to sad endings in relationships, esp where love is concerned. Sure...you can say stuff like if he/she really loves you, then $$ is not an impt factor. But what happens when reality sets in...&amp; you have mouths to feed?<br><br>Of course, it's best if I can have the best of both worlds....heee..heee.<br><br>But if I've to choose now..&amp; I mean NOW...I'll definitely go for my career. Okie...call me ambitious, but as much as I think r/s are impt in life...there's also something as impt too, called self-worth.<br><br>Yup..it may seem selfish, but then again men are selfish creatures too. Hey, even Maslow's hierarchy of needs ranked self-actualization higher than social needs!And what better time to do it than now...when you are young &amp;<br>physically &amp; mentally-abled to do it?<br><br>I'm not advocating ruthlessness here where you have to "bull-doze" over everything in sight that's hindering you to a successful career path. But I rather try to strike it out now when my parents are still able to take care of themselves...when I'm single...than when my Mom &amp; Dad are old &amp; feeble...when I'm loaded with responsibilities towards my husband &amp; kids...<br>*gasps &amp; shudders @ that thought*<br><br>Hmm...then again...ask me in 10-15 yrs' time, &amp; I can tell you my perspectives will change then.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Jubilee (edited 06 April 2000).]</div>
