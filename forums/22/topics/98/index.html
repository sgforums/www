            <div class='col-md body'>refer to the above. anyway, what it means, is anyone too young to be involved in a bgr?? this age group refers mainly to teenagers. of course when u are just a little kid, it's rather impossible.<br>it's like adults always say that when u are in secondary sch, dun get involved in a bgr. u are not fit to be in love. u don't even know what love is, how can u fall in love. is this true??? if so, to what extent?<br><br>personally, i feel that parents should not restrict their children to an age when they can "start" falling in love. thou' there may b more dangers when u r young, coz u r so innocent and naive, but i believe if they educate their child well, such dangers couuld be prevented. mayb a heartbreak will cause alotta grief, and getting into a r/s is a waste of time, buut i think they should be given a chance to learn from their own mistakes, and experience the feeling of teenage love. still thinking......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, it depends on how u define BGR...if it is what u mean by serious love n the other followups...I think age does matter.<br>Most people are only sensible n mature when they reach 18 or 19 yrs old..I mean *most, that's the time they can take responsibility for their own actions and towards their counterpart. When u r very much younger, the type of BGR involved r usually crushes or puppy love...<br><br>However, it still depends on individuals...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it really matter with age cause if u are having BGR when u r 13 to 16 of age, i can say that this BGR will not last long. Because u teenages just want to show off by having a BGR lor. Withthin my lifes in my secdonary school i reall see a lot of BGR that does not last very long because teenages withthin the age of 13 to 16 does not really know how to think problay. I quote this BGR AS &lt;Puppy Love&gt; i can have a bet with u lor that a BGR withthihin the age of 13 to 16 does long last more than 2 to 3 mths and the shortest is 1 month.This teen nowadays doesn't know how to think for themselves. I really agree to age do matter in a BGR!</div>

What are the chances of an obese person getting a partner? Or a poor broken guy/gal for that matter? Close to nothing...<br><br>Young kids just go for looks , once they get bored of it , they split , u cant help it , the whole of Singapore doesnt read this forum.I know some girls who lost their V at ages of 14 or 15 , some just do it with their bf when they want.<br><br>A very harsh fact but true , i admit this is very steorotype , but to me , this is the way i see things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah... so true. I have to wonder, though, if "puppy love" isn't sort of good sometimes. That way, people actually get to experience a tiny, diluted dose of love before they are completely swept away by a feeling they don't understand... at least they will be a bit prepared if they have had superficial relatioships before. They will know how to make small talk, please the other person, have a give and take relationship and know when the person is going too far... I think it's natural for teenagers to seek someone to focus their affection on, it's like... oh, I don't know. There was this show that said something like "24 hours in a day-- 8 hours for sleep, 8 hours for study/work misc., and 8 hours to love somebody. That is what everybody needs." It's also like... the thrill of the chase, a bit of excitement and distraction from the humdrumness of daily life... love tints even the grayest days with a bit of colour, whether it's "real" love or just a foretaste of the actual thing.</div>
