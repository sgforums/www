My friend says I lack "The Drive" or rather, the motivation or passion to complete something. I have always wondered, is this Drive buried somewhere in me?<br><br>Would I be able to rise to the occasion when i need to? To find that extra energy to go that extra few miles?<br><br>So where does the source of your "Drive" or will to suceed come from?<br><br>I wish I find my powerpoint soon...

            <div class='col-md body'>My frens all said I am one of the most motivated and determined person they have ever known.<br><br>I have goals. Some are long term goals and some are short term ones.<br><br>I used to be a person who are not so motivated. I just tell myself "try your best". And that is what i did all the time. I scored pretty well for my PSLE, at least I am qualified for Special Course. So I thought I can get into XXX school since I am already a Special Course Student. However, I was taken aback when I knew that I was actually rejected by that school and was hence posted to my 2nd choice.<br><br>That was kind of a turning point of my life, yes, at a young age of 12.<br><br>From that lesson, I learnt that if I really want something, I must really work HARD for it. Don't take success for granted. I then became a very determined and motivated person and had never failed to achieve what I wanted from then on.<br><br>Today, I don't believe in "trying my best" anymore because I still dun know what is my "best". I am still trying hard to know what i am capable of.<br><br>I see myself as a rubber band. I know i can be stretched, but how far ? I am stretching myself whenever i have the opportunity. One day that rubber band will snap, and that is when i can truly say "that's my best".<br><br>How to be motivated ?? It is hard, but not impossible. But these things keep me going :<br><br>a.  Keep all promises you made, no matter how small and to whom do you made those promises (even young children).<br><br>b.  Plan your goals. Make sure you have planned your route well to achieve what you want to achieve. Don't only think of the end results, think of *how* you are going to achieve these results. Then work them out.<br><br>c.  Never give up. Plan well, understand your plan, believe in it and then work it out. But be prepared to change your plans. The World is dynamic, you should not be static.<br><br>d.  Set datelines for yourself. And MAKE SURE you meet the datelines.<br><br>e.  Not only do well in the things you do, you MUST be the BEST.<br><br>f.  Do not allow yourself to fail. Every failure will be a blow to your confidence. But if you do fail, be PROUD of it.<br><br>g.  Passion. Have passion in the things you do.<br><br>h.  Nothing is more impossible than the creation of life itself, which has already happened millions of years ago.<br><br>That's about all i can think of now.<br><br>Just keep stretching yourself, one day you'll know your limits but most of us are too young to have reached that.<br><br>"In order to accelerate, you'll need a force. Without a force, you'll stay where you are" -- Sir Isaac Newton on Newton's 2nd Law.<br><br>And this force must come from WITHIN you.<br><br>Start young. Don't believe the "never too late" concept.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Setting goals is easy... planning isn't easy. That is what I meant by "burden with disadvantages and limited resources". It's because of all the planning and forseeable problems that could possibly arise that makes one stop and think twice. Depending on how big the problem is... it is capable of deminishing that drive to work towards that goal.</strong></blockquote>Nope, i dun think setting a goal is easy. Some of us could not achieve our goals because we are too unrealistic. Set a realistic goal. Once you have a long term goal, think of all the short term goals that you must achieve first before reaching that long term one. This is the divide and conquer concept.<br><br>Planning a goal is more important than setting one. And believe me, you can't plan it alone. You got to talk to many people. People who are more experienced than you. Assimilate all their thoughts and conjure something of your own. Something that suits you best.<br><br>Yes, you will face problems when executing your plans. Hence I mentioned that the "world is dynamic, so you should not be static". You must be ready to change your plans when the world is changing. There is more than one way to Rome.<br><br>There are always uncertainties in our future. Nobody can avoid that. But there are basically 2 things you can do about it :<br><br>a.  Minimise the risk<br>b.  Do not minimise the risk. Set a flexible plan and live with the risk or even make use of the risk to your advantage (agility of plan)<br><br>These are the 2 method most commonly used by companies all around the world to tackle with uncertainties in the market.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It's a risk that one has to take... go for it despite all the difficulties or take a step back and wait for better opportunites.<br></strong></blockquote>Yes, there is always risk involved. Do take the risk. But when i say "risk" i mean "calculated risk". Eliminate as much risk as possible and analyse whatever that is left. Then decide if you can take these risk.<br><br>when taking risk, one has to ask himself if he can face the consequences of the worst situation. If he can, by all means, take that risk. If not, back off.</div>
