            <div class='col-md body'>What's wrong??<br>Is it just me or ppl jux cannot stand ppl who dress differently from them????<br>I was on the MRT that day dressed in a t-shirt and a baggy pair of jeans and this WEIRDO of a lady came on board with a friend ....<br>And after gossiping so loudly as if the train was empty, started saying to her friend how much she would never wear a BIG PAIR OF PANTS with a big logo (that was what i was wearing and she was just standing two passengers away) and could not understand why ppl would wear that....I stared at her and her friend saw me and and was so 'paisah' that she quickly turned away and told her friend with the big hole in her face to (i believe) shut up! What..., everyone has to dress like her to avoid criticism?<br>I happened to be with my mother that day and my mother who is older than THAT lady has no objection to what I wear!<br>So what is wrong with these ppl?</div>
