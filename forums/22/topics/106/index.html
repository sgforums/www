            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm only 13 years old now, and I have a stead already. Things go quite ok in the beginning...<br><br>Well, she's my classmate. We used to phone each other but often, we've nothing to talk about at all. So we just kept quiet throuhout the call.<br><br>That's very time consuming, and I don't really like it. For some reasons, or another, I've been lying to her and not talking on phone with her. I usually say that I'm not free or just say I'll call back later, but eventually, I won't.<br><br>That's when we both stop talking to each other. Maybe she's angry that I'm avoiding her? How can I tell her about I don't like calling?<br><br>Since it's school holiday now, I've thought of going out with her. And that's when the money part comes in. And again, going out can be money consuming too.<br><br>I'm not as old as some of you out there. As you may know, I don't really have that much money.<br><br>Well, after you all seeing that, you may think I'm a "stingy" guy? Hmmmz... I've no choice... Sobz~<br><br>Can anyone of you out there help me solve this problem? How can I carrying on this relationship with her without the "money" and "time" problem?<br><br>I really want to carry on this relationship. Please help me ASAP.<br><br>** P.S.: My english's not that powderful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> , if possible, please tell me where I went wrong in this post.<br><br>[This message has been edited by sMiLey- (edited 25 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think tt u gotta be frank to ur gf. It's good tt u are matured enough to knoe tt phone calls can be time consuming and as such, i'm sure u will be able to reason with ur gf nicely. Even so, u cant blame her for avoiding u. Breaking ur promise to call back may seem a small thing, but u still broke a promise to someone u love. Not to make this sound so serious, but u betrayed her trust to some extent. She may like u but u gotta show ur love back too. i think tt u shld still call ur gf regularly to ask abt her and show ur care and concern for her. If u dun like calling, perhaps u can email or send her letters and postcards to show tt she still has a place in ur heart. This is the basic responsibility of a bf, tt is, to make ur gf happy and able to rely on u when she's troubled....<br><br>Abt the money problem, i think it's a typical problem for many teenagers, including me. Wat i do is tt i save up my allowance to spend it during the hols. Money shouldn't be a main issue while dating even if it's impt to have cash. What really matters is the time u spend with ur gf. Simple things like going to the beach together doesn't require too much money...<br><br>Well, hope tt helps...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well firstly, you must understand that having a gf means that you need to sacrifice your timE and money..<br><br>Are you ready to commit into a relationship? Love isn't a game nor a easy play.. it concerns matters of the heart and should be taken seriously.. that's when i realise that you are not sincere in committing..<br><br>If you love the person, you will never lie to her nor avoid her. Even when there is nothing to talk about.. well as long as you know you have called her up. Be honeSt! Tell her the truth.. tell her that you aren't gonna listen to silenCe.. and say that both of you should chat for awhile.. Or maybe hoG the phOne and watch TV together..<br><br>About the $$, can't help it.. you're still younG and depend on pocket money.. Spend wisely.. Save up a little that is enough to buy her dinner, catch a movie occasionally.. =) Get a part-time joB and start workinG! Be wiSe in spenDing.. I think a girl would already be happy and satisfied just when you spend time with her... Go to the beaCh.. spenD time w/o the neeD to spenD $$..<br><br>------------------<br>PeaCe Baby*<br>PeaCe...
