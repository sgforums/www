            <div class='col-md body'>Dearie...how about a date with me? *winks* hahahaha....<br><br>Ok, so you need to de-stress? There are a hundred and one ways to do that. Well, it all depends on what is not stresful for you, or what you enjoy doing. I suppose you should enjoy dancing, yes? How about listening to some Ballet music, Swanlake perhaps? Well here is an excercise I am teaching you to relax.<br><br>In the privacy of your room, close your eyes, lying flat on your back on the floor, imagining that you are faraway on an island...the sun is shining warmly in your face....the sea breeze gently caresses your skin...you hear the soft rustling of trees...the sounds of waves washing up to the shore...just relax....you are totally at ease with yourself....so relax...there is nothing that is botherign you...relax....breath in...and slowly breath out....feel the warm air going through your nose to your lungs....and then to your tummy, it is a warm and nice feeling...relax....let loose all your muscles...relax....there is no need for your muscles now...so relax....continue with the breathing and concentrate on it...relax...just relax....<br><br>Well you can continue doign this for about 5 mins....and after that you should feel very relax. This is what is taught in stress management course that I organise...so I hope they help you well. Else, there are a few others that can help you, and they are pretty easy too...<br><br>1. Clench your hands into a fist as tightly as you can....count to 10 then you release....you should feel loose and relax after repeating this for about 4 or 5 times.<br><br>2. Close your eyes, you can be sitting lyign down or anything, and just listen to some music....focus on it....after a song or 2 you should feel refreshed.<br><br>3. Do some excercises...most people would say that it adds stress, but in actual fact..it is suppose to release stress as another form of energy. The theroy behind is pretty long winded, and I would only explain it if you want me to, so tell me if you want to know.<br><br>That's all for now....hope that it serve you well...tell me if they work...for they work for me.</div>
