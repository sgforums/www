            <div class='col-md body'>This happened to my family. It was when I was 9 yrs old. My Auntie died in a tragic car accident in 1996 ( that was when i was 9,so slowly go figure moi age ). Chinese believe that on the 7th day, the spirit of the deceased will come back to the family. I dunno how true it was. But on the 7th night itself, my grandparents decided to test this theory so they set out stuff that my dead Aunt liked on the table top. Then next morning, they found the orange peeled and the toys on the table rearranged. I had one more living Auntie. The night b4,she was scared so she pulled the blanket up to cover her face. But there was an invisible force that pulled the blanket of her face. Now that happened in my Grandmother's house. What happened at my house was that my Mum woke up @ 1 am to check up on us kids. ( My mum always wakes up @ around 1am to help us cover blankets and stuff ) 1 am was also the time when my Auntie died in the hospital. My mum said as she was walking down the hallway, she saw my Auntie standing there. We all thought she was dreaming but my mum sweared that it was really my Auntie. My Auntie was standing there, but u cant see anything from her waist onwards. My mum said my Aunt was smiling and beckoning my mum to follow her. Somehow my mum moved without her own accord and soon my Mum found herself in a serene place that resembled the cemetery that my Aunt was buried . When my Mum came back, she looked at the time and found that only 5 mins had passed. How could 5 mins passed when so many things happened?<br>Well that is a mystery unsolved.</div>
