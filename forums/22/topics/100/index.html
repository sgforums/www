            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose a 7-11 relationship is a u want, u come sort of relationship. Such an impromtu relationship pattern usually ends up with disastrous consequences. Murphy, I suggest u try to know the drafting department gal better first before u jump into it. She likes u doesn't mean that u like her.<br><br>Think twice. Relationships are serious matters.</div>
