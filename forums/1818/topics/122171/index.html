And if these toys happen to be powered by USB, well then, all the more fun to have. The USB Mini Desktop Aquarium is the home to two life-like tropical fish. A small motor generates a current in the water, allowing the fish to gently swim about the tank. The aquarium is equipped with a high-intensity blue LED that illuminates the tank in dark environment. Both motor and LED can be independently switched off.<br><br>The LED and the water-current motor can be powered by USB connection or batteries. The package comes complete with the tank, two fish, and USB cable. Operation is simple! Just add water to the tank, connect the cable to your computer, and enjoy the aquarium.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>James Bond Camera<br><br><img src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/front/007camera-front.jpg"><br><br>There is finally a hi-tech gadget from Q's laboratory that can be had by the measly (albeit smart) masses who are not fortunate enough to carry a license to kill. Not even the likes of Auric Goldfinger would imagine that this inconspicuous Zippo look-alike actually contains a digital camera capable of holding over 300 images.<br><br>The JB1 uses ST Micro technology to capture highly-detailed images with incredibly small file sizes. After all, you can't imagine James Bond stopping in the middle of a mission to insert another memory card, can you? Sneaking a pic indoors is kept stealthy thanks to LiteSync technology that allows you to take clear images in fluorescent lighting without using a flash.<br><br>When your mission requires an especially deft touch, use the JB1's surveillance mode to automatically capture images at preset intervals up to 90 minutes apart, spanning up to nineteen days! Of course, you can also capture video clips with sound, so you can record that elusive piece of evidence wherever you may find it.<br><br>This little gadget can also come in handy when you need to take a quick mental note, thanks to its voice recording function. This tiny little gem will record up to 12 minutes of crystal clear audio, so you don't forget any important pieces of information. A nice touch for a secret agent, or an everyday businessman who aspires to be one...</div>
