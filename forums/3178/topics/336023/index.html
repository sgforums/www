              <p>Good day everyone,<br><br>In today's post, we have researched and gathered evidence of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">inconsiderate <span style="color: #ff0000;">RoadHOGGERS</span></span> that are the reason behind why there are more and more ERP Gantries and why ERP charges are going higher. These <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000;">inconsiderate ROADHOGGERS</span> could also be the cause of the deaths of some unfortunate victims in
              ambulances which they have blocked on the expressways. Who are these
              morons?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">We have gathered evidence showing some of the road hoggers contributing to the JAMS along Central Expressway (CTE).</span> They <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">REFUSE TO KEEP LEFT</span> but instead <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">HOG THE RIGHT LANE</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000099;">go slower than the trucks on their left</span>, causing the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">perennial jams</span> along the CTE because <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3333ff;">all the few hundred cars behind them who</span> <span style="color: #3333ff; font-weight: bold;">wants to go faster</span> cannot because they are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">blocked by these ROAD HOGGERS</span> (<span style="color: #330099; font-weight: bold;">If
              you observe carefully, there are no cars in front of these ROAD HOGGERS
              (hogging the extreme right lane) but a long queue of cars BEHIND THEM.
              ie THEY ARE CAUSING THE JAM</span>).<br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Watch these videos of these ROAD HOGGERS causing the jam and even BLOCKING AMBULANCES</span>:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Problem is </span><span class="query" style="font-weight: bold;">exacerbated</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> by the fact that Traffic Police do not seem to be interested in booking these road hoggers</span>: They seem to be more interested in causing more jams by booking fast moving vehicles rather than road hoggers. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3333ff;">Ask around your friends: When was the last time they were booked for road hogging?</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">They probably struck more 4D lottery than been booked for road hogging</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Ask around again who's been booked for speeding: probably everyone except the <span style="font-style: italic;">road hoggers</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br><br>So,
              do you think the attitude of the traffic police has resulted in a
              country of road hoggers: Who cares if I'm causing the jam, Traffic
              Police are not going to book me anyway, but if I am considerate and go
              faster so as to filter left to let traffic behind me past, I'll get
              booked by Traffic Police for speeding. So, is the Traffic Police
              actually contributing to this problem of road hogging and traffic jams
              because of their system of booking people. What's your take on this?<br><br><span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="color: #3333ff; font-weight: bold;">So what is the SOLUTIONS to reducing the traffic jams?</span> </span>Traffic Police or Land Transport Authority should <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #3333ff;">BAN these inconsiderate ROAD HOGGERS from using the extreme right lane or </span><br><br>First time Road Hogging offence: Fine $10,000<br>Second time </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Road Hogging</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;"> Offence: Fine $100,000</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Third time </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">Road Hogging </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">offence: Banned from Driving on extreme right lane &amp; Fine $200,000</span>.<br>Okay,
              the above is a bit too harsh, as much as I would like it to be
              implemented. But if the law was passed, you can be sure the roads would
              definitely be more free flowing. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3333ff;">Solutions after the videos.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you're wondering why : </span><br><span style="color: #000099;">Singapore always kena TRAFFIC JAMs?</span> <span style="color: #000099;">Why more and more ERPs?</span> <span style="color: #000099;">Why ERP Charges More and More EXPENSIVE?</span><br>CHECK OUT the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000;">CAUSE </span>of it here:<br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">(We
              noticed that TAXIs form the BULK OF THE ROADHOGGING &amp; something
              must be done about it: In our future posts, we will show the motoring
              community ALL THE TAXIs HOGGING the extreme right lane. </span><span style="color: #000000;">One
              cannot see the cause of the jam while on the road, but from these
              videos, one will understand why the CTE is jammed and slow moving:
              because of these slow Road Hoggers </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="color: #000000;">taking their Sunday Drive to the right lane during peak hours</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;"></span>)</span><br>

              <p><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000066;">SOLUTIONS TO EASE THE TRAFFIC JAMS</span><br>What one should do is to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3333ff;">ALWAYS KEEP LEFT, even though you claim you are travelling at speed limit</span>. In Singapore, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">LIFE IS HECTIC and there are always people rushing</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't block their way by hogging the right lane</span>.<br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #cc0000;"><br><span style="color: #000099;">He
              may be rushing to take a loved one to hospital, and there you are
              hogging the right lane, causing the jam and no one can overtake because
              of you.</span></span><span style="color: #000099;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A Life could be LOST BECAUSE OF YOUR INCONSIDERATE ROADHOGGING &amp; REFUSAL TO KEEP LEFT!</span></span><br><br>If
              you like to travel on the extreme right lane (Because its faster, and
              you are the type of driver that don't like to change lane or not
              confident enough to change lanes), <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3333ff;">PLEASE DO CHECK YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR AND FILTER LEFT WHEN YOU ARE BEING TAILGATED</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">YOU
              ARE BEING TAILGATED BECAUSE THE CAR BEHIND WANTS TO GO FASTER BUT YOU
              ARE BLOCKING THE RIGHT LANE (WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE OVERTAKING LANE,
              in case you haven't realised), and he cannot overtake on the left
              because the left lanes are for slower moving vehicles. <span style="color: #000000;">If
              you think he is speeding, then that's the job of the Traffic Police,
              who is ALWAYS looking to book fast cars &amp; its not for you to stop
              him from speeding by ROADHOGGING</span>.<br><br><span style="color: #000000;">If
              you insist on hogging the extreme right lane, you are risking the ire
              of the hundreds of motorists that are caught in the JAM that is caused
              by YOU. And if you happened to be flashed and horned by the tailgater
              and you insist on hogging the right lane, there is a high possibility
              that the whole bunch of drivers would just come out of their cars and
              give you a free nose job, and you have no witnesses because everyone
              behind you wants to rearrange your face.<br><br>Singapore is already a
              very stressful and expensive place, Don't Create Road Rage and Don't
              risk being bashed up by insisting on Road Hogging and Blocking everyone
              else on the Expressways.<br><br><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: 130%;">And don't be the cause of the HIGHER ERP charges. </span><br><br><span style="color: #3333ff; font-size: 180%;">Be Considerate, KEEP LEFT.<br><br></span></span></span><span style="color: #330033;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #3333ff; font-size: 180%;"><span style="font-size: 78%;"></span></span></span></span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></span></p>
