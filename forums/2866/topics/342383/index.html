              <h1>2008 was the year man-made global warming was disproved</h1>
              <h2>Looking back over my columns of the past 12 months, one of their major themes 
                was neatly encapsulated by two recent items from The Daily Telegraph.</h2>
              <p>By Christopher Booker <br> Last Updated: 7:27AM GMT 30 Dec 2008</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/3982101/2008-was-the-year-man-made-global-warming-was-disproved.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/3982101/2008-was-the-year-man-made-global-warming-was-disproved.html</a></p>
              <p>The first, on May 21, headed <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3342553/Climate-change-threat-to-alpine-ski-resorts.html">"Climate 
                change threat to Alpine ski resorts"</a> , reported that the entire 
                Alpine "winter sports industry" could soon "grind to a halt 
                for lack of snow". The second, on December 19, headed <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/3851179/The-Alps-have-best-snow-conditions-in-a-generation.html">"The 
                Alps have best snow conditions in a generation"</a> , reported that 
                this winter's Alpine snowfalls "look set to beat all records by New 
                Year's Day".</p>
              <p>Easily one of the most important stories of 2008 has been all the evidence 
                suggesting that this may be looked back on as the year when there was a 
                turning point in the great worldwide panic over man-made global warming. 
                Just when politicians in Europe and America have been adopting the most 
                costly and damaging measures politicians have ever proposed, to combat this 
                supposed menace, the tide has turned in three significant respects.</p>
              <p>First, all over the world, temperatures have been dropping in a way wholly 
                unpredicted by all those computer models which have been used as the main 
                drivers of the scare. Last winter, as temperatures plummeted, many parts of 
                the world had snowfalls on a scale not seen for decades. This winter, with 
                the whole of Canada and half the US under snow, looks likely to be even 
                worse. After several years flatlining, global temperatures have dropped 
                sharply enough to cancel out much of their net rise in the 20th century.</p>
              <p>Ever shriller and more frantic has become the insistence of the warmists, 
                cheered on by their army of media groupies such as the BBC, that the last 10 
                years have been the "hottest in history" and that the North Pole 
                would soon be ice-free – as the poles remain defiantly icebound and those 
                polar bears fail to drown. All those hysterical predictions that we are 
                seeing more droughts and hurricanes than ever before have infuriatingly 
                failed to materialise.</p>
              <p>Even the more cautious scientific acolytes of the official orthodoxy now admit 
                that, thanks to "natural factors" such as ocean currents, 
                temperatures have failed to rise as predicted (although they plaintively 
                assure us that this cooling effect is merely "masking the underlying 
                warming trend", and that the temperature rise will resume worse than 
                ever by the middle of the next decade).</p>
              <p>Secondly, 2008 was the year when any pretence that there was a "scientific 
                consensus" in favour of man-made global warming collapsed. At long 
                last, as in the Manhattan Declaration last March, hundreds of proper 
                scientists, including many of the world's most eminent climate experts, have 
                been rallying to pour scorn on that "consensus" which was only a 
                politically engineered artefact, based on ever more blatantly manipulated 
                data and computer models programmed to produce no more than convenient 
                fictions.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, as banks collapsed and the global economy plunged into its worst 
                recession for decades, harsh reality at last began to break in on those 
                self-deluding dreams which have for so long possessed almost every 
                politician in the western world. As we saw in this month's Poznan 
                conference, when 10,000 politicians, officials and "environmentalists" 
                gathered to plan next year's "son of Kyoto" treaty in Copenhagen, 
                panicking politicians are waking up to the fact that the world can no longer 
                afford all those quixotic schemes for "combating climate change" 
                with which they were so happy to indulge themselves in more comfortable 
                times.</p>
              <p>Suddenly it has become rather less appealing that we should divert trillions 
                of dollars, pounds and euros into the fantasy that we could reduce emissions 
                of carbon dioxide by 80 per cent. All those grandiose projects for "emissions 
                trading", "carbon capture", building tens of thousands more 
                useless wind turbines, switching vast areas of farmland from producing food 
                to "biofuels", are being exposed as no more than enormously 
                damaging and futile gestures, costing astronomic sums we no longer possess.</p>
              <p>As 2009 dawns, it is time we in Britain faced up to the genuine crisis now 
                fast approaching from the fact that – unless we get on very soon with 
                building enough proper power stations to fill our looming "energy gap" 
                - within a few years our lights will go out and what remains of our economy 
                will judder to a halt. After years of infantile displacement activity, it is 
                high time our politicians – along with those of the EU and President Obama's 
                US – were brought back with a mighty jolt into contact with the real world.</p>
              <p>I must end this year by again paying tribute to my readers for the wonderful 
                generosity with which they came to the aid of two causes. First their 
                donations made it possible for the latest "metric martyr", the 
                east London market trader Janet Devers, to fight Hackney council's 
                vindictive decision to prosecute her on 13 criminal charges, ranging from 
                selling in pounds and ounces to selling produce "by the bowl" (to 
                avoid using weights her customers dislike and don't understand). The 
                embarrassment caused by this historic battle has thrown the forced 
                metrication policy of both our governments, in London and Brussels, into 
                total disarray.</p>
              <p>Since Hackney backed out of allowing four criminal charges against Janet to go 
                before a jury next month, all that remains is for her to win her appeal in 
                February against eight convictions which now look quite absurd (including 
                those for selling veg by the bowl, as thousands of other London market 
                traders do every day). The final goal, as Neil Herron of the Metric Martyrs 
                Defence Fund insists, must then be a pardon for the late Steve Thoburn and 
                the four other original "martyrs" who were found guilty in 2002 – 
                after a legal battle also made possible by this column's readers – of 
                breaking laws so ridiculous that the EU Commission has even denied they 
                existed (but which are still on the statute book).</p>
              <p>Readers were equally generous this year in rushing to the aid of Sue Smith, 
                whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in 2005. Their 
                contributions made it possible for her to carry on with the High Court 
                action she has brought against the Ministry of Defence, with the sole aim of 
                calling it to account for needlessly risking soldiers' lives by sending them 
                into battle in hopelessly inappropriate vehicles. Thanks not least to Mrs 
                Smith's determined fight, the Snatch Land Rover scandal, first reported here 
                in 2006, has at last become a national cause celebre.</p>
              <p>May I finally thank all those readers who have written to me in 2008 – so many 
                that, as usual, it has not been possible to answer all their messages. But 
                their support and information has been hugely appreciated. May I wish them 
                and all of you a happy (if globally not too warm) New Year.</p>

              <p>Regarding the global warming, I feel it is still early to tell. Unfortunately, by the time it becomes clear it would be way too late.</p>

              <p>As I said many times, I dont disagree with the message, but the methods that the rulers of the world is using to 'save' the environment because it really benefits them than actually save the planet. Even if warming is man-made, and its not, in fact, the warming has stopped, its being exploited not to protect the environment, but to protect profit margin and monopoly power.</p>
              <p>If we really wanted to stop pollution,cut down on GHG- notably CO2, which doesnt cause pollution, and 'save' the world, then we should have used all the trillions wasted on weapons development, bio- "crime against humanity"- fuels and bailout gifts (including carbon taxes) to corporate criminals, to fund production and distribution of solar panels, wind farms, geothermal plants, wave and tidal generators. Screw nuclear and not-so-clean clean coal. Not to forget, improving the distribution of our more-than-enough global supply of food from monopolising corporate fucks so that the Third World isn't starving anymore.</p>
              <p>At the same time, to prevent corporate hijacking of the 'save' the world effort, governments got to have the balls to stand up to their corporate sponsors. Yet, its obvious it will not happen <em>within</em> this system. The status quo feeds on itself, preventing real change.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/04/financial-times-uncovers-widespread.html">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/04/financial-times-uncovers-widespread.html</a></p>
              <p>The Financial Times, in a <a href="http://www.ft.com/indepth/carbontrading">series of articles published today</a>,
              probes the workings of the carbon trading business, and uncovers
              widespread fraud: buyers paying for reductions that don't occur,
              organizations extracting large carbon reduction payments for programs
              they were going to implement regardless, clueless or complicit brokers,
              offset programs that are shams.<br><br>We have been skeptical about carbon trading because it was an <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/02/study-recommends-carbon-tax-over-cap.html">inferior (although politically more palatable) policy choice</a>. Even Harvard professor Greg Mankiw (no liberal; he is Mitt Romney's economics advisor) <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/03/greg-mankiw-on-pigovian-taxes-vs-cap.html">favors a carbon tax</a>. And we were also <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/03/gore-carbon-offsets-and-misguided.html">concerned</a> about the higher administrative costs, and potential for cheating and
              market manipulation, which would not only increase costs but would
              reduce investment and distort incentives by creating an unstable price
              for carbon (a Financial Times editorial cited the importance of having
              a stable price for carbon, which <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/02/ft-we-need-clear-and-predictable-price.html">runs counter to the notion</a> of an actively traded market).<br><br>But
              what the FT has found is even worse than what we had imagined, worse in
              the sense that the abuses are so widespread. We hope you will read the <a href="http://www.ft.com/indepth/carbontrading">stories in their entirety</a>;
              this is Pulitzer Prize level work (and far more important than the
              options backdating story that won this year). It will be interesting to
              see how much, if any, of the FT's reporting is picked up in the US.<br><br>Below is the overview article, "Industry caught in carbon ‘smokescreen':"<br>Companies
              and individuals rushing to go green have been spending millions on
              “carbon credit” projects that yield few if any environmental benefits.<br><br>A
              Financial Times investigation has uncovered widespread failings in the
              new markets for greenhouse gases, suggesting some organisations are
              paying for emissions reductions that do not take place.<br><br>Others
              are meanwhile making big profits from carbon trading for very small
              expenditure and in some cases for clean-ups that they would have made
              anyway.<br><br>The growing political salience of environmental politics
              has sparked a “green gold rush”, which has seen a dramatic expansion in
              the number of businesses offering both companies and individuals the
              chance to go “carbon neutral”, offsetting their own energy use by
              buying carbon credits that cancel out their contribution to global
              warming.<br><br>The burgeoning regulated market for carbon credits is
              expected to more than double in size to about $68.2bn by 2010, with the
              unregulated voluntary sector rising to $4bn in the same period.<br><br>The FT investigation found: <br><br>â– 
              Widespread instances of people and organisations buying worthless
              credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions.<br><br>â– 
              Industrial companies profiting from doing very little – or from gaining
              carbon credits on the basis of efficiency gains from which they have
              already benefited substantially.<br><br>â–  Brokers providing services of questionable or no value.<br><br>â–  A shortage of verification, making it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits.<br><br>â– 
              Companies and individuals being charged over the odds for the private
              purchase of European Union carbon permits that have plummeted in value
              because they do not result in emissions cuts.<br><br>Francis Sullivan,
              environment adviser at HSBC, the UK’s biggest bank that went
              carbon-neutral in 2005, said he found “serious credibility concerns” in
              the offsetting market after evaluating it for several months.<br><br>“The
              police, the fraud squad and trading standards need to be looking into
              this. Otherwise people will lose faith in it,” he said.<br><br>These concerns led the bank to ignore the market and fund its own carbon reduction projects directly.<br><br>Some
              companies are benefiting by asking “green” consumers to pay them for
              cleaning up their own pollution. For instance, DuPont, the chemicals
              company, invites consumers to pay $4 to eliminate a tonne of carbon
              dioxide from its plant in Kentucky that produces a potent greenhouse
              gas called HFC-23. But the equipment required to reduce such gases is
              relatively cheap. DuPont refused to comment and declined to specify its
              earnings from the project, saying it was at too early a stage to
              discuss.<br><br>The FT has also found examples of companies setting up
              as carbon offsetters without appearing to have a clear idea of how the
              markets operate. In response to FT inquiries about its sourcing of
              carbon credits, one company, carbonvoucher.com, said it had not taken
              payments for offsets.<br><br>Blue Source, a US offsetting company,
              invites consumers to offset carbon emissions by investing in enhanced
              oil recovery, which pumps carbon dioxide into depleted oil wells to
              bring up the remaining oil. However, Blue Source said that because of
              the high price of oil, this process was often profitable in itself,
              meaning operators were making extra revenues from selling “carbon
              credits” for burying the carbon.<br><br>There is nothing illegal in
              these practices. However, some companies that are offsetting their
              emissions have avoided such projects because customers may find them
              controversial.<br><br>BP said it would not buy credits resulting from
              improvements in industrial efficiency or from most renewable energy
              projects in developed countries.</p>

              <p>Very interesting....thanks.</p>
              <p>Hmmm.....arguably carbon trading seems to be a burden in this light. Because of the extra admin, and glaring instances of market failure.</p>
              <p>Is it a noble plan poorly executed? A good institutional framework should not have led to many of these problems.</p>
              <p>Carbon trading is another instance of "market fundumentalism"? Where there is a belief that the market works best?</p>
