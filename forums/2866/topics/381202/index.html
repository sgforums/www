              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">With phony radicals like Michael Moore around, the ruling elite has nothing to worry about. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">The filmmaker likes to pose as a
              radical critic of the status quo, but he isn’t. All the evidence you
              need is in his latest documentary, <cite>Capitalism: A Love Story.</cite> Sure, he rails against home foreclosures, bank bailouts, low wages,
              other real and imagined problems, but his solution would not disturb
              the sleep of any big banker, corporate bigwig, or political big shot. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">The tipoff comes right at the
              beginning of the movie. He paints an idyllic picture of life in America
              in the 1950s. His father worked for a big auto company, through which
              the family got free medical and dental care. All was well. He realizes
              that a major reason things were so good was that the U.S. military had
              destroyed Japan’s and Germany’s competitive industrial bases in World
              War II. But the dominance was great while it lasted. It was a time when
              an alliance of big government, big business, and big labor ruled the
              roost. The military-industrial complex was thriving. That seems fine
              with Moore, which puts him in the camp of the corporatists of Franklin
              Roosevelt’s Brain Trust, who thought free markets and competition among
              independent firms were passé. The new world required big monolithic
              entities that sat down together and worked things out nicely. The
              spirit of Mussolini hovered over all of it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">Of course, Moore blasts Wall Street
              because it got all that taxpayer bailout money and is not being held
              accountable for it. That is worth getting mad about. But how would he
              feel if the money had been given <em>with</em> lots of conditions and regulations? He might have liked that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">He certainly doesn’t mind that the
              government had the taxpayers’ money to give away in the first place. He
              never once suggests that the people should keep their own money because
              the political elite has no right to it. He also never indicts the
              Federal Reserve for its legal counterfeiting. That would be the true
              radical position. Moore sides with the politicians. He even complains
              that the top income-tax rate was lowered from 90 percent some years
              ago! Conveniently, he gets the history wrong. He says Republican Ronald
              Reagan cut the 90 percent rate, but it was really Democrat Lyndon
              Johnson who did it, following through on John Kennedy’s proposal.
              (Reagan presided over a cut from 70 to 50 and then to 28 percent.) At
              any rate, he is perfectly comfortable with government’s taking 90
              percent of people’s earnings. He seems indifferent about whether the
              money is made through honest trade or political privilege. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">Favoring a high top rate may not win
              him favors from some in the establishment, but for generations there
              has been a wing of that establishment that understood that high
              marginal rates were the price of the lucrative corporate state. So
              Moore may not be the pariah among the ruling elite that he makes
              himself out to be. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">Moore’s movie contains much else to
              make us doubt his radical bona fides. He blusters about Robert Rubin,
              Timothy Geithner, Lawrence Summers, and their relationship to the
              current financial problems. Rubin, a Wall Street hotshot, and Summers
              were Treasury secretaries under President Bill Clinton. Geithner ran
              the New York Federal Reserve Bank from late 2003 to 2009, overseeing
              the Wall Street bailouts. In Moore’s eyes, they are the rogues who,
              along with former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury
              Secretary Henry Paulson, gave us the meltdown of 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">So far so good. But when he gets to
              the election of Barack Obama in November 2008 he declares, “This is not
              what Wall Street wanted.” Yeah? Then why are Moore’s bêtes noires Rubin
              and Summers close Obama economic advisors, and why is Geithner
              secretary of the Treasury? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">A true radical would not have given
              Obama a pass. Moore says he’s for socialism, but all he means by that
              is that workers have some say in their companies. Nothing very radical
              about that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times,Times New Roman;">If Moore were truly a radical critic
              of capitalism as he conceives it, he’d be for its true opposite: the
              radical separation of business and State — that is, the free market. </span></p>

              <p>Yes, I agree that his documentaries raise valid questions, but he doesn't go all the way. Perhaps thats why his documentaries are able to receive mainstream attention.</p>
              <p>As the above article points out, Moore doesnt question the fundamental existence of this system, he merely criticises how its operated when the entire system is corrupt and rigged from the beginning to benefit a few.</p>

              <p>Yeah well, my point in posting the above article is that he isnt exposing the root problem for what it is. <em>If</em> he is aware of that, then he is just false opposition.</p>
              <p>But his work is commendable for raising such issues in the mainstream media.</p>
              <p>If you really want a documentary that points out genuine problems and solutions, go watch Zeitgeist Addendum. Of course such documentaries never receive mainstream attention.</p>

              <p>From <a href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=66#5">TZM FAQ</a>:</p>
              <h1>How does The Venus Project compare with Communism?</h1>
              <p>Communism used money and labor, had social stratification, and
                  elected officials to maintain the communists' traditions. Most
                  importantly, Communism did not eliminate SCARCITY nor did they have a
                  blueprint or the methods for the production of abundance. Machine
                  production rather than labor will dominate the future. Perhaps through
                  no fault of their own, they also had to maintain huge military
                  expenditures to protect themselves from invasion of fascistic and
                  capitalistic institutions.</p>
              <p><strong>Communism being similar to a resource-based economy or The Venus
                  Project is an erroneous concept. Communism has money, banks, armies,
                  police, prisons, charismatic personalities, social stratification, and
                  is managed by appointed leaders.</strong> The Venus Project's aim is to surpass
                  the need for the use of money. Police, prisons and the military would
                  no longer be necessary when goods, services, healthcare, and education
                  are available to all people. The Venus Project would replace
                  politicians with a cybernated society in which all of the physical
                  entities are managed and operated by computerized systems. The only
                  region that the computers do not operate or manage is the surveillance
                  of human beings. This would be completely unnecessary and considered
                  socially offensive. A society that uses technology without human
                  concern has no basis of survival. Communism has no blueprint or
                  methodology to carry out their ideals and along with capitalism,
                  fascism, and socialism, will ultimately go down in history as failed
                  social experiments.</p>
              <p>Communism is a political system managed by a form of ideology, which
                  does not necessarily relate to human or environmental needs. Communism
                  uses money, banks, armies, police, prisons, charismatic personalities,
                  social stratification, and is managed by appointed leaders and uses
                  indoctrination. The Venus Project's aim is to surpass the need for the
                  use of money. Police, prisons, banking, advertising, stockbrokers,
                  military, and government would no longer be necessary when goods,
                  services, healthcare, and education are available to all people. The
                  Venus Project would replace politicians with a cybernated society in
                  which all of the physical entities would as quickly as possible be
                  managed and operated by computerized systems. The only region that the
                  computers do not operate or manage is the surveillance of human beings.
                  This would be completely unnecessary and considered socially offensive.
                  A society that uses technology without human concern has no basis of
                  survival. Communism has no blueprint or methodology to carry out their
                  ideals and along with capitalism, fascism, and socialism will
                  ultimately go down in history as failed social experiments. One of
                  Communism's concerns is the condition of labor and the working class.
                  The Venus Project's major concerns are producing products with limited
                  labor and eventually eliminating labor and at the same time giving
                  people all the amenities of a prosperous, high energy society. It is
                  not our aim to produce a society that does nothing but enjoy leisure
                  time. Instead people will be introduced to limitless opportunities to
                  explore, create, participate, and learn.</p>
              <p>The Venus Project offers science and technology in the service of
                  humankind on a global scale and eventually helps to eliminate all the
                  artificial boundaries that separate people. The system uses no money
                  and makes goods and services available without a price tag, debt,
                  barter, or servitude of any kind. If we use our technology
                  intelligently, we can create an abundance of goods and services for the
                  entire planet. We use machines and automation to produce and distribute
                  all manufactured products, which will be available at distribution
                  centers to everyone. The purpose of this high technology is to free
                  people so they can pursue their own interests and fulfillments.</p>
              <p>We would surpass the need for human participation in the production
                  of goods and services. There is no taxation or obligation of any kind.
                  We advocate no government by human systems. They have always proved
                  inadequate. Computerized systems and cybernetics would be applied to
                  the social system and must comply with the carrying capacity of our
                  global resources. The machines' main purpose is for the manufacturing
                  and distribution of goods and services while maintaining a clean
                  environment with service to all and profits to none. When people have
                  access to resources, most crimes will disappear. The need for police,
                  military, and prisons will eventually vanish with it. Of course this
                  will coincide with the necessary changes in education. I hope this
                  helps to clarify some points. We realize this is a simplified
                  description of how it differs from communism.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In socialism, everybody would have <strong>free
                    access</strong> to the goods and services designed to
                    directly meet their needs and there need be no system of
                    payment for the work that each individual contributes to
                    producing them. All work would be on a voluntary basis.
                    Producing for needs means that people would engage in work
                    that has a direct usefulness. The satisfaction that this
                    would provide, along with the increased opportunity to shape
                    working patterns and conditions, would bring about new
                    attitudes to work.</p>

              <p>From <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=28&amp;amp;Itemid=66#5">TZM FAQ</a>:</p>
              <h1>How does The Venus Project compare with Communism?</h1>
              <p>Communism used money and labor, had social stratification, and elected officials to maintain the communists' traditions. Most importantly, Communism did not eliminate SCARCITY nor did they have a blueprint or the methods for the production of abundance. Machine production rather than labor will dominate the future. Perhaps through no fault of their own, they also had to maintain huge military expenditures to protect themselves from invasion of fascistic and capitalistic institutions.</p>
              <p><strong>Communism being similar to a resource-based economy or The Venus Project is an erroneous concept. Communism has money, banks, armies, police, prisons, charismatic personalities, social stratification, and is managed by appointed leaders.</strong> The Venus Project's aim is to surpass the need for the use of money. Police, prisons and the military would no longer be necessary when goods, services, healthcare, and education are available to all people. The Venus Project would replace politicians with a cybernated society in which all of the physical entities are managed and operated by computerized systems. The only region that the computers do not operate or manage is the surveillance of human beings. This would be completely unnecessary and considered socially offensive. A society that uses technology without human concern has no basis of survival. Communism has no blueprint or methodology to carry out their ideals and along with capitalism, fascism, and socialism, will ultimately go down in history as failed social experiments.</p>
              <p>Communism is a political system managed by a form of ideology, which does not necessarily relate to human or environmental needs. Communism uses money, banks, armies, police, prisons, charismatic personalities, social stratification, and is managed by appointed leaders and uses indoctrination. The Venus Project's aim is to surpass the need for the use of money. Police, prisons, banking, advertising, stockbrokers, military, and government would no longer be necessary when goods, services, healthcare, and education are available to all people. The Venus Project would replace politicians with a cybernated society in which all of the physical entities would as quickly as possible be managed and operated by computerized systems. The only region that the computers do not operate or manage is the surveillance of human beings. This would be completely unnecessary and considered socially offensive. A society that uses technology without human concern has no basis of survival. Communism has no blueprint or methodology to carry out their ideals and along with capitalism, fascism, and socialism will ultimately go down in history as failed social experiments. One of Communism's concerns is the condition of labor and the working class. The Venus Project's major concerns are producing products with limited labor and eventually eliminating labor and at the same time giving people all the amenities of a prosperous, high energy society. It is not our aim to produce a society that does nothing but enjoy leisure time. Instead people will be introduced to limitless opportunities to explore, create, participate, and learn.</p>
              <p>The Venus Project offers science and technology in the service of humankind on a global scale and eventually helps to eliminate all the artificial boundaries that separate people. The system uses no money and makes goods and services available without a price tag, debt, barter, or servitude of any kind. If we use our technology intelligently, we can create an abundance of goods and services for the entire planet. We use machines and automation to produce and distribute all manufactured products, which will be available at distribution centers to everyone. The purpose of this high technology is to free people so they can pursue their own interests and fulfillments.</p>
              <p>We would surpass the need for human participation in the production of goods and services. There is no taxation or obligation of any kind. We advocate no government by human systems. They have always proved inadequate. Computerized systems and cybernetics would be applied to the social system and must comply with the carrying capacity of our global resources. The machines' main purpose is for the manufacturing and distribution of goods and services while maintaining a clean environment with service to all and profits to none. When people have access to resources, most crimes will disappear. The need for police, military, and prisons will eventually vanish with it. Of course this will coincide with the necessary changes in education. I hope this helps to clarify some points. We realize this is a simplified description of how it differs from communism.</p>

              <p><br>And how do you intend to implement that without a totalitarian government like the Communists did ? <strong></strong></p>
              <p>By voting on it ?</p>
              <p>You would think with their aging population and advanced robotics the Japanese would have implemented the idea a long time ago.</p>
