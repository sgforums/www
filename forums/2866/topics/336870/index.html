              <p><strong>By Dawn Tay</strong></p>
              <p>CONSUMERS are generally upbeat about the decision by the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority (AVA) to allow some imported China-made milk products back on the shelves.</p>
              <p>After a blanket ban of almost two months, 21 types of butter, ghee and non-dairy creamer made in China will be released with immediate effect, the AVA announced yesterday.</p>
              <p>
              
              Singaporeans my paper spoke to welcomed the news.</p>
              <p>Mrs Elizabeth Ang looks forward to buying her baby daughter's favourite biscuits, which were taken off the shelves. Said the 29-year-old dentist: "But I'll steer clear of China-made baby cereals. And I'll never drink Yili milk again."</p>
              <p>These products have been categorised by the AVA as being at "low risk" of melamine contamination.</p>
              <p>The category also includes China-made products that use milk from other countries as an ingredient.</p>
              <p>For example, butter is classified as a low-risk product because it is fat-based, and melamine is relatively insoluble in fat, said AVA chief executive Chua Sin Bin.</p>
              <p>Expect the following products to be available for sale in three weeks: "Medium-risk" products such as bread, biscuits, crackers, candies, chocolate and cake; and "higher-risk" products like liquid milk, ice cream, milk protein and whey protein.</p>
              <p>The AVA is considering lifting the import ban on China milk products when China provides a full account of its investigations and improvements made to its food-safety system.</p>
              <p>But Dr Chua clarified that should the ban be lifted, fresh batches of products would be brought in, and not old and possibly contaminated stock.</p>
              <p>He did not put a date on when the ban would be lifted.</p>
              <p>The AVA has spent an estimated $1.6 million testing for melamine-tainted products.</p>
              <p>While Hong Kong and Bangladesh were still clearing tainted China-made products off the shelves as late as last month, Dr Chua warned against taking an over-conservative stance.</p>
              <p>He said: "We're not trying to be gungho (in releasing products for sale). After our first round of tests...we've found that the picture is largely confined to China-made products.</p>
              <p>But he added that the AVA is not ruling out finding more melamine-tainted products.</p>
              <p><strong>MEASURES TAKEN</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>CHINA-MADE milk products imported before the Sept 19 ban will be gradually released by the AVA under a managed-risk approach. "Low-risk" products will be released first, followed by "medium-risk" products and "higher-risk" products. </li>
              <li>NUMBER of milk products from China and other countries tested since September: Over 3,500.<br>Other non-milk products tested include preserved eggs and high-protein products such as canned luncheon meat. </li>
              <li>NUMBER of melamine-tested products found here: 33.<br>They include 16 China milk products, including yogurt bars, milk candy, flavoured milk and crackers, and 17 biscuit products from Malaysia.<br>The contamination in the Malaysian biscuits is thought to have stemmed from tainted ammonium bicarbonate, and not milk. The AVA will send a team to China within a month to inspect dairies and factories and ensure that regulatory measures have been put in place. </li>
              <li>LAST month, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan gave the thumbs-up to a new forensic unit to test for potential non-conventional food contaminants. </li>
              </ul>
