              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333399;">Millions of women around the world are feted on International Women's Day but for Waris Dirie, the Somali nomad turned supermodel, the idea is absurd.<br><br>"Every day, women move mountains. It is an insult to have an international women's day," Dirie told Reuters before the premiere of a film based on her life story, coming out in France on Wednesday Mar 10.<br><br>The film, Desert Flower, tells the story of how Dirie used her fame as a model to get the world to care about and fight against female circumcision.<br><br>Dirie underwent genital mutilation at the age of three together with her two sisters, who did not survive.<br><br>Dirie, a special ambassador to the United Nation for the elimination of female genital mutilation, said governments in Africa cared little about the issue.<br><br>"Governments do not care about that type of thing," she said. "They do absolutely nothing to help."<br><br>That is why, she said, help needed to come from non-governmental organisations (NGOs).<br><br>On its website, the Waris Dirie Foundation, estimates that at least 150 million women and girls are affected by the cruel practice which continues to be performed in Africa and elsewhere around the world.<br><br>Thousands of mothers continue to give up their little girls for mutilation even if they live in Europe or America as it represents a way for them to cling to their traditional beliefs.<br><br>The film says 6,000 women every day lose their genitals and are sewn up. The practice is based on a belief that woman who are not circumcised are impure.<br><br>Women remain sown up until their marriage. They suffer lasting infections and psychological disorders.<br><br>The film is based on Dirie's books.<br><br>Dirie was born in the Somali desert and fled her family after she was given in marriage to an old man.<br><br>She became a supermodel after a photographer noticed her while she was cleaning in a fast-food restaurant in London.<br><br>The Foundation in Support of the Dignity and Rights of Women, part of the French retail and luxury group PPR, supported the screening of the film and organized fund-raising to support NGOs that fight female genital mutilation.<br><br>Members of the Foundation include actress Salma Hayek, wife of PPR Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault, and designers Stella McCartney and Frida Giannini.<br><br>Funds from the film screening went to French NGO Equilibres et Populations which works against female circumcision in Mali.</span></p>

              <p>Three decades later, after a career as a supermodel and human rights 
                  activist, Waris Dirie is planning to go home to Africa.</p>
              <p>“I dream of having my own farm and lodge in Tanzania, near Mount 
                  Kilimanjaro,” she said in an interview with The Sunday Times last week. “I am 
                  convinced that my beautiful continent has more potential than most people 
                  imagine.”</p>
              <p>Born to a family of nomadic goat herders, Dirie, 44, has led an extraordinary 
                  life: she was “discovered” in London by a fashion photographer who gave her his 
                  card in a burger bar where she was sweeping up.</p>
              <p>The “nomad to supermodel” story is the subject of Desert Flower, a film that 
                  opened last week in Paris.</p>
              <p>It has shocked audiences with its portrayal of the pivotal moment in Dirie’s 
                  life when, as a three-year-old, she was subjected to ritual genital mutilation 
                  by a woman wielding a worn razor.</p>
              <p>Liya Kebede, an Ethiopian model, plays Dirie in the film. Dirie cried at the 
                  first viewing. The film is based on her autobiography of the same name and also 
                  stars Sally Hawkins, Timothy Spall and Juliet Stevenson, the British actors.</p>
              <p>“It was very disturbing and emotional, especially scenes from my childhood,” 
                  Dirie said. “It is a barbaric crime,” she added, talking about female 
                  circumcision. “It’s incredible it is still happening now in the 21st 
                  century.”</p>
              <p>Since abandoning the catwalk, Dirie, who lives in Austria, has campaigned for 
                  an end to the practice. She hopes the film will promote indignation at “an 
                  especially cruel form of suppressing women” that claimed the life of one of her 
                  sisters, who bled to death after being circumcised.</p>
              <p>“I have reached a lot of people,” she said, referring to her role as a United 
                  Nations special ambassador and recipient of numerous humanitarian awards, as 
                  well as France’s Légion d’Honneur. “But those who could really change something, 
                  the politicians, do not seem willing to act. Not in Europe and even less in 
                  Africa, Asia and in the Middle East.”</p>
              <p>She hopes the film will be shown everywhere in Africa but says “eradicating 
                  female genital mutilation can only happen there if the living conditions of the 
                  people and the social and legal status of women improve”.</p>
              <p>The film’s director was determined to make the childhood scenes as authentic 
                  as possible and these were shot in Djibouti, which shares a border with Somalia. 
                  Local families were used as extras and a circumciser was found who was filmed 
                  with her razor.</p>
              <p>After the “operation”, Dirie was sewn up with a thorn and thread to ensure 
                  she would stay a virgin until her husband “opened” her with a knife on her 
                  wedding night. When she reached 13 she decided to flee rather than submit to the 
                  old man who had paid five camels.</p>
              <p>She walked to Mogadishu, the capital, where her grandmother put her on a 
                  plane to London. The Somali ambassador’s wife was an aunt who took her in as a 
                  cleaner. When the ambassador left, she got a job in a burger bar. Terence 
                  Donovan, the photographer, spotted her. “We’re always looking for new faces,” he 
                  says in the film, handing her his card.</p>
              <p>A modelling agent was appalled by the scars on her feet but this did not stop 
                  her being on the cover of the Pirelli calendar in 1987, helping her to become 
                  one of the most famous black models of the 1990s.</p>
              <p><strong>Aid ‘fraud’</strong></p>
              <p>A United Nations agency blacklisted a British whistleblower after he exposed 
                  alleged corruption in its Somalian aid programme, according to a UN ethics 
                  committee report, writes Sara Hashash.</p>
              <p>Ismail Ahmed, who worked for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
                  in 2005-7, said it had hounded him after he uncovered fraud in a programme 
                  backed by British aid money to combat terrorism and money-laundering. He was 
                  later told his contract would not be renewed.</p>
              <p>The UNDP investigated but concluded that no current staff member was involved 
                  in any corrupt activities.</p>
              <p>The UN ethics report confirmed that an official had warned a potential 
                  employer not to hire Ahmed because of his “silly” accusations. Ahmed has 
                  received compensation.</p>
