              <p>Mom kept girl on leash</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LONDON - SCHOOLGIRL Shannon Matthews was drugged and probably kept captive on a leash in a 'wicked' plot hatched by her mother and another man to claim a newspaper reward for her recovery, a court was told on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Prosecutor Julian Goose said a looped strap tied to a roof beam at the West Yorkshire flat where she had been held for over three weeks was probably used to restrain the nine-year-old.</p>
              <p>Mr Goose said her mother Karen called police on Feb 19 to say her daughter had not returned to her Dewsbury home from a school swimming trip, sparking a massive police hunt.</p>
              <p>'The 999 call was part of a dishonest and we say wicked plan by Michael Donovan and Karen Matthews', the Press Association reporting him as telling Leeds Crown Court.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Shannon was an innocent victim of the plan. She was kidnapped and falsely imprisoned in the flat where Donovan lived'.</p>
              <p>'She was drugged to subdue her during the period of her captivity'.</p>
              <p>Karen Matthews and Donovan, the uncle of her then boyfriend Craig Meehan, deny charges of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.</p>
              <p>Mr Goose said Donovan had told police the plan was to release Shannon in Dewsbury Market and for Donovan to discover her.</p>
              <p>He would then have claimed a newspaper reward, which had risen to 50,000 pounds (S$113,127) by the time police found Shannon in Donovan's flat, around a mile from her home, 24 days after she disappeared.</p>
              <p>'The prosecution's case is that this plan was as dishonest as it was wicked', Mr Goose said.</p>
              <p>'Karen Matthews was using one of her own children in her plan with Donovan to kidnap and falsely imprison her'.</p>
              <p>'Both defendants stood by and watched the very large police investigation and assistance by many members of the public in the search for Shannon'.</p>
              <p>Shannon's disappearance sparked one of Britain's largest ever missing person hunts, which involved more than 300 police officers and cost almost 3.2 million pounds.</p>
              <p>'Throughout this extensive search, Karen Matthews maintained her lie and Michael Donovan watched as the reward money increased', said Mr Goose.</p>
              <p>Matthews was a 'consummate and convincing liar', taking part in impassioned televised appeals for her daughter's return.</p>
              <p>'Both defendants stood by and watched the very large police investigation and assistance by many members of the public in the search for Shannon', Mr Goose added.</p>
              <p>The public followed the day-by-day events until Shannon was eventually found, 'only then to discover that it had all been a lie, a trick and deliberately false complaint'.</p>
              <p>Donovan had been waiting in his car on Shannon's route home from school and persuaded her to get in by telling her she was going to a fair.</p>
              <p>He kept Shannon in his flat and wrote a set of rules telling her to keep quiet and stay away from the windows to prevent her discovery.</p>
              <p>But he also subdued the girl by giving her Temazepam sleeping pills and Traveleeze travel sickness tablets, Mr Goose said.</p>
              <p>Traces of both drugs were found in her blood after she was rescued.</p>
              <p>The case continues. -- REUTERS</p>
