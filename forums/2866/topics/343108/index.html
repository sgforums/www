              <br><strong>
              <div>ISRAEL - MY EXPERIENCES THERE, IN THE SUMMER OF 1989</div>
              <br>My name is Joe Cortina. I am a retired Florida businessman who has done substantial world traveling - some purely as a 'tourist' and some in areas - shall I say- 'nothing to do with vacationing'. I am a former special operations officer and have done intelligence investigator work for over 15years - some of it overseas - mostly in Central America - but also in the Mid-East. My political posture is `conservative' and my religious values are Christian. <br><br>Exposing lies and revealing the truth was what I did professionally for a long time. <br><br>I have hunted REAL terrorists in jungles with Salvadorian Rangers and Marines - so I am not a stranger to dangerous environments and am familiar with basic protocols of civilized conduct regarding civilians and the military - something that the Israelis do not consider applicable to them. <br><br>For anyone wishing to challenge my credibility - I am willing to show credentials. I have a flawless civic record, an honorable military record and have never committed a crime nor ever been accused of such. I am mentioned as my father's son in the registry - 'PIONEER FLORIDA'. My grandfather was a pioneer in Florida in the most literal sense, and my father was a respected businessman and foreign diplomat. <br><br>I was invited to Israel by a former military comrade who attained a substantial rank and subsequently ended up as the ranking military attache' from our govt., to the Israeli military (IDF). I went places and saw things only a hand full of 'private sector' Americans will EVER experience. My 'specially authorized' trips included Gaza City, Hebron and areas of militarily protected Israeli 'settlements'. I will touch on only a few of what I considered the most revealing experiences. I can't stress this enough. What I write here is but a tear in a sea of misery that I witnessed. <br><br>Treason to the United States: <br><br>While there I witnessed MANY signs and graffiti showing enthusiastic and shameless support by Israelis for the convicted American traitor Jonathon Pollard - a Jewish - Zionist Soviet spy. Intelligence experts in America have termed Pollards treasonous acts second only to the Rosenbergs in the level of betrayal and endangerment to every American man woman and child. According to officials in Tel Aviv, Pollard was AND STILL IS considered a hero - literally - to the Israelis. So much for any notion of the Israeli 'love and concern' for American families. <br><br>Israeli destruction of civilian homes and businesses: <br><br>The road blocks as one neared Gaza strip became increasingly secure and formidable. The absence of any civilian traffic was conspicuous. Once in either a suburb of Gaza or another city in the 'Strip' - I don't remember the exact name - a ride down the main street looked like a scene from some WWII movie. Windows shattered, charred rubble and destroyed vehicles littered the area. (I saw one still burning). Then I noticed something a little strange. There was no building with any floor above the first. ALL buildings had any additional floors blasted into rubble - much of the jagged former construction black and charred. This was a city street no much different from any American small town. Shops, restaurants, services, apartment etc. blown to bits and vacant as a tomb. <br><br>I learned quickly why the upper parts of the buildings (peoples homes and businesses, incidentally) - were blown away. This was to reduce any cover for potential snipers who might threaten Israeli patrols. Kind of like the mentality and rationale if it had been your hometown - after being occupied by the Soviets or Chinese communists. Just blow it all up! It is of no consequence if these were homes and businesses of the Palestinians -- it was occupied by the Israelis now! <br><br>Mockery of America: <br><br>At one of the many roadblocks - usually manned by a small IDF military unit, we stopped our armored vehicle just long enough for the CIA to 'inspect' the situation. I got outside and overheard 2 of these young soldiers speaking. Much to my surprise, they had Brooklyn accents! I asked them where they were from, and they answered New York. Apparently they had left the States to serve a foreign power -remember - these were American citizens (who just happened to be Jews) <br><br>Puzzled at this bizarre reply, I decided to give benefit of doubt and responded with something like: "Boy, you guys are really something - having served the military of your country (remember - they were AMERICAN citizens) and then investing your time in a 'feeling for duty' to Israel". They answered proudly and without hesitation: "Oh no - we haven't served in the United States military - there's no way". So if there is any doubt where their loyalties lie - consider their unabashed answer of mockery for the notion of serving America. <br><br>I can't think of ANY male American CITIZEN who would sneer at serving the United States but willingly owed their loyalties to -say Italy, or Greece or Ireland, or France or Germany - just because his ancestors were of that ethnic group. AND - if one such person voiced such an opinion - you can imagine what people would think of him. But of course - apparently if you are Jewish - such odious and OPENLY PROUD mockery of love of this country is acceptable conduct. So much for American Jewish loyalty to America. <br><br>Israeli sanctioned creation of 'incidents': <br><br>I witnessed 'settlers' vehicles driving around and around the homeland of the Palestinians (JUST LIKE YOUR HOMETOWN - NEVER FORGET THAT FACT!) whose purpose was only to taunt and humiliate the local inhabitants. One of these cars had a sun roof through which protruded an Israeli flag (just like a Red Chinese flag from a car driving around in your American 'occupied' neighborhood) - AND an M-16 automatic rifle to insure their torment of the helpless Palestinians was 'enforced'. ANY resistance to the dreaded 'settlers', and the UNITED STATES supplied - IDF rolls in and just blows them away. <br><br>After all - remember - the Palestinians are considered no more than animals to the Israelis. Do you see some sort of hypocrisy here? Regarding the horrendous brutality to the Palestinian civilians - more than one conscientious Israeli journalist has concluded that "the Palestinians are now the Jews - and the Israelis are now the NAZIS". This is a COMMON reference in Israel today. Ever see that analogy in an American Newspaper, magazine or TV presentation? Ever wonder why not? <br><br>There are dozens of such stories involving brutality and inhumane treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis - which must be put in historic perspective. This is the ancestoral heritage and home of these Palestinians for over TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS! An entire MILENNIA longer than the United States has been in existance! Just immagine a FOREIGN power GIVING AWAY some 85% of the entire United States to an invading foreign Colonizer! <br><br>This land has been the home for generations and generation of Palestinians, and 'Israelis' are the intruders and occupying force here -- NOT the other way around. Cold-blooded murders, torture, shelling of schools and hospitals, bulldozing of homes with civilians buried alive, destruction of ambulances - and nearly every type of war crimes imaginable including torture of eight out of ten Palestinians brought in for "questioning"! Many of these incidents were shared with me - although several from UNQUESTIONABLY reputable sources, I cannot PERSONALLY attest to them - but what I have told the reader and will tell - are incidents and conduct I witnessed FIRST HAND. <br><br>Brutality against children: <br><br>I will share one more incident - one I will not forget - which classically characterized the Israeli attitude to people which they OPENLY refer to as "animals". While in another area of Gaza, we were following our IDF Para escort. It was an open jeep with heavily armed Paratroops. Suddenly it screeched to a halt not 10 yards in front of us and out jumped the men - one immediately dropped to one knee and took careful aim at his victim to our immediate right. The 'enemy' some 50 feet away - throwing egg size rocks at their tormentors. Hardly sophisticated or dangerous - but there he stood - proud, defiant and fearless - a 10 year old child. This was HIS neighborhood and HIS country and HIS land -and he was a prisoner in this Israeli 'concentration camp' for "animals". Think of it as a 'role change' for David and Goliath. <br><br>Children like this young lad, routinely 'disappear' in occupied territories. They are just never seen or heard of again. I have children - and grandchildren whom I would defend with my life. I would like you to imagine for just a moment that you are not an American - just close your eyes and visualize -- finding your beloved 10 year old child with half his head blown away - the flies feasting on his scattered brains. The unimaginable accident ? - NO - a war crime- and it is YOUR child! The 'sin' of your child? He was throwing egg sized rocks at an Israeli tank - BOUGHT and PAID FOR by AMERICAN citizens. Could you just forget it as if were only the family cat - or would you swear revenge/ justice against the monsters that made it happen? Could you possibly be so arrogant as to believe that this Palestinian mother and father loved their child any less than you would - or that 'his' life is 'worth' less in the eyes of God? <br><br>I had a Canon 35mm camera (official CIA issue at the time) and immediately jumped out of our vehicle and zeroed in on the would-be murderer - not 10 paces in front of me. Apparently he saw what I was doing and muttered something I couldn't hear - as he withdrew back to his jeep. I never saw the child again and was grateful that I had been able to save his life by my 'intimidation' with a camera. God only knows how many children that same jeep full of soldiers had murdered before or after I was there. It is a common practice by the Israeli govt. military to murder children for even the slightest provocation. It is doubtful that the young child in this incident ever saw another birthday. Just another nameless dead "goy" - animal - to the Israelis. <br><br>These are the events that occur daily in the 'concentration camps' of the Israelis - and MUCH MUCH worse! You will NEVER EVER see these horrors in the 'news' and rarely if ever even hear of them. Virtually ALL of these brutal activities are 'filtered' from the American public. You are ONLY ALLOWED to see what the 'entities' which control the media see fit for you to see. ONLY relatively recently - with the wider offerings of 'chat rooms' 'web sites' and other similar internet facilities, do we begin to gain access to the truth without thousands of miles of travel - years of seasoned intelligence experience or personal perils. <br><br>If you are disgusted with the mega-lies and misleading propaganda - educate yourself as to what is REALLY going on in the world. You will NOT find the complete truth in the newspaper - or Time - or Newsweek - Or Rush - or our Govt. - or TV or even our hypocrite evangelical pseudo-Christian church 'leaders'. These daily atrocities committed by the Israelis AND funded by YOU and ME, are carefully 'filtered' by our Israeli controlled press. Despite the one-sided propaganda, disinformation, distortions, and outright lies that we have been fed for years, you may now find and know the truth. The REAL truth – as in "so help me God" <br><br>We American have been responsible for the deaths of WAY to many innocent human beings throughout the world recently. Sooner or later - the truth will come to light - as it always does. Do YOU have innocent blood 'on your hands'? ESPECIALLY encouraged by the blasphemous hatred sponsored by your supposedly `Christian' church? A LOT of American do - and a 'higher' Judge WILL hold them accountable for these crimes against humanity - even if not in this life. <br><br>Keep your eternal soul. Keep you conscience clean. The truth IS available. World War III is in the 'making' folks. The `model' revelation for `Armageddon' as described by Nostrodamus centuries ago, is now, at the beginning of the second millennium - becoming frighteningly clear. It is a no-brainer if you just open your eyes and your ears. There is till time. Thank you for taking time to read this. I am willing to speak personally with any moral American who still possesses a conscience and must know the truth. <br><br>I may be contacted through <a href="mailto:whtt@cox.net"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">whtt@cox.net</span></span></a> <br>Joe Cortina <br><span style="font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.currentissues.tv/Joe_Cortina.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">www.currentissues.tv/Joe_Cortina.html</span></span></a> </span></strong></div>
