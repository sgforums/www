              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By Silvia Aloisi</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ROME (Reuters) - High food prices have pushed another 105 million people into 
              hunger in the first half of 2009, the head of the U.N. World Food Program said 
              Friday, raising the total number of hungry people to over 1 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Urging rich nations at a meeting of the Group of Eight's development 
              ministers not cut back on aid, Josette Sheeran told Reuters the world faced a 
              "human catastrophe" as more and more people struggle to eat a decent meal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"This year we are clocking in on average four million new hungry people a 
              week, urgently hungry," Sheeran told Reuters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Already for the first six months of this year, 105 million people have been 
              added," she said, citing figures to be released by the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
              Organisation next week that will raise the total number of undernourished people 
              to over 1 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In 2008, FAO said the world's hungry numbered 963 million.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The WFP needs $6.4 billion (3.9 billion pounds) this year for food aid, but 
              donors' contributions have fallen way behind that level -- it had around $1.5 
              billion at the end of last week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The agency says it has had to cut food aid rations and shut down some 
              operations in eastern Africa and North Korea because of the credit crunch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"I know it seems a big figure, but if you compare it with the global stimulus 
              package, it means that for less than 1 percent of that we could help meet the 
              urgent human crisis that is unfolding, and that is just as essential to the 
              stability of the world," Sheeran said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">She said that despite a decline in most food prices from record peaks last 
              year, they remained stubbornly high in developing countries, while global food 
              aid was at a 20-year low.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The financial crisis has only made things worse, and in terms of staple food, 
              people in poorer countries today can only afford about a third of what they 
              could afford three years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In a statement after a two-day meeting in Rome, G8 ministers reaffirmed their 
              commitment to more than double aid to Africa to $25 billion a year by 2010.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But a report this week said the group was collectively off course in 
              delivering on those pledges, made at a G8 summit in Scotland in 2005.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The report, by anti-poverty body ONE, was particularly critical of Italy, 
              saying Rome was trailing far behind other nations in meeting aid targets and 
              that undermined its credibility as G8 president this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We have confirmed our commitment to find the resources this year to bring us 
              back on track and fulfil our undertakings," Foreign Minister Franco Frattini 
              told reporters Friday, responding to the report.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ONE said Italy had delivered only three percent of the aid increase to Africa 
              pledged by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi four years ago.</span></p>
