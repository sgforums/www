              <p>Hrm, the way i see it Bush's policies have already taken a momentum of its own in the Middle east.  I don't see how Obama's going to be able to do much to affect it, the American people are already too hyped up on the fear of the crazy terrorists who hate America's Freedom and Democracy. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, the hate for America in the Middle East is no longer able to be resolved by just American forces pulling out. They won't forget it, and they would hit back any chance they get.</p>
              <p>And the vicious circle continues.....</p>
              <p>You view it as the economic dream team, but i see it as the appointment of people who propagated the problem in the first place. Though his appointment of Steven Chu as Energy Secretary is a surprise, a scientist actually in a place of political power?</p>
              <p>While i do see Obama improving international relations with the world,  the American people as a whole (From my impression) still sees their way of life as the non negotiable way of life for everyone else, despite it causing so much problems for the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>Obama's real problem is not going to be with the world, it's going to be with his own people.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Change? Obama Inner Circle Filled With Bilderbergers</span></strong></p>
              <p>By Victor Thorn</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/obama_bilderbergers_160.html">http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/obama_bilderbergers_160.html</a></p>
              <p>FOR TWO YEARS, Americans have heard an unrelenting mantra of change
              emanating from the campaign trail. But now that President-elect Barack
              Obama has begun forming his cabinet, we’re seeing a cadre of more
              deeply entrenched insiders than any administration that has preceded it.<br><br>In
              regard to key foreign policy advisors, all three of Obama’s selections
              either initially supported the Iraq war, or still do. On the economic
              front, each appointee maintains a close relationship with the Jewish
              triad of Ben Bernanke, Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan—as well as
              bailout engineer Henry Paulson. Barack Obama himself is a Council on
              Foreign Relations member, has strong ties to Zbigniew Brzezinski, and
              participated in a clandestine meeting with Hillary Clinton at
              Bilderberg member Diane Feinstein’s house at the time when 2008
              Bilderberg members were congregating only a few miles away.<br><br>Below
              is an overview of Obama’s top 14 selections to date. When considering
              their collective histories, a trend becomes clear, proving that the
              more things change under Obama, the more they stay the same.</p>
