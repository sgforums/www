              but yes this theory is very VERY possible.......i live here in ny for almost 10 years and this recent 2-3 years was terrible..............all i can say is that the economy went wrong.....it will collapse soon.....everything i buy here so expensive.......a Mcdonald meal or fried rice or watever will cost me about $6......that really pissed me off......it used to cost like $4 bucks a few years ago.......but the guy predicts this at the end of 2010 june....i think its kinda early,maybe a few more years
              I just hope obama is not the next bush....

              <p>Up and downfall is a natural phenomenon, if we look back at history, which dynasty, tribe, empire, govt or ruler last forever, not the hans, khans, british, romans, greece etc etc can do that. So it is not surprise that USA will come down in time from it superpower ranking. As the saying goes, "what goes up, will come down" it just how long can you stay up there. Same to all organisations, not much organisation can last for a century, sony, coca cola, etc etc may end in time to come.</p>

              <p>Whatever it is, when some one  goes down, someone will come up, just a matter of time, for yesterday is a past we should learn from, tomorrow is the future we should plan well  ith what we learned from the past, as for today, is a gift, that is why it is called " present"  Cherish it.</p>

              <p><br>Uncle, why u like to go back to tong lian time ar?? today is different, we want to stand or sit is our problem, and we can also question the teacher instead of he/she questioning us. We also got a complain room in the school web for us or parents to make complains and comments, all these will affect the teacher performances.</p>

              <h1>Singapore economy Contracts Sharply</h1>
              <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/equities/2009/01/02/singapore-japan-asia-markets-econ-cx_ll_0102markets04.html">http://www.forbes.com/markets/equities/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An economic system <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not have to be expansive</span>—that
                  is, constantly increasing its production of wealth—and it might well be
                  possible for people to be completely happy in a non-expansive economic
                  system if they were accustomed to it. In the twentieth century,
                  however, the people of our culture have been living under expansive
                  conditions for generations.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Their minds are psychologically adjusted to
                  expansion, and they feel deeply frustrated unless they are better off
                  each year than they were the preceding year.</span> The economic system itself
                  has become organized for expansion, and if it does not expand it tends
                  to collapse.</p>
              <p>The basic reason for this maladjustment is that
                  investment has become an essential part of the system, and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if
                  investment falls off, consumers have insufficient incomes to buy the
                  consumers' goods</span> which are being produced in another part of the system
                  because part of the flow of purchasing power created by the production
                  of goods was diverted from purchasing the goods it had produced into
                  savings, and all the goods produced could not be sold until those
                  savings came back into the market by being invested.</p>
              <p>In the system as a
                  whole, everyone sought to improve his own position in the short run,
                  but this jeopardized the functioning of the system in the long run. The
                  contrast here is not merely between the individual and the system, but
                  also between the long run and the short run.</p>
              <p>The factors necessary to achieve economic progress are
                  supplementary to the factors necessary for production. Production
                  requires the organization of knowledge, time, energy, materials, land,
                  labor, and so on.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic progress requires three additional factors.
                  These are: innovation, savings, and investment.</span></p>
              <p>Unless a society is
                  organized to provide these three, it will not expand economically.</p>
              <p>"Innovation" means devising new and better ways of performing the tasks
                  of production; "saving" means refraining from consumption of resources
                  so that they can be mobilized for different purposes; and "investment"
                  means the mobilization of resources into the new, better ways of
                  production.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The absence of the third factor (investment) is the
                  most frequent cause of a failure of economic progress.</span> It may be absent
                  even when both of the other factors are working well. In such a case,
                  the savings accumulated are not applied to inventions but are spent on
                  consumption, on ostentatious social prestige, on war, on religion, on
                  other nonproductive purposes, or even left unspent.</p>
              <p>Economic progress has always involved shifts in productive
                  resources from old methods to new ones. Such shifts, however beneficial
                  to certain groups and however welcome to people as a whole, were bound
                  to be resisted and resented by other groups who had vested interests in
                  the old ways of doing things and in the old ways of utilizing
                  resources.</p>
              <p>In a progressive period, these vested interests are unable
                  to defend their vested interests to the point of preventing progress;
                  but, obviously, if the groups in a society who control the savings
                  which are necessary for progress are the same vested interests who
                  benefit by the existing way of doing things, they are in a position to
                  defend these vested interests and prevent progress merely by preventing
                  the use of surpluses to finance new inventions. Such a situation is
                  bound to give rise to an economic crisis.</p>
              <p>From one narrow point of
                  view, the twentieth century's economic crisis was a situation of this
                  type. To understand how such a situation could arise, we must examine
                  the development in the chief capitalist countries and discover the
                  causes of the crisis...</p>
              <p>The purchasing power available in the community is equal to
                  income minus savings. If there are any savings, the available
                  purchasing power will be less than the aggregate prices being asked for
                  the products for sale and by the amount of the savings.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, all the
                  goods and services produced cannot be sold as long as savings are held
                  back. </span>In order for all the goods to be sold, it is necessary for the
                  savings to reappear in the market as purchasing power.</p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">usual way in
                  which this is done is by investment. </span>When savings are invested, they
                  are expended into the community and appear as purchasing power. Since
                  the capital good made by the process of investment is not offered for
                  sale to the community, the expenditures made by its creation appear
                  completely as purchasing power.</p>
              <p>Thus, the disequilibrium between
                  purchasing power and prices in which was created by the act of saving
                  is restored completely by the act of investment, and all the goods can
                  be sold at the prices asked.</p>
              <p>But whenever investment is less than
                  savings, the available supply of purchasing power is inadequate by the
                  same amount to buy the goods being offered. This margin by which
                  purchasing power is inadequate because of an excess of savings over
                  investment may be called the "deflationary gap."</p>
              <p>This
                  '"deflationary gap" is the key to the twentieth century economic crisis
                  and one of the three central cores of the whole tragedy of the century...</p>
              <p>The deflationary gap arising from a failure of investment to reach the
                  level of savings can he closed either by lowering the supply of goods
                  to the level of the available purchasing power or by raising the supply
                  of purchasing power to a level able to absorb the existing supply of
                  goods, or by a combination of both.</p>
              <p>The first solution will give a
                  stabilized economy on a low level of economic activity; the second will
                  give a stabilized economy on a high level of economic activity.</p>
              <p>Left to
                  itself, the economic system under modern conditions would adopt the
                  former procedure.</p>
              <p>This would work roughly as follows: The existence of
                  the deflationary gap (that is, available purchasing power less than
                  aggregate prices of available goods and services) will result in
                  falling prices, declining economic activity, and rising unemployment.</p>
              <p>All this will result in a fall in national income, and this in turn
                  will result in an even more rapid decline in the volume of savings.
                  This decline continues until the volume of savings reaches the level of
                  investment, at which point the fall is arrested and the economy becomes
                  stabilized at a low level...</p>

              <p><br>Do u know that US space vessel is using Russian engines as US engine is not stable n NASA abundent their own engine vessel testing. The only current space vessel engine belongs to Russian. If Russian realli wanna to be funny, then they can transport military to space. This is what US lacks off now. The next testing vessel is China n India.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Currently the worst economy is US, not Russian. Russia maybe affected but not hit as bad as their production can be consumed by local population, juz like China, going towards local market.....</p>
              <p>Soviet Union was broken partly becos of the western powers as they are fear of the SU power. Therefore Russian has mostly of the resources unconsumed should thanks to the western power......</p>
              <p>Russia is a very closed up country, therefore most of us only know the westerner powers. But I believe the No.1 position of US is going to fall soon. UpComing power is either Russia or China. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
