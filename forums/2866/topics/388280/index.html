              one of the only people to ever escape from the notorious Tower of
              London. Gerard was put in the Tower for carrying out his religious
              missions during a time when the Catholic Church was under persecution
              in Elizabethan England. He endured frequent interrogations, and despite
              never breaking even under torture, he was eventually sentenced to
              death. Gerard immediately began planning an escape, and was able to
              communicate with allies on the outside via smuggled notes written in an
              invisible ink made from orange juice. After one failed attempt, Gerard
              was able to make his escape when some accomplices rowed a boat into the
              Tower’s moat and managed to get a rope up to him. Gerard almost fell to
              his death because his hands were so injured from torture, but he
              managed to climb down to the boat and was smuggled out of England to
              live out the rest of his life in Rome.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><br> 9. Dillinger’s County Jail Escape</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cpjail.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Legendary 30s outlaw John Dillinger was involved in a number of often
              violent prison escapes. In 1933, he and his gang engineered a daring
              escape from a prison in Lima, Ohio after they used smuggled rifles to
              gun down two guards. But Dillinger’s most famous escape of all came in
              1934, after he was arrested on the heels of a number of famous bank
              heists. Dillinger was put in the “escape-proof” Lake County Jail, a
              prison that was guarded by an army of policeman and National Guard
              troops. In what has become something of a legend, Dillinger is said to
              have fashioned a phony gun out of a bar of soap and used it to force
              his way out of the jail. In his typical brash style, he then stole the
              Sheriff’s brand new Ford and made his escape to Illinois. Ironically,
              it was this move–driving a stolen vehicle across state lines– that got
              the FBI on his trail and eventually led to his demise.<br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;">8. The Libby Prison Escape</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/887345219_720c4f0c9f.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Richmond, Virginia’s Libby Prison was one of the most infamous jails of
              the Civil War, but it’s also the site of one of the conflict’s most
              daring escapes. In 1864, a group of 15 Union soldiers under the
              direction of Col. Thomas E. Rose and Major A.G Hamilton managed to
              tunnel through the prison’s basement to a nearby vacant lot. This was
              no easy task, as Libby’s basement was a dark and vermin-infested cellar
              known to the men as “Rat Hell,” but after seventeen days of digging,
              they reached a nearby tobacco shed. From here, 109 soldiers managed to
              escape into the city of Richmond and make a run for the nearby Union
              lines. 48 of the men were recaptured, and 2 drowned in a nearby river,
              but 59 managed to make it to the safety of the Federal army. Their
              escape remains the most successful prison break of the Civil War. Photo

Casanova’s Escape from the Leads</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_6983a.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Venetian writer and adventurer Giacomo Casanova is best remembered for
              being a ladies’ man, but he is also responsible for one of the all time
              great prison breaks. In 1753, after gaining a reputation for debauchery
              and adultery, Casanova was arrested and confined to the Leads prison,
              so named because it was outfitted with a lead roof that was designed to
              encourage stifling heat and make escape impossible. After smuggling a
              metal spike into his cell, Casanova and a renegade priest confined
              nearby managed to tunnel through the ceiling of their cells. Once
              through, they pried open the lead plates on the roof and broke into
              another room through a dormer window. Using a combination of ladders
              and ropes, the duo managed to make it to the ground floor, and after
              breaking a lock and sneaking through the prison corridors, they escaped
              by gondola into the city’s network of rivers. Casanova would later
              write about the escape in a popular memoir, and though many have
              speculated that the story may be embellished, evidence from scene of
              the jailbreak seems to back up his account.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><br> 6. Pascal Payet’s Helicopter Escapes</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ChopperG1507_468x305.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Many European prisons have exercise yards on their roofs, a feature
              that French criminal Pascal Payet has repeatedly used to his advantage.
              Payet was originally jailed for a murder that occurred during a botched
              robbery on a security van, and was sentenced to thirty years in
              France’s Luynes Prison. In 2001, he managed to make a daring escape
              when an accomplice simply picked him up from the prison’s roof with a
              hijacked chopper. Payet even returned to the prison two years later
              with another helicopter and proceeded to help three other prisoners
              make their escape, but all four men were re-captured, and Payet was
              given another seven-year sentence for his role in the jailbreak.
              Amazingly, in 2007 Payet again escaped via helicopter, this time from
              Grasse prison in southeast France. He was lifted off the roof by four
              masked accomplices who had hijacked a chopper from a nearby airport by
              threatening to kill the pilot. After landing near the Mediterranean
              Sea, the pilot was released, and Payet and his accomplices have since
              disappeared.<br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;">5. Dieter Dengler’s Prison Camp Escape</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/thumbnail.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Dieter Dengler was a German-American Navy pilot who made a famous
              escape from a jungle prison camp during the Vietnam War. In early 1966,
              Dengler’s plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Laos, and he
              was captured and shipped to a prison camp run by the Pathet Lao, a
              group of North Vietnamese sympathizers. Dengler had earned a reputation
              for his uncanny ability to escape from mock-POW camps during his
              military training, and he immediately contributed to a plan the
              prisoners had to make a getaway. On June 29, 1966, he and six other
              prisoners managed to escape from their hand and foot restraints and get
              a hold of the guard’s weapons. After gunning down three guards, Dengler
              escaped into the dense forest. He would eventually spend 23 days in the
              jungle enduring extreme heat, insects, leeches, parasites, and
              starvation before being rescued by an American helicopter. Only one of
              the other prisoners, a Thai contractor, survived the escape. The others
              were all either killed or disappeared in the jungle. Dengler would go
              on to become a successful test pilot in his later years, and to this
              day he is credited as the only American soldier to successfully escape
              from a prison camp during the Vietnam War.<br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;">4. Escape From Alcatraz</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/alcatraz.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> In 1962, Frank Morris and Clarence and John Anglin used months of
              meticulous planning to make what has become the prototypical prison
              escape. The trio were being held in the infamous prison on Alcatraz
              Island in San Francisco, which was reserved for the most hardened
              criminals and considered to be one of the most escape-proof prisons
              ever built. The men used a series of tools including a drill assembled
              from a vacuum cleaner motor to chip away at the aging concrete in their
              cells and make it to a nearby ventilation shaft. They then made their
              way down a chimney to the beach, where they quickly assembled a
              handmade raft and escaped into the San Francisco Bay. Their escape was
              not realized until the next morning, as the men had fashioned some
              dummy heads from soap, human hair, and toilet paper to make it look
              like they were asleep in their beds. The men were never heard from
              again, and most evidence suggests they drowned in the bay, but no
              bodies were ever found.<br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;">3. The Maze Prison Escape</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vmysyw.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> One of the most violent prison escapes of all time, the Maze Prison
              break took place in 1983, when 35 inmates escaped after taking control
              of the prison by force. The Maze was reserved for Irish Republican Army
              paramilitary combatants and terrorists, and was considered to be one of
              the most inescapable prisons in all of Europe. But after several months
              of planning, a group of prisoners led by IRA members Gerry Kelly and
              Bobby Storey seized control of an entire cellblock by using handguns
              that had been smuggled into the jail. After wounding several of the
              guards and stealing their uniforms, the prisoners hijacked a car and
              took over a nearby guard post, but when they couldn’t get past the main
              gate, the men hopped the fence and made a run for it on foot. All told,
              35 men escaped from the prison– sixteen of whom were recaptured soon
              after–and twenty guards were injured.<br> <br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;">2. Billy Hayes’ Escape From Turkish Prison</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/esca_billyhayes_l.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Billy Hayes was an American student who was arrested in 1970 when he
              tried to smuggle two pounds of hash onto a plane in Turkey. After being
              caught, he was sentenced to thirty years in the harsh Turkish prison
              system. Hayes toiled in Sagmilicar Prison for five years, but he was
              eventually transferred to an island prison in the Sea of Marmara, and
              it was here that he began to seriously plan his escape. The island had
              no boats, but a nearby harbor would frequently fill up with small
              fishing vessels any time there was a strong storm. Hayes spent days
              hiding in a concrete bin, and when the time was right, he swam to the
              harbor and stole a small dinghy. From here, he was able to make his way
              to Greece, and eventually traveled halfway around the world before
              arriving safely back in the United States. Hayes later wrote a book
              about his ordeal called Midnight Express, which was adapted into a
              fictionalized film of the same name.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: large;"><br> 1. The Great Escape</span><br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.toptenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/harry.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> For sheer planning, risk, and scale, prison escapes don’t get much more
              complex than the 1944 escape of 76 Allied soldiers from Stalag Luft
              III, a German prison that operated during WWII. The escape was the
              culmination of over a year of work by some 600 prisoners. The men dug
              three tunnels (nicknamed “Tom,” “Dick,” and “Harry”) 30 feet beneath
              the surface of the prison with the plan of tunneling past the main
              fence and surfacing in the nearby forest. This required a sophisticated
              construction process that included the use of wood blocks for support,
              a series of lamps, and even a pump to make sure the soldiers digging
              had enough air to breathe. After gathering a collection of civilian
              clothes and passports, on March 24, 1944 the soldiers began to make
              their escape. Unfortunately, the tunnel had come up short of the
              forest, and as the men surfaced they were in clear sight of the guards.
              76 men still managed to escape, but the 77th was spotted and the tunnel
              was shut down. The Nazis took a special interest in the escaped
              prisoners, and all but three were eventually caught. Still, thanks to
              the popularity of the famous movie based on it, as well as its sheer
              scale and audacity, “the Great Escape” remains one of the most
              well-known prison escapes of all time.<br> <br> <br> <a href="http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-most-incredible-prison-escapes.php">http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-most-i...on-escapes.php</a></div>
