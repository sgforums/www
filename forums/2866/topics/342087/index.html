              <h1>Serbs murdered for their organs in Kosovo – new evidence</h1>
              <p><span class="date">December 26, 2008, 9:12</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/35306">http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/35306</a></p>
              <p><em class="annotation">Serbian war crime prosecutors have received new
              evidence that hundreds of Serbs had their internal organs removed and
              sold by ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo war. The UN document
              obtained through unofficial channels contains photographs of what are
              believed to be mass graves of the victims.</em></p>
              <p>Film-maker
              Ninoslav has put his life on the line to show the suffering of the
              Serbian population in Kosovo, but fewer and fewer people want to
              listen. Until now the West has ignored him completely and the Serbian
              government would also prefer he kept quiet.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">“We see that they were killed and
              dumped. Now there’s legitimate concern that some of them had been used
              to take organs and killed later on. Now we can only reconstruct this.
              But what do we do today to make sure that a civilised solution to the
              Kosovo crisis will be achieved?”</span> says Randjelovic.<br> <br> However now that everybody wants to close the files, new evidence has
              emerged of what happened in Kosovo in 1999. Reports suggest Serb
              prisoners of war were taken by the Kosovo Liberation Army to the
              Kosovo-Albanian border.<br> <br> In a place called ‘the yellow house’ their vital organs were cut out
              and sold on the black market. The Serbian war crimes prosecution has
              through its own means obtained photographs purported to show a nearby
              mass grave and a report on the fate of these kidnapped Serbs.<br> <br style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">“We have evidence that there was an
              operating room in that yellow house. A UN Mission in Kosovo [UNMIK]
              report, which we got through our own channels, said they found a couple
              of bottles of penicillin there. There’s not enough proof to say there
              was an operating room. From the report you can see that there were some
              other medicines and containers for transporting the organs. There are
              nine pages missing. The investigation is now on and we are trying to
              find out what really happened,”</span> said Bruno Vekaric, prosecution spokesperson for Serbia’s War Crimes Court.<br> <br> The UN, though, denies knowing about any of this. UNMIK spokesperson
              Russell Geekie said he has no information about this report.<br>  <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">“It may very well be an internal
              report. You have to go to the UN headquarters to ask about it, but they
              won't necessarily be able to divulge anything about an internal report,”</span> he said.<br> <br> RT contacted the UN but they referred us back to Geekie.<br> <br> The story first came to light when former UN Chief Prosecutor Carla del
              Ponte published her book earlier this year. For Russian journalist
              Evgeny Baranov it’s not surprising. He’s been working on this story
              since the war and the latest information just confirms what he
              suspected all along.<br> <span style="font-style: italic;">  </span><br style="font-style: italic;"> <span style="font-style: italic;">“The first serious information came
              in 2006. There is a town called Merderi at the administrative border
              between Kosovo and Serbia, and at that time the international forces
              were handing over remains of exhumed Serbs to Kosovo. Among the
              relatives was this woman who hysterically tried to tell the journalists
              gathered there that her husband had been gutted and his organs had been
              taken to a hospital in Gnjilane in Kosovo. His organs had been sold and
              his remains buried in the courtyard of the hospital. Everybody thought
              she was insane until April this year,”</span> Baranov recalls. <br> <br> In November Kosovo police arrested two people, one Israeli and one
              Turk, for illegal organ trafficking. They are currently under
              investigation.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If this is true, it should not be surprising. There are tonnes of bad blood between everyone in the Balkans, which was why NATO's intervention was downright improper in many ways. What NATO did was essentially rewarding one of the warring factions who have had their own hands with ethnic cleansing, aside from the fact that NATO destroyed one of the largest economies in the region and sent millions into poverty. Not least the bad blood extends for centuries. What NATO did was step into the fray of a centuries old blood fight between warring factions in an attempt to spread influence.</p></div>

              <p>I don't think anyone would disagree that some individuals deserve to be charged for war crimes.</p>
              <p>But you won't see any Kosovan war criminals charged for war crimes either. Just as you won't see George W. Bush in court for similar charges. The Law is merely a tool of convenience.</p>
