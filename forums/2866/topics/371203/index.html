              <p>A Core Duo MacBook has burst into flames, destroying the laptop and causing some property damage in the process. The <a href="http://www.appledefects.com/?p=79"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">batter</span></span></a>y looks to be the culprit as it erupted into a firestorm, much like the <a href="http://www.appledefects.com/?cat=25"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">exploding Mac’s</span></span></a> of the past. Here’s a shortened version of the story:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>3am last night. I woke up to my housemate screaming (yelling “Matty!”) and the dog barking…<br>As I was running I saw a fire. At first I thought that the lamp had fallen and set fire to the curtain. As I got closer I realised it was my mac book …. burning!</p>
              <p>…My housemate said she heard it hissing like a steam valve, then smoke started pouring out of it and a couple of seconds later, a very large flash fire started. I’m sure you have read about these and seen the dell video. This is what happened to my macbook.</p>
              <p>The battery is swollen and burnt so it’s definitely the battery that exploded and caught fire. The macbook is melted on the bottom and severely charred (along with my bookshelves, books, magazines and the wall). The space bar is melted as is the track pad. The screen has been damaged a little too.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Thankfully no one was hurt in the incident and the fire was quickly put out. See the full story at the <a href="http://mactalk.com.au/forums/showthread.php?t=28926"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">MacTalk forums</span></span></a>, including more pictures.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/laptops/macbook-joins-the-club-of-igniting-laptops-199368.php"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Gizmodo</span></span></a> is reporting that now a MacBook has burst into flames, in an area nowhere near the battery, which are not affected by the recent recalls anyway.  </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The bottom left corner of the screen managed to somehow catch on fire, in turn toasting the entire left side of his notebook.</p>
              <p>Eric said the employees at the Apple Store were shocked and told him to contact AppleCare, which was closed at the time.  </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This area of the MacBook gets extremely hot to the touch, on both the bottom and top surfaces, but is it hot enough to start a fire? <a href="http://www.appledefects.com/?p=74"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">We have seen MacBook’s casing melt</span></span></a> and warp from heat, but this is the first reported occurrence of ignition in Apple’s latest consumer laptops.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.appledefects.com/images/burning-ibook.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>If you are skeptical about the igniting laptop batteries, please take warning. These recalls are issued for consumer safety and should not be taken lightly, if you own a potentially affected product, be sure to check your serial number against the recalled list so you can avoid potential problems. An Ohio family had <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&amp;entry_id=8292"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">this</span></span></a> experience, where the above photo is from:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Cindy Brown and her husband heard a popping noise and ran into their living room, where they found their son’s iBook smoking.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Clearly dangerous. According to Apple:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The affected batteries were sold worldwide from October 2003 through August 2006 for use with the following notebook computers: 12-inch iBook G4, 12-inch PowerBook G4 and 15-inch PowerBook G4.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Don’t hesitate to get your new battery!</p>

              <p><strong>STAFF IN THE</strong> London office of a marketing company were left shocked and reeling yesterday after an Apple PowerBook burst into flames.</p>
              <p>The company asked not to be identified, as IT manager Steven told how he was called to the scene by reports of smoke billowing out of an employee's computer.</p>
              <p>"When I got there, much of the smoke has dissipated and nothing much was happening. I picked up the notebook to investigate, and turned it over. Soon after I put it down again, it basically exploded. Flames were flying six feet in the air, and sparks," he told the INQ.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/img/11638/macIMG_0452.jpg?1241332207" alt=""></p>
              <p>"I saw that the smoke was coming out of the battery and I was worried about the chemicals in the battery so I told everyone to get out of the office"</p>
              <p>"I was stood there wondering what to do with the <a class="iAs" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: darkgreen 0.07em solid; padding-bottom: 1px !important; background-color: transparent !important; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; color: darkgreen !important; font-size: 100% !important; font-weight: normal !important; text-decoration: underline !important; padding-top: 0px;" href="#">laptop</a> when suddenly a fire started and flames started coming out of the battery."</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/img/11640/macIMG_0451.jpg?1241332207" alt=""></p>
              <p>"I went to get a fire extinguisher and was just getting ready to put out the fire when all of a sudden it went BANG!</p>
              <p>"Suddenly flames flew up about six feet in the air and there were sparks flying everywhere.</p>
              <p>"There was a popping sound and more smoke," a shaken Steven told the INQ. "At that point I just hit the fire alarm and scarpered.</p>
              <p>"I was about two feet away from it when flames went up to the ceiling."</p>
              <p>A company fire marshall relieved Steve of his firefighting duties and emptied around half the extinguisher on the burning wreck.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/img/11639/macIMG_0453.jpg?1241332207" alt=""></p>
              <p>"When he stopped using it, it just fired up again," said Steve. "He used the rest if the extinguisher on it but the laptop was still hot and glowing and the battery was all molten inside and glowing red.</p>
              <p>"At that point we decided to wait for the fire brigade to turn up."</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.theinquirer.net/img/11643/macIMG_0450.jpg?1241332207" alt=""></p>
              <p>Steve said the PowerBook was three-to-four years old. "We are aware that there was a battery recall several years ago, it is entirely possible that the battery was one of those subject to that recall, but we can't tell now as the battery is now just slag."</p>
              <p>The company is checking all its MacBooks to  see if any were bought at the same time as the incendiary device and assessing all the batteries they contain. The flaming PowerBook was taken away for investigation.</p>

              <p>"We were thinking, what if this had happened somehere else, like in a car or plane," said Steve later reflecting on the day's events.</p>
              <p>"I think I'll stick to the IT job and let the professionals deal with the fires."</p>
