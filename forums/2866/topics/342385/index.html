              <h1>EU spends £2bn each year on 'vain PR exercises'</h1>
              <h2>The European Union has been accused of spending £2 billion each year on 'vain PR exercises'.</h2>
              <p>By Bruno Waterfield in Brussels <br> Last Updated: 12:29AM GMT 27 Dec 2008</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/3965512/EU-spends-2bn-each-year-on-vain-PR-exercises.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/3965512/EU-spends-2bn-each-year-on-vain-PR-exercises.html</a></p>
              <p>New research by Open Europe, a think-tank that supports EU reform,
              has found that so-called European "information" campaigns are one-sided
              and boast a budget that is bigger than Coca-Cola's total worldwide
              advertising account.</p>
              <p>One publication, entitled How the European Union works, described the EU as "a remarkable success story".</p>
              <p>Another
              English-language "information" pamphlet claimed the EU "is delivering a
              better life for everyone" and described the single market as "a winning
              formula."</p>
              <p>The researchers also found a European Commission
              document that admitted: "Neutral factual information is needed of
              course, but it is not enough on its own. Genuine communication by the
              EU cannot be reduced to the mere provision of information."</p>
              <p>Lorraine
              Mullally, director of Open Europe, said: "Taxpayers should not be
              footing the bill for vain PR exercises to make us love the EU. The EU
              needs urgent and radical reform, not expensive campaigns to improve its
              image."</p>
              <p>The research also found that projects, such as the EU's School Milk Scheme, come with propaganda strings attached.</p>
              <p>"The
              scheme requires schools to display a European school milk poster which
              must be 'permanently situated at a clearly visible and readable place
              at the main entrance' of the school," finds the study.</p>
              <p>"It even specifies that the poster must be 'A3 or bigger, with letters 1cm or bigger'."</p>
              <p>Other campaigns target young people. One project in late 2008 was themed "From Shakespeare to Euro Rap".</p>
              <p>Events included: "Poetry Slam competition - Europe: I have a dream".</p>
              <p>Miss
              Mullally said: "People certainly need to know more about the EU, but
              the EU has proved unable and unwilling to provide neutral, factual
              information. This senseless spending on dubious PR projects has got to
              stop."</p>
              <p>EU and European Commission officials have stepped up
              "information" campaigns following a series of referendum rejections
              over the last three years.</p>
              <p>Recent Brussels polling has also
              deeply alarmed Euro-MPs by finding that only that only two per cent of
              Britons are aware that European elections are taking place next year.</p>
              <p>A pre-Christmas<em> </em>Eurobarometer
              opinion survey found that the already low levels of interest in next
              June's elections were actually declining as the vote gets closer.</p>
              <p>"The
              number of citizens who say they are likely to vote is less than it was
              six months ago," found polling published last week.</p>
