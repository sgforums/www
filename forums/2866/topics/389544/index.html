              <p>British ufologist John Pope declares that all human geniuses are descendants of aliens. Approximately 30 to 40 thousand years ago our planet was visited by representatives of extraterrestrial intelligence. It was them who created ancient civilizations that reached the highest level of development. Aliens married humans and had children. Now about 50 percent of Earth population are people whose descendants were aliens.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Pope believes that all famous scientists, artists and psychics belong to this category. But only one percent of mankind has the brightest talents. They may come from later alien marriages and have more extraterrestrial genes than others.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>A 13-year old teenager Boris, or Boriska, from Russia's Volgograd region has unique abilities. For example, he assures that at some point he lived on Mars and tells amazing things about it.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Nadezhda, Boriska’s mother, says that her son developed early. When he was two weeks old he could hold his head, and started speaking when he was only six months old. He learned to read at the age of 18 months and paint at 24 months. In preschool he revealed wonderful memory and ability to learn languages.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>At the same time the boy’s parents noticed that he knew about things nobody told him about. For example, he would sit in the Lotus position and tell people unbelievable details about space, planets and other intelligent civilizations.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>After some time adults started paying attention to the boy’s words. Boriska told them that he used to live on Mars that is still habitable. The planet lost its atmosphere as a result of a nuclear war and its habitants had to live underground. Those who survived adjusted to breathing carbon dioxide.</p>
              <p></p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Boriska says that Mars habitants are immortal and their bodies “freeze” at the human age of 30-35 years old. During the Lemur Civilization Boris came to Earth a few times in a spaceship, he traded and conducted scientific research. He watched Lemuria disappear when a huge continent went under the water after an explosion.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Once the boy’s mother brought home Ernst Muldashev’s book “Where We Came From.” The boy took the book and started looking at the pictures and photographs. For the next two hours he was telling the adults unbelievable details about Lemurs.</p>

              <p>he saw the illustrations in Muldashev’s other book, “In Search of City Gods,” he declared that there is nothing under Cheops pyramid scientists are so interested in. Ancient knowledge will be found under another pyramid, currently unknown. He also said that “life will change when the sphinx is open.” And that the hiding place opens somewhere behind the sphinx’s ear.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>Boriska predicts that more unusual children like him will be born on Earth because big changes are coming. Our planet will experience two more catastrophic events, and only gifted kids will be able to save the world.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>These kids will come from Mars, and will arrive to Earth as a result of souls’ incarnation. Kids form Proserpina can be also born on Earth. This planet died millions of years ago, “it was cut by a ray and fell into pieces.” Proserpina habitants had a chance to teleport into the fifth dimension. These events could be observed from Mars.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Many researchers talked to Boris. They were impresses by the boy’s vocabulary abundant in terms and details known only to scientists. Even the scientists themselves have no idea about some of the details and events Boris talks about. Where would a schoolboy know it from?</p>

              <p>What makes Man think he is the only and supreme being in the Universe? Pride, Ego and hunger for power and control over fellow Man. Aliens are just beings from another planet. Earth is just one of probably billions of planets out there. Some of you may well have lived former lives on other planets as well.</p>

              <p><br>We should not be worried about that date. Changes leading to what will happen have already started on Earth, and some people can feel the changes in them already. The changes will accelerate with time, and the end date for the changes will be many years after 2012, but changes in 2012 will be more "visible".</p>
              <p>There's a lot of intentional misinformation about 2012 and extraterrestrials on the Net and Hollywood, for certain reasons. The main reason is to create fear in people. Fear makes one act unwisely. On the other hand, to totally disbelieve 2012 is a time of change is also unwise. This time next year, many people's questions will be answered. :)</p>

              <p>Not possible to explain all at once, or for one to understand all at once. But I'll give a very quick answer to help open your doors:</p>
              <p>1) All beings have souls. We are souls within physical bodies. Aliens are simply beings living on another planet, nothing to be afraid of. Ghosts are simply souls/spirits who have left their physical bodies, but not yet moved on to the Light, for various reasons. Ghosts often appear as shadowy, almost transparent forms. Their shapes as a former human form can be seen quite clearly, but other details like their faces often cannot be seen.</p>
              <p>2) Reincarnation is part of Life. It's possible for people to have previous/future lives on other planets, or as animals, etc, depending on their stage of 'learning' and 'development', and karmic lessons.</p>
              <p>3) There are a no. of dimensions. We are currently on 3rd dimension.</p>

              <p><br>In normal circumstances, when people die, their souls/spirits should return to spiritual realm, and not stay on in our dimension as ghosts indefinitely. When they stay on as ghosts, it's usually because of 'unfinished business' that makes them reluctant to move on. There could be many reasons, usually due to trauma during time of death, or extreme grief in their loved ones, so they feel that they are not ready to move on yet. Rightfully, they should just stay on long enough to help 'console' their loved ones, and then move on.</p>
              <p>Regarding their behaviours, ghosts could take on their previous behaviours when they were alive. That's the reason why sightings in haunted areas often see ghosts performing tasks as if they are still alive, eg. sitting on sofas watching TV, walking in and out of rooms, etc. If people see them walking through walls, it could be because in the past, there were no walls, but were built after they died.</p>

              <p><br>Though I have answers to your questions, there's 1 question no one in this world can ever answer fully, past, present or future, ie. who created God. This is not the appropriate forum for me to answer all your questions, so I'll briefly explain with regards to the original topic of this thread, about aliens. </p>
              <p>Basically, any being that is 'different' from Man, with greater abilities have often been treated by Man as gods, since the beginning of Earth's civilisations. Man's consciousness was deliberately lowered to what majority of the world is today, for certain reasons, to benefit certain beings.</p>
              <p>The key figures of the main religions in this world, eg. Jesus, Buddha, Prophet Muhammad were real people, who came to Earth with missions given by God/Creator/Source to help people of Earth understand the Truth of Earth, and live in ways that will enable 'Heaven on Earth'. Their intentions were all pure and meant for goodness of the world. While they are the most high profile people, there are also many other people in this world who have missions to fulfill.</p>
              <p>God/Creator/Source does not belong to anyone or any organisation or any world or any planet, much as many people in this world like to think so, for their own benefits. Every being, humans or aliens, is part of God/Creator/Source, and have equal abilities actually. The only difference is the level of consciousness. Man has the opportunity to raise their consciousness in the coming years, but only if they want to, as it's their freewill.</p>
