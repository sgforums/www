              <h2><strong>February 4, 2009</strong></h2>
              <p><em><strong>by Johann Hari</strong></em></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sfbayview.com/2009/you-are-being-lied-to-about-pirates/">http://www.sfbayview.com/2009/you-are-being-lied-to-about-pirates/</a></p>
              <p>Who imagined that in 2009, the world’s governments would be declaring a
              new War on Pirates? As you read this, the British Royal Navy - backed
              by the ships of more than two dozen nations, from the U.S. to China -
              is sailing into Somalian waters to take on men we still picture as
              parrot-on-the-shoulder pantomime villains. They will soon be fighting
              Somalian ships and even chasing the pirates onto land, into one of the
              most broken countries on earth.</p>
              <p>But behind the arrr-me-hearties oddness of this tale, there is an
              untold scandal. The people our governments are labeling as “one of the
              great menaces of our times” have an extraordinary story to tell - and
              some justice on their side.</p>
              <p>Pirates have never been quite who we think they are. In the “golden
              age of piracy” - from 1650 to 1730 - the idea of the pirate as the
              senseless, savage thief that lingers today was created by the British
              government in a great propaganda heave. Many ordinary people believed
              it was false: Pirates were often rescued from the gallows by supportive
              crowds. Why? What did they see that we can’t?</p>
              <p>In his book “Villains of All Nations,” the historian Marcus Rediker
              pores through the evidence to find out. If you became a merchant or
              navy sailor then - plucked from the docks of London’s East End, young
              and hungry - you ended up in a floating wooden Hell. You worked all
              hours on a cramped, half-starved ship, and if you slacked off for a
              second, the all-powerful captain would whip you with the cat o’ nine
              tails. If you slacked consistently, you could be thrown overboard. And
              at the end of months or years of this, you were often cheated of your
              wages.</p>
              <p>Pirates were the first people to rebel against this world. They
              mutinied against their tyrannical captains - and created a different
              way of working on the seas. Once they had a ship, the pirates elected
              their captains, and made all their decisions collectively. They shared
              their bounty out in what Rediker calls “one of the most egalitarian
              plans for the disposition of resources to be found anywhere in the 18th
              century.”</p>
              <p>They even took in escaped African slaves and lived with them as
              equals. The pirates showed “quite clearly - and subversively - that
              ships did not have to be run in the brutal and oppressive ways of the
              merchant service and the Royal navy.” This is why they were popular,
              despite being unproductive thieves.</p>
              <p>The words of one pirate from that lost age - a young British man
              called William Scott - should echo into this new age of piracy. Just
              before he was hanged in Charleston, South Carolina, he said: “What I
              did was to keep me from perishing. I was forced to go a-pirating to
              live.”</p>
              <p>In 1991, the government of Somalia - in the Horn of Africa -
              collapsed. Its 9 million people have been teetering on starvation ever
              since - and many of the ugliest forces in the Western world have seen
              this as a great opportunity to steal the country’s food supply and dump
              our nuclear waste in their seas.</p>
              <p>Yes: nuclear waste. As soon as the government was gone, mysterious
              European ships started appearing off the coast of Somalia, dumping vast
              barrels into the ocean. The coastal population began to sicken. At
              first they suffered strange rashes, nausea and malformed babies. Then,
              after the 2005 tsunami, hundreds of the dumped and leaking barrels
              washed up on shore. People began to suffer from radiation sickness, and
              more than 300 died.</p>
              <p>Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the U.N. envoy to Somalia, tells me:
              “Somebody is dumping nuclear material here. There is also lead and
              heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury - you name it.” Much of it can
              be traced back to European hospitals and factories, who seem to be
              passing it on to the Italian mafia to “dispose” of cheaply. When I
              asked Ould-Abdallah what European governments were doing about it, he
              said with a sigh: “Nothing. There has been no cleanup, no compensation
              and no prevention.”</p>
              <p>At the same time, other European ships have been looting Somalia’s
              seas of their greatest resource: seafood. We have destroyed our own
              fish stocks by over-exploitation - and now we have moved on to theirs.
              More than $300 million worth of tuna, shrimp, lobster and other sea
              life is being stolen every year by vast trawlers illegally sailing into
              Somalia’s unprotected seas.</p>
              <p>The local fishermen have suddenly lost their livelihoods, and they
              are starving. Mohammed Hussein, a fisherman in the town of Marka 100km
              south of Mogadishu, told Reuters: “If nothing is done, there soon won’t
              be much fish left in our coastal waters.”</p>
              <p>This is the context in which the men we are calling “pirates” have
              emerged. Everyone agrees they were ordinary Somalian fishermen who at
              first took speedboats to try to dissuade the dumpers and trawlers, or
              at least wage a “tax” on them. They call themselves the Volunteer Coast
              Guard of Somalia - and it’s not hard to see why.</p>
              <p>In a surreal telephone interview, one of the pirate leaders, Sugule
              Ali, said their motive was “to stop illegal fishing and dumping in our
              waters … We don’t consider ourselves sea bandits. We consider sea
              bandits [to be] those who illegally fish and dump in our seas and dump
              waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas.” William Scott would
              understand those words.</p>
              <p>No, this doesn’t make hostage-taking justifiable, and yes, some are
              clearly just gangsters - especially those who have held up World Food
              Program supplies. But the “pirates” have the overwhelming support of
              the local population for a reason. The independent Somalian news site
              WardherNews conducted the best research we have into what ordinary
              Somalis are thinking - and it found 70 percent “strongly supported the
              piracy as a form of national defense of the country’s territorial
              waters.”</p>
              <blockquote>
              <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">One
              of the pirate leaders, Sugule Ali, said their motive was “to stop
              illegal fishing and dumping in our waters … We don’t consider ourselves
              sea bandits. We consider sea bandits [to be] those who illegally fish
              and dump in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in
              our seas.”</span></h3>
              </blockquote>
              <p>During the revolutionary war in America, George Washington and
              America’s founding fathers paid pirates to protect America’s
              territorial waters, because they had no navy or coast guard of their
              own. Most Americans supported them. Is this so different?</p>
              <p>Did we expect starving Somalians to stand passively on their
              beaches, paddling in our nuclear waste, and watch us snatch their fish
              to eat in restaurants in London and Paris and Rome? We didn’t act on
              those crimes - but when some of the fishermen responded by disrupting
              the transit corridor for 20 percent of the world’s oil supply, we begin
              to shriek about “evil.” If we really want to deal with piracy, we need
              to stop its root cause - our crimes - before we send in the gunboats to
              root out Somalia’s criminals.</p>
              <p>The story of the 2009 war on piracy was best summarized by another
              pirate, who lived and died in the fourth century BC. He was captured
              and brought to Alexander the Great, who demanded to know “what he meant
              by keeping possession of the sea.” The pirate smiled and responded:
              “What you mean by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a
              petty ship, I am called a robber, while you, who do it with a great
              fleet, are called emperor.”</p>
              <p>Once again, our great imperial fleets sail in today - but who is the robber?</p>
