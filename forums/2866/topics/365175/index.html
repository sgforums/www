              <p><em>Thursday, June 18, 2009</em><br><br>The ability to learn and to establish 
              new memories is essential to our daily existence and identity; enabling us to 
              navigate through the world. A new study by researchers at the Montreal 
              Neurological Institute and Hospital (The Neuro), McGill University and 
              University of California, Los Angeles has captured an image for the first time 
              of a mechanism, specifically protein translation, which underlies long-term 
              memory formation. The finding provides the first visual evidence that when a new 
              memory is formed new proteins are made locally at the synapse - the connection 
              between nerve cells - increasing the strength of the synaptic connection and 
              reinforcing the memory. The study published in Science, is important for 
              understanding how memory traces are created and the ability to monitor it in 
              real time will allow a detailed understanding of how memories are formed. 
              <br><br>When considering what might be going on in the brain at a molecular 
              level two essential properties of memory need to be taken into account. First, 
              because a lot of information needs to be maintained over a long time there has 
              to be some degree of stability. Second, to allow for learning and adaptation the 
              system also needs to be highly flexible. <br><br>For this reason, research has 
              focused on synapses which are the main site of exchange and storage in the 
              brain. They form a vast but also constantly fluctuating network of connections 
              whose ability to change and adapt, called synaptic plasticity, may be the 
              fundamental basis of learning and memory. <br><br>"But, if this network is 
              constantly changing, the question is how do memories stay put, how are they 
              formed? It has been known for some time that an important step in long-term 
              memory formation is "translation", or the production, of new proteins locally at 
              the synapse, strengthening the synaptic connection in the reinforcement of a 
              memory, which until now has never been imaged," says Dr. Wayne Sossin, 
              neuroscientist at The Neuro and co-investigator in the study. "Using a 
              translational reporter, a fluorescent protein that can be easily detected and 
              tracked, we directly visualized the increased local translation, or protein 
              synthesis, during memory formation. Importantly, this translation was 
              synapse-specific and it required activation of the post-synaptic cell, showing 
              that this step required cooperation between the pre and post-synaptic 
              compartments, the parts of the two neurons that meet at the synapse. Thus highly 
              regulated local translation occurs at synapses during long-term plasticity and 
              requires trans-synaptic signals." <br><br>Long-term memory and synaptic 
              plasticity require changes in gene expression and yet can occur in a 
              synapse-specific manner. This study provides evidence that a mechanism that 
              mediates this gene expression during neuronal plasticity involves regulated 
              translation of localized mRNA at stimulated synapses. These findings are 
              instrumental in establishing the molecular processes involved in long-term 
              memory formation and provide insight into diseases involving memory impairment.
