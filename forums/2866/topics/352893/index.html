              <h1 class="Headline">Why the End of America is Closer than You Think</h1>
              <p>Sunday, March 22, 2009 by: Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, NaturalNews Editor</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.counterthink.com/025688.html">http://www.counterthink.com/025688.html</a></p>
              <p>(CounterThink) I recently moved to Ecuador. Not for a vacation. Not for
              a month or two. I moved to Ecuador for good, as a permanent resident.
              Upon hearing my plans for living in South America, many people who knew
              me in the States asked things like, "Well what about the stability of
              Ecuador as a nation?" To which I would respond, "Oh, you mean the
              stability of banks that don't make loans and don't invest in
              derivatives? You mean the stability of a nation where the population
              still has the courage to march in the streets and throw corrupt
              officials out of its capitol?"<br><br>These questions make Americans pause. Most tend to think of public demonstrations as signs of a political <em>instability</em>. But in fact, public demonstrations are a sign of a <em>healthy Democratic process</em>. And Democracy is alive and well in Ecuador (with the usual level of corruption you find in any democracy).<br><br>It
              is in America, where the sheeple have been terrorized into staying
              inside the boundaries of their little "protest zones," that you find a
              fragile, unstable nation.<br><br>Through complacency and
              fear-mongering, most Americans have become cowards when it comes to
              political activism. They think emailing their Senator a few times a
              year is all that's required to defend freedom and preserve a nation.
              Marching in the streets is seen as uncivilized... or even unpatriotic!
              The government agrees with this, too, now labeling anyone who protests
              in public a "potential terrorist" and targeting them for FBI
              investigations. (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C509929%2C00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C29...</a>)<br></p>
              <h1>The multi-trillion-dollar theft scheme</h1>
              <p>In
              the mean time, while the sheeple of America are caught up in their
              hypnotic dreams of world domination, white-collar hoodlums in
              Washington D.C. and Wall Street <strong>are stealing everything!</strong><br><br>The
              oft-repeated creation of $1 trillion in new money out of thin air by
              the Federal Reserve has made the U.S. dollar the laughing stock of the
              world. The leaders of the G20 nations have already decided to ditch the
              dollar and shift to other world reserve currencies, and China is now
              blatantly and publicly asking the U.S. put up some kind of collateral
              to back up future debt purchases, to which the U.S. says "Don't worry
              about the debt. We're good for it!"<br><br>And when $165 million in
              bonus money got paid to AIG employees, the tyrants in Washington
              demonstrated the true reach of their confiscatory punishment by
              enacting, within mere days, a 90% income tax rate on those bonuses.
              Sure, I agree those AIG executives deserve no bonus money, but the fact
              that the legislative branch of the U.S. government can reach out and
              hammer a targeted group of U.S. citizens with a retroactive 90% income
              tax rate should send shivers through any American that earns any income
              at all.<br><br>It has all taken on the caricature of a political
              circus. The perception around the world now is that America is not
              merely a land of the incompetent and the bankrupt; it's also a land of
              fiscal buffoons and political puppets who have no real ability to save
              the crashing economy.<br></p>
              <h1>The Fed's plan to increase the money supply 15-fold</h1>
              <p>But
              the real story starts to unfold when you realize the Federal Reserve is
              now hell bent on multiplying the U.S. money supply by a whopping <strong>fifteen times</strong> in 2009! This excellent article explains how this number is derived: <a href="http://www.marketskeptics.com/2009/03/fed-is-planning-15-fold-increase-in-us.html">http://www.marketskeptics.com/2009/...</a><br><br>Now think about this: If the Federal Reserve increases the U.S. money supply by a factor of fifteen, that means <strong>your dollars will be worth only 1/15th the value they represent right now</strong>.
              So a loaf of bread that costs a dollar right now could cost $15 when
              all this extra money ripples through the system. (Which will obviously
              take a couple of years, but 2009 will be the beginning of it.)<br><br>This
              is called "hyperinflation." We're talking about a loss of over 93% of
              the purchasing power of the dollar. That, my friends, is called a
              collapse of the currency.<br><br>And once it starts, the floodgates
              will be opened and the tsunami of investors and nations offloading
              dollars will be catastrophic and irreversible. By the time it's all
              done, the dollar might end up losing 99.9% of its value, and you can
              use greenbacks to light a fire or wipe your back side, as they will be
              useless for anything else.<br></p>
              <h1>Why America's currency -- and government -- is headed for total collapse</h1>
              <p>That's
              why I say America's days are numbered. The America as we know it, at
              least. This repeated creation of trillions of dollars in new money by
              the Federal Reserve <strong>is the last great looting of the U.S. economy by the wealthy elite</strong>.
              The Titanic is sinking, and high officials have monopolized the life
              rafts, leaving everyone else to drown with the ship. And while they're
              rowing away from the doomed vessel that's taking on water, they shout
              back to the low-income workers clinging to the rails, "Don't worry! The
              ship isn't really sinking. It's just 'correcting!'"<br><br>The truth is that <strong>America IS sinking</strong> -- and it's not just the currency I'm talking about here: America's
              criminal health care system has sickened the population and outlawed
              any real healing practices, too. Meanwhile, the FDA and FTC have
              attempted to destroy all knowledge of natural remedies that can prevent
              and cure disease, further compromising the future of the American
              People.<br><br>On the dollars-and-cents side, America's economy is a
              fictitious mish-mash of corporations selling poisons to the people, and
              people buying junk they don't need, and everybody paying through the
              nose for disease care services that ultimately provide no net benefit
              to the population.<br><br>America's infrastructure is crumbling, its
              industries are already gutted, and its exports resemble third-world
              agricultural nations more than first-world developed nations. Its
              political leadership is, with very few exceptions, a band of diseased,
              ignorant influence peddlers who sell out their constituents at every
              opportunity.<br><br>Perhaps more importantly, <strong>America has abandoned the principle of law</strong>.
              Laws no longer matter in America because they are selectively enforced
              only against those who threaten powerful institutions or corporations.
              America is no longer a nation of freedom and justice for all. Rather,
              it is a nation of <strong>greed and profit for the few</strong>, followed by oppression and bankruptcy for everybody else.<br></p>
              <h1>What's coming soon for America</h1>
              <p>Given
              these circumstances, it is not difficult to predict the demise of
              America as we know it. The U.S. dollar will eventually collapse or be
              abandoned. This could happen literally overnight, or it could take
              years, but make no mistake: <strong>The American people will not be forewarned of the collapse of the dollar</strong>.
              It will be a sudden, surprise announcement, and all the politicians and
              banking elitists who engineered the whole thing will pronounce their
              "shock" that such a thing could happen! "We could never have predicted
              this," they will insist, even while the whole thing was actually
              engineered by the very same people.<br><br>One day, Americans will wake
              up and discover that all banks are on "bank holidays" (which means that
              someone in Washington is taking a holiday with your money while YOU
              can't access it).<br><br>Within hours, the National Guard will roll
              into the cities of the United States, and Americans will find
              themselves penniless prisoners in their own country. Anyone who
              protests will be arrested or shot. Law will be dispensed at the end of
              military rifles, and the President will get on television and explain
              how this is all being done for YOUR benefit! It's for your own safety
              and protection, didn't you know?<br><br>From here, it's difficult to
              say exactly what will unfold. We could see UN troops on U.S. soil, the
              IMF taking over the U.S. banking system, and the forced transition to a
              global currency. Other possibilities include the Balkanization of the
              formerly-united States of America, with regional nation-states
              declaring their own independence from Washington.<br><br>During this chaos, <strong>just-in-time delivery of food and products will grind to a halt</strong>.
              Store shelves will be emptied. A healthy economy of barter will
              immediately spring up to fill the void. Those who have things to trade
              (toilet paper, butter, salt, sugar, matches, gold, silver, food, fuel,
              etc.) will eat. Those who don't will starve. Health will plummet and
              infectious disease will become a very real threat in many cities. The
              conventional medical system will, of course, be utterly useless and
              will run out of medicine within days or weeks.<br><br>This economic
              transition chaos will be short-lived, however, and from the ashes of
              economic turmoil will spring a new nation (or nations) of People who
              have finally awakened from their complacency. New governments will be
              forged, and the fields of economic ruin will be ripe for the planting
              and sprouting of new ideas from a new generation of visionary leaders.<br><br>In my related article called <em>How to Create A Healthy, Wealthy, Abundant Nation from the Ashes of America's Demise</em>,
              I discuss some advanced ideas of how new nation states might structure
              themselves in a way that creates lasting health, wealth and abundance
              for its citizens. Read that story on the other network I write for.
