              <p>SYDNEY (AFP) - - An Australian man was charged with murder after
              allegedly throwing his four-year-old daughter from a city bridge into a
              river during peak hour traffic on Thursday, police said.</p>
              <p>The 36-year-old man, believed to be involved in a custody battle
              with the girl's mother, allegedly threw her from a 60-metre (200-feet)
              high section of the West Gate Bridge into the Yarra River in the
              southern city of Melbourne.</p>
              <p>The incident took place in front of
              hundreds of motorists while two other children, boys believed to be
              aged six and eight, remained in the four-wheel drive, police said.</p>
              <p>"No one had the opportunity to intervene ... it all happened fairly quickly," Detective Inspector Steve Clark told reporters.</p>
              <p>"He's
              got straight out of the car and taken the young girl and walked to the
              edge of the bridge, so that would have happened in a matter of seconds."</p>
              <p>Horrified
              witnesses called police, who were on the scene within moments and
              retrieved her body from the water. They spent 45 minutes attempting to
              resuscitate the girl on the riverbank.</p>
              <p>She died from severe internal inuries within hours of being airlifted to hospital.</p>
              <p>The
              man was arrested outside the city's law courts building with the two
              young boys shortly after the incident, and was "visibly distressed",
              Clark said.</p>
              <p>He was not mentally fit to be interviewed, and his
              lawyers said he could not appear in court because he was suicidal and
              in an "acute psychiatric state". His case will be heard in May.</p>
              <p>"It's
              a dreadful set of circumstances, and often you think you've seen it all
              but you haven't," Clark said, adding that the man was believed to be
              embroiled in a custody battle with his wife.</p>
              <p>"There have been some ongoing family court matters as I understand it between the father and his wife," he said.</p>
              <p>The
              couple reportedly reached an agreement in court on Wednesday appointing
              joint custody. The boys were interviewed by police and have been
              returned to their mother.</p>
