              <p>Wang Zhengcheng, 41, a financial consultant from Singapore, was in Bangkok on business and preparing to leave the Thai capital on Tuesday evening, the night when anti-government protesters swarmed into the Suvarnabhumi Airport.</p>
              <p>Unlike others less fortunate, Mr Wang managed to leave just before the protesters took over the airport and came back to Singapore to tell his story, reported Shin Min Daily News.</p>
              <p>Enroute to the airport, Mr Wang had to alight from his car as the road was blocked by protesters. He walked the rest of the way into the airport.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <p><strong>In Bangkok for three days</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Wang went to Bangkok on Sunday and spent three days in the Thai capital on business. He was to leave Bangkok on Tuesday and take the 7.30pm flight back to Singapore.</p>
              <p>He had three colleagues with him. One of them had to take an earlier flight. As a result, the group decided to leave for the airport earlier, at about 3.30pm.</p>
              <p>Their car was about 2km from the airport when they hit a jam.</p>
              <p>Mr Wang said: "We were stuck in the jam for about 25 minutes. Our driver said there were protests ahead and advised us to leave the car and walk the remaining distance to the airport."</p>
              <p>Mr Wang and his colleagues took their luggage from the car and started to walk towards the airport.</p>
              <p>On the way, they saw vehicles full of passengers wearing yellow shirts. They, too, were alighting from their stationary vehicles.</p>
              <p>Mr Wang said: "Their voices were strong and powerful. I think there were as many as 500 of them, all blocking the road leading towards the airport.</p>
              <p>"They were also carrying bats and tear gas. When we walked past, some protesters told us they would not hurt us."</p>
              <p>He added: "At that moment, I was not very afraid, just a little worried they would release their tear gas."</p>
              <p>Just as Mr Wang and his colleagues were wondering what to do next, they met a Thai Airways crew on his way to the airport. He invited them into his taxi.</p>
              <p>His taxi drove into a lane meant for goods and airport staff.</p>
              <p>"That was how we got to the airport safely," said Mr Wang.</p>
              <p>According to Mr Wang, a trip from hotel to the airport usually took only 35 minutes. This time, however, Mr Wang and his colleagues spent two hours getting to the airport.</p>
              <p>Mr Wang left on the 7.30pm flight from Bangkok to return home to Singapore.</p>

              <p>State of emergency at Bangkok airports</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BANGKOK- Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat declared a state of emergency on Thursday at Bangkok's two main airports, which are under siege by anti-government supporters.</p>
              <p>Deputy Agriculture Minister Thirachai Sankaew told Reuters police would be in charge of any operations to remove the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) protesters, even though emergency rule gives the army legal authority to act.</p>
              <p>Thirachai did not say if or when action would be taken.</p>
              <p>
              
              Somchai's predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, declared a state of emergency on September 2 to end the PAD's occupation of Government House, although the army failed to heed the order and did nothing. The PAD supporters remain there to this day.</p>
              <p>The order was rescinded after two weeks.</p>
              <p>Following are the basics of Thai states of emergency:</p>
              <p>-- Public gatherings are banned in areas and roads declared restricted or off-limits by state officials.</p>
              <p>-- People can be barred from entering areas or buildings declared off-limits by the government.</p>
              <p>-- Newspapers and other media deemed to be publishing information provoking the situation can be banned throughout the country.</p>
              <p>-- The army commander-in-chief has the authority normally bestowed on the police to control public order.</p>
