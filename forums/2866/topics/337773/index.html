              <p>WHEN you don't get what you want, sometimes, you might get something even better.</p>
              <p>This was what 30 passengers found out on Monday.</p>
              <p>
              
              They did not know that their Tiger Airways flight had been rescheduled. They said they had not seen the e-mail the budget airline had sent them about this.</p>
              <p>But they later found themselves on a more expensive flight, albeit a later one, and for some, a more direct one to their destination.</p>
              <p>About 50 passengers arrived at the Budget Terminal after 12.30pm, to find that their 2.30pm flight to Macau - TR902 - had been rescheduled for 12.35pm, and had left without them.</p>
              <p>The aircraft can seat 180 passengers.</p>
              <p>Tempers flared as passengers - tourists and businessmen - gathered in the Airport Operations Division office, wanting to get to their destination as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>When The New Paper arrived around 2pm, the office was packed with luggage and luggout 40 upset passengers were milling about angrily.<br></p>
              <p><strong>Worried &amp; irritated<br></strong></p>
              <p>Some demanded to see a Tiger Airways representative, while others sat on their bags with sullen faces.</p>
              <p>Airport staff were placating the upset passengers, some of whom were using the service counter phone to call overseas.</p>
              <p>At 2.30pm, Miss Jessica Blackwell, 21, an American, was frantically calling her university friends in Hong Kong on the service counter phone.</p>
              <p>She goes to Lingnan University there, and is due to make a group presentation this morning for a liberal arts subject.</p>
              <p>She didn't know if she could get there on time, and felt she had let the others in her group down.</p>
              <p>Another upset passenger was Madam Sun Lai, who was going to see her elderly mother, who has diabetes.</p>
              <p>Madam Sun was with her 9-year-old daughter.</p>
              <p>Some of the irritated passengers had booked hotels, and others had transfer flights which they feared they could not catch.</p>
              <p>They were ushered into a room, and were addressed by airport staff.</p>
              <p>Some passengers said Tiger Airways was offering them a full refund, or a change of date to another Tiger Airways flight.</p>
              <p>But the passengers were not satisfied - they wanted to get to their destination.</p>
              <p>For two hours, they sat in the room, waiting for answers.</p>
              <p>At 4pm, the door opened, and what emerged were mostly smiling faces. Miss Blackwell called her friends in Hong Kong, reassuring them: 'We'll be there.'</p>
              <p>Tiger Airways had decided to put the passengers on another flight at no additional cost.</p>
              <p>These passengers could choose to leave at 6.30pm for Hong Kong, which is about an hour-long ferry ride from Macau.</p>
              <p>The tickets they were given were for a Cathay Pacific flight, and were significantly more expensive.</p>
              <p>Thirty passengers took up the offer, and it was not a bad deal for those who had intended to go to Hong Kong in the first place.</p>
              <p>Technician Yeo Eng Chuah, whose original plan was to take the flight to Macau, and then a ferry to Hong Kong, felt he was lucky.</p>
              <p>But despite the unexpected 'upgrade', Mr Yeo said he was 'frustrated and disappointed'.</p>
              <p>He claimed he received the e-mail notifying him of the rescheduling only at 3.10pm, when he checked his mail at a free Internet terminal at the airport.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo added: 'I don't want to have to argue for three-fourths of the day for such an upgrade.'</p>
              <p>The rest of the passengers chose to fly to Macau on another day, or requested a full refund.</p>
              <p>Some were still upset, like businessman Goh Soo Teck, 36, who had to attend a conference in Macau this morning.</p>
              <p>He spent an extra $700 on a Singapore Airlines flight to Macau yesterday evening, and wanted a full refund on the Tiger Airways ticket.</p>
              <p>'It's common for flights to be delayed, but this is a case of no notification,' he said.</p>
              <p>'This is the first time I have booked a seat on a budget airline. I regret it.'</p>
