              <div class="entry_body_text">
              <p>The real scandal of AIG isn't
              just that American taxpayers have so far committed $170 billion to the
              giant insurer because it is thought to be too big to fail -- the most
              money ever funneled to a single company by a government since the dawn
              of capitalism -- nor even that AIG's notoriously failing executives, at
              the very unit responsible for the catastrophic credit-default swaps at
              the very center of the debacle -- are planning to give themselves $100
              million in bonuses. It's that even at this late date, even in a new
              administration dedicated to doing it all differently, Americans still
              have so little say over what is happening with our money.</p>
              <p>The administration is said to have been outraged when it heard of
              the bonus plan last week. Apparently Secretary of the Treasury Tim
              Geithner told AIG's chairman, Edward Liddy (who was installed at the
              insistence of the Treasury, in the first place) that the bonuses should
              not be paid. But most will be paid anyway, because, according to AIG,
              the firm is legally obligated to do so. The bonuses are part of
              employee contracts negotiated before the bailouts. And, in any event,
              Liddy explained, AIG needed to be able to retain talent.</p>
              <p>AIG's arguments are absurd on their face. Had AIG gone into chapter
              11 bankruptcy or been liquidated, as it would have without government
              aid, no bonuses would ever be paid; indeed, AIG's executives would have
              long ago been on the street. And any mention of the word "talent" in
              the same sentence as "AIG" or "credit default swaps" would be laughable
              if it weren't already so expensive.</p>
              <p>Apart from AIG's sophistry is a much larger point. This sordid story
              of government helplessness in the face of massive taxpayer commitments
              illustrates better than anything to date why the government should take
              over any institution that's "too big to fail" and which has cost
              taxpayers dearly. Such institutions are no longer within the capitalist
              system because they are no longer accountable to the market. So to whom
              should they be accountable? When taxpayers have put up, and essentially
              own, a large portion of their assets, AIG and other behemoths should be
              accountable to taxpayers. When our very own Secretary of the Treasury
              cannot make stick his decision that AIG's bonuses should not be paid,
              only one conclusion can be drawn: AIG is accountable to no one. Our
              democracy is seriously broken.</p>

              <p>the problem lies in previous top executive of AIG. Liddy simply come out from retirement to head AIG. Most of such compensation is commited by previous management.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why previous management commit such a contract to these executive is puzzling. especially since 2007,2008 subprime crisis started to surface.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand the morality to pay talents top dollar but on the other hand, do executive these days has self belonging to the company they work for? i just simply question the corporate culture in american.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think obama administration would like to put an end of such behavious among the corporate culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How far is capitalism without strict legulatory restriction really gona benefits the world? do the top talent get what they want?</p>
