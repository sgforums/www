              <p>what a cork numskull..GDP per capita as an indicator of economic growth, economic theorists still find flaws and problems with it as an economic tool. Among these problems are, the inability of GDP per capita to provide information about income distribution. Some income derived from the black market, or those which were not reported to the government were not accounted for. Likewise, GDP does not count volunteer work and services provided by social workers and charity institutions. It also do not account for reconstruction work and services done due to national disasters and calamities. Additionally, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">GDP as a statistical account is subject to fraud</span></span></strong> especially from those who are engaged in tax evasion processes. Some companies do not foreclose their true gross domestic transactions to lessen their tax payments. <br><br>Those are just some of the on going issues behind the value of Gross Domestic Product Per Capita and GDP as a whole. And whether GDP per capita would continue to be of value to economic planners remains to be since and would greatly depend on whether other indicators would be developed.</p>

              (when comparing to Singapore). People enjoy a higher standard of
              living and have much more disposable income...</p>
              <p>GDP is an outward appearance meant to look good on paper to
              entice trade, but it is not a indicator of national progress
              because it doesnt take into account the cost of living, disposable
              income, wealth distribution ect ect.</p>

              <p>Go back to r rathole , and from this post i know that u are not highly educated , and not defintely from the field of economics and finance.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the single best gauge of economic performance is not growth in GDP, but GDP per person</span></span></strong>, which is a rough guide to average living standards. It tells a completely different story. <br><br>GDP growth figures flatter America's relative performance, because its population is rising much faster, by 1% a year, thanks to immigration and a higher birth rate. In contrast, the number of Japanese citizens has been shrinking since 2005. Once you take account of this, Japan's GDP per head increased at an annual rate of 2.1% in the five years to 2007, slightly faster than America's 1.9% and much better than Germany's 1.4%. In other words, contrary to the popular pessimism about Japan's economy, it has actually enjoyed the biggest gain in average income among the big three rich economies.…</p>
