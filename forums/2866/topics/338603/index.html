              <p>THE Singaporean being held hostage in a Mumbai's luxury hotel stormed by a team of militant gunmen managed to contact family members here, who in turn alerted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) early on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>Strait Times reported that the hostage is believed to be a woman and was staying at the Oberoi Hotel.</p>
              <p>'As far as we understand, the Singaporean has not been harmed,' an MFA official said at a media briefing on Thursday.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <p>The MFA spokesman said the ministry was in close touch with the family, who has expressed a desire to remain private for now. As such, MFA has withheld the identity of the Singaporean hostage.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>MFA has made arrangements for the family to fly to Mumbai, and is liaising with Indian authorities to secure the Singaporean's release. The Singapore government is also offering assistance to their Indian counterparts.</p>
              <p>MFA said it has not received any reports of any Singaporean casualties.</p>
              <p>There are about 115 known Singaporeans in Mumbai. Among them are seven who were stranded when the attacks happened.</p>
              <p>'They are in safe locations but not out of Mumbai,' said the MFA official.</p>
              <p>"The terrorists are holding several people of different nationalities as hostages. One Singaporean has been held hostage," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"We are in close touch with the family of the Singaporean and are working with the Indian authorities to secure the release of the Singaporean and other hostages."</p>
              <p>Nearly 100 people were killed and more than 250 injured in the Wednesday attacks when gunmen armed with assault rifles and grenades hit two luxury hotels and captured an unknown number of foreign guests.</p>
              <p>A group calling itself the "Deccan Mujahedeen" claimed responsibility for the late night assaults on the Taj Mahal and Oberoi Trident hotels, as well as the main train station, a hospital and an up-market restaurant.</p>
              <p>"Singapore strongly condemns the attacks," the foreign ministry said.</p>
              <p>"Singapore stands firmly behind the Indian government in its fight against terrorism."</p>
              <p>The foreign ministry advised Singaporeans to postpone travel to Mumbai unless they have a pressing need to go.</p>
