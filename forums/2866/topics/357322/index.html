              <p><strong><span style="color: #003366;">Mexico shuts schools around capital in flu scare</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">By Noel Randewich and Armando Tovar</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico cancelled classes for millions of children in its sprawling capital city and surrounding area on Friday after influenza killed more than 20 people in recent weeks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">The World Health Organisation said it was concerned over what it called 800 "influenza-like" cases in Mexico, and also about a confirmed outbreak of swine flu in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">U.S. health authorities were unsure whether the outbreak of a new kind of swine flu in California and Texas, which have borders with Mexico, was related to the unusually late and severe flu season in that country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Mexican authorities say the flu outbreak has killed around 20 people, but WHO said about 60 people have died in the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it was in daily contact with U.S., Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC) -- its command and control centre for acute public health events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">There have been some 800 suspected cases with flu-like illness, with 57 deaths in the Mexico City area, and a further 24 suspected cases and three deaths in San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said schools and universities in Mexico City and the surrounding area would be temporarily closed on Friday and advised people with flu symptoms to stay home from work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"We're dealing with a new flu virus that constitutes a respiratory epidemic that so far is controllable," Cordova said late on Thursday.[nN24310608]</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Some 20 million people live in Mexico City and the surrounding metropolitan area.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Canada's government advised doctors to be on the alert for reports of illness from people who recently travelled to Mexico, although it did not advise against visiting the country, a popular destination for beach vacations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">FLU SEASON USUALLY ENDS EARLIER</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Mexico's flu season normally ends in February or March, but it has lasted longer this year, the government said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"We recommend avoiding places or events with a lot of people unless strictly necessary," Cordova said in an unusual late-night live statement to media.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">About 79 people, possibly ill with the flu, are being treated in Mexico and that number has not increased in recent days, the health ministry said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Worldwide, seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">In the United States, seven people have been diagnosed with a new kind of swine flu in California and Texas, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">All seven people there have recovered but the virus itself is a never-before-seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs, birds and humans, the CDC said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">"We are likely to find more cases," the CDC's Dr Anne Schuchat said. "We don't think this is time for major concern around the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">Canadian officials have been particularly sensitive to the international spread of respiratory illnesses since Toronto was hit by the SARS epidemic in 2003, which was blamed partly on a slow response to early disease reports.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A deadly swine flu never seen before has broken out in Mexico, killing at least 16 people and raising fears of a possible pandemic.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">The World Health Organisation said it was concerned at what it called 800 "influenza-like" cases in Mexico, and also about a confirmed outbreak of a new strain of swine flu in the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Mexico cancelled classes for millions of children in its sprawling capital city and surrounding area on Friday after authorities noticed a higher number of flu-like deaths than normal in recent weeks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">"It is a virus that mutated from pigs and then at some point was transmitted to humans," Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told the Televisa network.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">He put the death toll at 16 confirmed cases and dozens of other suspected deaths. WHO said about 60 people have died in the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it was in daily contact with U.S., Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Centre (SHOC) -- its command and control centre for acute public health events.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">U.S. health officials said on Thursday that seven people had been diagnosed with a new and unusual H1N1 swine flu virus, different from seasonal flu, but all had recovered.</span></p>
