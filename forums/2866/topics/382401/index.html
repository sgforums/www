              <p><strong>Written by our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A 70 year-old breast cancer patient has chosen to end her life by leaping to her death from a HDB flat.</p>
              <p>Madam Chen Baozhu used to sell prawn noodles with her husband Mr Yan Qingji in Geylang. They live together with a son who suffers from cerebral palsy.</p>
              <p>Due to their ill-health, they have to stop working and depend on public assistance from the government to support themselves. Mr Yan had a stroke three months ago and is still recuperating.</p>
              <p>According to her nephew, Madam Chen was worried her medical bills may impose a financial burden on the family.</p>
              <p>Mr Yan has been sent to a old folks’ home and his son to a nursing home. There is nobody else in the family to take care of them.</p>
              <p>As recipients of public assistance, both Mr Yan and Madam Chen would have received a monthly allowance of $330 from the state and they do not have to pay for their medical bills at government clinics and hospitals.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s aging population is a perennial headache for the government which is exacerbated by the declining birth rates.</p>
              <p>The government has encouraged Singaporeans to work as long as they can. Retirement age is extended to 62 and eventually to 67.</p>
              <p>Immigration is also encouraged as a means to increasing the flagging population. 36 per cent of Singapore’s population now consists of foreigners.</p>
              <p>There are few social welfare benefits for Singapore citizens. CPF, which is originally intended as a pension fund is now deemed inadequate to meet the retirement needs of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s cash-rich government has so far refrained from expanding the social safety net out of fear that it will lead to a crutch mentality among the populace.</p>
              <p>“Welfare” is a taboo in Singapore officialdom which has consistently exhorted Singaporeans to be self-reliant.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s income gap has widened considerably in the last decade. It is the second highest among the thirty most developed economies after Hong Kong whose result was skewed by the extraordinarily large numbers of billionaires.</p>
              <p>MM Lee Kuan Yew brushed aside the widening income gap as an issue of concern during a recent forum saying that it “does not matter” for long as the government continues to create jobs for Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Singapore's public health care system is too expensive (consider other countries like Hong Kong), that's why folks always say "Singapore can die but cannot get sick", because when you get sick you put alot of financial burden on your other family members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Subsidized healthcare my ass, they priced all the services really high, then give you a discount and claims that it's a subsidy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If I were stricken with a terminal illness, I will choose euthanasia too.</p>
              <p>And one word about 'free' public healthcare... I work in a country that provides 'free' healthcare but it isn't really 'free' because the tax burden on the working populace is very very high.  Think about it, the govt has to foot the bills for 'free' healthcare to the public somehow.  Would you be willing to pay, say, more than 30% in taxes for this provision?  I wouldn't, because I've witnessed a massive abuse of the system here just because it is free.</p>
              <p>And also, if the healthcare system is free, there will be massive cost-cutting measures - standards will drop, corners will be cut, resulting in a healthcare system that is close to shambles.  I live in a developed country with a free healthcare system so critically lacking, it really isn't funny and in comparison, Singapore's healthcare system is actually a shining beacon of light, and this is a consistent observation made by the health professionals here who've straddled the Singapore system before too and therefore have the first-hand knowledge and experience to pass this judgement.</p>

              <p>A MRI machine costs between US$1 million to US$3 million.</p>
              <p>Other costs include the construction cost of the MRI lab (US$0.5 million), radiologists' professional fees, technicians' salaries, repair and maintenance costs, utilities etc.</p>
              <p>So, it is costly to have a MRI scan. A private or full-fee paying patient will have to pay S$2,300 for a scan of the whole spine ie backbone.</p>

              <p>It's good to show all these figures, but how effective is it?</p>
              <p>If it's all that effective then this old lady and the old uncle won't have taken their own lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also have an endowment fund to help the needy, those that are totally penniless, you believe me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually those that qualify for these kind of endowment are probably to the extent of beggars (with no house or anything), it doesn't include those that have flats and jobs, which will probably end up bankrupt after being stricken by a terminal disease. That's why this old lady knowing that she will end up a financial burden took her own life. I would have done the same in Singapore. And they tell us that medical expenses are affordable in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yah!</p>
              <p>Cost is from US$1 million to US$2.5 million with installation cost at around $500,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But do we know the average MRI scans performed a year in a hospital?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are around 12,000 scans performed in Hartford Hospital, they have 2 MRI machines, so one machine handles 6,000 scans a year. But all these information regarding Singapore's hospital statistics is a national secret, they don't reveal, else everybody will know that they are not subsidizing but making a hefty profit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6,000 scans x $700 (say average cost of a scan) = $4,200,000</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>$4.2 million dollars for a year, 2 years of operation should rake in more than $8.2 million dollars, which more than covers the machine's cost at $3 million. Unless the radiologist is making million dollar salaries like our Ministers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The service life of these machines stated in the report is 8 to 14 years.</p>
