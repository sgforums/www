            <div class='col-md body'>After watching sales falling off for three straight months at Kentucky Fried Chicken, the Colonel calls up the Pope and asksfor a favor.<br>The Pope says, "What can I do?"<br>The Colonel says, "I need you to change the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken'. If you do it, I'll donate 10 Million Dollars to the Vatican."<br>Pope replies, "I am sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I can not change the words."<br><br>So the Colonel hangs up. After another month of dismal sales, the Colonel panics, and calls again.<br>"Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll give you $50 million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken.'"<br>And the Pope responds, "It is very tempting, Colonel Sanders. The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It would help us support many charities. But, again, I must decline. It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words."<br><br>So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible sales the Colonel gets desperate. "This is my final offer, your Excellency. If you change the words of the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken' I will donate $100 million to the Vatican."<br>The Pope replies, "Let me get back to you." So the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and he says, "I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that KFC is going to donate $100 million to the Vatican." The bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad news.The Pope replies, "The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One day a cat died and went to Heaven. There she met The Lord Himself. God said to the cat: "You lived a good life and if there is anything I can do to make your stay in Heaven more comfortable, please, don't hesitate to let Me know." After a moment of thought, the cat replied: "Lord, all my life I have lived with a poor family and had to sleep on a hard wooden floor. Just once would I like to have a nice soft pillow to call my own." The Lord smiled, and a beautiful velvet pillow appeared out of nowhere.<br><br>A few days later eight farm mice were killed in an accident and went to Heaven. They, too, were greeted by God Himself with the same question. The mice answered: "All of our lives we've been chased by cats, dogs, and even by women with brooms. We never want to have to run again. Do you think we could have inline skates? They look like a lot of fun." Suddenly all of them wore tiny inline skates with colorful little wheels.<br><br>About a week or so later, God visited the cat to see how she was doing. Rolled up in a ball, she was laying on her pillow, sleeping. God gently woke her up and asked: "So, how do you like it up here?" The cat stretched and yawned: "It is wonderful here! I love what you've done with the place. And great service! Those Meals On Wheels you've been sending me were a nice touch!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long ago, when sailing ships ruled the waves, a captain and his crew were in danger of being boarded by a pirate ship. As the crew became frantic, the captain bellowed to his First Mate, "Bring me my red shirt!"<br><br>The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt, which the captain put on and led the crew to battle the pirate boarding party. Although some casualties occurred among the crew, the pirates were repelled.<br><br>Later that day, the lookout screamed that there were two pirate vessels sending boarding parties. The crew cowered in fear, but the captain, calm as ever bellowed, "Bring me my red shirt!"<br><br>And once again the battle was on. The Captain and his crew repelled both boarding parties, however this time more casualties occurred. Weary from the battles, the men sat around on deck that night recounting the day's occurrences when an ensign looked to the Captain and asked, "Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before the battle?"<br><br>The Captain, giving the ensign a look that only a captain can give, exhorted, "If I am wounded in battle, the red shirt does not show the wound and thus, you men will continue to fight unafraid...<br><br>The men sat in silence marveling at the courage of such a man. As dawn came the next morning, the lookout screamed that there were pirate ships, 10 of them, all with boarding parties on their way. The men became silent and looked to the Captain, their leader, for his usual command. The Captain, calm as ever, bellowed, "Bring me my brown pants!"</div>

He ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate. "Why are you eating grass?", he asked one man.<br>"We don't have any money for food.", the poor man replied.<br>"Oh, come along with me then."<br>"But sir, I have a wife with two children!"<br>"Bring them along! And you, come with us too!", he said to the other man.<br>"But sir, I have a wife with six children!" The second man answered.<br>"Bring them as well!" They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limo.<br>Once underway, one of the poor fellows says "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."<br>The rich man replied "No, you don't understand, the grass at my home is about two meters tall!"</div>

An equal opportunity employer."<br>A dog ambling down the street saw the sign, walked in, and applied for the job.<br>The office manager said, "I can't hire a dog for this job." The dog pointed to the line: "An equal opportunity employer."<br>So the manager said, "Okay, take this letter and type it." The dog went off to the word processor and returned a minute later with the finished letter, perfectly formatted.<br>The manager said: "Here's a problem. Write a computer program for it and run it." Fifteen minutes later, the dog came back with the correct answer.<br>The manager still wasn't convinced. "I can't hire a dog for this position," he said. "You've got to be bilingual."<br>The dog looked up at the manager and said, "Meow."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once a Scotsman and an Englishman who lived next door to each other. The Scotsman owned a hen and each morning would look in his garden and pick up one of his hen's eggs for breakfast.<br>One day he looked into his garden and saw that the hen had laid an egg in the Englishman's garden.<br>He was about to go next door when he saw the Englishman pick up the egg. The Scotsman ran up to the Englishman and told him that the egg belonged to him because he owned the hen. The Englishman disagreed because the egg was laid on his property.<br>They argued for a while until finally the Scotsman said, "In my family we normally solve disputes by the following actions: I kick you in the balls and time how long it takes you to get back up, then you kick me in the balls and time how long it takes for me to get up, whoever gets up quicker wins the egg."<br>The Englishman agreed to this and so the Scotsman found his heaviest pair of boots and put them on, he took a few steps back, then ran toward the Englishman and kicked as hard as he could in the balls. The Englishman fell to the floor clutching his nuts and howling in agony for 30 minutes.<br>Eventually the Englishman stood up and said,<br>"Now it's my turn to kick you."<br>The Scotsman said, "Nah, keep the egg."</div>

"You will find no fish under that ice."<br><br>The drunk looks around, but sees no one. He starts sawing again.

            <div class='col-md body'>An Engineering Student, a Physics Student, and a Mathematics student were each given $150 dollars and were told to use that money to find out exactly how tall a particular hotel was.<br><br>All three ran off, extremely keen on how to do this. The physics student went out, purchased some stopwatches, a number of ball bearings, a calculator, and some friends.  He had them all time the drop of ball bearings from the roof, and he then figured out the height from the time it took for the bearings to accelerate from rest until they impacted with the sidewalk.<br><br>The math student waited until the sun was going down, then she took out her protractor, plumb line, measuring tape, and scratch pad, measured the length of the shadow, found the angle the buildings roof made from the ground, and used trigonometry to figure out the height of the building.<br><br>Of course, with all that was involved in getting this experiment done, they were up plenty late studying for other courses' exams.  These two students bumped into the engineering student the next day, who looked quite refreshed.  When asked what he did to find the height of the building he replied:  "Well, I walked up to the bell hop, gave him 10 bucks, asked him how tall the hotel was, and went inside for happy hour!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two monkeys walk into a bar and order a couple of beers. The barman had never served monkeys before so he was a little taken aback. He decides to consult with his manager, so runs up to the upper office to speak with Ian. "Ian! There are two monkeys downstairs ordering beers! What do I do?".  Ian: "Serve them you idiot. Oh, but wait: monkeys are stupid, so charge them twice the price. They won't know the difference." The barman goes back down to the bar, serves up the beer, and charges the monkeys double. Later in the evening, the monkeys are still nursing the<br>same beers while the barman's tidying up. Curious about these furry visitors, the barman comments: "Say, we don't get a lot of monkeys around here...". The monkeys look at each other and then back at the barman. Monkeys: "Well, with prices like these, no wonder!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As an elderly lady sat on her front porch reflecting on her long life, a Fairy Godmother suddenly appeared and offered to fulfill three wishes for her. "Well," said the woman, "I guess I'd like to be rich." Poof: The Fairy Godmother turned her rocking chair into solid gold.<br><br>"And, I wouldn't mind being a young and beautiful princess." Poof: The Fairy Godmother tuned the old woman into exquisite young princess, with a priceless crown of jewels.<br><br>"Your third wish?" asked the Fairy Godmother. The elderly woman's dog raised his head and uttered a single, weak, hoarse woof.<br><br>"Could you possibly turn my wonderful faithful dog into a handsome prince?" Poof: There, in front of the old woman, who has now turned into a beautiful princess, stood the most handsome young man anyone had ever seen. Morehandsome than anyone could possibly imagine. She stared at him in awe, completely smitten.<br><br>As he came toward her, her knees weakened. He bent down, brushing her cheek with his as he whispered into her ear, "I'll bet you're sorry now that you took me to the vet when I was younger!"</div>

He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people.  He asks how she knows if they're intelligent. "I do so by asking them the right questions," says the Queen. "Allow me to demonstrate."<br><br>She phones Tony Blair and says, "Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: "Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?" Tony Blair responds, "It's me, ma'am." "Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir," says the Queen. She hangs up and says, "Did you get that, Mr. Bush?" "Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!"<br><br>Upon returning to Washington, he decides he'd better put the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the White House and says, "Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for me."<br><br>"Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?" "Uhh! your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?"   Helms hems and haws and finally asks, "Can I think about it and get back to you?" Bush agrees, and Helms leaves.  Helms immediately calls a meeting of other senior Republican senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer.<br><br>Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at the State Department and explains his problem.  "Now look here, son, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?"  Powell answers immediately, "It's me, of course, you idiot."<br><br>Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, "I know the answer, sir! I know who it is!
