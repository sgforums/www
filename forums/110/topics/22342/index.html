But custody of the children was a problem.<br><br>The mother jumped to her feet and protested to the judge that since she had brought the children into this world, she should retain custody of them.<br><br>The old mountaineer also wanted custody of the children.

            <div class='col-md body'>HOKKIEN IN THE USA<br>A Taiwanese man with very poor, practically no knowledge of English once visited the US. His name happened to be Teng Xiao Ping. At the Immigration desk,the officer asked him a few questions to verify his true intentions of coming to the US.<br><br>First he was asked, "What is the last name of our first President?" Not knowing English neither what was the question, he guessed they must have asked him for his family name. So he replied, "Wa Sing Teng"  (in Hokkien meaning My Last Name is Teng). The officer heard "Washington"<br>(same sound) so passed him of the first question.<br><br>Second question was, "What do you intend to do in the US?" This time the Taiwanese thought, naturally he would be asked of his first name. So he replied, "Xiao Ping." The officer heard "Shopping" so nodded and proceeded with his third question."What car do you drive back home?" The tourist thought he was asked of his marital status, so he exclaimed,"Wa Bo Bo!" (in<br>Hokkien meaning I don't have a wife).<br><br>And the officer heard "Volvo". So he smiled with pleasure and asked another question.The fourth question was, "Who is the most popular basketball player here in the US?" By this time our Taiwanese friend was getting a bit impatient and annoyed hence shouted, "Mai Ho Wa Ja Dan.("meaning : "Don't let me wait here").The officer heard, "Michael Jordan!".<br><br>With great appreciation for this tourist's wide knowledge about the US, officer let him through without further harassment.</div>

As he had no family, they called up his two best friends, Ah Beng and Kumar.<br><br>Ah Beng went in first and the mortician pulled back the sheet. Ah Beng said, "Wah-lau-eh, he's very barbecued like cha siu. But if you would roll him over, I will tell you if he's my friend Ahmed or not." The mortician rolled the body over. Ah Beng looked at his ass and said, "Heng-ah! No-lah, dat not Ahmed." The mortician was puzzled how he was so sure but he didn't say anything. He went and got Kumar to check the body. Kumar looked closely and said, "Aiyoyo, it is true he's burnt Very bad, but need you to roll him over and I can confirm if he's my friend, Ahmed." Again the mortician rolled the body over. Kumar looked down at the ass and said, "Aiyoyo, oh no no, this is definitely not Ahmed." The mortician, unable to suppress his curiosity any longer, said,"Okay, you have to tell me now - how can you and Ah Beng tell for sure this is not Ahmed?" Kumar said, "Well, this Ahmed, he had two assholes." "What?!!" the mortician said in disbelief, "He had two assholes?!!" "Oh yes, everyone in the neighbourhood knows this. Every time the three of us go out, people always say, 'Here comes Ahmed with the two assholes'."</div>

An employee, then drove the Mercedes into the bank's car park and parked! ! it there. Two days later Ah Kang returned. He repaid the $5,000 and the interest which came to $13.07. The loan officer said, "We do appreciate your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a bit puzzled. While you were away, we checked and found that you are a very rich contractor. What puzzled us is why you would bother to borrow $5,000?" Ah Kang replied: 'Aiyah, where else in Singapore can I park my car for 2 days for 13 dollars and with security officers to guard some more?"</div>
