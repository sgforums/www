            <div class='col-md body'><br>i'm so lucky to have a sunday to clear my thoughts on what i've to do the coming week. this week is spent helping to arrange 40000 domino tiles for our programme. it's trial run, can't get volunteers so we have to do the trial test ourselves.from 10 am to 9 pm daily. no time and budget to take a cab back to office. thus my 2nd programme entertainment news's preparation was delayed. i've got 3 programmes to handle and really no time to even think. skipped dinner quite often 'cos too tired to eat. thanx to my partner, willing to drive all the way to imm to have dinner and sent me back home.<br><br>as i need to coordinate the students for their filming. it's hard to get them as not all of them carry handphone. one night i was trying to get this student so urgently as there is a sudden change of venue. but when i called his hostel, they refused to page for him. then i remembered i missed a call as i was walking back home, i checked it and it's either a pte call or a call from a public phone. it must have been that kid i'm looking for. i felt so shi1 bai4 having to miss such an impt call. maybe it's becos of the stress and the empty stomach, i just get furious and all of sudden i broke down. i kept on asking myself if it's a problem of me not used to this job or i really can't handle 3 jobs at the same time or is it due to the fact that this is not the job for me.<br><br>for the whole week, the moment i see my partner, the only things i talked about is my hectic job, complicated office politics. it's not fair thus yesterday after clearing the dominoes, i just try to talk less about my job. on friday, he accompanied me at Imm waiting for me to finish laying the tiles. we left at 12 midnight and the rest were still laying until 3 am. i know they will talk behind my back but i just can't take it anymore.<br><br>i find that in a big organisation like this, you are responsible for your hunger, your stress, your health, your work, your programmes.<br><br>a friend said, if it's dj work, no matter how tired, how unbearable, i will take it as a challenge.<br><br>i'm trying to bear with it. 'cos i need the experience and the money (though not much) for my renovation.<br><br>i'm taking it a day at a time. when i'm very stress, i bring my chicken along. now, being research writer of entertainment prg is something i'm looking forward to. but my shen1 fen4 is different now. last time someone coordinate the interviews but now i have to coordinate them according to producer's wants. scolded by one record company's xuan1 chuan2 when my producer decides to cancel the filming suddenly.<br><br>i'm longing to meet my friends, like u. but meanwhile a half day rest , i would rather read a book, get enough sleep.<br><br>life is full of choices. i am planning a choice now.<br><br></div>

Throughout the day, take "minibreaks." Sit-down and get comfortable, slowly take a deep breath in, hold it, and then exhale very slowly. At the same time, let your shoulder muscles droop, smile, and say something positive like, "I am r-e-l-a-x-e-d." Be sure to get sufficient rest at night.

            <div class='col-md body'>I remembered years ago, I just had my dinner and one of my bosses, called me at home.  Minutes later I was back at work, struggling with budgets, presentations etc, etc.  We worked hard for almost 4 hours before we had supper and this was rewarding - taking breaks in between - we went back to work after that and I never got home till 3am.  And my boss after sending me back, she stayed back in the workplace to complete the tailends.<br><br>This happened yearly - thank goodness not everyday!  No matter how stressful that day would be, we took it step-by-step.  We had choices - to forgo the whole idea or just leave it to others - we choose to do it stat!<br><br>It may not be easy to relax and breathe in between a tedious schedule - it may not be easy to make a choice - it may not be easy too to balance work and your life, your environment.<br><br>I could understand YM's cries and I am sure YM and all of us know that these are stressful and they seem so unbearable, but at the end of it, when you see the result, you'll be able to tell yourself, "I've made it at my best", strike a pose.  If it is not the exact response, do not brood over it, it's not the end and we'll learn how to make a better grade.<br><br>I think we would welcome anyone who has their woes and cries and needed a place to 'talk', come over here at MeiCaiKouRou (all thanks to CCL), I guess the friends here would be able to 'virtually', and of course spiritually supporting YOU.<br><br>Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
