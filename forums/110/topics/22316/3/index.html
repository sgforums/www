You know when I was in Hokkaido, we visited a theme park and there was this haunted place.  You will have to press a button and then the scary part would come on.  They also had this very long neck ghost in it.  But I hope this would not be a disappointing one.<br><br>Also caught the new Levis ad last week.  Interesting but I think it is selling Takuya rather than the product - cos' can't really see the design of the jeans!<br><br>Did you know that Music Station will be aired on Sat at 11 am now?  I was rather disappointed last Thurs when I didn't get to see it but after reading yesterdays' weekly TV listing - very happy but at the same time, sad because I only get alternate Sat off.  Sigh...well I guess better than having to stay up late at night.<br><br>Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks CCL.  I got them figured out its "Koi no kiseki" (Miracle of Love)  No wonder I can't find them on the web - translations a bit wrong.  This one never seen in the market - so I've not watched it.  It's a ugly duckling type of story done in 1999.<br><br>Good huh, SCV shows - some I've not watched them.<br><br>I'm not sure about the Music Station if its repeated.  I hope not or else very sian huh.<br><br>About Sadako - eh quite true I was not so frightened too.  I had to keep my eyes opened for my friends - so that I could described her movements to them.  Interesting, we are curious how she cursed those outdoors.  Afterall she had to climb out of the TV.

            <div class='col-md body'>SCV also showing the "Getting married at 20" - I read it in I Weekly.  This one also I have not seen.  Is it true that once you got SCV, you cannot tape any other channel but only the one you're watching?  (abit suah-gu here, cos' no SCV at home).  Let me know if they are really good. then maybe we will considering buying those VCDs.<br><br>About new songs you've asked before, recently did not buy any new ones but had listened to 96.3 and 88.3, thought the m-flo "prism" and their latest "Orbit" rather nice.  Her voice resembles that of janet jackson.  The other CD I bought was Smap's singles collection.  Can't find any others that are interesting and worth the money.  How about u?<br><br>As for the Chinese songs, I'm into Tanya, Sun Yan Zi and Jay Chou.  But I am still a fan of Mr Nice (Su Yong Kang).  Tanya's latest "Neng Ai ni zhen hao" - very sweet and catchy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zora,<br>I think that Getting Married at 20 is shown at SCV YU Jia Channel(Channel 55). This one i didnt subscribe as it cost additional of $12 per channel. I only have basic tier plan. All the jap show i watch is shown in TVBS channel.<br>Having SCV u cant record other channel while watching another channel but if u pay another $15 plus, they will add an special "apdator" to it and u will be able to record. But still u can only record SCV when u r watching channel 5,6 etc. u can't watch SCV programme while watching another SCV channel. Vice versa. very stupid right???<br><br>The latest jap song i heard is Sheena Ringo's Mayonaka Wa Junketsu. becos dun know what other nice song there is. Also never buy any CD. thinking of buying SMAP compilation.<br>Most of the time i listen to chinese songs. 90% of the mp3 in my PC is chinese song. Most recent ones are Wang Pei Rong, Tanya, Hong Aili, Jordan, Xin Wei, Xu Zhi'an, Harlem Yu etc. all download one! hahah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow!  Who is Hong Aili,  Xin Wei and Wang Pei Rong?  Jordan is chen xiaochun?  Pls forgive me as I am not familar.  Usually I listen to the songs and music but most of the time, cannot recall the title or singer.  Tanya and the rest are just too good for me to miss.  I heard that Guang Liang's own latest release not bad - got Malay lyrics.<br><br>And I've also heard that and watched that on the webpage (I think you posted it).  Is the one with the animated lady, rite?  I read her message to her fans to about her pregnancy.<br><br>Did u watch last nite YMCA - I thought the magician will win - but the 'korean' got in.  He dances in a very funny manner -  must be his height.  His friend was much better.  I also think that those Mei-Shao-Nu very poor thing - though very good experience for them.  Aisha and Pengzi very cute.<br><br>My colleague told me the 7pm show on U channel interesting.  I have not got the chance to see as I always come back late.  Wonder if they will repeat telecast the TV Works Stage Show cos' that day I watched PCK and the Millionaire show and did not tape TV Works.  BTW do you know how is Yong Mei?<br><br>Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hong aili is a new singer. she is say to be look like Cai 10. but i dun think so. At least she look smarter than Cai 10.<br>Xinwei is a new singaporean singer. her first album is release in Taiwan. 9 out of 10 song she wrote the melody. 8 out of the 9 she wrote the lyrics. She is dark n wear braces. long hair. Tao Zi likes her songs and has ask songs from Xinwei.<br>Wang Pei Rong releases her second album in Taiwan. There is one song written by her which i like it very much. the song is only about 2 min.<br>yes, jordan is Chen Xiao Chun. Guang Liang new song i have heard the main song. The one with malay lyrics is sang with other singers, if i remember correctly.<br><br>I watch YMCA last night. Find that the standard is dropping. all so skinny like bamboo. I like the 3rd one as he looks better. His friend really dance well. Why dun have macho guy??<br><br>Out of theose Sunday Girls I like Mai and Aisha. Both so cute!!<br><br>The 7pm show at Channel U is really funny!! It is Miao Cui Hua. Miao Cui Hua is mother of Fang Shi Yu. so this one talking about how she meet n married, her young days story. so comical!! must watch! better than channel 8 Zhen Ai Wu Di.<br>Yongmei ah. Busy! She is at the Big Walk. Huijun saw her following Zhong QIn. but due to the crowd, they have no chance to talk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello minasan<br><br>I've just finished Shiroi Kage - Love and Life in the White (literally translation : White Shadow).  About an ill doctor and a cheerful nurse.  The doctor played by Nakai Masahiro(from Smap) has the problem of multiple myeloma (increased protein production in the bone marrow) which has reached its terminal stage.  He was a skilful with some attitude problem at work.  He refused to get treatment as he wished to be a doctor until the day he died.  He fell in love with a nurse (Takeuchi Yuko) who was kept in the dark until the day he committed suicide.  - Overall very sad story - no happy notes - very simple story with a different disease to capture the hearts of the viewers.  Can watch if you have the time.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Peace</div>
