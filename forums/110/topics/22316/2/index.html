            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday actually very lucky.  We will not be watching TV8 at 9pm, so can catch the Korean show.  At the same time can tape Central from 9 onwards.  Also can watch Super Sunday - very sad that very handsome judo guy has to go to US -  Next time, may have to get friends to tape more than once channel.  Lucky I have no SCV.  After I moved, we will have 3 TVs, then can jump from room to another,, heee....<br><br>I've also watched BL but if there is no other shows on TV since I have no VCDs to watch at the moment, I might watch again lah.<br><br>BTW, I've watched Hero, Strawberry on the Shortcake, Big Wing, Aiken Rosente (Pet Dog show), and the Wangu Papa.  Minasan should try and catch these - all not bad.<br><br>Now waiting for Love Story to come to Singapore.<br><br>BTW what do you think of Sammi's latest - the techno sound music.  Good try from her but I still prefer her earlier songs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by zora (edited 17 May 2001).]</div>

The remaining few - I think last nite's and the first one (tall and skinny) better looking ones.  The 2nd one (boxer), I don't like him, very sissy.  The other short and skinny one - if you said he is good looking, I think there are even better ones here.<br><br>I have not watched the Iguana no Musume - it got quite a good review.  I think u can consider finishing the whole show.<br><br>I have watched quite a number of Jap dramas (more than 40) excluding those on TV.  Also had watched the "Hana yori dango" the cartoon on CityTV now.  I didn't watched the GTO cartoon as my nephew wants to watch the High Five on Central.  I am still crazy over those jap dramas - don't like the taiwanese show.  If not for TV8, I would not have the chance to watch HK dramas as I don't understand cantonese.  That's why, I have watched so many jap dramas and always waiting for new ones.  Love Story (with Nakayama Miho) - has very good ratings in Japan too.<br><br>BTW, what do you minasan think of the Monday drama "Yamato Nadeshiko".  I think Sakurako is very a annoying character.  But she will end up with the fisherman rite?  Can't understand why the fisherman liked her so much even though he knew what kind of person she was.

            <div class='col-md body'>Zora,<br>I think all not so handsome. Think only the first one can pass. He really looks like some character that walk out from japan comic. Same as you i dun like that 2nd one. His mouth look yucks! hahaha....<br><br>That Iguana no Musume is really ke lian! Never seen such pitiful character. Mentally abuse by a siao mother, at school kena bully by a bitch. Whenever i see that bitch i will switch channel. But that girl who acted as that bitch is pretty.<br><br>Before this i watched E Zuo Ju Zhi Wen. It is so so funny!! if really got such a person, she can't really survive unless someone protect her.<br><br>That Love Story u mention is by miho nakaya n Etsushi Toyokawa is it? If yes, please inform me once it is out. I like Etsushi Toyokawa!!<br><br>I didn't watch Yamato Nadeshiko bcos find it so stupid. Where got such person one??!! if have, this person will kena suan by me! hahaha... Love is blind so that fisherman likes her so so so much!<br>Compare this show wwith Che Zhan(Bus Stop), i will prefer bus stop more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes CCL, I've watched that too - rather ridicuous tho' funny. I think Sato Aiko always got comical role like that in Nanako the Doctor, Love and Peace).  I don't quite like Kashiwabara Takashi in this show, as I find his acting skills not so good then.  So far, he has been cast as someone very stuck-up, very quiet and always don't smile one.  But you should see him on Big Wing.  He even look much better with that hairstyle.    This Big Wing is similar to that of the Nurse's Work except this time, it happened at the airport.<br><br>Love Story - starring Etsushi Toyokawa and Miho Nakayama - where he plays as a writer and Miho as an editor.  This is something I am looking forward to esp to see Miho's drama again. I like her esp in Sleeping Forest.<br><br>Did you watched Love Complex?  This is the worst and weirdest I have ever seen.  My friend regretted buying the VCD.  We both naturally do not understand the whole show well.<br><br>I also agree that the first guy looks like he is from the comic.  And he was also very poor thing becos lots of balls were thrown at him.<br><br>CF, Sportscity now known as CityTV will run entertainment shows from afternoon 4pm to 10.30pm and thereafter its sports.  And we have whole day sports over the weekends.<br><br>Bear in mind also, we will have TV Works on 20 May.

I dun think Kashiwabara Takashi is really handsome. Agree with you that this show his acting is not so good. I like that little boy who acted as Takashi's brother. Think he act better than Takashi.<br><br>So far i only bought 2 sets of jap vcd - Beautiful Life (becos YM keep saying it is nice) and Say You Love Me(My favourite show!!). I just bought Say You Love Me last saturday. Has been looking for it. Now TS Group has imported jap VCD from Taiwan. it has beautiful case and design.<br><br>Who starr in Love Complex?

            <div class='col-md body'>CCL, u sure is a fan of Etsushi (he is also in the show Aishiteiru to Ittekure).  Have not got hold of this VCD.  I read that this show was one of the most watched drama in 1995.<br><br>Love Complex - Sorimachi Takashi and Karasawa Toshiaki star in "Love Complex". Someone has been embezzeled money within the company and the fingers are pointing to seven secretaries who are the only ones who can use computer and would have a motivation for stealing the money. The company hired Sorimachi and Karasawa to find out who is stealing the money. Storyline is very straightforward but there are scenes whereby you just find it impossible to believe; very supernatural.  Maybe you will not call it weird but unique, strange - very different from the usual dramas.  This show did not get very good reviews in Japan.<br><br>As for Sakura - I'm not very sure but according to her official page, she was born in Switzerland in 1971/11/23.  Came back to Japan in 1974, Osaka, Kobe.  She studied in International School and attended Washington university.  Returned in 1991 and worked as an OL.  She was discovered at a Vocal Festival Grand Prix in 1993 and released her first mini-album "Sakura" with bounce records@Dig-up label in 1995.  She was exposed to lots of black RB music since young.  She can sing, compose, arrange and play the guitar.  Very talented huh.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mmmm, Mystery of Love - there the actual title?  I usually use the japanese title so might be not so sure which show - could this be the "Ai de shengyang" ?  If so, I've not seen it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jas,<br><br>actually trying to break the record....we have moved out of your topic you know.<br><br>Let's 'chat' some more.<br><br>I watched BL again last nite.  Actually this show really not bad.  CCL, good recommendation from YM u know.  Really like to watch Tokiwa Takako - did minasan watched Tabloid - also very thrilling - she done very well in that show.  U Channel coming with "Bijin" (Mei Ren) - I can't remember the title starring her and that Ojiya (Father).  If you like shows like Tabloid, you will enjoy Hero, Gift and Team - a story per episode.<br><br>BTW if you have watched both Gift and Ii hito (A good person "yi ge hao ren"), wonder if you have noticed - that you will find both characters appearing on each other as part of the passerby/scene.  Very cute one when you noticed those similar parts.<br><br>I watched Love Letter on Central - about that time, I also watched the sushi chef showing.  Both starring Kashiwabara (in both shows, he acted cool and quiet ones) and you know what in both shows, he was from Hokkaido.  That's why when I reached the Otaru Canal, I just have to take a shot of it and posted in on my homepage.<br><br>BTW too, the weather is so hot these days that, how I wish I am back in Hokkaido (so cooling even though the snow has melted).<br><br>Peace<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by zora (edited 18 May 2001).]</div>
