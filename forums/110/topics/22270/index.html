'cos it's a daily programme.<br><br>guess what? i might appear in tv again. not as an actress or star. juz part of the production team for domino programme. we are preparing a "the making of Big challenge" programme and all crew has to appear on screen. sigh! despite my reminder to them of the stalker they still want everyone to be on screen. pray that the stalker didn't know how to switch to channel U. otherwise it'll be end of my freedom, considering i work till 8 pm and sometimes even 12 midnight!;(<br><br>so much so about my job, i still try to squeeze every possible time to do something i like. like reading in the library, eating my favourite stuff, and reading the messages you all posts, pampering my skin eating vitamins and doing home facial. listening to jpop music i used to play and something i long to do is going out with my girlfriends, some from this forum! though i am not doing jap programme, i still read jap entertainment thru website daily. so zora's news comes handy too!<br><br>zora, have you heard of a jap hip hop group by the name of "wit smith"? (their songs quite similar to dragon ash but much better). i heard it from hk radio programme. i like sunny day service too!<br><br>this evening, i am going picnic !!! laying down the green green grass, smiling at my chicken, and maybe eating my favourite suan4 pan2 zi2 from lavendar food court.<br><br>i guess all these are just "haven" for me.<br><br>what makes your "haven"?<br><br>take care friends! WARM GREETINGS FROM GINGER, MY CHICKEN TOO! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yongmei so busy with work...Well it is better to be busy, when you're too free like me at times, I keep surfing jnews and playing on the internet with my boss around.  But seriously, more work means time passes very fast and before we know it, it's time to go home.  I've been keeping myself updated with the jnews, though I did not post them here.  I think by the time, our friends here read about them, it is already old news.  But I will keep posting those more interesting ones most appealling to most of us.<br><br>So what is haven to me...none other than, walking down the japanese machi and saying 'ohayo' or 'konbanwa' to all the little ones going to or coming from school.  They are so cute!<br><br>ps, I've not heard of wit smith, I only know Will Smith.  Will 'listen' out for their music.<br><br>Can't wait to see you on TV.  I've never seen you 'life' before!<br><br>Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
