            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...actually I have been thinking about this too...might as well share some thoughts about it since this thread has surfaced...<br><br>I guess it happens to all surfers, you get connected to the net; you make virtual friends throught the various chat and messeging programs; you start to talk to them on a regular basis and get to know them better; you start to treat them as your real friends, or in certain cases, something more.<br><br>I have been on the net for quite some time. Probably not as long as some of you out there, but long enough to know not to read too deeply in between the lines of such conversations; not to lead someone on and not to take what they say too seriously. That's because if you do, part of the virtual world becomes part of YOUR real world, not THE real world.<br><br>I'll admit that I am quite close to some virtual friends, closer than I would have expected or wanted. It happens I guess, and one effect of it is the amount of time I am wasting in the virtual world at the expense of my real world. Thankfully I'm still untouched mentally and emotionally (I think...hope).<br><br>In dealing with virtual friends I always made it a point to remember behind every Nick is a human; a human of flesh and blood, susceptible to the same range of emotions that we ourselves possess, but I have to fall short of treating them as real friends due to the nature of the medium in which we communicate. I guess that's the best approach...for me at least.<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is like a box of Chocolates...you have to eat it before it melts..." -- El Joraen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm...<br><br>By hearing so many good and bad examples on this... you can be rational to a certain extent.<br><br>By drawing the line, you are doing good as a form of self protection.<br><br>Most people cannot draw a line between a lot of things, not necessary between virtual and real life, as they are bound by the emotions that they possess.<br><br>Treating friends with sincerity is a must but how many people can you trust?<br><br>There are people getting cheated/betrayed even in real life, what's to it with the virtual one?<br><br>To me, staying virtual or real does not affect you greatly unless you want it to.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>YesÂ¿ NoÂ¿ MaybeÂ¿<br><br>[This message has been edited by lexelle (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harlow Scarlett and allzzzz....<br>hmm.....this is a long discussed topic for me and my friends.  Anyway, I agree with Tet.  In fact, I usually react the same way as her.<br><br>Whether its virtual or reality, I don't think I can draw a precise line betw them.  When you meet ppl you got to know online, its oredi bringing virtual into reality.  We have to make allowances to accomodate all sorts of ppl in our lives.  Dun take things too hard is an impt principle.  I will usually put my trust in most of the ppl I know and it will depend on whoever these ppl are to appreciate my trust.  If they choose to let me down, then bo bian loh.  At least I gave them a chance to be trusted.<br><br>1) Be alert<br><br>2) Be observant<br><br>3) Shut up when needed<br><br>4) Be understanding of ppl's faults coz all ppl are not perfect.<br><br>5) Be more impartial<br><br>6) Dun get too emotionally involved.<br><br>Well well.....these 6 points are a few points to remember.  They apply in real life too.  To me, though virtual life is riskier, it is more or less the same as real life.  Still some black sheeps around.  Plus all the white ones.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Maybe I will end up with many good friends but no best friends.  But its better than getting hit badly when ppl whom you consider as best friends hurt you.<br><br>Last thing...... give ppl chances.  Till they are hopeless, don't give up.  Ppl make mistakes (some big, some small)!!!!<br><br>And for those ppl who commit mistakes....... dun let ppl condemn you for life.  Dun just run away!  Dun try to be defensive but instead, try to compensate and improve yourself.  Move on after that. Bo bian if you lose some friends along the way.  Can't blame them coz they may not be as patient as others.  Theres a price to pay for making mistakes, I guess....<br><br>Hugzzzz......     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 28 April 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 28 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like so many other people I have also wondered why its so easy to run into so much trouble with things like IRC/ ICQ ( I assume that you are talking about those.)<br><br>In the virtual world, I think you take away a lot of the signs and indications that you would be able to judge a person or situation, that exists in real life, and evaluating people and events in real life is hard enough.<br><br>Obviously everyone has different abilities to separate an online existence from a real life one. Some do it better than others. But I think its increasingly difficult to do so, because this sort of communication is becoming part and parcel of life.<br><br>On the other hand, no matter how you choose to treat the people you meet online, they will be different as well. Some will be really nice people whom you can trust, others are hypocrites that don't deserve your friendship. That is why I think all those advice given are good.<br><br>Which brings me to my next point. Its fine to say that you have to be careful and not say too much and all that. But sometimes, you might be the one who is doing the things that you are trying to avoid e.g. betraying someone's friendship or leading someone on. A lot of the principles,ideals and rules that you adopt will be different from other people's. What you think is innocent will be spiteful or suggestive to the other party.<br><br>So what the heck am I saying? I guess I'm trying to say that other than watching other people, you must watch yourself. Don't be part of the problem. The anonymity of an online existence makes it very easy not to be responsible. The fact that you are just connected virtually makes it easy to dismiss your own mistake and not be accountable.<br><br>Please don't succumb to that.<br><br>Other than that, enjoy the convenience and fun that these communication tools bring. I know I have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hrmmmm.... interesting question after a short hiatus from the forums... kekeke<br><br>Actually, this has been an issue that has been bothering me since the day i started making friends online(ard 4 yrs ago)<br><br>Of course most of my early friendships had been with girls(tsk tsk tsk), partially due to the fact that:<br><br>1. Guys have absolutely no interest in making online frens with other guys &amp;<br><br>2. Fate has a hand in letting me get to know this wonderful people(u know who u are!)<br><br>I had constantly, buried and redug this issue out so many times that i am getting tired of it.<br><br>For me, this cyber existence always starts to hurt when i inexplicably find out that they draw a line between me and their real friends.<br><br>It hurts me bad to know that I dun figure much in their lives.<br><br>Anyway.... on a positive note, cyber reality is a place i know i can fall back on for a good laugh and most importantly, companionship and that insane madness that rules in the chatroom  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Doh!

Sometimes we are neglecting people who are just next to us while on the contrary we pay so much attention to those who are virtual, being the aunt agony and Uncle misery to them.
