            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..just to share my SUAY experience..<br>Exactly one year back, tht day was a black friday for me..<br>Early morning i went down to check on my car and i heard the sound of car alarm's "ringing"..Meaning santa claus has come to "visit" your car last nite.... Mycar was broken into...Don;t knoe wht to do..i called my sister(old bird)... when she came down from the house...she was shouting like mad...her car was one deck below mine and was also broken into...<br><br>B4 tht i had already made a police call and awaiting for their arrival. When my sister also made her phone call, the police was like laughing coz he knoe tht she was my sister .....and how could this happen to both of us since we were not even in the same deck where we parked our car. This is wht i call " You Nan Tong Dan, You Fu Tong Xiang".<br><br>Lucky, my car got nothing to steal and after making the report i continued with my exam revision for tht nite...as i was without my car, i got to take a taxi..so i waited for an hour and walked from people's park all the way to SGH and still no taxi.."luckily" my car was ready for collection and my sister collected it for me...but then the time was already 7pm where my exam already started.<br><br>I was speeding on the road all the way to Ngee Ann and as all of u knoe, tht is the peak period and i squeezed inbetween jam and managed to reach NP in 20mins.  That was the first time i was lated and everyone was concentrating on their paper.<br><br>When i saw the paper i was shocked....ARghghghghhggh...i spotted the wrong questions.........study so hard and spotted wrong......wht's a SUAY day....haiz..<br>Luckily it was all over....and thinking back..i do;t htink it actually SUAY lah..this is wht they call the "chain REaction" .."Lian Suo Fan Ying"...<br><br>Well, of course no one wanna knoe wht i got for my exam.  Let this be a lesson to me.. Don';t laugh when u hear a car alarm's sounded coz it could be YOUR CAR!!!!! ( Forget to tell i laughed at other pples' car b4 i realised mine was also broken inot..kekekke)<br><br>Jenny , are  u reading this?" Don;'t laugh ..It might be your car next time.....kekekekkekeke<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

In fact, I usually frown if its too prolong coz I am always either studying or sleeping.<br><br>O.kee......my car?  I dun think anyone wanna aim my car lah.  You know......few times, I either left the window open BIG BIG or left the car doors unlocked accidentally.  Still nothing happens......no one wanna even come near my car by the look of it wan.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  ITs too old and they think theres nothing they can find in there anyway.  Once, at great world, I actually left the keys hanging at the door and left for about two hours before i even realised that I misplaced my car keys.<br>I went back there and there the keys are, hanging by the door.  And....all the packages and bags (coz onlie brought wallets) are all untouched.  My friends told me off man coz their stuff were in the car too.  hehehehaaa.....<br><br>Its either I am damn lucky or those thieves just won't even take a second look at my old and usually dirty looking car.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Worse, my car no alarm one....... but got some other security locks lah......<br><br>O.k o.k......i will make it a point to check when I hear alarm sound again.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Smilezzz<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't be unhappy. life got it's ups and downs. there were times when i thought of just running away from it all, you know, taking a m16 and start shooting everyone in camp, so many things were going wrong for me then. but i was sorted out, by a few soothing words. look up to the sky and see the future. what it holds for you rewards you for your sufferring. nothing is smooth flowing, nothing comes without hard work, or some difficulty. that's the way life is. one day, you'll realise that life is beautiful afterall.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>I didn't come 10 million miles to turn back at the last 10 feet.....</div>
