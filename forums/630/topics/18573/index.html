Some can become really great pals who'd be there for you. Some will always know you inside out, your feelings, emotions, insecurites etc.<br><br>For me? If only I could find one. Yet, I'm scared of the emotional baggage that comes with it. I hate it when someone turns out to be someone I don't even know. To be let down or  turned away by a person whom you tot was clsoe to you, is not a very nice feeling.

            <div class='col-md body'>ERrrrrrrrrr..........big bird,<br>what you trying to say here?  sounds so scary.  aiyooooooooooo........<br><br>hmmm.......well, i have to agree wif you on the part that friends are everywhere.  Good friends who can click are difficult to find.  So, i guess we must learn how to treasure them.  Losing their trust is the last thing to do man.<br><br>Like i said before.  Everything we do contains some risk.  After many trials and errors, i have finally settled on my stand when it comes to this kinda thing.  i always choose to put my trust in ppl.  Its not that i trust ppl easily but its more of a direct 'painful' way to get to know a person's true colours, if any.  If that person choose to betray that trust i put in him or her, then too bad.  Life still goes on......alhough i will be sad lah.  i will wish whoever this is all the best....... but i am gonna stay away til a good explaination is given.<br><br>Big bird, dun be too afriad of all those emotional burdens. Yesh......  its sianz to always hear ppls' same old probs all the time but remember, if you are there for them, you can be sure that someone will be there for you when you need that 'shoulder'.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  For me, if i spot an emotional full of same old probs person, i will try to keep a distance as i am afriad i will not be able to help but will be kana affected and makes things worse instead.  ehehheheaa..... but if this person is oredi my friend, him or her can be sure that i will be there when time arises.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>O.keee....enough friendship philo lah.  You want anymore cheem cheem theories, i can bring you go borrow all those psycho books at the library lah....ehhehea...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take care everyone!!!!<br>*muakiesssss*</div>
