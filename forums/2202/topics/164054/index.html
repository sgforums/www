            <div class='col-md body'>*************************************************<br>EXPOSED: Stunning Moments in Liberal Hypocrisy<br><br>"The Book of the Century" -- Ann Coulter<br>*************************************************<br><br>Do As I Say (Not As I Do)<br>by Peter Schweizer<br><br>Hypocrisy has proven to be a wonderful weapon for liberals in their war against conservatives. When a pro-family politician gets caught cheating on his wife, or a conservative pundit turns out to have a bad habit or addiction, their enemies use the charge to good effect. Fair enough. But what happens when the spotlights are turned on liberals themselves? Do the supporters of progressive taxes, affirmative action, strict environmental safeguards, and unionized labor practice what they preach? In a word: NO.<br><br>"Do As I Say (Not As I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy" is Hoover Fellow Peter Schweizer's hard-hitting exposÃ© of the contradictions between the public stances and real-life behavior of prominent liberals like Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore, Al Franken, Ted Kennedy, Nancy Pelosi, Ralph Nader, Barbra Streisand, and many more.<br><br>Some of the shocking hypocrisy Peter Schweizer reveals:<br><br>* "I don't own a single share of stock," Michael Moore declares. No, his tax returns show he has owned hundreds of thousands -- profiting from some of the very companies (like Halliburton and Boeing) he viciously denounces<br><br>* Hillary Clinton supports the right of thirteen-year-old girls to have abortions without parental consent -- yet she forbade thirteen-year-old Chelsea to pierce her ears and enrolled her in a school that would not distribute condoms to minors<br><br>* The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel, ultra-left class warrior, defender of the inheritance tax -- and trust-fund heiress fought the IRS all the way to the Supreme Court to avoid paying $2 million in estate taxes<br><br>* During the 2004 campaign, John Kerry complained that the "super-rich" don't pay their fair share in taxes. Care to guess what percentage of their income Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry -- who are worth over $700 million -- are paying in taxes?<br><br>* Noam Chomsky opposes private property and calls the Pentagon "the most vile institution on the face of the earth" -- yet he has made millions in contract work for the Pentagon, owns two luxurious homes, and set up an irrevocable trust to protect his assets from Uncle Sam<br><br>* Ted Kennedy favors racial set-asides on federal contracts -- but when it came to his own investment in an entire city block of Washington, D.C., he got his political friends to help him waive an affirmative action set-aside<br><br>* Al Franken habitually calls conservatives "liars" and "mean and nasty" -- yet as a writer for "Saturday Night Live" he penned jokes and skits so mean-spirited they appalled even his colleagues, and he uses brazen lies for his bestselling books all the time<br><br>Schweizer makes it clear that when it comes to the things that matter most in our lives -- protection of family, property and privacy -- even the most outspoken liberals jettison their progressive ideas and adopt conservative principles. In short, he writes, "these do-as-I-say liberals don't trust their own ideas enough to apply them at home ... Which can only make one wonder: If their liberal prescriptions don't really work for them as individuals, how can they work for the rest of us?"<br><br><a href="http://www.wndbookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6832&amp;sour_cd=WNE000101" rel="nofollow">http://www.wndbookservice.com/products/BookPage.asp?prod_cd=c6832&amp;sour_cd=WNE000101</a><br></div>
