            <div class='col-md body'>While I am still confused over the time stamp thing, at least we can talk amicably now, which is good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am very sorry that i misunderstood. Anyway how u define smart? How can smart=stupid at the same time? Do u again like govt define smart=masters degree or PhD? Sometimes i really dont understand. Pls pardon me.<br></strong></blockquote>Well, my definition - smart can mean intellect on the positive side, on the negative side it would mean smart-alec.<br>Stupid, as you had previous said, can mean lacking of intellect, but it also can mean lacking in common sense. Lacking in intellect is a correctable condition, lacking in common sense, in most cases, is inborn. Kinda of like "buay tze tong"<br>When I said "smart people doing stupid things" I mean intelligent people who has no common sense or no regards with the surroundings. A good example may be a person with who has studied a lot but drives around disregarding the safety of others and crashing.<br>If I have been unclear, I am sorry.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Well u sounded like that. Sorry lah. I never said i was superior or inferior. There u go again. Then what is your definition of Christian? Must every Christian be like u or MC2, who said once somewhere that he has given up searching long ago &amp; he doesnt belong to any group. So what makes both of u?<br></strong></blockquote>Err... you did write this statement: "I already admitted that i dont have such good IQ &amp; reasoning power" and some other statements amounting to that. By that you are infering that you are inferior, or at least less superior than others.<br>I can't speak for MC. Myself? Nope I don't expect everyone to be like me. That would be really scary <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> My observation, from what you've written so far (including some of your earlier works) is that you tend to feel inferior when compared to others. I certainly hope this will not impede your growth (spiritual and mental). You want to make a guess as to what qualification I am? Go ahead take a shot.... I give you the answer the next time (or in a PM).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Where did i misquote or misuse the bible here? You have to give a point by point rebuttal of my verses &amp; explain to me what they mean. Also, there're many branches of theology but i am not talking abt theology here. I am not trying to prove got God or not bcos theology means study of God. I am into eschatology w/c is the study of last things or last days. So i think u miss it.<br><br>How to be objective when ppl call me dumb already in this thread's title? What happens if i call u dumb also? Wont u react also? I am sorry it's very unchristian to react but i have my own limits. Pls forgive me for flaring out.<br></strong></blockquote>Aiyoh, I where got say you misquote or misuse the Bible! I clearly stated that it is my personal conviction for the Bible NOT to be used this way. And I also stated clearly that I will not impose this view on others. Wah lau....<br><br>I am aware that your area of interest is eschatology, interestingly, it was one of my areas too (sometime in the past, I am into cults and urban legends nowadays). My point really is, it takes more than just having an interest in becoming a mod (again no offence intended). If it's of any comfort, I had also previous commented to another mod on how uneasy with him. Fortunately, I was wrong in that instance and he is a great mod.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I did NOT call you dumb, I said the rules were dumb. You need to separate the issues and don't mix the person and the article together</span>. It's dangerous for you and the contributors as well.<br>On being specific, it's in my training - my line of work, we are trained to be very very specific in our objectives, the objectives also has to be measurable and attainable. To me, your rules are not measurable and in some cases extremely vague. As an afterthought I should not have used the word dumb - that I apologise too.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am sorry i dont wish to draw boundaries. If i draw boundaries, i might sound too dogmatic or iron fisted or dictatorial. I will rather have conscensus as to what the boundary should be &amp; i will make the final decision. i am not your father u know. I cant say u must return home by 2359. I will rather let ppl come to a consensus. The only boundary is to stick to end time issues whether Christian or not. Thanks for your comments. Anyway boundaries can always be redrawn. I am not God or saddam hussein or hitler.<br></strong></blockquote>Boundaries help to determine how far and how much people can go. Otherwise the rules are useless and powerless. By having boundaries, I don't think it will be seen as ironfisted, I'd use the word FIRM. On the other hand, to state that something like "I will close threads when I see fit" shows that your decision is base on you state of mind at that point of time, or at your descretion. At the end of the day, you own the forum. The thing about consensus - it is a herd instinct thing. It is not an indicator that something is right or not. It only shows what is popular and what is not.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Ok. I will keep in mind. But there's bound to be conflicts with public no matter what. Ok sorry for that. I wasnt trying to be derogatory. If i sounded like i was, i am sorry for that.</strong></blockquote>Like I said, I am glad we are both mature individuals and can put the past behind....<br><br>.... though I am still darn confused over the time stamp thing.</div>
