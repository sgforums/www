EH will serve this purpose just as well. Perhaps it's because there are too many serious minded Christians there checking up on such topics and allegations???? So you can now mod your own postings???</div></blockquote>Yes, you make very valid comments. Thanks for these comments.<br><br>1) Regarding what is inflammatory or not, it is very subjective to diff ppl but the mod has the last say just like in EH.<br><br>2) Destructive comments are when ppl attack the person's brain faculties, way of reasoning, implying he has no brains when everyone should be given a chance to air his/her views, no matter how ridiculous. Yes, i agree it's a very thin line bcos each person has a certain limit of tolerance.<br><br>3) Sorry, but w/c forum is not iron fisted in a way? W/c govt or corporation or institution is not iron fisted in a way? Or for that matter w/c society, family or even social grps is not iron fisted in a way also? Yes, the point is different views are allowed here but pls dont go into fits of anger or tirades against opposing views. Or all out war might start here or anywhere else for that matter.<br><br>4) I just want to state my basic beliefs so that ppl posting here are prepared where i come from. As i said, this forum is titled "Apocalyptic Prophecies" &amp; Christians doesnt have the ONE &amp; ONLY view abt this. Even muslims, buddhists, taoists, atheists, agnostics, cultists, Moonies, JWs, Mormons, catholics etc etc have their views abt apocalpyse. Can any grp silence them so easily? Do i or u for this matter want to break the religious harmony laws by not allowing any dissenting views but proclaiming outright that my view or your view of Christianity apocalpyse IS the right way, &amp; the rest ALL wrong?<br><br>5) I WONT &amp; DONT START ANY LIBELS NOT HERE. How could i be responsible for any libellious statements made when I wasnt the author? Can u blame the mod for sgforums.com for any libellious comments made anywhere in this big forum? If so, i think they would have been sued already. Then where is freedom of speech or expression in the internet here? As i repeat, i wont tolerate any libel &amp; i wont hesitate to warn or delete such posts, so that i wont be responsible. Then my hands r clean.<br><br>6) As i said, i will only close or delete a thread when it's not very valid so i wont close yours here. I might not have your intelligence or way of reasoning but i respect your opinions. It's very valid anywhere in this sgforums.com forum. Yes the mod has fantastic powers regarding his own forum. I admit this.<br><br>7) Well, if u arent thinking of personal attacks, u shouldnt be fearful. Bcos laws r meant for those who try to break them. Thanks for your comments. I will improve myself as i go along. I welcome u to post here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Part of the upbringing of twenty years ago, check with your parents.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I put cap in paragraph to highlight/emphasize words. Check on any good books which needed to emphasize certain words.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I sound unfriendly and rude to you because I<strong> want </strong>to sound unfriendly and rude to you. It has nothing to do with the bolds or cap. Anyway I have never claim to be humble. I will openly admit that I am arrogant. That's one of my darker side. So let God deal with me on this one. Do you mind <strong>bolded</strong> letters.... suddenly I am afraid to offend you. How about <span style="font-style: italic;">Italized</span> ones, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined</span> emphasis. Or a combination <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>of all three</strong></span></span> Tell me which you prefer and I will stick to it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If I appear impatient to you, it's okay with me. You opinion really matters very little to me. I have also never claimed to be patient, it's others who said that I am very patient and I have stated on record that this observation is not an accurate observation. Actually I am a very impatient person.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can cap all you want, because it's your finger that's typing, not mine. Sure go ahead and copy my style, see if it bothers me.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> JTB heed my advice of not PUTTING ALL CAPS IN HIS NOTES. Actually, that advice did not come from me alone, so the observation is quite universal. Of course, there are others who think my style needed some correction, I will be happy to hear them. Coming from you? Nah!<br><br>You are missing the point of how to write notes and emails.<br><br>Email etiquette states that fully capping the entire note is liken to shouting, whether the shouting is intended or not. JTB's did not intend to shout. So he is able to understand where the others (and myself) are coming from. In any given paragraph, when the writer needs to emphasize a point, the writer can either bold, italized, underline or colorize a word or a phrase. As long as it is done in small dosage, it is ok.<br><br>The question marks??? Well if you read comics enough, you know that in any speech bubbles, multiple question marks emphasize the importance of the question or the high level of confusion.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Do you understand???????????????</strong></span></span><br><br>Let me help you understand that I am arrogant, impatient, and absolutely hate stupidity.

JTB's did not intend to shout. So he is able to understand where the others (and myself) are coming from. In any given paragraph, when the writer needs to emphasize a point, the writer can either bold, italized, underline or colorize a word or a phrase. As long as it is done in small dosage, it is ok.<br><br>The question marks???

Then why not u go to buddhist forum &amp; ask them not to quote from the buddhist scriptures or not to read their scriptures? Why also u dont question their acting out &amp; come attack me or other Christians here for our acting out? But i thank God that u remind us to act out what we preach but pls be reminded we are saved by God's grace &amp; no one is righteous, no not one, all have gone astray each to his own way. &amp; God looked from heaven to see who can be saved but no one! So it's His grace that i being a sinner was saved.

The problem is the short form "Prob" which you now claim to mean as "Probably" where I see that as a short form of "Problem". Here is why I absolute hate short form in write such notes. and my preference to us proper English spelling is why I write what I write. Of course, in retrospect, the sentence: "Problem you think the bible or God's word is stupid" may not sound grammatically correct - but hey, lots of people write with broken English here. I really really like to encourage people to write properly (even in SMS). There are proper short forms and then there are the others.
