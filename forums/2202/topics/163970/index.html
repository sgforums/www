            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>AS STRAWS IN THE WIND </strong></span><br><br>Dorothy A. Seese<br>November 18, 2005<br>NewsWithViews.com<br><br>As one bell upon another tolls for those of my generation, the generation that entered college in the early to mid 1950's with the future of the entire world in our hands, we know another one of us is missing from this life and has gone on to eternity. The movie stars of our youth, the broadcasters who shaped the minds of the next generation (for good or bad, as one's viewpoint dictates), the politicians without whom things would certainly crash about us ... gone from our sight. At one point some of these icons were the movers and shakers upon whose opinions and insights we directed our course. Or they were role models for the things we ourselves had to accomplish to carry out the great mission of ensuring that the world survives for more generations. What a heavy load to carry, what a noble cause for which to sacrifice. That was the mindset of my generation ... no one assigned these responsibilities to us, they "devolved" upon us as the youth, the future of the world. We inherited responsibilities and stood up to challenges.<br><br><strong>Looking at today's world, we obviously missed the whole point ... our responsibilities were a lot more limited, our spheres of influence were smaller than a city block and our passing is hardly cause for someone to say a half-hearted "oh too bad." </strong><br><br><strong>The world we didn't have in our charge and control is a sloppy mess filled with evil and violence. No, don't call us or any generation "the greatest" one of all, there is none such upon the earth filled with flawed men and women of hubris or hopelessness. </strong>We were just another generation, perhaps filled with more exuberance than the youths of the Great Depression who didn't know the way out, or <strong>who had to drop their dreams and pick up their shovels to eke out any kind of living.</strong> We lived in the most respected nation in the world, in 1952, <strong>but instead of making it greater we and our offspring (if any, I have none) have let the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new era scalawags and carpetbaggers run off with our taxes, our retirement, our medical care and the control of our government which was supposed to be a people's government. </span>Those of the baby-boomer generation who have positions of leadership are diluting our culture by leaving our borders open, and under the guise of giving us security have taken the liberties so many of my generation gladly handed over to prevent being discomforted by terrorism. </strong><br><br>Unbelievable? I wish this were a nightmare rather than the description of a page from today's scenario of life in the United States, Planet Earth.<br><br><strong>Some folks notice the past ten years have seen an advancing, accelerating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">decline in morality, educational "outcomes" (aka dumbed down kids), and a terrifying loss of personal liberty</span>.</strong> My grandparents owned a homestead south of Bisbee, Arizona, in 1905. <strong>They owned it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unconditionally. No property taxes. No limits on fencing their property against one set of heathen neighbors who wanted to use it to run their rustled cattle through to the site of re-branding.</span> Grandpa was a man other men feared. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He would protect his family and was expected to do so ... no explanation needed for shooting a malicious trespasser who would harm his wife and daughters.</span> People could even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">protect their property at gunpoint in those days.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Criminals weren't the poor victims in those days. Up was up, down was down, everyone understood "is" and while there were evil people around (and have been since the fall of Adam) there was frontier justice, swift and final.</span> </strong><br><br>Now people own everything conditionally, subject to paying taxes to the governments (local, state, federal) to be able to keep owning it, which isn't ownership at all. Property taxes, auto license lieu taxes, boat taxes, income taxes, death taxes, all manner of taxes make ownership conditional upon paying our own government tribute to allow us to live!<br><br>That isn't freedom, and few people ever give it a thought. And yes, I pay my property taxes to keep my condo and the auto lieu tax so my current tags let me drive where I need to go. <strong>I'm just mindful that my paid-for property isn't really mine as long as government has the right to set the tax rate and, if so inclined, set it so high I cannot keep my property. File that last statement for reference. </strong><br><br><strong>Few people "get it" that the government has no source of revenue other than what it extorts from the people by way of taxation and redistributes by entitlements so-called. Few people feel that licensing is a form of tax vehicle, not a source of order and protection. Now, with today's technology, it's a source of snooping as well! Oh yes, we need to catch all those terrorists who are just waiting for the right time to give us all bird flu. And it's probably some violation of "hate speech" law to suggest that the terrorism just may have its source at home rather than abroad. </strong><br><br>The Black Plague that hit Europe in the 14th century still has not been definitively identified as the bubonic. It supposedly was carried into Europe by Mongols who brought goods from the Orient to Europe, along with rats infested with infected fleas. However, the disease spread faster than the rats, so there's some question as to whether the virus/bacteria became airborne. We know it decimated Europe and everywhere else it hit, so that long before today's "sustainable earth" depopulation goals were formulated, depopulation occurred by war, pestilence and famine.<br><br>The Four Horsemen have been riding across the earth for centuries. Even without war, famine and pestilence, death comes to all, and few names survive the shifting sands of time. One Pythagoras, one Alexander, one Galileo, people whose contributions really do affect the way life is lived today.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">One Jesus Christ, Lord of All to those who believe in His redemptive work. </span></span></strong><br><br>Kingship is something ingrained in a human being's "need box" inside the spirit. Why? <strong>Because there is but one "King" and the earth has always rejected Him in favor of lesser gods and little petty kings. </strong>His own people rejected Him long before Christ was born, when Israel rejected the Judges, in the days of Samuel, and cried for a king. <strong>The problem is, people don't want a true king, they want a kindly father who will grant them all their wants and wishes, to which there is no visible end. </strong>They only cry to this father figure as a "god" when they want deliverance from danger and the evils of this world, and at that point where their spirits must leave this earth, allowing the body to return to dust and the soul to go forward to its destiny in eternity. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They have to make that trip alone, no human can accompany them. Coming into the world involves a mother, leaving it demands a father to meet them and guide them safely home. The problem is, few have met the correct "father" to do that job, but have relied on every manner of idol, statue, carving, human usurper of divine status, and humanly-devised government system that attempts to take the place of the True King. </span></strong><br><br>Recent natural disasters have proven the worthlessness of government to save us from the hurricanes, tornadoes that devastate in less than sixty seconds, storm surges that topple buildings, winds that snap trees like match sticks, snows that bury and floods that wash away our bodies like roadway debris. We're humans and we stand helpless before the power of nature's forces ... fire, earth/mud, wind and water.<br><br><strong>Crying to government for help is calling to equally helpless humans whose power exists only in being able to command the forces of force (the law and the military) to move the herds around. Their power looks good on the media, it looks useless in the face of something like a Category 4 or 5 hurricane or a 20-foot storm surge. Government? That's security? No, it's force ... in times when force can be exerted. </strong><br><br>We're straws in the wind, all of us. Seldom known to one another, we're all known to God. <strong>He has known us since before the foundation of this world. </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We do well to get that straight, because there is no other refuge or fortress, no other power, no other King with the ability to give life, resurrect the body and make all things new. Without that hope, life is a sad lottery of fools on fools' errands in a meaningless universe so large that we scarcely exist. </strong></span><br><br>Remembering that we are only straws in the wind, except for God's grace, is indeed the beginning of wisdom and the only worthwhile perspective that has a guaranteed future as well as strength for each day.<br><br><strong>Begin with humility, there is no other road to triumph.</strong><br><br>Â© 2005 Dorothy A.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Isaiah 9</strong><br><br>1 Nevertheless the gloom will not be upon her who is distressed, As when at first He lightly esteemed The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, And afterward more heavily oppressed her, By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, In Galilee of the Gentiles. 2 <strong>The people who walked in darkness Have seen a great light; Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, Upon them a light has shined. 3 You have multiplied the nation And increased its joy; F10 They rejoice before You According to the joy of harvest, As men rejoice when they divide the spoil. 4 For You have broken the yoke of his burden And the staff of his shoulder, The rod of his oppressor, As in the day of Midian. 5 For every warrior's sandal from the noisy battle, And garments rolled in blood, Will be used for burning and fuel of fire. 6 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of His government and peace There will be no end, Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, To order it and establish it with judgment and justice From that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. </span></strong>8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob, And it has fallen on Israel. 9 All the people will know-- Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria-- Who say in pride and arrogance of heart: 10 "The bricks have fallen down, But we will rebuild with hewn stones; The sycamores are cut down, But we will replace them with cedars." 11 Therefore the Lord shall set up The adversaries of Rezin against him, And spur his enemies on, 12 The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; And they shall devour Israel with an open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand is stretched out still. 13 <strong>For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, Nor do they seek the Lord of hosts. 14 Therefore the Lord will cut off head and tail from Israel, Palm branch and bulrush in one day. 15 The elder and honorable, he is the head; The prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail. 16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err, And those who are led by them are destroyed. 17 Therefore the Lord will have no joy in their young men, Nor have mercy on their fatherless and widows; For everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, And every mouth speaks folly. For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand is stretched out still. 18 For wickedness burns as the fire; It shall devour the briers and thorns, And kindle in the thickets of the forest; They shall mount up like rising smoke. 19 Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts The land is burned up, And the people shall be as fuel for the fire; No man shall spare his brother. 20 And he shall snatch on the right hand And be hungry; He shall devour on the left hand And not be satisfied; Every man shall eat the flesh of his own arm. 21 Manasseh shall devour Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; Together they shall be against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand is stretched out still. </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Isaiah 10</strong><br><br>1 <strong>"Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, Who write misfortune, Which they have prescribed 2 To rob the needy of justice, And to take what is right from the poor of My people, That widows may be their prey, And that they may rob the fatherless. 3 What will you do in the day of punishment, And in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory? 4 Without Me they shall bow down among the prisoners, And they shall fall among the slain." For all this His anger is not turned away, But His hand is stretched out still. </strong><br>5 "Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger And the staff in whose hand is My indignation. 6 I will send him against an ungodly nation, And against the people of My wrath I will give him charge, To seize the spoil, to take the prey, And to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 7 Yet he does not mean so, Nor does his heart think so; But it is in his heart to destroy, And cut off not a few nations. 8 For he says, 'Are not my princes altogether kings? 9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus? 10 <strong>As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, Whose carved images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria, 11 As I have done to Samaria and her idols, Shall I not do also to Jerusalem and her idols?' " 12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Lord has performed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, that He will say, "I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his haughty looks." </strong>13 <strong>For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, And by my wisdom, for I am prudent; Also I have removed the boundaries of the people, And have robbed their treasuries; So I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man. 14 My hand has found like a nest the riches of the people, And as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; And there was no one who moved his wing, Nor opened his mouth with even a peep." 15 Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Or shall the saw exalt itself against him who saws with it? As if a rod could wield itself against those who lift it up, Or as if a staff could lift up, as if it were not wood! 16 Therefore the Lord, the Lord F11 of hosts, Will send leanness among his fat ones; And under his glory He will kindle a burning Like the burning of a fire. 17 So the Light of Israel will be for a fire, And his Holy One for a flame; It will burn and devour His thorns and his briers in one day. 18 And it will consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, Both soul and body; And they will be as when a sick man wastes away. 19 Then the rest of the trees of his forest Will be so few in number That a child may write them. </strong><br>20 And it shall come to pass in that day That the remnant of Israel, And such as have escaped of the house of Jacob, Will never again depend on him who defeated them, <strong>But will depend on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. 21 The remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, To the Mighty God. 22 For though your people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, A remnant of them will return; The destruction decreed shall overflow with righteousness. 23 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the Lord God of hosts Will make a determined end In the midst of all the land. </span></strong><br>24 Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: "O My people, who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian. He shall strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, in the manner of Egypt. 25 <strong>For yet a very little while and the indignation will cease, as will My anger in their destruction." 26 And the Lord of hosts will stir up a scourge for him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; as His rod was on the sea, so will He lift it up in the manner of Egypt. 27 It shall come to pass in that day That his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.</strong> 28 He has come to Aiath, He has passed Migron; At Michmash he has attended to his equipment. 29 They have gone along the ridge, They have taken up lodging at Geba. Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled. 30 Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim! Cause it to be heard as far as Laish-- O poor Anathoth! F12 31 Madmenah has fled, The inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge. 32 <strong>As yet he will remain at Nob that day; He will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, The hill of Jerusalem. 33 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behold, the Lord, The Lord of hosts, Will lop off the bough with terror; Those of high stature will be hewn down, And the haughty will be humbled. 34 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, And Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One. </span></strong><br></div>

Pangs and sorrows will take hold of them; They will be in pain as a woman in childbirth; They will be amazed at one another; Their faces will be like flames. 9 <strong>Behold, the day of the Lord comes, Cruel, with both wrath and fierce anger, To lay the land desolate; And He will destroy its sinners from it. 10 For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not give their light; The sun will be darkened in its going forth, And the moon will not cause its light to shine. 11 "I will punish the world for its evil, And the wicked for their iniquity; I will halt the arrogance of the proud, And will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 12 I will make a mortal more rare than fine gold, A man more than the golden wedge of Ophir. 13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, And the earth will move out of her place, In the wrath of the Lord of hosts And in the day of His fierce anger. 14 It shall be as the hunted gazelle, And as a sheep that no man takes up; Every man will turn to his own people, And everyone will flee to his own land. 15 Everyone who is found will be thrust through, And everyone who is captured will fall by the sword. 16 Their children also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished.</strong> 17 "Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, Who will not regard silver; And as for gold, they will not delight in it. 18 Also their bows will dash the young men to pieces, And they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb; Their eye will not spare children.<br>19 <strong>And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, The beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 20 It will never be inhabited, Nor will it be settled from generation to generation; Nor will the Arabian pitch tents there, Nor will the shepherds make their sheepfolds there. 21 But wild beasts of the desert will lie there, And their houses will be full of owls; Ostriches will dwell there, And wild goats will caper there. 22 The hyenas will howl in their citadels, And jackals in their pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, And her days will not be prolonged." </strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Isaiah 14</strong><br><br><strong>1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will still choose Israel, and settle them in their own land. The strangers will be joined with them, and they will cling to the house of Jacob. </strong>2 Then people will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them for servants and maids in the land of the Lord; they will take them captive whose captives they were, and rule over their oppressors. <strong>3 It shall come to pass in the day the Lord gives you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear and the hard bondage in which you were made to serve,<br>4 that you will take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: "How the oppressor has ceased, The golden F16 city ceased! 5 The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of the rulers; 6 He who struck the people in wrath with a continual stroke, He who ruled the nations in anger, Is persecuted and no one hinders.</strong> 7 The whole earth is at rest and quiet; They break forth into singing. 8 Indeed the cypress trees rejoice over you, And the cedars of Lebanon, Saying, 'Since you were cut down, No woodsman has come up against us.' <span class="large"><strong>9 "Hell from beneath is excited about you, To meet you at your coming; It stirs up the dead for you, All the chief ones of the earth; It has raised up from their thrones All the kings of the nations. 10 They all shall speak and say to you: 'Have you also become as weak as we? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Have you become like us? 11 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, And the sound of your stringed instruments; The maggot is spread under you, And worms cover you.' 12 "How you are fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, F17 son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations! 13 For you have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.' 15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit. 16 "Those who see you will gaze at you, And consider you, saying: 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, 17 Who made the world as a wilderness And destroyed its cities, Who did not open the house of his prisoners?' 18 "All the kings of the nations, All of them, sleep in glory, Everyone in his own house; 19 But you are cast out of your grave Like an abominable branch, Like the garment of those who are slain, Thrust through with a sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit, Like a corpse trodden underfoot. 20 You will not be joined with them in burial, Because you have destroyed your land And slain your people. The brood of evildoers shall never be named. 21 Prepare slaughter for his children Because of the iniquity of their fathers, Lest they rise up and possess the land, And fill the face of the world with cities." 22 "For I will rise up against them," says the Lord of hosts, "And cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, And offspring and posterity," says the Lord. 23 "I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, And marshes of muddy water; I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," says the Lord of hosts.</span><br>24 The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought, so it shall come to pass, And as I have purposed, so it shall stand: 25 That I will break the Assyrian in My land, And on My mountains tread him underfoot. Then his yoke shall be removed from them, And his burden removed from their shoulders. 26 This is the purpose that is purposed against the whole earth, And this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations. 27 For the Lord of hosts has purposed, And who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, And who will turn it back?" 28 This is the burden which came in the year that King Ahaz died. 29 "Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia, Because the rod that struck you is broken; For out of the serpent's roots will come forth a viper, And its offspring will be a fiery flying serpent. 30 The firstborn of the poor will feed, And the needy will lie down in safety; I will kill your roots with famine, And it will slay your remnant. 31 Wail, O gate! Cry, O city! All you of Philistia are dissolved; For smoke will come from the north, And no one will be alone in his appointed times." 32 What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That the Lord has founded Zion, And the poor of His people shall take refuge in it.</strong> </span></div>
