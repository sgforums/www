            <div class='col-md body'>Is 2006 the year of the beginning of the end? Could some great thing be happening that will usher in the final Great Tribulation? Could Syria be destroyed? Could Gog &amp; Magog &amp; the middle east be embroiled in a big scale war where Israel will be outnumbered again but God will come to the rescue? Could true Christians have been raptured up already? Could the Antichrist then appear &amp; sign a peace treaty with Israel after God has destroyed the Gog/Magog armies? Could US have been nuked already?<br><br>2006: The definitive year. Even a secular Michael Drosnin in Bible Code 2 predicts 2006-the beginning of the end of days. Let's wait &amp; see as nobody knows the day nor hour so people could be wrong. Keep watch Christians for Jesus to come from heaven. Pray for the grace to escape all these things that r to come.

Bcos Jesus wasnt mentioned. Instead a Great Genius is mentioned. It's all New Age stuff. I have been there before. Reducing God to a Great Genius(prob advanced human being) &amp; communication with aliens? I wonder is the bible more ludicrious or is he more ludicrious? This is a setup man. Who are these beings or aliens? Satan can masquerade as an angel of light u know. So we have to be careful. If people can believe Nostradamus, they will have no prob believing the prophets of old in the bible. Cos they also saw angels, visions, heard voices, had dreams &amp; even John who saw Christ &amp; glory of God in heaven!</div>

Maybe you want to take a look:<br><br><blockquote>Somebody said that all the prophecies about Christ were fulfilled by Jesus.<br>- I wonder how He gambled over His clothes as He was nailed to the Cross.<br><br>Somebody said that while a double negative in the English language means a positive; there was no instance of a double positive expression in the English language that could mean a negative.<br>- Yeah, right. </blockquote>and<br><br><blockquote>You asked an honest question and are seeking clarification. Maybe you could restate your question, so it could be answered more clearly. Am I correct to assume that your question is whether or not man makes prophecies come to pass? If so, then the answer is yes in the sense that man is fulfilling God's plan. God has spoken in His word what will come to pass, and since God is sovreign (all powerfull, knowing, ever present) He forknew what man was going to do. Biblical prophecies are 100% accurate and Jesus alone fulfilled over 300 of them.<br>Other religions have no prophecies, they have mere conjectures. Satan can kind of take a good guess what man might do in any given situation, since he has observed us for so many years. Based upon those observations he makes predictions, which can be obtained by visiting psychics and other assorted flase prophets. Nostradamus comes to mind, who is highly regarded nowadays, but nevertheless was a false prophet. Also keep in mind that Satan knows God's word better than we do, so he gives his own little spin to some future events and the world goes AHH!<br>At the time of Jesus life here on earth, there was no general literacy and books were not readily available. As a matter of fact, there were no books, but scrolls and these were only accessible to the very rich and the religious elite. The last thing the Sanhedrin wanted to do was fulfill prophecy. By killing Jesus, they thought they had won the victory and silenced the dissenter. Instead, they had fullfilled Gods prophecies to the last jot and tittle. Read Isaiah 53, it was written long before the Lord Jesus came to this earth as a man. The Sanhedrin (religious rulers of Israel) Knew these scriptures, but failed to understand what they were reading. They were not of God, but of their father the devil, as Jesus accused them. I hope I answered at least part of your question. If I missed your point please let me know. God bless! </blockquote>and<br><br><blockquote>The answer to this question in the context meaning "could someone have set out to self fulfill prophecy" the answer would be no, too many years (100's to 1000's) are usually between each prophecy. The prophecy in Ezekiel 26 showing that Israel would once again come into the land was prophesied in Ezekiel and also in Jeremiah. These prophecies would have been made before the birth of Christ yet were fulfilled in 1948. Many prophetic events prophesied in the Bible are today coming true and I do believe that we are in the last days before the rapture, tribulation and then the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>If the context of "Self-Fulfilling" meaning is it fulfilling itself as stated, that answer would be a whole hearted yes. The Bible has withstood critics and criticism for many years yet has held its ground as complete "truth."</blockquote>If you have any doubts, you can go to other christians forums that have mature and friendly christians who can seriously and wisely comment on your doubts.<br><br>Regards  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

We have our faults but some ppl just too much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Bcos when we lose sight of Jesus' second coming, we lose focus on God &amp; live for ourselves. His 2nd coming is very impt to Christian doctrine &amp; faith. Bcos when a Christian has no hope of resurrection, he will live like a demon &amp; refuse to share gospel or love to others. Bcos all me, mine, myself first. Kiasuism &amp; kiasism. Bcos no 2nd coming what to them! No judgement. No hell. No heaven. No accountability for unsaved frens &amp; relatives. No God! Even Christ Jesus said in a parable abt certain servants who starts to get drunk &amp; beat up other servants bcos they thought the master isnt coming yet soon. So what did Jesus the Master say when He comes back to find these servants doing such things? Pls read for yourself in the gospel We know what happens.

So rebukes will happen but like what u say it's the tone that matters. Bcos i remember Aesop's fables abt persuasion is better than force. Bcos the harder (the wind) u force the more the man wont take off his coat.
