Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up" (1 Corinthians 8:1)<br><br></div></blockquote>I am sorry but u're quoting out of context. Pls read the chap again. 1 Cor 8:1-2: "NOW CONCERNING THINGS OFFERED TO IDOLS: WE KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE KNOWLEDGE. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know. etc..." This passage was talking abt Christians eating food offered to idols not abt end times! Some Christians say can, some say cannot &amp; there was a fight, like what's happening here &amp; elsewhere in Christendom.<br><br>So Paul was telling us not to fight over such trivial matters but to LOVE one another &amp; only love can edify or build up, &amp; not to tear down one another over trivial matters as food offered to idols. Even Jesus said it's not the food that goes into your stomach that defiles a man, but what he says with his mouth. For from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks &amp; our words defile us &amp; others.<br><br>Pls read the whole chapter yourself, w/c goes on to explain Paul's position. In fact read the whole of 1 Cor. to understand Paul's position on so many matters in the church of Corinth. Thank u. God bless you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.<br><br>Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.<br>(1 Corinthians 9:16-22)<br><br>What I mean is to clarify their doubts, be it christians or non-christians. If a christian's doubt is addressed, he would be wiser by your answer and with it he can clarify the same doubt to other people. If a non-christian's doubt is addressed, he would be more convinced by your answer and with it he can go on to explore new areas until he finally says to himself, it is sufficient.</div>
