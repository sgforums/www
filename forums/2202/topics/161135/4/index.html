            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by askxyz:</div><div class="quote_body">Paul said this:<br><br>Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.<br><br>Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.<br>(1 Corinthians 9:16-22)<br><br>What I mean is to clarify their doubts, be it christians or non-christians. If a christian's doubt is addressed, he would be wiser by your answer and with it he can clarify the same doubt to other people. If a non-christian's doubt is addressed, he would be more convinced by your answer and with it he can go on to explore new areas until he finally says to himself, it is sufficient.</div></blockquote>Yes, pls clarify doubts for all ppl here instead of hurling abuse or destructive comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John The Baptist:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, u're free to share your views abt the end times tribulation then if no pretrib rapture. I agree that there're other views like post trib or mid trib rapture. Perhaps u can share your views instead of dissecting our views.<br><br>If no pre trib rapture, then we might have to endure all the martyrdom &amp; beheading to remain faithful to Christ under the dictatorship of Antichrist. But is anyone of u ready here even if no pre trib rapture? Just a question like what Icemoon raised in EH-who wants to be a martyr? Of w/c i raised hand reluctantly bcos BH &amp; a few others raised their hands. Care to comment?</div></blockquote>Err... I have already stated, I DID NOT DISSECT the original thread or your views. So can we give the "dissecting" word a rest, please, at least for now.<br><br>I also did not state I do not believe in rapture. In reality, what I believe about what end times will be, is irrelevant to the topic.<br><br>I have stated all I needed to state on this topic:<br>1. Original question is as rrelevant as "when is the worst time to be save". (you may want to reread my earlier explanations)<br>2. Intention of the original question is to have fun (as can be found in the first post). I took this at face value, did not attempt to infer anything from it. HH was very clear with that and as I had said, I refuse to attempt to even read between the lines.<br>3. Thread will take another path is the original question is different. If it was the intention to talk about those who did not get raptured, the question has to be reworded. Eg: "Have you eaten?" is a different question from "What have you ate?" even though the two objects of the question are the same: you and food.<br><br>ONE MORE POINT: we are not talking about martyrdom. Either start a new thread or go back to EH, it is not necessary to introduce this here.<br><br>I repeat, everything I want to say on the topic (ie first post by HH) I have already said. I have nothing else to comment unless it is with regards to the points I have raised (which I believe is clear enough for anyone to understand).<br><br></div>
