Also ppl have diff characters. When two A types come tog, they clash. There must be a match of personalities. Similarly for those who r married or intends to get married, they better consider their personalities &amp; blood types. Some chars match but others dont &amp; there is no fix all! We have to try to be tolerant &amp; forgiving but sometimes harder said than done esp when others have hurt u very badly.<br><br>Pls help to report any abuses on this forum if u can when u're ard here by messaging my mailbox.

Can govt claim that 100% voted for them in all the constituecies? I think when that happens, it will be like saddam's Iraq or Kim's DPRK! Thanks for your comments bcos it's what i meant in my post. I never said i was right &amp; since this is my forum in a way, i have the last say to what ppl comment here.<br><br>Sometimes democracy doesnt work so the president of USA had to veto congress or senate. Same as UN security council. Did USA consult UN's vote against war on Iraq? Did USA go against UN security council's wishes? Can any of the 5 major security members who has veto power not veto anything that is against their country or interests? Pls think abt this.<br><br>As i said boycott or strikes or riots can be done outside this forum but in here, pls consider the viewpts &amp; sensitivities of others who might not agree with u.

But typing all these might also help some ppl who read to warn them just in case. Anyway, anything done for God is not wasted bcos He keeps a record book in heaven of all we have done &amp; bottles up all our tears. Heaven is eternal whereas earth is temporal.</div>

It's up to God to bother. Nobody can do convincing if God doesnt give the grace to understand by His Holy Spirit, so the prob doesnt lie with humans anyway. &amp; certainly God wont give probs except to help us thru the probs we face. So who gives the most problems? The devil &amp; his demons of course.<br><br>What did Jesus say on the cross? He said "Father pls forgive them bcos they do not know what they are doing." So how come these ppl dont know what they're doing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
