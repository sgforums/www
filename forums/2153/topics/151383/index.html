            <div class='col-md body'>Part 1 of 11<br><br>14 Aug 2005<br>The Boston Globe<br><br>What Makes People Gay?<br><br>The debate has always been that it was either all in the child's<br>upbringing or all in the genes. But what if it's something else?<br><br>By Neil Swidey | August 14, 2005<br><br>With crystal-blue eyes, wavy hair, and freshly scrubbed faces, the boys<br>look as though they stepped out of a Pottery Barn Kids catalog. They<br>are 7-year-old twins. I'll call them Thomas and Patrick; their parents<br>agreed to let me meet the boys as long as I didn't use their real<br>names.<br><br>Spend five seconds with them, and there can be no doubt that they are<br>identical twins - so identical even they can't tell each other apart in<br>photographs. Spend five minutes with them, and their profound<br>differences begin to emerge.<br><br>Patrick is social, thoughtful, attentive. He repeatedly addresses me by<br>name. Thomas is physical, spontaneous, a bit distracted. Just minutes<br>after meeting me outside a coffee shop, he punches me in the upper arm,<br>yells, "Gray punch buggy!" and then points to a Volkswagen Beetle<br>cruising past us. It's a hard punch. They horse around like typical<br>brothers, but Patrick's punches are less forceful and his voice is<br>higher. Thomas charges at his brother, arms flexed in front of him like<br>a mini-bodybuilder. The differences are subtle - they're 7-year-old<br>boys, after all - but they are there.<br><br>When the twins were 2, Patrick found his mother's shoes. He liked<br>wearing them. Thomas tried on his father's once but didn't see the<br>point.<br><br>When they were 3, Thomas blurted out that toy guns were his favorite<br>things. Patrick piped up that his were the Barbie dolls he discovered<br>at day care.<br><br>When the twins were 5, Thomas announced he was going to be a monster<br>for Halloween. Patrick said he was going to be a princess. Thomas said<br>he couldn't do that, because other kids would laugh at him. Patrick<br>seemed puzzled. "Then I'll be Batman," he said.<br><br>Their mother - intelligent, warm, and open-minded - found herself<br>conflicted. She wanted Patrick - whose playmates have always been<br>girls, never boys - to be himself, but she worried his feminine<br>behavior would expose him to ridicule and pain. She decided to allow<br>him free expression at home while setting some limits in public.<br><br>That worked until last year, when a school official called to say<br>Patrick was making his classmates uncomfortable. He kept insisting that<br>he was a girl.<br><br>Patrick exhibits behavior called childhood gender nonconformity, or<br>CGN. This doesn't describe a boy who has a doll somewhere in his toy<br>collection or tried on his sister's Snow White outfit once, but rather<br>one who consistently exhibits a host of strongly feminine traits and<br>interests while avoiding boy-typical behavior like rough-and-tumble<br>play. There's been considerable research into this phenomenon,<br>particularly in males, including a study that followed boys from an<br>early age into early adulthood. The data suggest there is a very good<br>chance Patrick will grow up to be homosexual. Not all homosexual men<br>show this extremely feminine behavior as young boys. But the research<br>indicates that, of the boys who do exhibit CGN, about 75 percent of<br>them - perhaps more - turn out to be gay or bisexual.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 2 of 11 --What makes the case of Patrick and Thomas so fascinating<br>is that it calls into question both of the dominant theories in the<br>long-running debate over what makes people gay: nature or nurture,<br>genes or learned behavior. As identical twins, Patrick and Thomas began<br>as genetic clones. From the moment they came out of their mother's<br>womb, their environment was about as close to identical as possible -<br>being fed, changed, and plopped into their car seats the same way,<br>having similar relationships with the same nurturing father and mother.<br>Yet before either boy could talk, one showed highly feminine traits<br>while the other appeared to be "all boy," as the moms at the<br>playgrounds say with apologetic shrugs.<br><br>"That my sons were different the second they were born, there is no<br>question about it," says the twins' mother.<br><br>So what happened between their identical genetic starting point and<br>their births? They spent nine months in utero. In the hunt for what<br>causes people to be gay or straight, that's now the most interesting<br>and potentially enlightening frontier.<br><br>WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHERE HOMOSEXUALITY COMES FROM? Proving people are<br>born gay would give them wider social acceptance and better protection<br>against discrimination, many gay rights advocates argue. In the last<br>decade, as this "biological" argument has gained momentum, polls find<br>Americans - especially young adults - increasingly tolerant of gays and<br>lesbians. And that's exactly what has groups opposed to homosexuality<br>so concerned. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian<br>think tank in Washington, D.C., argues in its book Getting It Straight<br>that finding people are born gay "would advance the idea that sexual<br>orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals,<br>like African-Americans, should be legally protected against<br>'discrimination;' and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as<br>socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true."<br><br>Some advocates of gay marriage argue that proving sexual orientation is<br>inborn would make it easier to frame the debate as simply a matter of<br>civil rights. That could be true, but then again, freedom of religion<br>enjoyed federal protection long before inborn traits like race and sex.<br><br>For much of the 20th century, the dominant thinking connected<br>homosexuality to upbringing. Freud, for instance, speculated that<br>overprotective mothers and distant fathers helped make boys gay. It<br>took the American Psychiatric Association until 1973 to remove<br>"homosexuality" from its manual of mental disorders.<br><br>Then, in 1991, a neuroscientist in San Diego named Simon LeVay told the<br>world he had found a key difference between the brains of homosexual<br>and heterosexual men he studied. LeVay showed that a tiny clump of<br>neurons of the anterior hypothalamus - which is believed to control<br>sexual behavior - was, on average, more than twice the size in<br>heterosexual men as in homosexual men. LeVay's findings did not speak<br>directly to the nature-vs.-nurture debate - the clumps could,<br>theoretically, have changed size because of homosexual behavior. But<br>that seemed unlikely, and the study ended up jump-starting the effort<br>to prove a biological basis for homosexuality.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 3 of 11 --Later that same year, Boston University psychiatrist<br>Richard Pillard and Northwestern University psychologist J. Michael<br>Bailey announced the results of their study of male twins. They found<br>that, in identical twins, if one twin was gay, the other had about a 50<br>percent chance of also being gay. For fraternal twins, the rate was<br>about 20 percent. Because identical twins share their entire genetic<br>makeup while fraternal twins share about half, genes were believed to<br>explain the difference. Most reputable studies find the rate of<br>homosexuality in the general population to be 2 to 4 percent, rather<br>than the popular "1 in 10" estimate.<br><br>In 1993 came the biggest news: Dean Hamer's discovery of the "gay<br>gene." In fact, Hamer, a Harvard-trained researcher at the National<br>Cancer Institute, hadn't quite put it that boldly or imprecisely. He<br>found that gay brothers shared a specific region of the X chromosome,<br>called Xq28, at a higher rate than gay men shared with their straight<br>brothers. Hamer and others suggested this finding would eventually<br>transform our understanding of sexual orientation.<br><br>That hasn't happened yet. But the clear focus of sexual-orientation<br>research has shifted to biological causes, and there hasn't been much<br>science produced to support the old theories tying homosexuality to<br>upbringing. Freud may have been seeing the effect rather than the<br>cause, since a father faced with a very feminine son might well become<br>more distant or hostile, leading the boy's mother to become more<br>protective. In recent years, researchers who suspect that homosexuality<br>is inborn - whether because of genetics or events happening in the womb<br>- have looked everywhere for clues: Prenatal hormones. Birth order.<br>Finger length. Fingerprints. Stress. Sweat. Eye blinks. Spatial<br>relations. Hearing. Handedness. Even "gay" sheep.<br><br>LeVay, who is gay, says that when he published his study 14 years ago,<br>some gays and lesbians criticized him for doing research that might<br>lead to homosexuality once again being lumped in with diseases and<br>disorders. "If anything, the reverse has happened," says LeVay, who is<br>now 61 and no longer active in the lab. He says the hunt for a<br>biological basis for homosexuality, which involves many researchers who<br>are themselves gay or lesbian, "has contributed to the status of gay<br>people in society."<br><br>These studies have been small and underfunded, and the results have<br>often been modest. Still, because there's been so much of this<br>disparate research, "all sort of pointing in the same direction, makes<br>it pretty clear there are biological processes significantly<br>influencing sexual orientation,"; says LeVay. "But it's also kind of<br>frustrating that it's still a bunch of hints, that nothing is really as<br>crystal clear as you would like."<br><br>Just in the last few months, though, the hints have grown stronger.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 4 of 11 --In May, Swedish researchers reported finding important<br>differences in how the brains of straight men and gay men responded to<br>two compounds suspected of being pheromones - those scent-related<br>chemicals that are key to sexual arousal in animals. The first compound<br>came from women's urine, the second from male sweat. Brain scans showed<br>that when straight men smelled the female urine compound, their<br>hypothalamus lit up. That didn't happen with gay men. Instead, their<br>hypothalamus lit up when they smelled the male-sweat compound, which<br>was the same way straight women had responded. This research once again<br>connecting the hypothalamus to sexual orientation comes on the heels of<br>work with sheep. About 8 percent of domestic rams are exclusively<br>interested in sex with other rams. Researchers found that a clump of<br>neurons similar to the one LeVay identified in human brains was also<br>smaller in gay rams than straight ones. (Again, it's conceivable that<br>these differences could be showing effect rather than cause.)<br><br>In June, scientists in Vienna announced that they had isolated a master<br>genetic switch for sexual orientation in the fruit fly. Once they<br>flicked the switch, the genetically altered female flies rebuffed<br>overtures from males and instead attempted to mate with other females,<br>adopting the elaborate courting dance and mating songs that males use.<br><br>And now, a large-scale, five-year genetic study of gay brothers is<br>underway in North America. The study received $2.5 million from the<br>National Institutes of Health, which is unusual. Government funders<br>tend to steer clear of sexual orientation research, aware that even<br>small grants are apt to be met with outrage from conservative<br>congressmen looking to make the most of their C-Span face time. Relying<br>on a robust sample of 1,000 gay-brother pairs and the latest<br>advancements in genetic screening, this study promises to bring some<br>clarity to the murky area of what role genes may play in homosexuality.<br><br>This accumulating biological evidence, combined with the prospect of<br>more on the horizon, is having an effect. Last month, the Rev. Rob<br>Schenck, a prominent Washington, D.C., evangelical leader, told a large<br>gathering of young evangelicals that he believes homosexuality is not a<br>choice but rather a predisposition, something "deeply rooted" in<br>people. Schenck told me that his conversion came about after he'd<br>spoken extensively with genetic researchers and psychologists. He<br>argues that evangelicals should continue to oppose homosexual behavior,<br>but that "many evangelicals are living in a sort of state of denial<br>about the advance of this conversation." His message: "If it's<br>inevitable that this scientific evidence is coming, we have to be<br>prepared with a loving response. If we don't have one, we won't have<br>any credibility.";<br><br>AS THE 21-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE JUNIOR IN A HOSPITAL JOHNNY slides into the<br>MRI, she is handed controls with buttons for "strongly like" and<br>"strongly dislike." Hundreds of pornographic images - in male-male and<br>female-female pairings - flash before her eyes. Eroticism eventually<br>gives way to monotony, and it's hard to avoid looking for details to<br>distinguish one image from the rest of the panting pack. So it goes<br>from "Look at the size of those #%$%$^s!" to "That can't be<br>comfortable, given the length of her fingernails!"; to "Why is that guy<br>wearing nothing but work boots on the beach?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 5 of 11 --Regardless of which buttons the student presses, the MRI<br>scans show her arousal level to each image, at its starting point in<br>the brain.<br><br>Researchers at Northwestern University, outside Chicago, are doing this<br>work as a follow-up to their studies of arousal using genital<br>measurement tools. They found that while straight men were aroused by<br>film clips of two women having sex, and gay men were aroused by clips<br>of two men having sex, most of the men who identified themselves as<br>bisexual showed gay arousal patterns. More surprising was just how<br>different the story with women turned out to be. Most women, whether<br>they identified as straight, lesbian, or bisexual, were significantly<br>aroused by straight, gay, and lesbian sex. "I'm not suggesting that<br>most women are bisexual," says Michael Bailey, the psychology professor<br>whose lab conducted the studies. "I'm suggesting that whatever a<br>woman's sexual arousal pattern is, it has little to do with her sexual<br>orientation."; That's fundamentally different from men. "In men, arousal<br>is orientation. It's as simple as that. That's how gay men learn they<br>are gay."<br><br>These studies mark a return to basics for the 47-year-old Bailey. He<br>says researchers need a far deeper understanding of what sexual<br>orientation is before they can determine where it comes from.<br><br>Female sexual orientation is particularly foggy, he says, because<br>there's been so little research done. As for male sexual orientation,<br>he argues that there's now enough evidence to suggest it is "entirely<br>in-born," though not nearly enough to establish how that happens.<br><br>Bailey's 1991 twin study is still cited by other researchers as one of<br>the pillars in the genetic argument for homosexuality. But his<br>follow-up study using a comprehensive registry of twins in Australia<br>found a much lower rate of similarity in sexual orientation between<br>identical twins, about 20 percent, down from 50 percent. Bailey still<br>believes that genes make important contributions to sexual orientation.<br>But, he says, "that's not where I'd bet the real breakthroughs will<br>come."<br><br>His hunch is that further study of childhood gender nonconformity will<br>pay big. Because it's unclear what percentage of homosexuals and<br>lesbians showed CGN as children, Bailey and his colleagues are now<br>running a study that uses adult participants' home movies from<br>childhood to look for signs of gender-bending behavior.<br><br>Cornell psychologist Daryl Bem has proposed an intriguing theory for<br>how CGN might lead to homosexuality. According to this pathway, which<br>he calls "the exotic becomes erotic," children are born with traits for<br>temperament, such as aggression and activity level, that predispose<br>them to male-typical or female-typical activities. They seek out<br>playmates with the same interests. So a boy whose traits lead him to<br>hopscotch and away from rough play will feel different from, and<br>ostracized by, other boys. This leads to physiological arousal of fear<br>and anger in their presence, arousal that eventually is transformed<br>from exotic to erotic.<br></div>

BECAUSE IT'S UNCLEAR why twin<br>brothers with identical genetic starting points and similar post-birth<br>environments would take such divergent paths, it's helpful to return to<br>the beginning.<br><br>Males and females have a fundamental genetic difference - females have<br>two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y. Still, right after<br>conception, it's hard to tell male and female zygotes apart, except for<br>that tucked-away chromosomal difference. Normally, the changes take<br>shape at a key point of fetal development, when the male brain is<br>masculinized by sex hormones. The female brain is the default. The<br>brain will stay on the female path as long as it is protected from<br>exposure to hormones. The hormonal theory of homosexuality holds that,<br>just as exposure to circulating sex hormones determines whether a fetus<br>will be male or female, such exposure must also influence sexual<br>orientation.<br><br>The cases of children born with disorders of "sexual differentiation"<br>offer insight. William Reiner, a psychiatrist and urologist with the<br>University of Oklahoma, has evaluated more than a hundred of these<br>cases. For decades, the standard medical response to boys born with<br>severely inadequate penises (or none at all) was to castrate the boy<br>and have his parents raise him as a girl. But Reiner has found that<br>nurture - even when it involves surgery soon after birth - cannot trump<br>nature. Of the boys with inadequate penises who were raised as girls,<br>he says, "I haven't found one who is sexually attracted to males." The<br>majority of them have transitioned back to being males and report being<br>attracted to females.<br><br>During fetal development, sexual identity is set before the sexual<br>organs are formed, Reiner says. Perhaps it's the same for sexual<br>orientation. In his research, of all the babies with X and Y<br>chromosomes who were raised as girls, the only ones he has found who<br>report having female identities and being attracted to males are those<br>who did not have "receptors" to let the male sex hormones do their<br>masculinizing in the womb.<br><br>What does this all mean? "Exposure to male hormones in utero<br>dramatically raises the chances of being sexually attracted to<br>females," Reiner says. "We can infer that the absence of male hormone<br>exposure may have something to do with attraction to males."<br></div>

Bailey and Reiner say the<br>answer is probably not as simple as just exposure to sex hormones.<br>After all, the exposure levels in some of the people Reiner studies are<br>abnormal enough to produce huge differences in sexual organs. Yet,<br>sexual organs in straight and gay people are, on average, the same.<br>More likely, hormones are interacting with other factors.<br><br>Canadian researchers have consistently documented a "big-brother<br>effect," finding that the chances of a boy being gay increase with each<br>additional older brother he has. (Birth order does not appear to play a<br>role with lesbians.) So, a male with three older brothers is three<br>times more likely to be gay than one with no older brothers, though<br>there's still a better than 90 percent chance he will be straight. They<br>argue that this results from a complex interaction involving hormones,<br>antigens, and the mother's immune system.<br><br>By now, there is substantial evidence showing correlation - though not<br>causation - between sexual orientation and traits that are set when a<br>baby is in the womb. Take finger length. In general, men have shorter<br>index fingers in relation to their ring fingers; in women, the lengths<br>are generally about the same.

This stress might have been based on his<br>position in the womb or the blood flow to him or any of a number of<br>other factors not in his mother's control. Yet more evidence that<br>identical twins have womb experiences far from identical can be found<br>in their often differing birth weights. Patrick was born a pound<br>lighter than Thomas.<br><br>Taken together, the research suggests that early on in the womb, as the<br>fetus's brain develops in either the male or female direction,<br>something fundamental to sexual orientation is happening. Nobody's sure<br>what's causing it. But here's where genes may be involved, perhaps by<br>regulating hormone exposure or by dictating the size of that key clump<br>of neurons in the hypothalamus. Before researchers can sort that out,<br>they'll need to return to the question of whether, in fact, there is a<br>"gay gene."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Page 9 of 11 --There is, however, a towering question that Sanders's<br>study will probably not be able to answer. That has to do with<br>evolution. If a prime motivation of all species is to pass genes on to<br>future generations, and gay men are estimated to produce 80 percent<br>fewer offspring than straight men, why would a gay gene not have been<br>wiped out by the forces of natural selection? This evolutionary<br>disadvantage is what led former Amherst College biologist Paul Ewald to<br>argue that homosexuality might be caused by a virus - a pathogen most<br>likely working in utero. That argument caused a stir when he and a<br>colleague proposed it six years ago, but with no research done to test<br>it, it remains just another theory. Other scientists have offered<br>fascinating but unpersuasive explanations, most of them focusing on<br>some kind of compensatory benefit, in the same way that the gene<br>responsible for sickle cell anemia also protects against malaria. A<br>study last year by researchers in Italy showed that female relatives of<br>gay men tended to be more fertile, though, as critics point out, not<br>nearly fertile enough to make up for the gay man's lack of offspring.<br><br>But there will be plenty of time for sorting out the evolutionary<br>paradox once - and if - researchers are able to identify actual genes<br>involved in sexual orientation. Getting to that point will likely<br>require integrating multiple lines of promising research. That is<br>exactly what's happening in Eric Vilain's lab at the University of<br>California, Los Angeles. Vilain, an associate professor of human<br>genetics, and his colleague, Sven Bocklandt, are using gay sheep,<br>transgenic mice, identical twin humans, and novel approaches to human<br>genetics to try to unlock the mystery of sexual orientation.<br><br>Instead of looking for a gay gene, they stress that they are looking<br>for several genes that cause either attraction to men or attraction to<br>women. Those same genes would work one way in heterosexual women and<br>another way in homosexual men. The UCLA lab is examining how these<br>genes might be turned "up" or "down." It's not a question of what genes<br>you have, but rather which ones you use, says Bocklandt. "I have the<br>genes in my body to make a vagina and carry a baby, but I don't use<br>them, because I am a man." In studying the genes of gay sheep, for<br>example, he's found some that are turned "way up" compared with the<br>straight rams.<br><br>The lab is also testing an intriguing theory involving imprinted genes.<br>Normally, we have two copies of every gene, one from each parent, and<br>both copies work. They're identical, so it doesn't matter which copy<br>comes from which parent. But with imprinted genes, that does matter.<br>Although both copies are physically there, one copy - either from the<br>mom or the dad - is blocked from working. Think of an airplane with an<br>engine on each wing, except one of the engines is shut down. A recent<br>Duke University study suggests humans have hundreds of imprinted genes,<br>including one on the X chromosome that previous research has tied to<br>sexual orientation.<br></div>

So if<br>there's something atypical in the copy from mom, the copy from dad<br>cannot be turned on. The UCLA lab is now collecting DNA from identical<br>twins in which one twin is straight and the other is gay. Because the<br>twins begin as genetic clones, if a gene is imprinted in one twin, it<br>will be in the other twin as well. Normally, as the fetuses are<br>developing, each time a cell divides, the DNA separates and makes a<br>copy of itself, replicating all kinds of genetic information. It's a<br>complicated but incredibly accurate process. But the coding to keep the<br>backup engine shut down on an imprinted gene is less accurate.<br><br>So how might imprinted genes help explain why one identical twin would<br>be straight and the other gay? Say there's an imprinted gene for<br>attraction to females, and there's something atypical in the copy the<br>twin brothers get from mom. As all that replicating is going on, the<br>imprinting (to keep the copy from dad shut down) proceeds as expected<br>in one twin, and he ends up gay. But somehow with his brother, the<br>coding for the imprinting is lost, and rather than remain shut down,<br>the fuel flows to fire up the backup engine from dad. And that twin<br>turns out to be straight.<br><br>IN THE COURSE OF REPORTING THIS STORY, I EXPERIENCED A good deal of<br>whiplash. Just when I would become swayed by the evidence supporting<br>one discreet theory, I would stumble onto new evidence casting some<br>doubt on it. Ultimately, I accepted this as unavoidable terrain in the<br>hunt for the basis of sexual orientation. This is, after all, a<br>research field built on underfunded, idiosyncratic studies that are met<br>with full-barreled responses from opposing and well-funded advocacy<br>groups determined to make the results from the lab hew to the scripts<br>they've honed for the talk-show circuit.<br><br>You can't really blame the advocacy groups. The stakes are high. In the<br>end, homosexuality remains such a divisive issue that only thoroughly<br>tested research will get society to accept what science has to say<br>about its origin. Critics of funding for sexual orientation research<br>say that it isn't curing cancer, and they're right. But we devote a lot<br>more dollars to studying other issues that aren't curing cancer and<br>have less resonance in society.<br><br>Still, no matter how imperfect these studies are, when you put them all<br>together and examine them closely, the message is clear: While<br>post-birth development may well play a supporting role, the roots of<br>homosexuality, at least in men, appear to be in place by the time a<br>child is born. After spending years sifting through all the available<br>data, British researchers Glenn Wilson and Qazi Rahman come to an even<br>bolder conclusion in their forthcoming book Born Gay: The Psychobiology<br>of Sex Orientation, in which they write: "Sexual orientation is<br>something we are born with and not `acquired' from our social<br>environment.";<br></div>
