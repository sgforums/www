            <div class='col-md body'>San Francisco, California, the gay capital of the world has seen a huge movement (finally) in legalising gay marriage.. Let's wait to see whether this will be passed as state law..<br><br><strong>07 Sept 2005<br>The New York Times<br>Same Sex Marriage Wins Vote in California</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6 - California lawmakers on Tuesday became the first in the country to legalize same-sex marriage, with the State Assembly narrowly approving a bill that defines marriage as between "two persons" instead of between a man and a woman.<br><br>Unlike Massachusetts, where gay men and lesbians are permitted to marry because of court rulings, the legislators in California voted to amend the state's family code without the threat of legal action.<br><br>"Do what we know is in our hearts," Assemblyman Mark Leno, an openly gay Democrat from San Francisco who sponsored the bill, said Tuesday night in a debate on the bill. "Make sure all Californians, all California's children and families, will have equal protection under the law."<br><br>Opponents of the measure warned that lawmakers were venturing into uncharted and potentially dangerous territory.<br><br>"Engaging in social experimentation with our children is not the role of the legislature," said Assemblyman Ray Haynes, a Republican from Southern California. "We are throwing the dice and taking a huge gamble, and we are gambling with the lives and future of generations not yet born."<br><br>The measure now goes to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, who has supported domestic partnership legislation in the past but has not taken a public position on the marriage bill.<br><br>A spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzenegger, Margita Thompson, said after the vote that the governor believed that the issue of same-sex marriage should be settled by the courts, not legislators, but she did not indicate whether that meant he would veto the legislation. The bill did not pass with enough votes to override a veto.<br><br>"The governor will uphold whatever the court decides," Ms. Thompson said.<br><br>Californians voted overwhelmingly in 2000 for a ballot measure, Proposition 22, that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, but the legality of that law is now being fought over in the courts.<br><br>In a case stemming from a decision last year by Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco to allow gay men and lesbians to marry, a San Francisco Superior Court judge ruled that the state law was unconstitutional but the ruling is being appealed.<br><br>The 41-to-35 vote in the 80-member Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, was along party lines, with no Republicans supporting the bill.<br><br>It follows a similar lopsided partisan vote last week in the State Senate, which approved it by the smallest possible margin.<br><br>Assemblyman Leno, among six openly gay lawmakers in Sacramento, revived the bill through a controversial parliamentary maneuver known as "gut and amend" after the bill failed to pass the Assembly in June.<br><br>Mr. Leno essentially inserted the marriage bill's contents into another bill regarding marine fisheries that was pending in the Senate and stripped of its content. When the bill passed the Senate, Mr. Leno and his allies then persuaded three Democratic members of the Assembly who had abstained in June to vote for the new version.<br><br>One of them, Thomas J. Umberg of Anaheim, said during the debate Tuesday that he had been "cajoled, harassed, harangued and threatened" by both sides of the issue, but ultimately decided to support the measure because of his children.<br><br>"This is one of those times when history looks upon us to be in the lead," Mr. Umberg said. "The constituency I'm concerned about is a very small one, that is the constituency of my three children should they decide to look back on my record."<br><br>But several Republicans derided the parliamentary maneuver to resuscitate the bill and said Democrats who represented districts where voters approved Proposition 22 had no moral authority to subvert that vote.<br><br>"We damage the moral fabric of our society, that's what's damaged here," said Assemblyman Dennis L. Mountjoy, a Republican from Southern California.<br><br>Assemblyman Jay La Suer, a San Diego Republican, chided his colleagues for sending the wrong message about same-sex marriage, saying that no matter "how you candy coat it," it is wrong.<br><br>"You are not leading, you have gone astray," Mr. La Suer said. "History will record that you betrayed your constituents, and their moral and ethical values." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The same piece of news reported in Los Angeles Times..<br><br><strong>07 Sept 2005<br>Los Angeles Times<br>Legislature OKs Gay Marriage<br>By Nancy Vogel, Times Staff Writer</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">SACRAMENTO Â— The California Legislature made history Tuesday as the Assembly passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.<br><br>With no votes to spare, California's lawmakers became the first in the United States to act without a court order to sanction gay marriages. The measure was approved after three Democratic lawmakers who abstained on a similar proposal that failed in June changed their minds under intense lobbying by bill author Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) and gay and civil rights activists.<br><br>No Republicans voted in favor of the bill. Forty-one of the Assembly's 47 Democrats voted yes; four Democrats voted "no," and two abstained.<br><br>The bill, which would change California's legal definition of marriage from "a civil contract between a man and a woman" to a "civil contract between two persons," now goes to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has signaled that he will veto it.<br><br>Tuesday's vote came after 23 lawmakers addressed the chamber, many of them focusing on the historic element of their action, others relating intensely personal stories.<br><br>In a moment of high drama, with dozens of gay rights supporters watching from the gallery, Simon Salinas (D-Salinas) hesitated for several seconds as the tally hung at 40 "ayes" Â— one short of passage. Then, having promised Leno months ago that he would not let the bill fail, Salinas pressed the "aye" button on his desk, making the final vote 41-35.<br><br>Those seconds "seemed like an eternity," said Mark Guzman of El Dorado Hills, as he and his partner of 14 years, J. Scott Coatsworth, celebrated in the Capitol rotunda after the voting.<br><br>In addition to Salinas, Assembly members Tom Umberg of Anaheim and Gloria Negrete-McLeod of Chino provided key votes. Assemblyman Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), who had missed the floor vote in June, also helped the bill prevail.<br><br>Assemblyman Jerome Horton (D-Inglewood) Â— one of the lawmakers who abstained in June, when Leno's bill fell four votes short Â— withheld his vote again Tuesday. Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia (R-Cathedral City) abstained after having voted "no" in June. Assemblyman Joe Baca Jr. (D-Rialto) also abstained Tuesday.<br><br>Two of the lawmakers who switched their votes from abstain to "aye" said in floor speeches that they were glad for another chance.<br><br>Umberg elicited applause and whoops in the otherwise hushed chamber when he described why he had changed his mind. He said he had been "cajoled, been harassed, been harangued and been threatened" by friends over the issue.<br><br>"This is one of those times when history looks upon us to see where we are," Umberg said. "Ten years from now, there are a handful of issues that history will record where we stood, and this is one of those issues.<br><br>"History will record whether we pushed a bit, took the lead to encourage tolerance, to encourage equality to encourage fairness," he said.<br><br>"The constituency I'm concerned about is a very small one," said Umberg, "and that's the constituency of my three children, should they decide to look back on my record Â… and reflect on where I was when we could make a difference."<br><br>Negrete-McLeod similarly said she regretted abstaining in June.<br><br>Some Republicans dismissed the historic significance of the vote and said gay marriage is not an issue of civil rights. Others criticized Leno for reviving the bill after the June defeat and called gay marriage immoral.<br><br>"The institution of marriage transcends political fads," said Assemblyman Ray Haynes (R-Murrieta). "We are talking about an institution that has been defined for thousands of years Â… and we are being asked to engage in a great social experiment."<br><br>The fight over same-sex marriage will now shift to the governor's office Â— and to the courts and perhaps the ballot box. A case testing the legality of gay marriage is moving toward the state Supreme Court, and opponents of same-sex marriage are trying to qualify two initiatives to ban the practice for the ballot next year.<br><br>Leno characterized gay marriage as the most important civil rights issue of the 21st century. He enlisted Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers of America, and Alice Huffman, California president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, to help him lobby undecided lawmakers.<br><br>Huerta said she spoke to Salinas last week and "went back to our old culture, the Latino culture."<br><br>"Respecting other people's rights is peace," she said. "Respecting other people's rights to marry who they want is a constitutional right, it's a human right and it's a privacy right. I said to Simon, 'You've got to be a leader. Â… You've got to have courage.' "<br><br>Foes of same-sex marriage call Leno's bill unconstitutional, saying it overturns what citizens put into law five years ago when they passed Proposition 22 with 61% of the vote. That initiative said that only marriage between a man and a woman was valid and recognized in California.<br><br>"The only word I can see here is prostitution," said Randy Thomasson, president of the Campaign for Children and Families. "Instead of obeying the voters and the Constitution, the Democratic politicians have prostituted themselves to the homosexual marriage agenda. It's not gay, it's bad."<br><br>After Leno's bill failed in June, he inserted the gay-marriage legislation into a measure about marine research that was pending in the Senate. That bill, AB 849, cleared the upper house Thursday, also with the minimum number of votes necessary.<br><br>Leno said he is optimistic that Schwarzenegger has an open mind on his bill, which the governor has until Oct. 9 to veto or sign. The assemblyman noted that public opinion on gay marriage is evenly split, 46% to 46%, in the state based on a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.<br><br>"I believe this is a governor who at his core is a libertarian on issues of social matters," Leno said, "and that he is very fair-minded. I think he also takes the longer, rather than shorter, view of history."<br><br>After the vote, Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Margita Thompson said: "The people spoke when they passed Proposition 22. The issue subsequently went to the courts. The governor believes the courts are the correct venue for this decision to be made. He will uphold whatever decision the court renders."</span></div>

The Roman Catholic Church, the predominant Christian denomination in Canada, vigorously opposed the legislation.<br><br>The new legislation grants gays and lesbians the right to full civil marriages however religious officials would not be obliged to marry same-sex couples.<br><br>Prime Minister Paul Martin's minority Liberal Party government said it had to draw up the legislation to allow same-sex marriages across the country after courts in eight of the 10 provinces ruled that a heterosexual-only definition of marriage was unconstitutional.<br><br>Martin, a Roman Catholic, has said that despite anyone's personal beliefs, all Canadians should be granted the same rights to marriage.<br><br>In a speech addressing the House of Commons on February 16, 2005, Martin quoted the British Columbia Court of Appeal: "Marriage is the only road to true equality for same-sex couples. Any other form of recognition of same-sex relationships... falls short of true equality."<br><br>Canadian residency requirements are less strict than those in other countries that allow gay marriage resulting in gay men and lesbians travelling to Canada to get married despite the unions not being recognised in the couples' home countries. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Focus on the Family" changed their tone to win votes..<br><br><strong>365Gay.com</strong><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">(Portland, Maine) Pastors opposed to the state's gay rights law are being advised to tone down their condemnation of homosexuality and focus as much on love and support as on sin and scripture.<br>Haley and Melissa Fryrear from Focus on the Family have urged a meeting of about 200 leaders from Maine's evangelical community to stop quoting Leviticus, which refers to gay sex as an ''abomination," and to avoid sayings like, ''Love the sinner, hate the sin."<br><br>They encouraged "balance" in churches, communities, and public policy debates.<br><br>That balance could be key for Maine's Christian conservatives trying to win support for a November ballot question. They hope to overturn a state law that would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation.<br><br>A righteous or hateful tone could steer undecided voters away, while one of kindness and compassion could help win supporters, said Mark Brewer, a political science professor at the University of Maine.<br><br>''You have to avoid coming off in any way as hateful," Brewer said. ''If they can't do that, they won't succeed."<br><br>Gay rights advocates question how much love and support conservative Christians can muster while they condemn same-sex relationships as morally wrong.<br><br>Jesse Connolly of Maine Won't Discriminate, the campaign to add sexual orientation to the Maine Human Rights Act, questioned how much love and support exist in an effort by conservative Christians trying to stop a law that would ensure that people can keep their jobs, apartments, or lines of credit.<br><br>''If there was compassion in what they talk about, they would be on our side," Connolly said.<br><br>Christian conservatives in Maine have swayed voters on the antidiscrimination measure before. Mainers in 1998 sided with conservative religious groups and repealed a law that would have outlawed discrimination against gays. Two years later, lawmakers did not pass the measure, but asked voters to decide. Mainers rejected it in a close vote.<br><br>The most recent dispute over the antidiscrimination law started last spring. The Legislature enacted the law, but conservative Christians led a drive that gathered enough signatures to force a vote in November.<br><br>Colin Lemont of Calvary Bible Baptist Church in Whitefield said he hopes Focus on the Family's message will help to keep the campaign from becoming nasty and divisive. ''That really needs to become a key component through this whole debate and process," Lemont said.<br></span></div>

"I do not have to attend that course for credit hours because I've got enough, but if I have time I will go there to learn some new knowledge," she added.<br><br>Sun said students' interest in sexuality-related topics was the main reason for the course to be offered.<br><br>Fudan University offered a small-intake homosexual studies course for graduates in 2003. Many undergraduates were also interested and applicants for the course numbered more than 1,500, according to Sun.<br><br>Some students wrote to professors saying they learnt "tolerance, understanding and correct life attitude" from the course.<br><br>The new undergraduate course has been sponsored by the Hong Kong-based Chi Heng Foundation, which says its mission is: "To create a harmonious, equal, and healthy society by funding and operating projects in education and care for children and adults impacted by AIDS, AIDS prevention and anti-discrimination."<br><br>Teachers of the course will be from outside the university because, so far, Fudan has limited experience in teaching the subject, Sun said.<br><br>In the past two years Fudan has invited established scholars to give lectures for the graduate homosexual course, including Li Yinhe, a renowned sociologist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.<br><br>"Even if students select the course merely out of curiosity, it's still a good thing, more students will become educated in this area and contribute to academic study," said Sun. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Massachusetts is one of the earliest state in US to permit gay marriages..<br><br><strong>The normality of gay marriages<br>New York Times<br>Editorial<br>September 17, 2005</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/opinion/20sat2.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/opinion/20sat2.html</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">There's nothing like a touch of real-world experience to inject some reason into the inflammatory national debate over gay marriages. Take Massachusetts, where the state's highest court held in late 2003 that under the State Constitution, same-sex couples have a right to marry. The State Legislature moved to undo that decision last year by approving a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages and create civil unions as an alternative. But this year, when precisely the same measure came up for a required second vote, it was defeated by a thumping margin of 157 to 39.<br><br>The main reason for the flip-flop is that some 6,600 same-sex couples have married over the past year with nary a sign of adverse effects. The sanctity of heterosexual marriages has not been destroyed. Public morals have not gone into a tailspin. Legislators who supported gay marriage in last year's vote have been re-elected. Gay couples, many of whom had been living together monogamously for years, have rejoiced at official recognition of their commitment.<br><br>As a Republican leader explained in justifying his vote switch: "Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for the citizens of the commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry who could not before." A Democrat attributed his change of heart to the beneficial effects he saw "when I looked in the eyes of the children living with these couples." Gay marriage, it turned out, is good for family values.<br><br>Some legislators who strongly oppose gay marriages also switched their votes this year for tactical reasons. They realized that the original measure was headed for defeat, and they had never really liked the part that created civil unions anyway. They are now pinning their hopes on an even harsher proposal, endorsed by Gov. Mitt Romney, that would ban gay marriages without allowing civil unions.<br><br>We can only hope that this new appeal to fear and bigotry will stumble over the reality, already apparent, that gay marriage is no threat to the larger community. States that rushed to ban same-sex marriages after the Massachusetts court ruling were succumbing to misplaced hysteria.</span></div>

Get ready for another round of "witch-hunt"..<br><br>And they can only force those who are openly gay out of Church, while they can't do anything to those in the closet.. So what now?<br><br>Part 1/2<br><br><strong>New Vatican rule said to bar gays as new priests<br>New York Times<br>Ian Fisher and Luarie Goodstein<br>September 22, 2005</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/22/international/europe/22vatican.html?incamp=article_popular_2" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/2005/09/22/international/europe/22vatican.html?incamp=article_popular_2</a><br><span style="color: darkred;"><br>ROME - Homosexuals, even those who are celibate, will be barred from becoming Roman Catholic priests, a church official said Wednesday, under stricter rules soon to be released on one of the most sensitive issues facing the church.<br><br>The official, said the question was not "if it will be published, but when," referring to the new ruling about homosexuality in Catholic seminaries, a topic that has stirred much recent rumor and worry in the church. The official, who has authoritative knowledge of the new rules, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the church's policy of not commenting on unpublished reports.<br><br>He said that while Pope Benedict XVI had not yet signed the document, it would probably be released in the next six weeks.<br>In addition to the new document, which will apply to the church worldwide, Vatican investigators have been instructed to visit each of the 229 seminaries in the United States.<br><br>Although work on the document began years ago under Pope John Paul II, who died in April, its release will be a defining act in the young papacy of Benedict, a conservative who said last spring that there was a need to "purify" the church after the deeply damaging sex scandals of the last several years.<br><br>The church official said the ban would pertain only to candidates for the priesthood, not to those already ordained. He also said the document did not represent any theological shift for the church, whose catechism considers homosexuality "objectively disordered."<br><br>Although the document has not been released, hints of what it will say are already drawing praise from some Catholics, who contend that such a move is necessary to restore the church's credibility and who note that church teaching bars homosexuals, active or not, from the priesthood.<br><br>Other Catholics say, though, that the test should be celibacy, not innate sexuality, and they predict resignations from the priesthood that can worsen the church's deep shortage of clergy.<br><br>"I'm hearing that some men will choose to leave, because if they don't, it would be like living a lie," said the Rev. Robert Silva, president of the American National Federation of Priests' Councils, who opposes a ban because it would be "extremely hurtful" to chaste gay priests who are serving the church.<br><br>But the church official who discussed the expected new rules said the document called for barring even celibate men who considered themselves homosexual because of what he contended were the specific temptations of seminaries.<br><br>"The difference is in the special atmosphere of the seminary," he said. "In the seminary, you are surrounded by males, not females."<br><br>The issue of homosexuality in the priesthood and seminaries has long been a difficult one, which the Vatican appears to be addressing, particularly in the United States, on two apparently connected fronts.<br><br>The visits to the American seminaries cover a wide range of concerns, but among those the investigators will be looking for is "evidence of homosexuality" and whether seminarians are being properly prepared to live celibately. Both the document and the investigation come under the authority of the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education.<br><br>Taken together, the document and visits seem aimed at imposing a stricter standard on both the atmosphere at seminaries and on whom they accept as candidates for the priesthood. Archbishop J. Michael Miller, the congregation's secretary, noted at a meeting in Baltimore last week with more than 100 bishops, priests and lay people that the new rules would come as no surprise because there was an existing Vatican document barring homosexuals from the priesthood, according to two church officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they felt there might be repercussions if they spoke for attribution.<br><br>Archbishop Miller appeared to be referring to a 1961 document that recommended against ordaining anyone who has "perverse inclinations to homosexuality or pederasty."<br><br>But that document has been overlooked by seminaries in the United States for many years. Although practices vary, most American seminaries in recent years have not uniformly rejected candidates with a homosexual orientation, seminary officials say.<br><br>Instead, they try to ascertain case by case whether the candidate is capable of living in a chaste and celibate manner, often rejecting candidates who have been sexually active in the years before deciding to join the priesthood.<br><br>Many gay men have entered the priesthood, though, and they are increasingly open with their colleagues, their bishops and in some cases, even with their parishioners, about their sexual orientation. The Rev. Donald Cozzens, a former American seminary rector, contended five years ago in his book "The Changing Face of the Priesthood" that "the priesthood is or is becoming a gay profession."<br><br>James Hitchcock, a conservative Catholic and a professor of history at St. Louis University, said some seminaries had reached the point of being "openly welcoming of homosexuals" and "don't even regard chastity necessary."<br><br>"In that environment - and then you add to that the pedophilia scandals - probably the Vatican thinks that strong medicine is necessary for a serious disorder," said Mr. Hitchcock, who said he would nonetheless favor a system that allows for rare cases to be decided individually.<br><br>In fact, the degree to which the new rules would allow some slack appears to be a major question. It seems clear that the rules will be far more restrictive than current practice.<br><br>In what many church experts saw as a hint of the new rules, the archbishop leading the seminary visits was quoted last week by The National Catholic Register as saying even homosexuals not sexually active for a decade or more should not be accepted into seminaries.<br><br>But the church official said the rules were not absolute. The very definition of homosexuality, he said, is not fixed. And there may be rare cases in which a prospective seminarian who is confused about his sexuality might be accepted if the church decided he would still make a suitable, celibate priest.<br><br>"There is room for this," he said.<br><br>Still, Father Silva of the Federation of Priests' Councils and three other church officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared they would lose their jobs if they revealed dissension within church ranks, said several influential American church leaders had tried to persuade Vatican officials not to release a document about gay seminarians because it would create more problems in the priesthood than it would solve.<br><br>"People would do what they used to do, which is not be honest," said a gay American priest and professor at a Catholic college who did not want to be identified because he fears he could lose his church position if his sexual orientation was known.<br><br>"The irony is, if you look at the exact ages and seminary graduating classes of those priests who were convicted of sexual abuse in the past few years, they were not on the whole people who entered seminaries in the 1980's, when there began to be more openness about homosexuality," he said. "These were people from the old closeted days.<br><br>"So what the church is doing is repeating, in a weird way, the conditions they had before that gave rise to the abuse crisis." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2/2<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">But any move to ban or limit gay men from serving as priests would probably be popular among conservative Catholics, some of whom contend that heterosexuals hesitate to enter the priesthood because they have heard it is predominantly gay.<br><br>Mike Sullivan, of Catholics United for the Faith, a conservative advocacy group, said his group would favor a ban because putting a homosexual in an all-male seminary environment subjects that person to too much temptation, and increases his likelihood for failure.<br><br>"It's not appropriate to put an alcoholic in a bar either," he said.<br><br>On the general issue of homosexuality, official Catholic teaching, as explained in the catechism, says that while some people appear to have a predilection toward same-sex attraction, homosexual acts are impermissible and that homosexuals should remain chaste. But the church has also counseled understanding, and in 1986, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed then by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, denounced the "unfounded and demeaning assumption" that homosexuals could not control their sexual behavior.<br><br>The church official said, however, that the church was entitled to make its own decisions, based on theology, about who is allowed to be a priest, comparing the issue to that of women, who are barred from the priesthood as well.<br><br>"Being a priest is not a right," he said. "The Catholic Church never ordains anyone on the conception of human rights."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was spending some time tidying up my mailbox, saw this interesting article.. Another look at the reparative study, something which I've posted elsewhere in another thread..<br><br>Part 1/3<br><br><strong>Vowing to set the world straight<br>Washington Post<br>Sandra G. Boodman<br>August 16, 2005</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/15/AR2005081501022.html" rel="nofollow">www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/15/AR2005081501022.html</a><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Proponents of reparative therapy say they can help gay patients<br>become heterosexual. Experts call that a prescription for harm.<br><br>Nicholas Cavnar said he tried everything he could think of in his 30-<br>year quest to become heterosexual. He spent years in therapy, paying<br>thousands of dollars for treatment designed to overcome his<br>homosexuality. He faithfully attended meetings of Christian self-help<br>groups for "strugglers." He married and fathered three children, a<br>metamorphosis featured on the cover of a Catholic magazine.<br><br>Yet every day, the 54-year-old Washington publishing executive<br>recalled, he had to suppress his deepest feelings about who he really<br>was -- emotions he thought he had left behind at 20 when, to the<br>delight of his devout family, he abruptly renounced his openly gay<br>life in San Francisco.<br><br>Three years ago, Cavnar said, after soul-searching prompted by the<br>Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he decided his days of "white-knuckling<br>it" were over. "I told my wife I couldn't not be gay anymore,"<br>recalled Cavnar. His biggest regret, he said, was the devastating<br>impact ending their 26-year marriage had on the woman who had<br>struggled with him.<br><br>Cavnar's odyssey -- from gay to ex-gay to ex-ex-gay -- is<br>inextricably linked to his long involvement in reparative therapy, a<br>controversial form of psychotherapy aimed at making gays straight.<br><br>While its supporters cite success stories from their clinical<br>practices as well as a recent and much debated study showing that<br>conversion therapy can work, the treatment is opposed by virtually<br>every medical and mental health organization, including the American<br>Medical Association, the U.S. Surgeon General and the American<br>Psychiatric Association (APA), which removed homosexuality from its<br>list of mental disorders in 1973.<br><br>Until the early 1990s the treatment, also known as reorientation<br>therapy, was largely relegated to religious groups or to the fringes<br>of mental health. Mainstream therapists have been taught to help<br>patients distressed about their homosexuality work toward self-<br>acceptance, to overcome the internalized homophobia thought to be the<br>cause of much emotional turmoil.<br><br>Reparative therapists reject the views held by an overwhelming<br>majority of mental health practitioners. They regard homosexuality as<br>a pathological preference forged in the crucible of a troubled<br>childhood and not, as most scientists believe, an inborn orientation<br>significantly influenced by biological factors such as genetics and<br>exposure to hormones in the womb.<br><br>"I don't think sexual orientation is genetically determined, but like<br>a lot of preferences we have in life is a complicated and<br>idiosyncratic mix of temperament and experience," said Warren<br>Throckmorton, a supporter of reparative therapy who is an associate<br>professor of psychology at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and<br>former president of the American Mental Health Counselors<br>Association. "The other reason I think change is possible is that<br>I've worked with a lot of clients who've done it."<br><br>In the past decade, the growing influence of religious conservatives<br>and the national debate over gay rights, especially gay marriage, has<br>revived interest in the therapy, significantly raising its public<br>profile, spawning new practitioners and igniting debate about a<br>matter that had been considered settled, supporters and critics agree.<br><br>"Reparative therapy is the laetrile of mental health," said New York<br>psychiatrist Jack Drescher, referring to the quack cancer cure banned<br>in the United States in the 1970s.<br><br>To gay rights activist Wayne R. Besen, the author of "Anything But<br>Straight," a 2003 book that tracks the history of ex-gay groups, the<br>therapy is "a kinder, gentler form of homophobia. The argument has<br>shifted from 'You're harming society' to 'You're harming<br>yourselves.'"</span></div>

Its leaders often appear<br>at "Love Won Out" workshops that draw more than 1,000 participants<br>and are sponsored by Focus on the Family, a group founded by<br>conservative psychologist James Dobson, a staunch opponent of gay<br>rights who has ties to the Bush administration.<br><br>Mental health experts are alarmed by the resurgence of a treatment<br>they say has been discredited.<br><br>In the view of Drescher, chair of the APA's committee on gay, lesbian<br>and bisexual issues, reparative therapy's ascendance resembles the<br>resurrection of creationism, a religious belief at odds with science<br>that has been rechristened with the more scientific-sounding<br>name "intelligent design."<br><br>"Many people who try this treatment tend to be desperate, very<br>unhappy and don't know other gay people," said Drescher, who has<br>treated about a dozen men who previously underwent conversion<br>therapy. (Men are far more likely than women to receive the<br>treatment.)<br><br>"I see people who've been very hurt by this," said Drescher, who said<br>some people do manage to temporarily change their behavior, often by<br>becoming celibate, but not their sexual orientation. "They spend<br>years trying to change and are told they aren't trying hard enough."<br><br>Catherine Wulfensmith, 46, a family therapist in Monrovia, Calif.,<br>said she attempted suicide several times after reparative therapy<br>failed to alter her attraction to women. "I bought it hook, line and<br>sinker," she said. "If you don't change, what are you left with?"<br><br>The 'Fix'<br><br>Reparative therapy typically involves once- or twice-weekly<br>psychotherapy sessions lasting a minimum of two years; it may be<br>covered by insurance if it is listed as being for a "sexual disorder<br>not otherwise specified." Patients are encouraged to delve into their<br>childhood relationships, especially with the same-sex parent; to<br>cultivate straight friends and "gender-appropriate" activities such<br>as sports or sewing; and to avoid anything, or anyone, gay. Prayer is<br>often recommended.<br><br>NARTH co-founder Joseph Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist in Encino,<br>Calif., who coined the term reparative therapy and is one of its<br>leading practitioners, emphatically rejects the view that it is<br>ineffective and potentially damaging. He points to a study published<br>in 2003 by Columbia University psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer which<br>found that therapy seemed to work for some highly motivated patients.<br><br>"It can only be damaging if the agenda of the therapist supersedes<br>that of the patient," said Nicolosi, who added that it should never<br>be forced on unwilling participants.<br><br>Although no rigorous outcome studies have been published, Nicolosi<br>estimates that one-third of patients treated at the Thomas Aquinas<br>Psychological Clinic, of which he is founding director,<br>experience "significant improvement -- they understand their<br>homosexuality and have some sense of control" but may still have gay<br>sex. Another third, he said, are "cured": They don't have gay sex and<br>the intensity and frequency of their same-sex desires is diminished,<br>but not necessarily gone. The other third fail to change.<br><br>Hector Roybal, a 52-year-old financial consultant in Los Angeles,<br>spent four years in intensive treatment with Nicolosi, who considers<br>him to be cured. Roybal concurs, but said he still sometimes<br>struggles with sexual feelings for men, although he has remained<br>faithful to his wife, the only woman to whom he says he feels<br>physically attracted.<br><br>"I saw myself as someone who had a problem with homosexuality but was<br>meant to be straight," said Roybal, who, like Nicolosi, is a<br>conservative Catholic. "This is about making a choice."<br><br>Although reparative therapists sometimes differ about the causes of<br>homosexuality, they are united in saying it is not inborn and it is<br>never normal.<br><br>Nicolosi maintains it is the result of a defective bond with the same-<br>sex parent. Boys who feel rejected by their fathers develop<br>a "defensive detachment" -- they reject them and identify with their<br>mothers and other females. Because opposites attract, he theorizes,<br>they are sexually drawn to men, even though what they are searching<br>for is their lost masculinity. Once they find it, he said, their<br>attraction to women will follow, although lifetime vigilance is<br>required to avoid slipping.<br><br>Even though reparative therapists say they support "free choice,"<br>they see nothing contradictory in their view that homosexuality is<br>pathological. Nor do they regard as incongruent their refusal to work<br>with a straight or bisexual client who thinks he or she might be gay.<br>In their view, homosexuals are doomed to miserable, unhealthy lives.<br><br>"We say to patients, 'Your true self is heterosexual,' " Nicolosi<br>said. He said he tells male patients, "Look at your body: It was<br>designed to fit a woman, not a man."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 3/3<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Study<br><br>Robert Spitzer sounds weary when discussing the study published two<br>years ago in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that earned him the<br>enmity of many of his colleagues and the admiration of reparative<br>therapists.<br><br>Spitzer's study has special resonance: In 1973 he was the driving<br>force behind the removal of homosexuality from psychiatry's<br>diagnostic manual.<br><br>Thirty years later, he said, he decided to test the widespread<br>hypothesis that reparative therapy never worked. "I like to challenge<br>conventional notions," he explained.<br><br>Despite the active cooperation of NARTH and ex-gay religious groups,<br>Spitzer said it took him more than 16 months to recruit 200 people<br>who had undergone treatment. He conducted 45-minute telephone<br>interviews and found that 66 percent of 143 men and 44 percent of 57<br>women, all of whom Spitzer described as "highly motivated" and almost<br>all of whom were "extraordinarily religious," had achieved "good<br>heterosexual function" lasting at least five years. They were in a<br>committed relationship, had satisfying heterosexual sex at least<br>monthly and said they were rarely or never bothered by homosexual<br>feelings.<br><br>In an accompanying commentary, former APA president Lawrence<br>Hartmann, a professor at Harvard Medical School, called Spitzer's<br>study "too flawed to publish." Hartmann noted the study was<br>retrospective, that it lacked controls or independent measurements,<br>and was based entirely on self-reports by people who were motivated<br>to say they had changed because of their affiliation with ex-gay or<br>anti-gay groups.<br><br>While Nicolosi and others frequently cite the study as proof<br>reparative therapy works, Spitzer said his results have been<br>misrepresented. "It bothers me to be their knight in shining armor<br>because on every social issue I totally disagree with the Christian<br>right," he said.<br><br>"What they don't mention is that change is pretty rare," he added,<br>noting that the subjects of his study were not representative of the<br>general population because they were considerably more religious.<br><br>And Spitzer calls "totally absurd" the twin hypotheses that everyone<br>is born straight and that homosexuality is a choice.<br><br>Drescher agrees. "There are probably a small number of people with<br>some flexibility in their sexual identity who can change," he<br>said. "Out of the hundreds of gay men I've treated, I've had one."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can commonly hear MPs or the average joe say something like SIngapore is a conservative country. And we have our Asian values. However, China is much much more open about homosexuality than Singapore. The gay and lesbian film fest is an event which they publicise together with other events, including one which is targeted at children.. See, the point about being conservative is moot..<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-12/09/content_501984.htm<br><br>Gay &amp; Lesbian Fest<br><br>The first Beijing Gay &amp; Lesbian Culture Festival, open to all and free of charge, will take place from Dec 16-18, with a series of programmes arranged.
