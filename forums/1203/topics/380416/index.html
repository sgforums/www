              <p>The Deftones has announced a benefit show for injired and hospitalized bassist Chi Cheng at the Avalon in Hollywood, CA on 11/19. Tickets will go on-sale for our fans this Wednesday, 10/28 with a general on-sale to follow on Friday, 10/30. All proceeds will go to the Chi Ling Cheng Special Needs Trust that has been set up by the Cheng family to help pay for the growing medical costs required for Chi's survival and recovery.</p>
              <p>In the event that you do not live in Los Angeles, or you don't end up getting a ticket for the show, the band will be launching a series of online auctions, an online store and making available other opportunities for you to make a donation to the Trust. More details will come soon.</p>
              <p>It has been almost a year since Chi's accident. On November 2nd, 2008 Deftones bassist Chi Ling Cheng was involved in a horrific car accident which has left him in a semi-conscious state. In his journey to recovery, the Cheng family has accumulated an overwhelming amount of medical bills that insurance does not entirely cover, which is the reason a trust has been set up for him as well as a number of benefit shows.</p>

              <p><strong>Chi Cheng Benefit Auction Announced</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>On November 17th, Deftones with the assistance of <a href="http://charitybuzz.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">CharityBuzz.com</span></span></a> will commence a three week online auction to raise money for their brother, Chi Cheng. With the event only a few days away, the response has been overwhelming and Chino, as well as Deftones, would like to send their thanks to all involved:</p>
              <p>"Wow, first let me start off saying how amazed I am at the generosity of all the friends and artists who have come forward for this auction. We, Deftones are so very grateful to all for your donations and time you've put into making this a success. I myself had no idea it would be this big. Just goes to show how many good friends and good will Chi has made over the last 20 years, just being the good dude he is.</p>
              <p>"If you were lucky enough to befriend Chi over the last couple decades you would know that there is not a more kind, or more giving person. It's so great to see it all coming back around for him.</p>
              <p>"I really want to thank everyone that has kept him in their thoughts, prayers, and kept all the positive energy and love flowing his way. I truly believe he will return to us one day when he is good and rested with a great story to tell in his off the wall Cheng sense of humor. Chi is one tuff "MF" and if anyone can make it through this, it's gonna be him.</p>
              <p>"Chi, I miss you and love you and so does the world. Hope to see you soon."</p>
