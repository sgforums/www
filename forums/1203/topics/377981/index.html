              <p>Bassist/vocalist Janne Jarvis of Hate Gallery issued the following statement about being arrested at Pub Anchor in Stockholm, Sweden on October 1st:</p>
              <p>“I’ve never experienced anything like it. The bouncers dragged me out and held me down over a barrier outside. I couldn’t breathe and they almost broke my arms. Luckily there were a number of people outside including some journalists who helped me get free. However this was just the start. I managed to make it into the middle of the street and was relieved to see that a police car had just pulled up. I tried to explain what had happened but before they could take a statement the bouncers rushed me and grabbed me again, this time with considerably more force. I pleaded with the police to stop them but they just stood back. They looked like they were panicking and didn’t seem to know what to do or they were ‘friends’ with the bouncers. Luckily some more police turned up and they kindly arrested me and took me away.</p>
              <p>"I cannot believe how incompetent and incapable the Stockholm police were of protecting a member of the public from this kind of assault. Members of the police force that I spoke to later were amazed and embarrassed that members of their own department did absolutely nothing.</p>
              <p>"Stockholm is a great city but the police have lost control of the streets and are powerless or unwilling to protect the public against these licensed thugs. Sadly these events occur every night of the year all around the world, it’s just a shame that a country like Sweden that prides itself on its anti-violence policies and equality should allow its reputation to be damaged by the impotence and apparent corruption of its police.This has to be stopped.</p>
              <p>"If you love music and value your personal safety, I’d strongly advise against going to or playing at Pub Anchor. If you’re an international musician visiting Stockholm then watch your back because the police will not protect you.”</p>
              <p>Linnea Olsson of Sweden Rock Magazine, who was present at Pub Anchor, issued the following the statement about the incident:</p>
              <p>“I’m sorry to say I’m not entirely surprised by the behaviour of the bouncers, since Pub Anchor is infamous for its ruthless and disrespectful staff. I am however stunned by the fact that the police not only failed to do their job, but even enabled this completely unprovoked act of violence. The police claim to have a zero tolerance approach, which does not seem to be true since they’re clearly collaborating with the bouncers. I will never set my foot in Pub Anchor again and I encourage all bands and fans in Stockholm to follow my example.”</p>
