              <p><strong>Aerosmith Still In Turmoil Regarding Situation With Singer Steven Tyler</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://kyuball.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/aerosmith.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Although Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler took to the stage with The Joe Perry Project recently to perform "Walk This Way" and announced he was not, contrary to rumours, leaving the band, it would appear that Aerosmith's problems are still far from over. Joe Perry has told Billboard.com that Tyler "never said he was leaving the band" but that that the singer "said he wanted two years off to do his other projects," which has created some tension and problems within the group.</p>
              <p>"Aerosmith wants to work," says Perry, who Tweeted earlier in the week that the band was "positively looking for a new singer to work with." He adds, "the band's been playing together for 40 years. It's a really powerful rock band, and I don't want to see it just go to waste and I don't think any of the other guys do, either. We're gonna work and we're gonna do something -- I'm not exactly sure what yet, but the band's too good to let it sit around. We're not going to wait for Steven."</p>
              <p>Perry says he's had one conference call during the past week with bandmates Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer, but they have not made any firm decisions about anything -- including working with another singer while Tyler is pursuing his outside endeavors. "We're waiting for things to kind of settle down, and then we'll figure out what we're gonna do. Anything is possible," the guitarist says.</p>
