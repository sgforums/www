              <p>             While the major record labels were dragging file-sharers and BitTorrent
              sites to court for copyright infringement, they were themselves being
              sued by a conglomerate of artists for exactly the same offenses.
              Warner, Sony BMG, EMI and Universal face up to $6 billion in damages
              for pirating a massive 300,000 tracks.</p>
              <p>            It is no secret that the major record labels have a double standard
              when it comes to copyright. On the one hand they try to put operators
              of BitTorrent sites in jail and ruin the lives of single mothers and
              students by demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines, and on
              the other they sell CDs containing music for which they haven’t
              obtained copyright permission.<br><br><br>         In the past we’ve covered many disputes between artists and labels,
              where the latter is being accused or even sued for using songs without
              permission. Just a few months ago Latin America’s biggest artist,
              Alejandro Fernández, sent the police to a Sony Music office <span style="color: #888888;">to confiscate </span>over 6,000 CDs that the label refused to return, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br><br></p>
              <p>            The labels have made a habit of using songs from a wide variety of
              artists for compilation CDs without securing the rights. They simply
              use the recording and make note of it on “pending list” so they can
              deal with it later. This has been going on since the 1980s and since
              then the list of unpaid tracks (or copyright infringements) has grown
              to 300,000.</p>
              <p>           Growing tired of the labels’ piracy, a group of artists have filed a <span style="color: #000000;">class-action lawsuit</span> in Canada against four major labels connected to the CRIA, the local
              equivalent of the RIAA. In October last year Warner Music, Sony BMG
              Music, EMI Music and Universal Music were sued for illegal use of
              thousands of tracks and at present the case is still underway.</p>
              <p>           How and why this blatant copyright infringement could go on for
              years is a mystery, but the labels’ double standard has been picked up
              by the plaintiffs as well. “The conduct of the defendant record
              companies is aggravated by their strict and unremitting approach to the
              enforcement of their copyright interests against consumers,” the
              artists argue in their claim for damages.</p>
              <p>           The suit is still ongoing but already the labels have admitted to
              owing at least $50 million for infringing the rights of artists, and
              this figure could grow as high as 6 billion. So who are the real
              pirates here?</p>
