              <p>Veteran German rock hard rockers <strong>SCORPIONS</strong> have released the following statement: <br><br>"Important message to our fans: <br><br>"It
              was always our pleasure, our purpose in life, our passion and we were
              fortunate enough to make music for you — whether it was live on stage
              or in the studio, creating new songs. <br><br>"While we were working
              on our album these past few months, we could literally feel how
              powerful and creative our work was — and how much fun we were still
              having in the process. But there was also something else: we want to
              end the <strong>SCORPIONS</strong>' extraordinary career on a high note. <br><br>"We
              are extremely grateful for the fact that we still have the same passion
              for music we've always had since the beginning. This is why, especially
              now, we agree we have reached the end of the road. We finish our career
              with an album we consider to be one of the best we have ever recorded
              and with a tour that will start in our home country Germany and take us
              to five different continents over the next few years. <br><br>"We want you, our fans, to be the first to know about this. <br><br>"Thank you for your never-ending support throughout the years! <br><br>"We uploaded the very first snippets from our new album for you <a href="http://www.the-scorpions.com/english/">here</a>. And now… let's get the party started and get ready for a <strong>'Sting in the Tail'</strong>! <br><br><strong>SCORPIONS</strong>' new album, <strong>"Sting In The Tail"</strong>, will be released in Europe on March 19. The CD was recorded at a studio in Hannover, Germany with Swedish producers <strong>Mikael "Nord" Andersson</strong> and <strong>Martin Hansen</strong> (the team behind <strong>THE RASMUS</strong>' <strong>"Dead Letters"</strong> CD).<br><br>Check out the cover artwork below.<br><br><strong>SCORPIONS</strong> recently extended their record deal with <strong>Ariola</strong>, which is part of the international media conglomerate <strong>Sony BMG Music Entertainment</strong>. <br><br>In a December 2009 interview with the Polish web site <strong>Plejada</strong>, <strong>SCORPIONS</strong> guitarist <strong>Rudolf Schenker</strong> stated about the band's forthcoming CD, "After <strong>'Humanity - Hour 1'</strong>,
              which was more in the concept-album [vein], talking about the problems
              in the world, we said, 'OK, we talked about all these things which
              [were] happening and now we don't wanna talk again about problems, now
              we wanna party. We're going back to the roots of the band. <br><br>"We
              have great rock songs — fantastic rock songs — we have great ballads...
              The mixture if 10 percent ballads and the rest is up-tempo and
              mid-tempo [material]. And I think we have a great team of people
              working for us, producer team from Sweden — they're great people — and
              we're doing this recording in Stockholm and in Hannover, where my
              studio is. <br><br>"It looks great. We have a fantastic sound, because
              my studio is very good for guitars, and this time we're looking very
              much also to bring the guitars up, and, of course, with the great voice
              of <strong>Klaus</strong>, with the right melodies, giving the right vibe — the typical <strong>SCORPIONS</strong> sound."<br><br>Added singer <strong>Klaus Meine</strong>:
              "We recorded the last album in the U.S. This has a more European kind
              of feel, I think, working in Germany and in Sweden. And we're looking
              very much forward to releasing this in the spring and we can't wait to
              play the songs live on stage.<br><br>"We tried to find this spontaneous moment — not to overproduce things and to keep things really fresh. <br><br>"There
              are a lot of great songs on this record. And we always had our fans in
              mind [when putting the material together], especially the tour next
              year, because we hope many [of the new] songs we can [perform live] on
              the road."<br><br>2009 was the year of the <strong>SCORPIONS</strong>: they received the German lifetime achievement <strong>ECHO</strong>,
              collected many other awards, and undertook a grand tour through Russia,
              the U.S. and Europe. However, it is 2010 that will set a milestone for
              the career of the most successful international rock band from Germany.
              The <strong>SCORPIONS</strong> will be touring the world for the next two years
              and performing in the largest venues and stadiums that cross their
              path. The mammoth tour will be launched for the first time in many
              years in Germany. "It was important for us to give our fans a chance to
              celebrate a never-to-forget party with us," said <strong>Schenker</strong>. <strong>Meine</strong> added, "2010 is going to be a very special year for the <strong>SCORPIONS</strong>, so it is an especially good feeling to be able to start this tour at home."<br><br>The
              performances in Germany will be followed by concerts in the U.S., South
              America, Asia, Russia and various countries in Europe. <br><br><strong>SCORPIONS</strong>' brand new DVD, <strong>"Amazonia - Live In The Jungle"</strong> — a live recording of the <strong>SCORPIONS</strong> concerts in Manaus and Recife, Brazil — is in stores now.<br><br>The band's last CD, <strong>"Humanity - Hour 1"</strong>, was produced by <strong>James Michael</strong> and co-produced by songwriter/producer <strong>Desmond Child</strong>, who has worked with such high-profile pop/rock artists as <strong>AEROSMITH</strong>, <strong>BON JOVI</strong>, <strong>ALICE COOPER</strong>, <strong>KISS</strong>, <strong>RICKY MARTIN</strong>, <strong>CHER</strong>, <strong>MICHAEL BOLTON</strong> and <strong>BONNIE TYLER</strong>.<br></p>
