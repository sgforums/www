              <div id="showItems_ctl00_storyPanel" class="regular">Author and <strong>Metal Hammer</strong> reporter <strong>Joel McIver</strong> received an unexpected phone call in the evening of Tuesday, July 8 from <strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong> frontman <strong>David Vincent</strong>. "I was arrested in Italy today — and charged with a weapons offense," explained the furious singer. <strong>Vincent</strong> went on to explain that the veteran death metal outfit had arrived at
              Milan airport that morning for a flight to Greece, but that he was
              detained after customs officials found a bullet-belt inside his
              checked-in luggage. <br><br>Arrested and escorted by a group of 15 to 20 armed police officers to a holding cell, <strong>Vincent</strong> endured over two and a half hours of questioning before being released.
              "I asked them again and again if they were kidding," recalled <strong>Vincent</strong>,
              "but they said no. The belt is obviously not made of real bullets.
              Metal is clearly not fashionable in the fashion centre of Europe." The
              bullet-belt, given to <strong>Vincent</strong> in 1989 by the <strong>Earache</strong> owner <strong>Digby Pearson</strong> when <strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong> signed to his label, was confiscated and the singer was charged with an
              offense that translates approximately as "possession of contraband
              weapons."<br><br>Asked for a statement by <strong>McIver</strong>, <strong>Vincent</strong> replied: "My comment is this. For 20 years I've had my same friendly
              bullet-belt with me at all metal occasions. After 20 years of being a
              lawless individual, I'm happy that the Keystone Kops of spaghetti
              western fame have been able to show me the error of my ways." He was
              given a document requesting his attendance in an Italian court, with
              the date yet to be decided, and was required to contact a lawyer on his
              return to the USA in order to arrange his defense. "I doubt very much
              that I'll ever get the belt back," he fumed down the line from Greece,
              where his band are playing tomorrow evening (Wednesday, July 9). "We
              barely made our flight," he added. "We only made it to the plane
              because we make a point of showing up early at airports in case of
              bullshit like this."<br><br><a href="http://musicametal.blogosfere.it/">Musica Metal</a> has posted video footage of <strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong> performing a brand new song, <strong>"Nevermore"</strong>, at the <strong>Gods of Metal</strong> festival on June 29, 2008 in Bologna, Italy. Watch the clip below.<br><br><strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong> played its first show with new touring guitarist, <strong>ZYKLON</strong>'s longtime axemeister <strong>Destructhor</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>Thor Anders Myhren</strong>), on June 22 at the <strong>Hellfest</strong> in Clisson, France.<br><br>Although <strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong>'s
              upcoming album does not currently have a name, its title will likely
              begin with the letter "I", in keeping with the band's tradition of
              titling their albums in alphabetical order beginning with 1989's <strong>"Altars of Madness"</strong>, and continuing through <strong>"Heretic"</strong>.<br><br>"A lot of people around the world have come up with titles that they thought it would be," <strong>Vincent</strong> told Norway's <strong>"Tinitus"</strong> radio show in an interview that aired last month. "There is no title
              yet — we've not decided on it. We've not decided whether it's going to
              continue following the alphabet or not. So anything that you hear or
              read on the Internet is totally speculation by anyone."<br><br><strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong>'s follow-up to 2003's <strong>"Heretic"</strong> will mark the group's first release to feature <strong>David Vincent</strong> since 1995's <strong>"Domination"</strong>. <br><br><strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong> is presently unsigned, having parted ways with <strong>Earache Records</strong> following <strong>"Heretic"</strong>'s release.<br><br>Regarding <strong>Destructhor</strong>'s addition to the band's touring lineup, <strong>Vincent</strong> said, "We had a fairly long audition process. We looked long and hard
              at this. We decided when we began this process that it was gonna be a
              unanimous decision. We had several people [apply for the job] — very
              good players from, really, all over the world — and we got a video from
              <strong>Thor</strong> — the same video that we asked from all the different
              players; the same two songs — and some people didn't get past the
              initial discussion stage, and then some people went on to the next
              stage and it ended up that the band unanimously felt that <strong>Thor</strong> would be the best guitarist for the band." <br><br><strong>MORBID ANGEL</strong>'s current lineup is rounded out by guitarist <strong>Trey Azagthoth</strong> and drummer <strong>Pete Sandoval</strong>.</div>
