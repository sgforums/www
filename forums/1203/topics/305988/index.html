              <div id="showItems_ctl00_storyPanel" class="regular">The <a href="http://www.jrockrevolution.com/">Jrock Revolution</a> web site has posted an English translation of the interview <strong>X JAPAN</strong> founder <strong>Yoshiki</strong> gave to MySpace regarding the band's upcoming reunion shows and future plans. An excerpt follows:<br><br><strong>Q</strong>: Can you tell us something about the Tokyo Dome live shows?<br><br><strong>Yoshiki</strong>:
              "There haven't been any concrete decisions made yet. We're still having
              meetings about that. But there will probably different songs at those
              two nights — well, not all different — and I'm contemplating creating
              totally different performances."<br><br><strong>Q</strong>: Did you start rehearsing?<br><br><strong>Yoshiki</strong>: "No, not yet. <strong>X</strong> doesn't really rehearse much. Or rather, I don't like rehearsal, I like
              to see just what will happen at any given concert. Well, for some songs
              we rehearse a lot, but with others we hardly do and just perform them
              as a challenge on stage."<br><br><strong>Q</strong>: Do you have any plans after Tokyo Dome?<br><br><strong>Yoshiki</strong>:
              "Well, I guess just as with the previous video, it's another step on
              our way and we'll see how it goes on after we've taken that. We'll see
              if there's something we want to do next or if we'll end it if nothing
              like that comes up. I don't actually know yet, I'm just doing things as
              they come up without much planning ahead. With <strong>X</strong>, it seems
              regardless whether we make plans or not, when things are bad they're
              bad, and when they're good they're good. Naturally, there are concert
              offers from overseas and so on now, but that's all still under
              consideration. Well, after we start to rehearse for Tokyo Dome, if all
              the members feel we can do more, there's a good chance we'll do more."<br><br>Read the entire interview at <a href="http://www.jrockrevolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=245&amp;Itemid=1">this location</a>.<br><br><strong>X JAPAN</strong>'s new song, <strong>"I.V."</strong>, topped <strong>iTunes</strong>' daily charts upon its release on January 23 in both Overall Sales and Rock categories.<br><br><strong>X JAPAN</strong> is the first Asian artist to chart high worldwide on <strong>iTunes</strong> and the <strong>Billboard</strong> music site <strong>Billboard.biz</strong>.<br><br>A 16-minute interview (in English) with <strong>Yoshiki</strong> about the reactivated band's future plans can be viewed below.<br><br><strong>"I.V."</strong> and another new song, entitled <strong>"Without You"</strong>, will be featured on a forthcoming "best-of" collection, to be released later in the year.<br><br><strong>"I.V."</strong> appears in the fourth movie of the record-breaking <strong>"Saw"</strong> horror franchise, although it's not featured on the film's soundtrack.<br><br><strong>"Saw IV"</strong> comes from the same team that produced <strong>"Catacombs"</strong>, which featured the song <strong>"Blue Butterfly"</strong>, written and produced by <strong>Yoshiki</strong>. <br><br>Approached in July 2006 about producing the theme track for <strong>"Saw IV"</strong>, <strong>Yoshiki</strong> chose to perform the song with <strong>X JAPAN</strong>.<br><br>Written and composed by <strong>Yoshiki</strong>, with lyrics completely in English due to the international target audience, the song features <strong>Toshi</strong> on vocals, <strong>Pata</strong> on guitar and <strong>Heath</strong> on bass. While attending <strong>Toshi</strong>'s vocal recording sessions, <strong>Yoshiki</strong> took the lead in overseeing the English lyrics. <br><br><strong>"I.V."</strong> reportedly features previously unreleased ideas written by <strong>X JAPAN</strong>'s influential lead guitarist <strong>Hideto "Hide" Matsumoto</strong>, who committed suicide in May 1998.<br><br>The video for the song <strong>"I.V."</strong> can be viewed below.
