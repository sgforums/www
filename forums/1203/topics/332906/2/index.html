              <p>Nyktalgia-Cold Void Lyrics</p>
              <p>The deadly way out reveals the truest cruelty <br> and isolates me from reality, <br> but I'm asking myself: what is reality: a dream? <br> Everytime I reach this point, I remember dreams that will never be reality. <br> Taking a bath in razors, entices me as a solution for my endless grief. <br> <br> The decision draws nearer. <br> <br> On a transparent way, I float much more away, without any sight. <br> Am I blind, or am I still alive? <br> And once again, I only sense the purest absence. <br> A wound like this, cannot be healed anymore. <br> <br> I will decide, for the last time. <br> <br> The courage I've lost long ago - for I'll never feel happiness anew. <br> In emotions of solitude, the non-presence is my home.my grave. <br> When the pulse no longer throbs and the last drop of life left my veins, <br> I become forever paralysed, by this ultimate.Cold Void.</p>
