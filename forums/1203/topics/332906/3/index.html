              <p>Giving up hurts the most - Underoath</p>
              <p>Angels mourn; crying, praying for your soul.</p>
              <p>As my eyes open from their state of sleep,<br>I feel my blood turn into a frozen river.<br>Nightmares told me<br>Death was in the air.<br>My heart locked shut, and I gave you the key<br>Promise never, never to leave!<br>As lies hold me and this emptiness fills my broken heart.<br>Screaming your name hoping for a response.<br>Ssilence.<br>Summer, drowned by WINTER!<br>To look in your face AND realized the time we SPENT<br>The chances I HAD...<br>...Have drifted away from my fingertips,<br>Your life, your thoughts, your dreams, your love.<br>Never tried my hardest and now I pray as the hurt enters.<br>I LOVE YOU, and I still love you;<br>Even though I... Even though I never showed it</p>
              <p>A piece of me is gone forever.<br>Clutching memories held so close.<br>Repeating words of love spoken too late.</p>
              <p>(My eyes look all around, but all they can focus on is you, for in you, I find me)</p>
              <p>Days pass by and thy death still lingers.<br>This coldness will never satisfy me.<br>I want to be surrounded by angels,<br>In a place where the sun is so warm,<br>It burns my insides.</p>
              <p>Surrounded by angels. Surrounded by angels.<br>Where love takes my darkest depressions...<br>And throws it into the deepest sea.<br>A place I can call home, I'm crying to you, Jesus<br>Mend me, break me, make me.<br>You're all I've got now.</p>
              <p>(My eyes look all around, but all they can focus on is you, for in you I find me.<br>Farewell my friend, your time has come.<br>And never will I be able to tell you "I love you" again....)</p>
