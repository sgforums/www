              <p> fucked your girlfriend last night.<br>While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.<br>She called me Daddy. And I called her baby when I<br>Smacked her ass. I called her sugar when I ate<br>Her alive till daylight. And I slept with her all<br>Over me, from forehead to ribcage I dripper her ass.<br><br>Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some<br>Brash fantasy, but no. You were knocked out. But we were<br>All knocked out you know. In a way<br><br>I serve too many masters.<br><br>We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic<br>Came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists<br>And neck. And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude.<br><br>But you wouldn't know what you were doing because<br>I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn<br>Victim, an amputee, a dead body. But god damn I wanted<br>To fuck.<br><br>I'm serving too many fucking masters.<br><strong>[I told you. I told you motherfucker]</strong></p>
