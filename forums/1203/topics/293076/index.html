            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MARILYN MANSON: More 'Sick And Disturbing Purchases' Revealed By Former Bandmate</strong><br><br>The New York Post's Page Six reports that Marilyn Manson is in more legal trouble. The shock rocker was accused in August by his band's former keyboardist, Stephen "Pogo" Bier (who performed with the band under the name Madonna Wayne Gacy), of squandering the group's earnings on "sick and disturbing purchases." A new complaint filed yesterday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Bier's lawyer, Keith Fink, added more items to the list, including African masks made of human skin, a full skeleton of a 4-year-old Chinese girl that Manson is said to have turned into a chandelier, and another skeleton of a man in a wheelchair Â— all illegal items in the U.S. He allegedly continued his spree with swastika wall tiles and matching custom rugs, a mounted grizzly bear and two mounted baboons. Bier's filing also says Manson arranged for his girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood, to star in his "Heart Shaped Glasses" video for the "highest salary ever paid to any actress in any music video in history." He also allegedly used funds to pay roadies to move suitcases filled with "Alice in Wonderland" books because he was obsessed with author Lewis Carroll.<br><br>In an e-mail sent to the Post in early August 2007 with the approval of his attorney, Bier stated that he was promised "partnership proceeds" from the band in 1993, only to see Manson spend large amounts of money on a "multi-million-dollar home," "a lavish wedding in Ireland" and "an engagement ring to Dita von Teese," Manson's former wife. In addition, Bier's lawsuit states that Manson also splurged on "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy (including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl)."<br><br>Bier said that when he requested his share of the so-called "partnership proceeds," Manson "devised a campaign to drive Bier out of the band and rob him of his entitlement."<br><br>Bier has played keyboards on every Manson album except for the newest one, "Eat Me, Drink Me". He was said to have left the Manson band shortly before the album's release in order to concentrate on his photography.<br><br>Manson has denied the charges, telling MTV News in August, "The fact that he's claiming that I've treated him unfairly, financially, is really ridiculous. And I would never spend my money on a Chinese girl skeleton. That would be crossing the line. It's a Chinese boy, for the record," he joked, before continuing. "[Bier and his lawyers are] going for shock value, obviously, and I couldn't be less surprised by how unshocking these things would be to the public."<br><br>Manson said he will defend himself against the allegations. "I wish there was some sort of legal angle to this whole thing, or some sort of common sense, or just even camaraderie after all the years that we knew each other," he continued. "I don't have an explanation for it. It just seems like another ex-bandmember suing me and trying to assassinate my personality as a means to financial gain, and it just seems old. It's just not fair. If I spent my money on anything, it was my family, and paying his salary for a year when we weren't even touring."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> cool!</div>
