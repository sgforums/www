              <h1>Top 10 Rivalries Involving Dave Mustaine</h1>
              <p> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Is
              there any other artist out there that has a list of rivalries as
              extensive as Dave Mustaine's? I could have easily done a top 10 list of
              Mustaine's rivalries from 2009 alone. Top 10 Fights Involving Dave
              Mustaine<br> <br>
              </span></p><h1>10. Suicide Silence</h1>
              <br> We still haven't heard Dave's version of the events that transpired in
              Dec 2009, but Mustaine created a feud with them upon him booting the <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">band</span></a> from their final show in Reno, NV. Suicide Silence's management took to
              Twitter and posted "Suicide Silence are not allowed to play Reno due to
              Dave Mustaine's ego. Kicked off last two days of tour and had laminates
              removed."<br> <br>
              <h1>9. Jeff Young - Megadeth</h1>
              <br> Mustaine had a busy 2009. In late 2009, Mustaine posted some comments
              in his blog about former guitarist Jeff Young being a heroin addict.
              Young fired back in his statement by saying "So, we canceled the
              Australian tour because I ran out of heroin!? Let's get the REAL truth
              out there, buddy. We cancelled the Australia tour for one reason: So
              you could get back to L.A. quick . . . and into one of how many failed
              attempts at rehab? Then, while you are in rehab, you try to get me and
              the other members to smuggle heroin into the rehab in a Coke can!? WTF?"<br> <br>
              <h1>8. Kirk Hammett - Metallica</h1>
              <br> Mustaine was fired from Metallica, Kirk stepped in as a replacement and
              played a lot of the solos Mustaine wrote on "Kill 'Em All". In 2005,
              Mustaine stated "I really don't care about Kirk [Hammett] — he stole my
              job, but at least I got to bang his girlfriend before he took my job —
              how do I taste, Kirk?"<br> <br>
              <h1>7. Mike Muir - Suicidal Tendencies</h1>
              <br> Mike Muir of Suicidal Tendencies was upset when Dave Mustaine tried to
              throw his band off the bill and responded by attacking Mustaine's
              alcohol addictions and joking that he "lived at the Betty Ford Center."
              The feud nearly became violent on the Clash of the Titans tour when he
              challenged Mustaine to an onstage fist-fight. Muir claimed that "There
              are a lot of people who would like to see Dave get his butt kicked, and
              the Lord knows Mike Muir ain't goin' down. I'll fuck him up... I'd
              dazzle him, left'n'right. I wanna see a little blood, y'know what I'm
              sayin'?" Mustaine responded to Muir verbally, claiming that Muir was
              stupid for trying to intimidate him.<br> <br>
              <h1>6. Fred Durst - Limp Bizkit</h1>
              <br> I completely forgot about this one until researching for the list.  It appears to have been largely based around <a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">MTV</span></a> and Fred Durst (gee, how'd I miss that). Apparently Dave had a problem
              with Fred wearing a Megadeth shirt in a video. "Limp Bizkit are shit.
              Their first record was decent, then Durst started writing about random
              shit." When asked about Mustaine's remarks, Durst replied "I love
              Megadeth and the <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">music</span></a> that Dave and the boys write. Regardless of what Dave feels about <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ff0000; color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">Limp </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ff0000; color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">Bizkit</span></a>,
              I will not stop loving Megadeth." In the fall of the same year,
              Mustaine phoned up Durst, apologizing for the negative things he had
              said. <br> <br>
              <h1>5. Phil Anselmo &amp; Pantera</h1>
              <br> Seems in the early 90's, Dave Mustaine thought Pantera was a Megadeth
              clone. While on tour with Megadeth, Phil Anselmo would say "Fuck
              Megadeth" and "Fuck Dave." Mustaine finally became a fan of Pantera
              after Dime's death in 2004.<br> <br>
              <h1>4. Kerry King - Slayer</h1>
              <br> From what I gather on this one, it began in 1984 when King was a fillin
              guitarist in Megadeth. Mustaine wanted to poach him from Slayer and
              didn't think he should go back to that band of eyeliner wearing fairies
              with the poor <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">album</span></a> sales. Kerry refused to make the switch and public name calling began
              which Mustaine later revealed hurt his feelings. Nowadays neither side
              cares anymore and they almost toured together in 2010.<br> <br>
              <h1>3. David Ellefson - Megadeth</h1>
              <br> David Ellefson was a little pissed to say the least in 2002 when
              Mustaine broke up Megadeth due to an arm injury. Ellefson claimed he
              did it solely to get the rest of <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">the </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">band</span></a> to quit. Lawsuits were filed on both ends for several million dollars
              and Mustaine ultimately winning. Word is they celebrated Christmas
              together a few years later.<br> <br>
              <h1>2. Lars Ulrich - Metallica</h1>
              <br> Just mentioning Metallica or Lars Ulrich has sent Mustaine into tears.
              Things got so bad that the media began asking about the feud in
              interviews causing Dave to blowup at the press. Things came to a
              boilingpoint in 2005 when Metallica released Some Kind of Monster which
              featured Mustaine and Ulrich working out their differences. Things now
              seem to be on the right path although both sides take jabs at one
              another in the press on occasion.<br> <br>
              <h1>1. The media</h1>
              <br> Mustaine has issued countless edicts that he will never answer another
              question about Metallica or anyone else he has quarreled with over the
              years. Yet with all these statements he has made, he continues to bring
              up other bands and then slams the fans, the press and the bands for
              turning on him.<br> <br> Feuds not making this list:  Chris Poland, Ron McGovney, James Hetfield, Slayer fans, Roadrunner <a id="KonaLink6" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/272/17701/Top-10-Rivalries-Involving-Dave-Mustaine.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Records</span></a>, Jeff Young, Tom Araya, Dissection, Rotting Christ and Rikki Ratchman.<br><p></p>
