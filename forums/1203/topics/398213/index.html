              <div style="width: 95%;">
              <p class="style3">Vorum is a finnish death metal trio from the Aland
              islands (Ahvenanmaa) located between Finland &amp; Sweden in the Baltic
              sea. The band was established during slushy weather conditions in the
              winter of 2006 and withholds to this present date the same line up as
              in the early hours of the bands existence wich is Jonatan Johansson,
              Matti Jalava and Mikko Josefsson. With eager "The three" rehearsed and
              began writing songs about death, darkness, evil and destruction wich
              ended up in a seven (7) track demo, recorded in the basement of lord
              thunder &amp; doom's brother; His Hogness The Feral God-Pig of Antioch.
              It was a mixture of thrash metal and death, but it sounded far from
              what the band would later sound like. This recording was never released
              unofficially/officially. Not much happened, a few demos were sent
              around but without any aftermath and they played a few gigs at the only
              local kvlt place called Pub Bastun in the town of Mariehamn. Under this
              time the band went under the moniker of "Haudankaivaja" wich means
              "Gravedigger" in finnish. A little while and fistful of new songs
              later, it was time to make a new demo. The second demo was recorded in
              Helsinki at Panu Posti mansion and took about a week of nerve testing
              and resulted in a eight (8) track long death strike. This demo, now
              released as an MCD and titled "GRIM DEATH AWAITS", came to gather
              attention in webzines such as imperiumi.net and in demo review columns
              in magazines like Miasma and even some radio plays in the Ylex
              Metalliliitto radio show. Most special to be mentioned is that Vorum
              could be seen on the cover of Scandinavias biggest metal/rock magazine
              "INFERNO" this year being the first unsigned band ever to be featured
              in the magazine as a coverstory without having any official release.
              Eventually all this lead to a record deal with WOODCUT RECORDS known
              for it's excellent black metal and other extreme metal releases. The
              MCD "GRIM DEATH AWAITS" is the first official release of Vorum and was
              released in Scandinavia the 8th of April and worldwide the 24th of
              April by Woodcut Records. Vorum is now slowly but steady writing new
              songs for their debut full-lenght album wich will occur on a date TBA!<br><br>DEATH METAL!<br><br><br>Wall of words... if you don't want to read it then CHECK THEM OUT! <a href="http://www.vorumdeath.com/index.php">HERE</a>!</p>
