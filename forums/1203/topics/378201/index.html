              <p><strong>Benefit Fund Set Up For Evile Bassist's Family</strong></p>
              <p>UKThrash.co.uk has set up a special fund in honour of Evile bass player Mike Alexander, who passed away while the band were on tour in Sweden on monday. A posting on the UKThrash foums reads:</p>
              <p>"After the recent tragic news of the death of Evile bass guitarist Mike Alexander, it has been decided that the UKThrash PayPal account will be open to voluntary donations, to which anyone in the UKThrash community (and beyond) can contribute.</p>
              <p>"When the time comes, the full amount raised will be forwarded to Mike's family, or to a charity of their choice. Donations can either be made through the donations button on the left of this site, or by sending money via PayPal to paypal@ukthrash.co.uk. If sending directly via PayPal (i.e. not through the "Donate" button on the left), please mark the amount as a gift, as there is a small transaction charge by PayPal which will be skimmed from the amount if it is marked as anything else."</p>
