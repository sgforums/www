            <div class='col-md body'><strong>FLOTSAM AND JETSAM: New Album Is '75 Percent Written</strong><br><br>Drummer Craig Nielsen of the veteran Arizona-based metallers FLOTSAM AND JETSAM has issued the following update:<br><br>"Let me be the first to confirm that we will be playing on the killer Metalmania festival on March 8 in Katowice, Poland, with MEGADETH, OVERKILL, and so many other great bands. This is the biggest festival in Eastern Europe and it will be at the end of our nine-show European tour that starts on March 1, bringing us to such cool cities as Barcelona, Budapest, Vienna, Frankfurt, and more.<br><br>"We are extremely pumped for this tour and the complete itinerary will be posted within two weeks. Also this weekend, on Dec. 14 we play at The Jumping Turtle in San Marcos (San Diego), and on Saturday, the 15th, at The Whisky on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. Our last Hollywood show at the House of Blues about 15 months ago, with ARMORED SAINT and DEATH ANGEL, sold out and was one of the best performances from FLOTSAM AND JETSAM ever, and we are hoping to repeat, or even outdo, that level of intensity once again.<br><br>"Finally, our new record is about 75 percent written and we plan on getting into recording mode within months. I know every band always says this, but we aim to make the very best record and will settle for NO filler songs and only the most primal vibe."<br><br>As previously reported, FLOTSAM AND JETSAM, ATTACKER and CHRIS CAFFERY will perform at the TMT Metal Fest 2008, set to take place July 18-20, 2008 in Endicott, New York. Also scheduled to appear are TANTALLON, MAGUS BEAST, ARES and ICARUS WITCH, with more to be announced.<br><br>For ticket information, go to www.myspace.com/tmtmetalfest.<br><br>FLOTSAM AND JETSAM's classic debut, "Doomsday for the Deceiver", was reissued as a "Special Edition" by Metal Blade Records on October 31, 2006. The original album was produced by Metal Blade CEO Brian Slagel and FLOTSAM AND JETSAM and is the group's sole release to feature Newsted before he joined METALLICA as the replacement for Cliff Burton. More information is available at this location.<br><br>FLOTSAM AND JETSAM's "Live In Japan" DVD was released in February 2006 via Crash Music, Inc. The disc was filmed over three shows in Japan in January of 2004.<br><br>FLOTSAM AND JETSAM's latest album, "Dreams of Death", is available now on Crash Music, Inc. The CD was engineered by Tom Giatron and produced by FLOTSAM AND JETSAM and Tom Giatron at Genesis Studios in Phoenix. Travis Smith did the cover art.<br><br>Watch FLOTSAM AND JETSAM's "Straight to Hell" video (taken from "Dreams of Death"):<br><br><span style="color: green;">FIY Flotsam and Jetsam is ex-Metallica bassist Jason Newsted's previous band.</span></div>
