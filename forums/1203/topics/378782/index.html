              <p>Typically we think of female-fronted bands as being European, but like their varied music style, Echoes of Eternity doesn’t get pigeon-holed by tradition. This California based act that mixes thrash with symphonic and mainstream metal is spreading their wings with their second release, "As Shadows Burn." I recently talked with lead singer Francine Boucher about the new album, and discovered that though she is the main lyricist for the band, she’s actually a woman of few words, laced with a heavy dose of sarcasm and wit.</p>
              <p>Nichole Nash: First let’s talk about your new release, "As Shadows Burn." It’s just been released in the last couple weeks. How do you think it compares to "The Forgotten Goddess?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine Boucher: The music is a lot heavier and darker; the vocals are more raw and powerful. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: I did notice that when I listened to "Twilight Fires" on your Myspace page prior to the release. Was making the music heavier on this album intentional?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: We didn’t hold anything back this time and we weren’t afraid to combine heavier riffs with my vocals. Twilight is one of my favorites. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: You chose to go with Massacre Records, an underground German label, for European distribution of "As Shadows Burn." Why’d you choose them over some of the bigger name labels?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: They were a better fit for us as far as European distribution goes. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: What differences were there in the production and recording this time compared to your first album?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: This new album has a heavier and raw sound. The first album we were going for soft ethereal vocals with a lot of harmonies and melodic guitar work. This album is a lot more metal. Whereas "The Forgotten Goddess" was more of a studio album with a lot of layers, the songs for "As Shadows Burn" were written for a live context, more simple, powerful and heavier. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Historically, most critics say sophomore albums are weaker than debuts. Are you nervous about how "As Shadows Burn" will fare in its reviews?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: So far we’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback and good reviews. I think we are truly starting to find our sound; we’ve all grown as musicians and still have a lot more growing to do. I’m proud of the first album but I think "As Shadows Burn" is definitely an improvement over the debut. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: A lot of people may not know how Echoes of Eternity came about. Why don’t you tell us how you and Kirk met, and how Echoes came together?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francince: I met Kirk and Brandon in college in Florida back in ’02. We moved to Los Angeles after graduation to find work. The band formed in ’04. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: You’re actually Canadian born. How’d you end up in the U.S.?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: I teleported here. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Do you see any big differences between the metal scene in Canada compared to U.S.?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Canadian crowds seem to go off a little more at shows. I don’t think there’s much difference in the scene, but then again I’ve been gone a long time. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Your original plan before signing on with Echoes of Eternity was to do film scores. Are there any thoughts of Echoes of Eternity doing something like that down the road?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Not at this time. It would be cool to be on a soundtrack, but we’ll see. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: I always ask the women in female-fronted bands: what’s it like being the only female in a band? Does it make touring any more difficult?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Not really, in the end were all just humans. We need food, shelter and beer. The only difference is when there’s no gas station in sight I can’t piss in a Gatorade bottle like my bandmates can. I’m a little jealous of that. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Speaking of touring, any plans to go out on the road to promote the new album?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: We might do a spring tour and a summer tour in North America, but nothing has been confirmed yet.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: What bands would you like to tour with?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: I’d tour with any good metal band. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Tell us about one of your live catastrophes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Nothing really exciting, tripped on my mic cable once and fell on my ass. It was hard for the guys to keep a straight face and not laugh! Although it was pretty funny.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: What music influenced you growing up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: I listened to just about every genre, and every decade from the 50’s to the 80’s, I’ve always been open minded when it comes to music. I’m influenced by everything. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: If you weren’t singing for Echoes of Eternity, what would you be doing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Spinning fire in a circus.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nichole: Anything else you’d like to share with our readers?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Francine: Life is short, enjoy it while you can.</blockquote>
