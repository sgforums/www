              <p class="review">Paul Speckmann's thrash metal project Abomination was just one of those bands
              you'd like to appreciate more but simply can't find the music too great to
              start with. Abomination's sound on their debut release is fairly satisfying
              with good guitars and Speckmann's rough vocals, but the extremely bare and
              depressive feel of this music makes it just a bit too difficult to bear with
              it. Not only that, but the riffs manage to dodge all attempts at memorable
              hooks, which only ensures that you cannot really recall much about the thing
              afterwards. Some respect must be certainly given for the band's honest style
              and dedication to avoid any gimmicks, but if the goal was to catch some long
              time attention then at least on this debut the outcome was not too successful.</p>

              <p class="review">It seems that somewhere between their first two albums Abomination found the
              magic to actually create some good music. While the band's debut album
              certainly left something to be desired, <em>Tragedy Strikes</em> shows vast
              improvement in all areas. With these tracks the band sound heavier, stronger,
              and simply more credible by tenfold. The difference between dull and powerful
              riffs can really be very narrow - while the style of this album is not that
              much different from its predecessor, the level of power is definitely
              something else. Suddenly even the lyrics appear perfectly fitting with strong
              feelings of fear, hate and pain, not just something taken from a thrash metal
              textbook. A lot of credit must be given to Paul Speckmann's intense vocals on
              this album; when the man roars into the chorus of <em>Pull The Plug</em>, the
              hair on your neck stands up. It should be noted that Abomination's output is
              still essentially very raw and unfriendly, and those looking for a bit more
              accessible style might not consider this too attractive - but those who give
              <em>Tragedy Strikes</em> a try may find that it wipes the table with a whole lot
              of other recordings.</p>

              <p class="review">It may be only inevitable that a band's sound would wear off in almost a
              decade, but it was still something of an unpleasant surprise to find how
              lacking in content Abomination's <em>Curses Of The Deadly Sin</em> turned out to
              be. For some reason the band saw it best to abandon all the previous
              achievements in both production and songwriting areas, and the result is bare
              and terse to a near hardcore-ish extent, making it virtually impossible to
              distinguish these songs from each other. Abomination's sound on this album is
              nearly as dull as on their debut, and it is practically one and the same kind
              of banging that goes on here, with no slightest variation whatsoever. Maybe
              <em>Curses Of The Deadly Sin</em> was meant to serve as a reminder that the band
              were still active, but compared to <em>Tragedy Strikes</em> this thing is almost
              an equivalent of being dead in the water.</p>

              <p class="review"><em>The Final War</em> marked the end of the nineties for Abomination, and you
              can say that the band could have done better than this. The style of this mini
              album is very similar to <em>Curses Of The Deadly Sin</em>, which is not a great
              surprise since there was only a short time between these recordings. The most
              distinctive feature of this release is without a doubt the production that is
              awfully bass-heavy. With the bass brought way too up front, it is very close
              to dominating the mix over everything else. Occasionally you cannot even hear
              the guitar properly except for some undeniably stylish solos. If the bass
              sound on Overkill's <em>W.F.O.</em> sounded quirky enough to you then this is
              going to be a tough one to bear. For other than that, pretty much the same
              points apply to <em>The Final War</em> as the previous release - this album is
              as raw and unapologetic as it gets, and it really takes an acquired taste to
              consider it a masterpiece.</p>

              <p class="review">Despite having their origins in Germany, Accuser did not play your most
              stereotypical German thrash metal of the time. While the band's debut release
              <em>The Conviction</em> consists of energetic and straightforward thrash metal
              with a fairly dark sound and snarling vocals, it is varied enough to maintain
              some interest. The music still sounds a bit rough around the edges, especially
              the vocal delivery is quite nasty at times and can take some time to get used
              to it. Nevertheless, the band keeps up some respectable speed and the rough
              delivery sort of matches the intensity of music at this early stage. <em>The
              Conviction</em> may not be the most refined Accuser release, but it is no less
              an essential document of the band's style in the beginning.</p>

              <p class="review"><em>Experimental Errors</em> is not radically different from Accuser's debut
              release, but the production is slightly better and also the style is more
              consistent. Actually this mini album feels even a bit more one-dimensional in
              comparison to its predecessor, which may explain a few stale moments during
              the first half of the recording. The band sound more technically proficient,
              but the material as a whole has less variety than <em>The Conviction</em>. The
              frantic run of <em>Technical Excess</em> and <em>F.H.W.C.</em> manages to catch
              some attention despite the rather simple style of these tracks, therefore
              giving the latter half of this album a fair boost. Even though <em>Experimental
              Errors</em> was not too bad for another heavy release from Accuser, the content
              still could have been more memorable.</p>

              <p class="review"><em>Who Dominates Who</em> represents logical continuation of the style of
              Accuser's previous release <em>Experimental Errors</em>. The music does not
              exactly differ too much from your basic thrash metal, but some original
              technical touches and intense delivery manage to make it pretty satisfying.
              The band pull some notably fast tracks like <em>Symbol Of Hate</em> which,
              while not actually too special in themselves, become quite impressive due to
              the sheer speed alone. On a few tracks the hyperactive, layered drumming draws
              some serious attention, even resembling the sound of Holy Moses on the classic
              <em>Finished With The Dogs</em>. While Accuser's output is not nearly as
              creative, some memorable tracks are created as a result. Still, as a whole
              this album is a bit tiresome as the music is just not quite strong enough.
              <em>Who Dominates Who</em> has its moments but does not really compare to the
              better albums of the time.</p>

              <p class="review">With little actual differences from the preceding albums, <em>Double Talk</em> is pretty much another typical Accuser release. The production is slightly
              heavier than before but the general sound is very familiar from the past. It's
              the same basic thrash metal with some light technical touches, though this
              time the outcome starts to get a little tedious at some point. It's not like
              Accuser ever sounded particularly fresh or innovative but on this album the
              repetitious and occasionally even preachy style starts to get old pretty fast.
              Despite the effort certainly spent on this album, no tracks are really
              distinguishable from each other. Somehow the earlier releases had at least
              some more energetic feel to them. In the series of consistent Accuser albums
              <em>Double Talk</em> remains faithful to the band's original style but lacks
              some power of its predecessors.</p>

              <p class="review">Accuser took one more draw in a traditional vein in the form of <em>Repent</em>,
              an album that proves the band still had some respectable energy left. It is
              certainly less worn out than <em>Double Talk</em>, also grittier and more
              focused while sometimes almost monotonic in comparison to Accuser's older
              releases. Except for one experimental piece (<em>Metal Machine Music</em>) which
              is just a throwaway, the music is unarguably quite consistent and stylish for
              what it's worth. It must be emphasized that this album is a notably heavy
              effort, therefore it is sort of an achievement in itself that the outcome does
              not collapse under its own load. You must have heard better than this, but
              considering the band's whole discography <em>Repent</em> is far from the worst
              of its kind.</p>

              <p class="review">For a short period of time Acid Reign were one of the more interesting groups
              in the British thrash metal genre. Granted, they were not quite as creative
              and original as Sabbat, for example, but they were enthusiastic enough to
              stand out of the crowd. The band's debut mini album <em>Moshkinstein</em> is an
              energetic recording though the lesser quality of the production makes the
              impression somewhat lacking. The incredibly thin and rough guitar sound in
              particular tends to distract you from the music a bit too often. This kind of
              lousy guitar might have felt natural on some punk band's album, but thrash
              metal standards required something different. The band pumps up the speed in a
              respectable manner and the songs are not too bad if fairly forgettable, but
              it's the poor production values that really leave this album behind.</p>

              <p class="review">Acid Reign's first full-length release <em>The Fear</em> featured notable
              logical development over the preceding mini album. Even though the musical
              approach in itself is already more advanced than on <em>Moshkinstein</em>, the
              improved production alone makes the earlier effort pale in comparison. On this
              album Acid Reign's song structures became clearly more ambitious than on
              average, resulting in compositions that you could call even stylish at times.
              Although a lot of the music is still not too memorable even after several
              listenings, the overall impression is fairly positive and makes you want to
              get back to the album every now and then. While <em>The Fear</em> still leaves
              room for improvement, it shows some serious promise and makes a satisfying
              piece of old British thrash metal.</p>

              <p class="review">With their final album Acid Reign took a step into a more technical direction.
              <em>Obnoxious</em> is a bit slower but musically more refined effort than the
              band's early works. There are some noticeably sinister overtones in the music,
              and with a couple of particularly long, complex tracks the sound of this album
              is very focused and heavy (excluding the cranky joke track <em>This Is
              Serious</em>, of course). The added technicality doesn't mean that the songs
              would have got boring, in fact quite the opposite. <em>Obnoxious</em> has an
              original, intriguing feel that helps it to carry on through even some less
              inspired moments during the latter half of the album. <em>The Fear</em> may be
              faster and more immediately accessible release, but based on its obvious
              strengths <em>Obnoxious</em> is bound to have some more long-lasting appeal.</p>

              <p class="review">Of Brazilian origins, Acid Storm played speed/thrash metal in a fairly typical
              but energetic vein. <em>Why?... Dirty War</em> manages to capture the authentic
              sound and feel of the scene at the time although musically it is an ordinary
              effort with no reason for big praise. Basically Acid Storm end up sounding
              almost like another run-of-the-mill band in the beginning of their career,
              with few distinctive features to differentiate them from the horde of other
              bands from the same period. Admittedly the output is formally adequate and the
              album plays rather unobtrusively in the background, but if you expect to get
              anything more out of it then you may be in for a slight disappointment. As the
              music doesn't really stand out of the crowd in either good or bad, it's just
              the lack of true character that makes <em>Why?... Dirty War</em> a bit
              forgettable in the end.</p>

              <p class="review">More ambitious than Acid Storm's debut release, <em>Biotronic Genesis</em> is
              something of a sci-fi concept album - clearly more diverse than what you might
              expect from a typical release in the genre, although far from the most classic
              implementations of the style. The music is all quite professional sounding and
              occasionally even semi-innovative with some additional technical touches and
              flashes of competence above the average level, therefore it's a slight pity
              that most of it escapes memory even in the long run. The first couple of
              tracks are compact enough to leave a mark, but some longer and more complex
              pieces later on do not quite make the same kind of impression anymore. The
              album is still worth a listen, though, even if only for the fact that it
              represents a slight departure from the most standard ways of thrashing out.</p>

              <p class="review">Apparently originally recorded already in 1988, this delayed release of
              Acridity's only full-length album is certainly not too groundbreaking. <em>For
              Freedom I Cry</em> is somewhat fair thrash metal that stays too much on the
              generic side. Technically the band sound just as capable as anyone in the
              scene, but somehow they manage to avoid all attempts to breath some life into
              their music. The riffs are absolutely bland, which renders this album totally
              unmemorable. The production lacks heaviness and together with the undeveloped
              vocals gives the album a slightly thin sound. Maybe it's partially due to the
              release issues, but in some way <em>For Freedom I Cry</em> seems a bit
              unfinished. Based on this album only it is hard to really say anything about
              the actual talent Acridity potentially had.</p>

              <p class="review">In the beginning Acrophet were nothing more than a full-fledged speedcore
              band, which shows on their debut. <em>Corrupt Minds</em> is total speedcore with
              little in the way of straightforward, hasty riffs and simple shouts for
              vocals. At first this album sounded so narrow and one-dimensional to me that
              it wasn't even funny, though later on I learned to bear with its plain style.
              Except for the short instrumental <em>Intro To Corruption</em>, the music
              doesn't really offer too much to catch a hold of, which makes this album sound
              pretty much the same. Only after careful listening one can pick some
              characteristics from the songs to help to differentiate them from each other.
              Although speedcore/hardcore fans may treat <em>Corrupt Minds</em> as a solid
              offering, I must say this kind of thing is not really my cup of tea.</p>

              <p class="review">With their second album Acrophet introduced some more diverse elements in
              their music, which in this case was only a good thing. <em>Faded Glory</em> is
              mostly standard thrash metal with some speedcore features still left around.
              The band sound more convincing than before, though despite the added variety
              and some decent riffs the music is still not too exceptional by any means. On
              the other hand, even the more hardcore-ish pieces blend smoothly with more
              advanced tracks (<em>Dead All Day</em> is actually one of the most memorable
              songs on this album). With a little more evolution and time Acrophet might
              have been able to create something truly interesting, but as <em>Faded
              Glory</em> was to remain their last album, this never really happened.</p>

              <p class="review">Of the few Australian thrash metal bands, Addictive appear to have been
              among the heavier and also better ones. <em>Pity Of Man</em> has a very good,
              thick and crunchy sound, which suits the band's heavy but rich style very
              well. The tracks are pretty heavy stompers, not exactly too imaginative but
              with some nice details appearing throughout. Somehow the band sound a bit more
              varied than your average thrash metal act although the music is certainly not
              too experimental or anything. Despite the convincing delivery and very
              consistent style this album is strained by some dullness in the songs which
              sound a little too samey. Still, Addictive deserves some respect for putting
              out a fairly interesting album with <em>Pity Of Man</em> even though the result
              is not quite there to become really great.</p>

              <p class="review">With their second release Addictive continued almost directly in the style of
              the band's debut. Supported by some very good and heavy production, <em>Kick
              'em Hard</em> maintains the characteristic crunchy sound not unlike <em>Pity Of
              Man</em> though the music here is generally more varied. At first this album
              sounds highly promising as <em>Waiting For Yesterday</em> and the title track
              are some of the fastest and heaviest pieces around. However, the album on the
              whole is more diverse than the first few tracks and does not fully succeed in
              sustaining the initial intensity. All tracks still carry the customary, even
              original Addictive sound, it's just not as consistent as on <em>Pity Of Man</em> though certainly not without its moments either. While not providing anything
              too remarkable, <em>Kick 'em Hard</em> still has some special appeal that makes
              it a bit more distinguishable from your average pack.</p>

              <p class="review">Although ADX must be one of the better known French speed/thrash metal bands
              out there, their recordings in English consist of this one album only. As the
              band had already released several albums before this, it is no surprise that
              <em>Weird Visions</em> features very refined if quite conventional speed/thrash
              metal. The first half of the album is pretty satisfying with some fairly
              effective riffs, but the second half contains a few tracks that are simply not
              quite as powerful. Probably a bit more energetic approach might have helped
              the result as now a couple of songs still carry some more mellow influences
              from the band's past. Nevertheless, the major instrumental pieces <em>Mystical
              Warfare</em> and <em>Trouble</em> are particularly stylish and well done. With a
              little more aggressive feel this album on the whole could have been more
              memorable, now it's pretty nice but definitely not too remarkable.</p>

              <p class="review">The band is called Affliction, the album <em>The Damnation Of Humanization</em>,
              and just by seeing the cover and not hearing a single note beforehand you
              could already be dead certain that the music is going to be straight-out
              thrash metal and maybe not too original for such. Indeed, the record starts
              out pretty flat and boring and doesn't really change its course during the
              lengthy tracks. To add to the textbook feel, even the lyrics cover seemingly
              serious topics in quite a stereotypical way. It's only the fastest thrashers
              like <em>Tombs Of Forgotten Souls</em> and <em>Trying To Be Cool</em> that provide
              some refreshment among the less distinctive and more tiresome stompers - too
              bad there's only a couple of these moments on the whole album. Affliction's
              sound is laudably heavy and technically there is no reason to complain, but
              with such a generic offering it was clearly too little and too late.</p>

              <p class="review">Agent Steel were undeniably one of the most classic speed metal acts in the
              eighties, whether you liked their style or not. <em>Skeptics Apocalypse</em> has
              a certain raw edge over the band's later recordings, which gives this album
              some additional boost. The first half is essentially faster and more furious
              than the second, therefore resulting in something of a dual nature. In
              addition, the vocals of John Cyriis are pretty much in the love-it-or-hate-it
              category, with an extremely squeaky tone that you may find either perfectly
              fitting or downright terrible. Anyhow, Agent Steel's vintage sound remains
              kind of appealing even today, featuring some great riffs and first class
              guitar work, and the most unrestricted and ultra-fast tracks like <em>Agents Of
              Steel</em> and <em>Bleed For The Godz</em> are still second to none in all their
              rage. Although <em>Skeptics Apocalypse</em> shows its age, it is still a highly
              noteworthy release in many ways.</p>

              <p class="review"><em>Mad Locust Rising</em> feels essentially like an aftertaste of <em>Skeptics
              Apocalypse</em>. This short mini album is still firmly in the high-speed realm
              except for a cover version of Judas Priest's <em>The Ripper</em>, and there are
              no signs of reduced intensity at this stage yet. Excluding the short intro and
              the cover song, there are only two actual original pieces on this release, but
              they are almost guaranteed to satisfy anyone who found the fastest tracks of
              the band's debut album enjoyable enough. For better or worse, the vocals are
              still bound to divide opinions, but you cannot deny that Agent Steel's sound
              was easily distinguishable as well as stylish in its own particular way. In
              this sense <em>Mad Locust Rising</em> just provides more of the same in a tested
              and tried format.</p>

              <p class="review">Not sure if it's the production of the original recording or the pressing of
              this re-issue by Old Metal Records, but the sound quality of Aggression's
              <em>The Full Treatment</em> leaves a lot to be desired. It's a real shame
              because this Canadian band surely lived up to their name as far as the sheer
              energy of music is considered. The whole album is extremely fast, heavy and
              raw, with little attention been paid to other than nearly mindless thrashing.
              The sound of <em>The Full Treatment</em> is so brutal and without compromises
              that it may actually be too much for some listeners - I must admit that at
              first this album sounded like a total mess to me, too. However, after some
              careful listening with patience, one cannot help but start to appreciate the
              undisputed attitude of this music. This recording essentially makes 95% of
              everything else out there sound like jazz in comparison. I only wish there
              would be a decent re-release of this album some day, as now the poor sound
              quality lessens the full impact.</p>

              <p class="review">Agony's <em>The First Defiance</em>, the only release from this Swedish band,
              starts and ends with some very fast and furious tracks but features also some
              less frantic material. The main issue with the music is that it's rather
              generic and unoriginal though this was a common problem with many other bands
              in the scene as well. The songs are very well done and the production is good
              and all, it's just that this band pretty much failed to make themselves
              distinguishable from countless others. Only occasionally do some riffs hint of
              some genuine ideas but these moments are quite rare after all. The band sound
              professional and the music is up to any thrash metal standards out there but
              the neutral, even clinical feel of the music tends to leave the listener
              pretty bored. As an example of technically well-done thrash metal <em>The First
              Defiance</em> certainly serves its purpose, but the lack of true character and
              spirit somewhat weakens the result.</p>

              <p class="review">Agressor's long lasting career in French death metal circles was based on
              strong thrash metal roots which still prevail on the band's debut album.
              <em>Neverending Destiny</em> can be best described as an unstoppable riff
              machine running at ultra-speed. From the very first moments, this album is
              characterized by amazingly fast but mostly quite distinctive riffs that weave
              an unsurpassable wall of sound. Complete with your typical but fitting
              death-ish growls for vocals, these tracks are like one long thrash metal epic
              divided into shorter sections. At some point it starts to seriously repeat
              itself, which is kind of unavoidable, but when you evaluate this album as a
              whole the strengths of the consistent style compensate for the weaknesses.
              Initially I didn't think too much of Agressor's output, but <em>Neverending
              Destiny</em> has grown on me over time.</p>

              <p class="review">Together with Stone, Airdash were probably considered a pioneer thrash metal
              act in Finland. The band's debut album <em>Thank God It's Monday</em> is your
              typical minor release in every sense - very ordinary, straightforward thrash
              metal with few highlights. The production is pretty stale and the sound of
              this album leaves a lot to be desired. Even some better production values
              wouldn't help the music too much, as with the undeveloped, annoying vocals
              that border on monotonous, and mostly generic, unmemorable riffs, this thing
              is far from impressive. A couple of songs like <em>Helluva Noise</em> and
              <em>Spit Your Guts</em> are not too bad, especially the former may as well be
              the best track on the whole album. Still, this debut release from Airdash is
              mostly remarkable only for possible nostalgic reasons, certainly not for the
              quality of music.</p>

              <p class="review">With their second release <em>Hospital Hallucinations Take One</em> Airdash
              improved over their debut just a bit. The music is notably more polished and
              fluent but rather emotionless speed/thrash metal, this time with some
              surprisingly classy vocals. The album sounds very consistent but almost
              completely lacks any memorable individual tracks, which makes it a bit hard to
              remember anything from this album afterwards. Not only that, but the band
              sound strangely restrained, which leads to a somewhat generic feel of the
              music. A little more aggressive approach might have helped the result a bit,
              now most songs sound more like technical exercises than really enthusiastic
              thrashers. Nonetheless, this album bears a certain touch of quality on it and
              the music is quite stylish in its own particular way. It's just that compared
              to a number of other albums in the scene <em>Hospital Hallucinations Take
              One</em> is too much on the bland side.</p>

              <p class="review">Airdash really took an ambitious step with their last release. Not nearly as
              dull as its predecessors, <em>Both Ends Of The Path</em> can be best described
              as highly technical thrash metal positioned somewhere between Coroner and
              Death Angel with its style. It's still pretty easy to recognize the band's
              sound even based on the vocal style alone, but this time the music contains
              some particularly rich elements and even progressive touches that make it
              somewhat extraordinary. Tracks like <em>Liquid Bliss</em> and <em>Silent Wall</em> are some prime examples of this captivating style whereas <em>Choking Child</em> proves that Airdash could also put out some highly effective straightforward
              thrashers when they really wanted. A couple of tracks appear a bit too "high"
              for my taste, but as a whole the result is surprisingly good. In the end, this
              is one of those albums that can leave you rather puzzled at first - the best
              way to get into it is just to give it a few spins one after another until the
              music either proves itself totally meaningless or suddenly becomes fully
              understandable in a splendid way. In this case I found the latter option to be
              closer to the truth.</p>

              <p class="review">Certainly not the best known example of Polish thrash metal, Alastor must be
              among the more obscure bands at least from today's perspective. On the other
              hand <em>Syndroms Of The Cities</em> doesn't really provide much of reason why
              the band should have been better recognized anyway. Alastor's sound has some
              slight technical tendencies, and attempts at creating a characteristic style
              with some semi-creative touches are obvious, but the result never really takes
              off. Maybe this is due to quite unmemorable riffs or rather thin vocals, but
              most songs here simply lack all substance. It goes without saying that the
              album as a whole does not exactly catch your attention in the long run. While
              <em>Syndroms Of The Cities</em> is not a complete put-off and has something like
              a few interesting moments after all, in the end this album tends to
              disappoint more often than not.</p>

              <p class="review">Allegiance's <em>D.e.s.t.i.t.u.t.i.o.n.</em> is a fair slab of vintage thrash
              metal from Australia. This album got a production of nice quality, heavy and
              stomping, and generally the band sound fairly good even though the vocals can
              appear quite pretentious at times. Musically the outcome is not too bad, just
              quite unsurprising to say the least. While it may be difficult to point out
              any blatantly copied elements, you cannot avoid a recurring sense of deja vu
              every now and then. It is not only due to some external influences, but most
              of these tracks tend to repeat the same kind of formula which effectively
              contributes to the slightly derivative feel of this album. Allegiance had it
              technically well done, but that does not quite compensate for some obvious
              lack of credibility.</p>

              <p class="review">Among Italian speed/thrash metal albums, Alligator's <em>Immortal Entity</em> is
              not the most memorable release. In fact, you could call it quite dull as a
              whole. Alligator's sound is not exactly weak but not really powerful either,
              and while these songs probably cause no great distraction, there is not much
              reason to give the album a second thought after you have been through it a
              couple of times at least. The music has a fair deal of variety for sure, but
              it is no great help when you tend to forget most of it with little effort, no
              matter whether trying hard to concentrate on the thing when it is playing.
              <em>Immortal Entity</em> contains some very unsurprising basic elements, and
              without any really original or even moderately appealing details a lot of it
              is bound to appear just too pointless.</p>

              <p class="review"><em>Cerebral Implosion</em> was obviously something of a turn into right
              direction for Alligator. While the band's style remains quite similar to their
              debut release, this second album appears a tad heavier and also stronger when
              compared to <em>Immortal Entity</em>. The outcome sounds generally more
              convincing and credible than before, although musical differences are not
              huge. Despite some advancements, it is still not unreservedly distinctive
              enough to completely avoid an occasional bored feel. The songs make a
              consistent bunch, but the quality is nowhere near the top class, and you
              cannot help wondering what a Beatles cover (<em>Help</em>) is doing here. Maybe
              just not as striking as one might wish for, at least <em>Cerebral Implosion</em> can be called a fair improvement over its predecessor.</p>

              <p class="review">Based on <em>Unknown Entity</em>, Amnesia had something of a distinctive sound
              among the other British speed/thrash metal bands. The band's style is
              something in the Megadeth/Metallica vein though with cleaner vocals and a less
              heavy production. Despite the overall feel being not too aggressive, this
              album builds up some decent speed. Occasionally the songs remind me of Bitter
              End and Dyoxen with their fairly technical feel though Amnesia are definitely
              more listenable than either of those bands. However, mostly the songs flow
              without leaving a mark anywhere, and while <em>The Final Revelation</em> and
              <em>Perish</em> are a couple of clever tracks they are not quite enough to
              make the whole album appear impressive. Amnesia's relaxed sound is kind of
              nice and the band apparently had some style of their own, but as a whole
              <em>Unknown Entity</em> sounds somewhat bland with only a few slightly
              interesting moments.</p>

              <p class="review">Let it be said that while the later recordings of Anacrusis can be pretty
              unlistenable in the conventional sense, the band's debut album fortunately has
              a lot more common with the pure thrash metal realm than their later
              explorations into the progressive swamp. <em>Suffering Hour</em> is a relatively
              rough dose of thrash with fairly catchy riffs and only some intricate touches
              hinting at more ambitious developments to come. Actually it is hard to find
              anything seriously faulty in this album, except maybe a few quirky moments in
              the vocal department. While Ken Nardi's vocals are more original than the
              norm, occasionally their balance between rough screams and clean, even melodic
              bits is not too well adjusted. Regardless, with several hard-hitting pieces
              like <em>R.O.T.</em> and <em>Twisted Cross</em> this album shows that Anacrusis
              could have pretty successfully filled a thrash metal niche of their own just
              by sticking to the style of <em>Suffering Hour</em>, without any urgent need to
              seek into more complex directions.</p>

              <p class="review">Better not let Angel Dust's reputation as a major power metal act fool you
              with this one. Done with the original line-up before the band decided to seek
              less extreme directions, their debut <em>Into The Dark Past</em> is a classic
              piece of German thrash metal filled with steady high-speed riffs throughout.
              The consistent speed is really a major aspect of this album - although the
              riffs are mostly not too distinctive, smashing fast thrashers like <em>I'll
              Come Back</em> and <em>Legions Of Destruction</em> hardly leave anyone cold. Just
              listen to <em>Fighter's Return</em> and try to stand still while this whirling
              wind unavoidably blows your socks off. Granted, as a whole this album is a bit
              one-dimensional and after the initial impression the overall effect starts to
              wear out little by little, however, the best moments make you get back into it
              again and again. While not a perfect album by any means, <em>Into The Dark
              Past</em> has a lot of special appeal for the fans of old school thrash metal.</p>

              <p class="review">Pick a random thrash metal band from the eighties underground scene, and you
              might end up with something like Anialator. This band's debut mini album is
              short and simple, the production being sufficiently rough around the edges,
              and you only need a glimpse of the song titles to see what the whole thing is
              all about. But it is actually not that bad - the band's attack is relentless,
              and you are easily convinced that they gave it everything, even if it wasn't
              really much on a global scale. Sometimes it can be refreshing to just abandon
              all thoughts and let this kind of energetic pack of fury to ravage around you
              for a moment. One thing you are guaranteed to remember from Anialator's debut
              is the violent feel of it, and even that is certainly more than in many other
              occasions.</p>

              <p class="review">Anialator's second mini album marked a slight deviation from the band's
              original style. Although this release may look very cheap at the first sight,
              the music is not terribly bad - just so typical and sometimes even bland that
              it is difficult to miss anything of it afterwards. In essence, the new tracks
              tend not to appear quite as uncontrolled and wild as earlier, which leads to
              an impression of more average quality. Something worth a special note is the
              guitar sound that is a lot more slick and almost surprisingly modern in
              comparison to the rough sound of the band's debut release. All things
              considered, these songs play in a fair but quite forgettable manner, and there
              is really not much reason to dive into the depths of this album in search of a
              hidden gem, simply because there is none to be found.</p>

              <p class="review">At first it might seem that Anihilated's <em>Created In Hate</em> plays like a
              blatant Slayer rip-off. But while it may apply to this British group that
              individuality was probably not their most important asset, the result deserves
              some credit for having been done in a genre-savvy manner. Actually, ignoring
              the most obvious similarities with other bands, there are some honest, even
              sympathetic aspects in Anihilated's music. Based on the sound of this album,
              one cannot deny that the band certainly gave it all they had. The production
              is awfully spartan, though, reducing the level of power from its fullest
              potential. But as far as the music is considered, <em>Created In Hate</em> is
              something more than just an ugly duckling. Sure, it seriously repeats itself
              and is not exactly an exercise in originality, but somehow this album catches
              something essential from the sound and spirit of the thrash metal movement in
              its most pure form.</p>
