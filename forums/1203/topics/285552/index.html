            <div class='col-md body'><strong>METALLICA, ANTHRAX Guitarists Get Number Of The Beast Tattooed On Their 'Bottoms'</strong><br><br>Legendary rock photographer Ross Halfin revealed on his web site that he took pictures of METALLICA in the Los Angeles area on Friday, October 12, presumably while the band was in the studio recording its new album. According to Halfin, "the highlight [of the session was] Kirk Hammett [METALLICA guitarist] insisting I photograph '666' which he'd had tattooed on his bottom after drinking 'Jack' with David Lee Roth. Kirk told me his hero, Scott Ian [ANTHRAX], has got the same on his bottom. 'We did it together!' He was extremely proud of this..."<br><br>Video footage of tattoo artist Kat Von D talking about how she tattooed "666" on Hammett and Ian's asses following the VAN HALEN rehearsal in September can be viewed below (fast-forward to around the 6-minute, 15-second mark).<br><br>METALLICA posted an update at the band's official web site this past week saying that the band was still at work on its ninth studio album. The post stated, "Things are as you would call it, status quo, consistent, constant, invariable, unaltered, unchanged, unfailing, uniform, unvarying. Pretty much what we are trying to say is: work is continuing and all is good in the METALLICA hood. As soon as we do have something new to report, you will be the first to know of course! OK, enough of this chit chat...back to work!"<br><br>METALLICA has announced that it will record its upcoming performances at Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit, scheduled for October 27 and October 28 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. Both of the band's performances will be available for download at LiveMetallica.com.<br><br>The shows, which will also feature PEARL JAM's Eddie Vedder, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS bassist Flea and others, will benefit the Bridge School, which was co-founded by Young's wife Pegi to assist children with severe speech and physical impairments.<br><br>METALLICA's next album is expected out sometime in early 2008.<br><br>Video footage of tattoo artist Kat Von D talking about how she tattooed "666" on Hammett and Ian's asses following the VAN HALEN rehearsal in September can be viewed below (fast-forward to around the 6-minute, 15-second mark).</div>
