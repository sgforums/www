              <p>Wendy Dio has issued the following new health update about Ronnie James Dio, who was diagnosed with stomach cancer:</p>
              <p>"Well, now it has been Ronnie’s 7th chemo, another cat scan and another endoscopy, and the results are good – the main tumor has shrunk considerably, and our visits to Houston are now every three weeks instead of every two weeks.</p>
              <p>"Ronnie and Vinny went down to the studio to have a listen and see how the DVD is coming along, NOT to overdub anything as presumed by Hoss2112 or Shattered 73 on the Blabbermouth rants. I was very annoyed to read these comments, and if they were truly fans of Ronnie’s, they would know #1) that Ronnie is a SINGER and does not need to overdub a live show, and #2) He would never cheat his fans by overdubbing a Live DVD. I will not be showing these comments to Ronnie, as I know they would hurt and upset him as they did me. He has been going to the REHEARSAL studio to sing, not the recording studio!</p>
              <p>"Ronnie’s cousin Rock (from The Rods, who used to be in Elf with him) flew in from New York to visit Ronnie for a week and they enjoyed spending some time together, going to the movies and taking walks, and Ronnie and Rock went to the studio to master Rock’s new album, which Ronnie sings a track on. And Craig Goldy will be coming over to start writing new songs with Ronnie next week. It will be great to see him again, as he has been away touring with the British band Budgie.</p>
              <p>"That’s all I can think of right now until the next update. God bless you all and we are still reading all the wonderful cards and letters."</p>
