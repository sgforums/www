              <p>.....For those metalheads who is thinking of getting a girlfriend who is not into heavy metal music.. Gotta read this... from an "Advice" topics;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>My Bloody Valentine :<span class="h1_subhead">How do I convince my boyfriend that death metal is not mood music?</span></h1>
              <h1><span class="h1_subhead">
              <p><strong>Dear Prudence,</strong><br>My boyfriend is absolutely not a sadistic sex killer. He is a kind and generally considerate person. But he loves listening to gruesome death metal—music best described as blasting noise with deranged growls and shrieks that often (from what I can tell) celebrates horrendous misogynistic violence. He respects that I am not a fan of this music and doesn't usually play it when I am around. But he gets a huge charge from listening to it when we have sex and is comparatively lackluster at the deed when he doesn't have it to fire him up. Although I find the music unpleasant and distracting, I don't object when I feel focused enough to block it out. What really bothers me are the awful themes. It disturbs me that a seemingly well-adjusted man in his 30s is aroused by torture fantasies set to music. He says it's just about the "energy" for him, but I really don't know what to think about someone who wants to listen to Cannibal Corpse when he makes love to me. Am I being oversensitive about this?</p>
              <p>—Blasted</p>
              <p>Dear Blasted,<br>It's always a comfort to know the person you love is not a sadistic sex killer—so right there you have something to build on. I like the image of you two making love: He's cranking up Cannibal Corpse's romantic classic "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8hrf3ux5jc"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Bloody Chunks</span></a>" while you're sticking in the ear buds of your iPod and desperately turning up the volume on Michael Bublé's version of "I've Got You Under My Skin." When you're not having sex, you say he's "generally considerate," which is not exactly a declaration that "I've got you under my skin/ I've got you deep in the heart of me/ So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me." But couples need to have sex, and he finds it hard to perform unless you are forced to listen to songs of female dismemberment. As you describe it, you get through these sessions by trying to disassociate yourself from what is going on. This does not sound like a formula for sustained intimacy. I don't think you're being oversensitive about the gruesome nature of your boyfriend's favorite erotic imagery, especially since you are supposed to endure it. I have a hard time seeing where this relationship is headed—it already sounds like a Cannibal Corpse.</p>

              <p><br>indeed it is. tsk, but the point is lay people or muggles aka those non-metalheads don't understand why Heavy Metal started out. Black Sabbath wanted it to be like a movie, a horror movie. <br><br>What comes out in a horror movie isn't totally true right? Same goes to Heavy Metal! Not all the stuff they write is real, cannible corpse's fucked with a knive isn't real right?<br><br>These people are just outa their mind! (Muggles) Too blind to see the greatness of this genre. HAHA!</p>

              <p>.....you're right Your Majesty! Those people who criticise heavy metal music ought to be shot. Heavy metal music is so wide that you can't really pin-point what is right or wrong. These shallow minded people base their views on the bands' name and their wordings. There are a lot of pop and hip hop songs that can do more harms than heavy metal. There are even heavy metal bands that sing christian songs too.</p>
              <p>.....yeah right, Muggles are like maggots, they eat the fresh out of heavy metal. The only way to destroy maggots is to seek them out, burn them with bonfire and send them down to hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/bat.png" alt="bat.png"></p>

              <p><br>Btw im a Catholic, one thing i always say to myself if im in doubt: "Never let anything get in the way of what you believe." That includes religion. So lyric wise i usually close a blind eye to it haha! Enjoy the music not listen to the song for the wrong reason.<br><br>Anyway we metalhead stay tog is not by the numbers, its like a cult the lesser the more exclusive it is! The more high we feel. <br><br>Btw SG has gone Metallica and F1 crazy... saw like 5 different people wearing Metallica shirts!? Only 1 Dimmu Borgir ang moh and I was wearing Morbid Angel haha! Heng none of the 'tellica fans were wearing Death Magnetic shirts.<br>Saw one St Anger -.-</p>
