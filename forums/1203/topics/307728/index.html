              <div id="showItems_ctl00_storyPanel" class="regular">UK's <a href="http://www.terrorizer.com/">Terrorizer</a> magazine recently conducted an interview with legendary Bay Area thrash drummer <strong>Paul Bostaph</strong> (<strong>TESTAMENT</strong>, ex-<strong>SLAYER</strong>, <strong>EXODUS</strong>, <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong>, <strong>SYSTEMATIC</strong>). <br><br>On rejoining <strong>TESTAMENT</strong>:<br><br>"I got a phone call from <strong>Chuck</strong> [<strong>Billy</strong>, <strong>TESTAMENT</strong> frontman]'s wife <strong>Tiffany</strong> — I'm really good friends with <strong>Chuck</strong> and <strong>Tiffany</strong> — and she asked me, 'Where are you and what are you doing?', and I was like, 'I'm not doing anything'. I wasn't in <strong>EXODUS</strong>, I'd just left the band and was like, 'Why? What's going on?' Evidentially, <strong>Nick Barker</strong> wasn't allowed in the U.S. because of some visa issues and they had two
              weeks worth of shows to play and they had no drummer and they didn't
              want to cancel. I think that when we got off the road the band was
              going to jump right into pre-production to finish the record and that's
              when we heard that <strong>Nick</strong> was having trouble getting into the
              country and probably wasn't going to be able to. In a bittersweet way I
              ended up doing the record and in a strange way it makes sense, because
              we all grew up in the same scene.<br><br>"I grew up watching <strong>TESTAMENT</strong> in clubs, right before <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong> got signed, and it really feels like the real thing all the way down to
              how the songs are written now. This line-up for me has more of a feel
              of a family than any of the other line-ups did." <br><br>On Bay Area thrash:<br><br>"Thrash
              metal is a West Coast thing, not that nobody else can do it but there's
              something special in the Bay Area sound, we had a scene going on, we
              had <strong>VIO-LENCE</strong>, <strong>DEATH ANGEL</strong>, <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong>, <strong>TESTAMENT</strong>, <strong>METALLICA</strong>, <strong>EXODUS</strong> — not to mention a ton of other bands. Literally five or six nights a week I could go to a club in the Bay Area with <strong>Tegio</strong>, the old bass player for <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong>, and there would always be a show. Sundays, no shows, but Monday through Saturday always a show."<br><br>On drumming:<br><br>"One
              of the things I've always loved about being in a band is that you get
              to see great music for free and you get to drink beer for free, that's
              cool. And I love to watch other musicians. When you go on tour you get
              to see some fantastic drummers play like <strong>Joey Jordison</strong> and <strong>Tomas</strong> from <strong>MESHUGGAH</strong> and then you go home and practice and go, 'Well, I suck,' so you have
              to practice, you have to practice very hard and you take that energy
              into the writing process. <br><br>On the <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong> reunion:<br><br>"Everything happened at the same time, we got together and met with <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong> and said, 'Yeah, we're gonna do this', and right that same week <strong>TESTAMENT</strong> had called me and I said, 'Hey guys, <strong>TESTAMENT</strong> have called me, we're writing songs and this is what to expect,' and after that <strong>TESTAMENT</strong> asked me to join and it's impossible to be in two places at one time. So <strong>Craig</strong> [<strong>Locicero</strong>, guitar] thought of <strong>Gene Hoglan</strong> [<strong>DEATH ANGEL</strong>, <strong>DEATH</strong>, <strong>STRAPPING YOUNG LAD</strong>] and they called up <strong>Gene</strong>, I mean c'mon, it's <strong>Gene Hoglan</strong>, it's gonna be fine, it's gonna a great reunion. I've been in a couple of bands in my life — one or two! — and I've seen <strong>SLAYER</strong> with <strong>Dave Lombardo</strong>, I've seen <strong>SLAYER</strong> with <strong>Jon Dette</strong>, I've played in <strong>SLAYER</strong>,
              I been out with them and I've watched them play with someone else ,
              it's not weird for me anymore. It doesn't matter who's in the band, I'm
              a fan of music and if I'm there, I'm there to enjoy the music. My only
              concern with <strong>FORBIDDEN</strong> was who's going to play drums for them as they were, and when I heard it was <strong>Gene</strong> — it's going to be a great live show for everybody."<br><br>On moving between bands:<br><br>"Every
              band that I'm in, I never think, 'Well, I may not be here'. I never
              approach coming into a band from the standpoint of 'it's gonna end'.
              When I was in <strong>SLAYER</strong> I jumped into it heart and soul, when I was in <strong>EXODUS</strong> I jumped into it heart and soul because that's the only way to give 100
              per cent. Let's face it, I wasn't there for money, I was there for the
              music and every time I'm in a band I treat it as if it were my own band
              because that's the only way I'm gonna give the best I got."<br><br>On his discography:<br><br>"One of the last records I did was <strong>SYSTEMATIC</strong> and that's not my favourite, that's right at the bottom of the list. I liked the punk record I did with <strong>SLAYER</strong>, <strong>'Undisputed Attitude'</strong>,
              that was a fun record because I didn't grow up a punk kid and that was
              my education into punk. My favourite part of that record was <strong>'Gemini'</strong>, the last song on that record because that was probably the slowest <strong>SLAYER</strong> song I ever played on so it gave me a chance to stretch out and play some big long fills. <br><br>"I'd have to say my second favourite is actually <strong>'Shovel Headed Kill Machine'</strong> with <strong>EXODUS</strong> because <strong>Gary</strong> is one of the most brutal guitar players, I think, in my opinion, ever,
              he's very underrated and more people need to pay attention to how that
              guy plays guitar. When I first came in to record that record, I had two
              weeks to learn that record and record it, which is also one of my
              favourite things about it, the first rehearsal I started playing with <strong>Gary</strong> I was like, 'Holy cr*p, this guy's got to be the best rhythm guitar
              player I've ever played with!' It's brutal, when they asked me to join
              I asked them to send me some songs and <strong>Gary</strong> send me a demo. I
              was talking to him on the phone and he said, 'I was thinking of
              throwing these songs out, I think I like one of them,' and I was like
              'Okay, cool' and I didn't ask him which one. I listened to it on the
              way home and I parked in front of my house and listened to it again and
              was like, 'Holy f*ck, this is good shit.' I called <strong>Gary</strong> on the phone and was like, '<strong>Gary</strong>,
              just curious, which one of these songs did you like and which ones were
              you thinking of throwing out?' and he was like, 'well you know,' and I
              was thinking about this one song that was my least favourite and it
              turned out to be <strong>'I Am Abomination'</strong> and I was like, 'Dude, you're crazy.'"<br><br>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.terrorizer.com/">www.terrorizer.com</a>.</div>
