              <p><strong>Lacrimosa Comments On Upcoming 20th Anniversary Album "Schattenspiel"</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.gothtronic.com/Goth/img_/Music1/sub/Lacrimosa-Fassade.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Lacrimosa is set to release a 20th anniversary album titled "Schattenspiel" on May 7th, 2010. The band has now issued the following comment about the release:</p>
              <p>"The one or other might ask himself, why don't Lacrimosa simply release a 'Best of Compilation'?<br>Very easy: a 'Best of Compilation' is for people who don't really know a band and with such a compilation of hits they shall be forced to like this band. But what about those who are listening to a band for many years and who have all their CDs already? What shall they do with a 'Best of'?<br>For the 20th anniversary we didn't want to make a CD for those who didn't care about Lacrimosa in the past, we made a CD for those whom we have to thank for this anniversary: you, our audience!</p>
              <p>"And since we've been asked by you many times if we could finally release those compositions that we didn't include to regular albums, we now meet your wishes and present 16 unreleased and 2 brand new tracks on 'Schattenspiel'! But, some may ask now, what shall we do with left-over songs? At Lacrimosa there is no class society between the songs, because our aim is not to write hits, our aim is to express feelings and feelings are relative. If we didn't release a song at its time there was always a reason for it. An example: on 'Schattenspiel' (= shadow play) there are compositions which were as important to the development of Lacrimosa as supporting pillars in the house of our art and we couldn't just pull them out of this building back in those days.</p>
              <p>"In the course of the years we kept on building and those parts of the house are self-supporting nowadays. Today we can tear out those pillars without everything collapsing! Thus every title on 'Schattenspiel' has its own history and in the booklet of the CD I write about all those stories and explain the relevance for Lacrimosa of each title. With this in mind we wish you exciting and moving moments with the music that in the past 20 years we have played in the shadow!"</p>

              <p>In November 1990 the Swiss music scene started to get curious about Tilo Wolff's Project LACRIMOSA as his music in form of a tape "Clamor" reached the people of the underground scene. This melancholic music filled with classical elements, surrounding poetic lyrics and topped by an emotional voice was something which fascinated many and quickly a scene was raising up, which was nearly already forgotten.</p>

              <p>For his first release, the LP "Angst", Tilo Wolff found his own label HALL OF SERMON for giving LACRIMOSA the entire artistical freedom. The music of LACRIMOSA was already that time developing from album to album without adapting any other music styles or denying it's roots. Through this progressive development, LACRIMOSA was challenging the tolerance of a widespread audience in the diverse facets of music-lovers around the world.<br><br>LACRIMOSA's music had been coloured by several guest musicians, but in the beginning of 1994, Anne Nurmi joined the former soloproject to become a permanent member. Anne Nurmi, who was the keyboarder, singer and one of the grounders of the Finnish band TWO WITHCES, was setting new musical accents with her singing and composing.</p>

              <p>The following releases were managing to combine the roughness of Metal and Gothic Rock, without loosing the most obvious love for classical music. With this revolutionary sound, LACRIMOSA was pioneer and obstetrician for music styles like Gothic Metal and Symphonic Metal, which both became a huge trend!<br><br>After the collaboration with the world-wide known LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, top 20 positions in the German and Polish music-charts, sold-out shows in Europe, Middle- and South America, on May the 2<sup> nd</sup> 2005, just on time for their 15<sup> th</sup> anniversary, the new studio album “Lichtgestalt”  (luminous figure) is going to be released!<br><br>With its musical variety, its full expression and its sympathetic production this masterpiece is going to set new standards and highlights a remarkable career!</p>
