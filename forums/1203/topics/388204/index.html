              I took that as a challenge and since I really don't listen to much
              Christcore, except Demon Hunter (which wasn't on Carlos' list by the
              way = fail), I couldn't say anything. Anyways, I decided to do a Top 10
              list of Born-Again Christians in Metal. <br> <br>
              </span></p><h1>10. Fieldy - Korn</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/fieldy-korn_04g.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> He quit drugs cold turkey when his father, a born-again Christian, told him his dying wish was for his <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/17687/Top-10-Born-Again-Christians-in-Metal.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">son</span></a> to find God.<br> <br>
              <h1>9. Dan Spitz - Anthrax</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/danspitz.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> I always thought Dan Spitz was Jewish? I guess he gave up on that and
              became a Christian. It must be why he and Dave Mustaine are such good
              friends.<br> <br>
              <h1>8. Tom Araya - Slayer</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/Slayer_-_tom_araya.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> "If guitarist King writes a good <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/17687/Top-10-Born-Again-Christians-in-Metal.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">song</span></a>,
              Araya puts his beliefs aside, "I'm not one that's going to go, 'This
              sucks because it's contrary to my beliefs.' To me it's more like 'this
              is really good stuff. You're going to piss people off with this.'"
              Drummer Dave Lombardo is also a born-again Christian.<br> <br>
              <h1>7. Peter Steele - Type o Negative</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/PeterSteele4.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> "I was born a Roman Catholic and I think that I have gone back to my
              faith. You know, people ask me are you a born-again Christian and I
              said no I am a dead-again Christian I have always been dead. I believe
              in Jesus Christ and God and the whole thing but, you know, I don't
              shove it down anyone's throat. You know, it's a very private personal
              thing and faith is really strong and I really want to see my mother and
              father again. And also I can't believe that somebody like Hitler and
              Mother Teresa are going to the same place after death. I can't believe
              that." Besides, you don't get a cock that big unless you are blessed by
              the Lord.<br> <br>
              <h1>6. Nicko McBrain - Iron Maiden</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/Nicko+McBrain.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> "Without this church and this relationship with God, I don't know where
              I'd be right now. I just know that I want to be able to use my life for
              God.”<br> <br>
              <h1>5. Dee Snider - Twisted Sister</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/snider.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> At the PMRC hearings, Dee Snider mentioned in his Statement to the
              Senate that he considers himself Christian, saying "I was born and
              raised a Christian and I still adhere to those principles.<br> <br>
              <h1>4. C.C. Deville - Poison</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/cc-poison-baby.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> Deville became a born-again Christian a few years back.  we wrote about it, got lot's of hate mail, nuff said.<br> <br>
              <h1>3. Alice Cooper - Alice Cooper</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/AliceCooper.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> Although Alice Cooper originally tended to shy away from speaking
              publicly about his religious beliefs, he has in recent years been quite
              vocal about his faith as a born-again Christian. "Drinking beer is
              easy. Trashing your hotel room is easy. But being a Christian, that's a
              tough call. That's real rebellion!"<br> <br>
              <h1>2. Brian 'Head' Welch - Korn, Head</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/brian_head_welch.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> In 2005, Head stated that he has "chosen the Lord Jesus Christ as his savior, and will be dedicating his <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1225/17687/Top-10-Born-Again-Christians-in-Metal.html#"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ff0000 ! important; font-family: Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">musical</span></a> pursuits to that end." Not many quit a major band like Korn for their
              beliefs. I think the only guy that quit a metal band over his religious
              convictions.<br> <br>
              <h1>1. Dave Mustaine - Megadeth</h1>
              <br> <img src="http://www.thegauntlet.com/photo/dave-mustaine.jpg" alt="" width="350"><br> Dave has had Satanic bands tossed from shows before.  He has also stated "I got saved in 2002." <p></p>
