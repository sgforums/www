An except from the chat follows:<br><br><strong>Headbanger's Blog</strong>: When did you start seeing signs that <strong>Glen Drover</strong> [former <strong>MEGADETH</strong> guitarist] might not be happy with what he was doing in the band?<br><br><strong>Mustaine</strong>: You know, out of respect for <strong>Glen</strong>,
              I'm not gonna really talk too much about that. He was having some stuff
              that he was dealing with, and we're talking about someone who left for
              personal matters. He didn't get into it, so why should I? I frankly
              don't know what [made him want to leave] other than what he told me,
              which is he wanted to leave to be with his family. Now, <strong>Glen</strong> is the brother of our drummer [<strong>Shawn Drover</strong>],
              and out of just sheer stupidity you would talk shit about an exiting
              member when he's got a sibling in your band, so I've got nothing to
              say. And even if I was mad a <strong>Glen</strong>, which I'm not, I wouldn't say anything about it. <strong>Glen</strong> is a talented player, and he had given the thumbs up to <strong>Chris Broderick</strong> [new <strong>MEGADETH</strong> guitarist] coming in, and <strong>Shawn</strong> is the one who even recommended <strong>Chris Broderick</strong>. So, I was really excited.<br><br><strong>Glen</strong> was influenced a lot by <strong>Chris Poland</strong>, and we don't play a lot of <strong>MEGADETH</strong> from the <strong>Chris Poland</strong> era. <strong>Chris</strong> was totally influenced by <strong>Marty Friedman</strong>, who we play a lot of music from. It was the longest lineup, and for subsequent guitar players after <strong>Marty</strong> left, I tried to find people who sounded a little more like him than just kind of going in whatever direction I wanted to.<br><br>There was no real rhyme or reason between the choices of a player like <strong>Chris Poland</strong>, and then jumping to someone like a Jeff Young and then jumping to <strong>Marty Friedman</strong>. It wasn't like I was advancing or progressing or following any kind of educational graph to get from <strong>Chris</strong> to <strong>Marty</strong>. The good thing now is every song is ready to go. <strong>Chris</strong> has been down here playing the songs with me. We play them in slow-mo,
              we film them on video cameras and we're going over every single note â€”
              so much so that we even corrected things that bass and drums were doing
              wrong while we were doing rehearsal here prior to leaving for the tour.
              We got deep down in there and found a bunch of stuff that made it even
              tighter. I loved playing with <strong>Glen</strong>. This is a new chapter. I think we've taken it up a level. I appreciate <strong>Glen</strong> helping me find <strong>Chris</strong>. Now it's time to move on.<br><br>Read more at <a href="http://headbangersblog.mtv.com/2008/01/30/podcast-preview-megadeths-dave-mustaine-talks-about-lineup-shift-discusses-giantour-reveals-sotu-taking-year-off/">Headbanger's Blog</a>.</div>
