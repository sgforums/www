              <p id="spIntroTeaser"><strong>While walking home from the busstop this 
              week, a 13-year-old Norwegian school boy stumbled upon four wolves. In 
              the end, it may have been his love of heavy-metal music by the band 
              Creed that saved his life.</strong></p>
              <p>Walter Eikrem listened to music on his mobile phone as he often does 
              as he made his way home from school in the southern Norwegian town of 
              Rakkestad earlier this week. The path leading from the stop where he 
              catches the school bus to his family's farmhouse traverses a gently 
              sloping hillside. All of a sudden, he made out something gray on the 
              hillside. "At first, I thought it might have been the neighbor's dogs," 
              he later told TV2, Norway's largest commercial broadcaster. What he 
              actually encountered, though, were four wolves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="spMInline"></div>
              <p>"I was afraid they would attack me," Walter told the Norwegian tabloid <em>VG</em>,
               describing the incident, which took place on Monday. But he didn't let 
              his fear show. Remembering his parents' advice, Walter pulled the 
              earphones out of his mobile phone, turned the volume all the way up and 
              blasted heavy metal music over its miniature speakers. At the same time,
               he yelled as loud as he could while flailing his arms about wildly to 
              scare off the pack of wild animals.</p>
              <p>"The worst thing you can do is run away because doing so just invites
               the wolves to chase you down," Walter told TV2. "But I was so afraid 
              that I couldn't even run away if I'd wanted to."</p>
              <p><strong>Overcoming the Wolves</strong></p>
              <p>The plan worked. Eikrem said he was able to drive away the wolves by 
              playing the song "Overcome" by the American hard-rock band Creed. "They 
              didn't really get scared," Walter said. "They just turned around and 
              simply trotted away."</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, the local newspaper <em>Rakkestad Avis</em> reported on 
              Walter's encounter with the wolves and even gave his mother a chance to 
              tell her side of the story. She said she had actually intended to pick 
              her son up from school, but got delayed while shopping in Rakkestad and 
              didn't make it on time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="spMInline"></div>
              <p>"I have a completely guilty conscience," she told the paper, "because I 
              knew there were wolves in the area. The previous evening, we saw three 
              wolves on the edge of the forest when we were putting our horses in 
              their stall. The horses were panicky."</p>
              <p>Even so, at least she had repeated to her children often enough just 
              how they needed to behave if they ran into any wolves. "Just don't run 
              away," she would tell them. "You can even get a little poodle to run 
              after you if you run away, even if it doesn't even actually want to 
              attack you. And the same holds true for wolves."</p>
              <p>In the end, the son's memory of her self-defense warnings -- and a little heavy metal -- appears to have saved the day.</p>
