              <p>These are some of the hidden messages within the Somewhere In Time
                                  artwork. Some of them are well hidden, others are not. The easiest way
                                  to see all of the hidden messages is too look at the vinyl version of
                                  the album as the CD is much smaller and cuts lots of the detail from
                                  the art. This article was adapted from the Iron Maiden FAQ by Tore

              <ul>
              <li>Ruskin Arms reference (old pub they started playing at)</li>
              <li><strong>Clock says 23:58 (2 Minutes To Midnight)</strong></li>
              <li><strong>West Ham 7 Arsenal 3 - soccer score, showing their favorite team West Ham </strong></li>
              <strong> well in the lead. Incidentally, West Ham are THE IRONS </strong>
              <li>Aces High bar, complete with a spitfire flying above</li>
              <li>The Rainbow bar (another old club they frequented in the early days)</li>
              <li>Live After Death, Blade Runner on the movie theater</li>
              <li>The movie theater is the Philip K. Dick cinema, who is the author
                                  of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", on which the movie Blade
                                  Runner is based.</li>
              <li>Marquee Club (another old club they frequented in the old days)</li>
              <li>Phantom Opera House</li>
              <li>"Bollocks again and again" under "Phantom Opera House". This might be a
                                  reference to the hidden "Bollocks" message on the Powerslave cover ('Bollokz is
                                  written on the wall in the bottom right of the Powerslave cover)</li>
              <li>Ancient Mariner Seafood Restaurant</li>
              <li>Herbert Ails on the overpass (probably a reference to Frank Herbert,
                                  author of DUNE, who wouldn't allow Maiden to use it as a song title)</li>
              <li>"Tonight GYPSY'S KISS", under the 23:58 sign (hard to see) - reference
                                  to Steve Harris' very first band</li>
              <li>Hammerjacks - a reference to one of the band's favorite bars in the US,</li>
              <li>Hammerjacks Night Club in Baltimore, MD. The Night Club closed on Jan 1 94.The concert hall is still open, however.</li>
              <li>Long Beach Arena</li>
              <li>Nicko is dressed in old-time flight goggles (reference to him being a pilot).</li>
              <li>Nicko is also wearing a shirt saying:  "Iron What?"</li>
              <li>On the back cover there is Icarus falling from the Sun with burning
                                  wings in the top right corner, in front of the Bradbury Hotel. This of
                                  course refers to "The Flight Of Icarus."</li>
              <li>The "Bradbury Hotels International" sign - is this possibly a
                                  reference to the popular futuristic author Ray Bradbury (author of such
                                  classics as "The Martian Chronicles", "Ice Nine", etc.)?</li>
              <li><strong>If you look closely, you can see the shadow of the reaper on the back cover in front of the pyramids. </strong></li>
              <li><strong>The pyramids refer to the sleeve of "Powerslave"</strong></li>
              <li>All the Japanese around the covers could be connected to "Maiden Japan" and IRON MAIDEN's other performances there.</li>
              <li>"Maggies revenge" on the back cover refers to Margaret Thatcher.
                                  She and the British government had a dispute with IRON MAIDEN back in
                                  1980/1981 with the "Sanctuary" and "Women In Uniform" singles,
                                  depicting her as dead
                                  on the ground (killed by Eddie, of course) and hiding behind a wall
                                  observing Eddie picking up chicks, respectively.</li>
              <li>The street Eddie is standing on is Acacia Avenue, a reference of
                                  course to
                                  "Charlotte the Harlot" and "22 Acacia Avenue", the Charlotte
                                  series.(You can see this above the IRON MAIDEN poster on the extreme
                                  right side)</li>
              <li>In one of the windows on Acacia Avenue, you can see a girl (supposedly
                                  Charlotte the Harlot herself) sitting in a chair.</li>
              <li>Bruce Dickinson is holding a brain, ala PIECE OF MIND.</li>
              <li>Tehe's bar is where they got the guys to sing backup vocals in the sing-along part in "Heaven Can Wait."</li>
              <li><strong>Batman standing under Tehe's bar sign</strong></li>
              <li>Tardis from Dr. Who is above the Rainbow Club sign</li>
              <li>Asimov Foundation Building in background</li>
              <li>Tyrell Corp. right above the causeway (replicant manufacturer in Blade Runner)</li>
              <li>Cat with halo, which seems to pop up all over the place</li>
              <li>Eye of Horus above Webster sign to left of Eddie's gun</li>
              <li>One of Eddie's eyes is actually a 'laser'.  This probably comes from the "2 Minutes To Midnight single"</li>
              <li>There is a litter box right under Eddie's left leg attached to the
                                  lamppost. This is exactly the same as the litter box attached to the
                                  light post on the IRON MAIDEN debut album, to the left of Eddie next to
                                  the wall.</li>
              <li>There is a metal plate that connects Eddie's nose to the top of his
                                  head. If you look at the wall to the right of sign that has the
                                  football score on it, you will see that little metal plate with two
                                  screws that Eddie always has on his head (since the PIECE OF MIND era
                                  at least, when he was lobotimized. The screw isthere now to keep his
                                  head all together in one piece! - Eddie Got his brain back at the end
                                  of the Visions Of The Beast DVD).</li>
              <li>There are also these neon signs, one of which says something in
                                  Hebrew, the other one in Russian. The Hebrew bit probably means "God"
                                  (?), the Russian bit is pronounced KEPHIR and means "yoghurt". This is
                                  (or rather was) a rather common sign on the buildings indicating a
                                  milk-store in Russia.</li>
              <li>There are three people climbing down behind of Eddie at the Websters Bar as in the end of the 2 Minutes to Midnight video</li>
              <li>Theres a Sanctuary music shop under the Phantom Opera House Bar</li>
              <li>This is a very boring painting - backwards message just behind Eddie's  right leg</li>
