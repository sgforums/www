              <p>Stumbling out of the smoke are the young men of death metal crew Cannabis Corpse. Promoting their new album "The Weeding," the band hit the road with Ramming Speed to preach the word of Bud and metal to the masses. Cannabis Corpse descended on New Orleans the same day that the President did and discussed with me very important issues. The interview was cut short by an altercation that spilled into the street from the bar. A transcribed version follows.</p>

              <p>Buick Mckane: Welcome to New Orleans. How’s the tour been going so far? Landphil: Good as shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Nickropolis: Awesome. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s awesome. Your third album “The Weeding” just came out this month. So how’s it going? How’s it selling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Well, we’ve been on tour for about two weeks now and all the shows have been great. There hasn’t been any shitty shows, so…</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: Atlanta was a rager! Gainesville was a rager! </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedgrinder: We had a lot of cool warehouse shows. “The Weeding” EPs been well received. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s great. I usually ask that question, but nobody wants to answer it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: Out on Tank Crimes Records for the low price of $4.20. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Tell me more about the album. What is it about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: Well, it’s not a full album. It’s a teaser to the one that’s coming out next. And it’s got two songs that are about how the buds are eventually coming here to rape the Earth and turn it into a big, demonic pot party.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: By demonic pot party he means funky pot party. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: Yeah, funky pot party. And just two songs about, anecdotes about people getting fucked up when they smoke weed. Evil shit like that. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Have yall had any weird stories about when you’re smoking pot and something happens?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: One time this guy brought me this weed, and then I smoked it and he said,” That ain’t weed. That’s crystal meth, homes!” And then I woke up in Deebo’s chicken coop. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Pigeon coop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Pigeon coop. Get it right, dude. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s cause yall smoke too much pot, you can’t remember.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: We got good weed stories, but we don’t remember. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: The album costs, in the CD form, $4.20, right? Is that any significant number for any reason?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: Highway 420 is the first time we ever smoked weed. We were on that highway. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: I smoked weed for the first time on this tour. It’s weird. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Nickropolis: I’ve actually never smoked weed before. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: I was just kiddin’ about that. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: If it comes to the end of the night and we have a long drive the next day, we have to have the marijuana. So, a message to everyone that comes to the shows, we need that thing. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: We need it. We need it. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: We used to be a straight-edge crew, but our parents hated it. So we decided to smoke weed so that they would accept us more. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Oh, okay. My mom told me to smoke weed instead of drink.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Your mom is kinda…I want to meet that mom. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: You do. She’s apparently really hot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Oh, you got a hot mom that smokes weed. </blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Tell her to come to the show. We got a couple single guys in this band. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: How many are single? Raise your hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Well, we can’t give exact numbers right now. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: How ‘bout I do this instead of raise my hand [gestures]? </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Zoom into this guy! I guess he’s the singlest. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Weedy: Well, I wasn’t expecting company. </blockquote>

              <blockquote>Landphil: [Hallhammer] is the second most singlest. </blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: No, I got…[looks to the side]. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: He keeps looking that way, but there ain’t nobody there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Hallhammer: Oh, that’s where my pretend hoes are. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Alright, I really like the tour poster with Beavis and Butthead zombies in a post-apocalyptic world. Who came up with that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: Weedgrinder came up with the concept. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Landphil: I didn’t know it’s been cancelled. </blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: But he needs to make something else that’s fun. Some of yall are in other bands. How do you find time to make music and tour with this band?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Nickropolis: Whenever we can. [Landphil] is pretty busy. </blockquote>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: This Spring, you did a cameo in a movie. In the Loop. How fun was that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Nickropolis: It was a pretty sweet gig. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
