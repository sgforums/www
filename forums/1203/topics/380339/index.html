              <p><strong>From a report in Rocklegend magazine;</strong></p>
              <p>I honestly thought the day would never come when I would see the legendary AC/DC in person. They haven’t been my way in years. But, like a message from God (or Satan), I received the news that indeed the duck-walking schoolboy would be visiting my town. My worn-out copy of AC/DC Live at Donington gave me high hopes of an incredible show that I prayed (to Satan) the aging men could still pull off. They not only equaled the spectacle, but far exceeded it, and it was one of the most energetic, loud and stunning shows I’ve ever seen.</p>
              <p>The opening band was The Answer from Northern Ireland. The singer had a voice reminiscent of Sebastian Bach mixed with Axl Rose and had the hair to match. He danced and screamed while the band pumped out classic hard rock with a glam feel. Promoting their new album "Everyday Demons", they played fist-pumpers and ballads that had so much of a Southern feel that I couldn’t believe they were from another country, especially the North of their country.</p>
              <p>The lights suddenly shut off and we all knew what that meant. The blinking red devil horns were like red stars across the arena. Waiting in the darkness with great anticipation that we were all finally going to see our heroes, we stood at full attention. A cartoon started to play on the jumbo screen; a runaway train being fed coals by a devil in a schoolboy outfit. Two women burst into the engine room and seduce the devil boy, until they punch him out and try to stop the train. The devil boy gets up and tries to thwart their actions, but the train crashes through the screen on to the stage with fire and sparks flying off everywhere. Then the show starts as AC/DC walk on the stage and launch into “Runaway Train” off their new album “Black Ice.” Great song after great song, the band rocked the crowd, playing old favorites which had the whole arena singing along and new hits that are sure to become classics. Just a few of those being “Shoot to Thrill,” “You Shook Me All Night Long” and “War Machine.” One of my favorites was “Whole ‘Lotta Rosie” complete with a blow-up, dancing Rosie that straddled the crashed train. But the highlight of the show for many was during the song “The Jack.” During the interlude, Angus Young put on a strip tease. Everyone in the arena wailed for the man in his fifties to take his clothes off, which he did slowly. The pinnacle comes when he shows the crowd what boxers he is wearing, but I’ll leave that detail out so you may one day see it for yourself. Unfortunately, the show ended. But it wasn’t really over yet. Concert novices started to leave their seats, but the wise stayed put and just kept cheering. Suddenly, a hole in the stage opened revealing smoke and fire; the doorway to hell. Angus, wearing devil horns, came up through the hole and played a riff that we all know. “Highway to Hell.” Which was followed by “For Those About to Rock” with the twenty one cannon salute.</p>
              <p>This show made me feel like I did when I was just learning about rock n’ roll music, when I would nearly faint at the thought of being in the same town as these guys. I was singing every word until my voice was hoarse and dancing for two hours straight. I was in awe like a child when they pulled out the theatrics. However, years of shows and then the opportunity that the owner of this site gave me to meet bands through interviews (which I can’t thank him enough for) have made that feeling of extreme excitement fade a bit. But I know that that excitement can be revitalized when I’m completely absorbed in the band. I still have my Angus poster on the wall, I still watch my Donington concert on dvd and I can’t help but get excited when I hear “Jailbreak.” But being able to see them onstage and do things that they’ve been doing since they were kids was an incredible experience. I wish that Bon Scott was still around; not only to sing, but to see what his band has created since he left this world.</p>
