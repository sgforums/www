                  <p>This message is to all metal fans: we need to know our roots. No, I’m not talking about <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> or <strong>Motorhead</strong>, <strong>Elvis</strong> or <strong>The Rolling Stones</strong>. I’m talking about classical music. If you’re about to hit the back button, understand this is coming from a guy who plays an <strong>ESP</strong> and wears a <strong>Mastodon</strong> shirt. Hear me out, it’s for your own good.</p>

                  Remember the first time you heard “Far <strong>Beyond Driven</strong>, ” or, “<strong>The New American Gospel</strong>?
                  ” I hope I don’t speak only for myself when I say all I heard was
                  noise. For one reason or another though, I believed there was something
                  to them, and now I can’t get enough. The way we <em>learn</em> to enjoy music is by attempting to <em>understand</em> it. This means listening critically to a lot of an artist’s work and
                  recognizing patterns or themes, and familiarizing yourself with the
                  genre and other artists who attempt the same thing. A lot of times we
                  even check out the band’s Wikipedia to try and understand where the
                  individual members are coming from. It’s when you understand a lot of
                  different styles and sounds that you start to craft your own ideal,
                  from your own circumstances, with your own patterns and nuances.</p>
                  <p>Classical Music is just another form to analyze and understand. Let me
                  start by saying that as a heavy metal guy, the classical genres that I
                  most enjoy are the <strong>Minor Symphonies</strong> by <strong>Beethoven</strong> and <strong>Tchaikovsky</strong>,
                  the darker piano music of Chopin, and the slow wandering string
                  ensembles, listening as a song-writer, rhythm guitar player, and solo
                  guitar player, respectively. If any of the last three are you, I’m
                  tellin’ you, this stuff is great.</p>
                  <p><strong>Beethoven</strong> was an angry old man (like <strong>Lars Ulrich</strong>)
                  and his best music is full of tension, angst, and sorrow (what a
                  coincidence). The tools of any songwriter are the different
                  instruments, song structure, dynamics, tempo, transitions, repetition,
                  and the like. A 30-minute instrumental told by a symphony orchestra is
                  the most vivid, capable form this could take, and Beethoven is master.
                  He uses different combinations of instruments to create varying sounds
                  to express varying thoughts. He can utilize tempo and dynamics to
                  create smooth lines of singing melody, or harsh, abrasive rhythms.
                  Don’t believe me? Windows Media Center comes pre-loaded with <strong>Beethoven’s Fifth</strong>. Listen to it 5 times at full blast in your car and pay close attention. You’ll see.</p>
                  <p>The work of the rhythm guitar player involves chord progressions,
                  rhythms, and runs up and down scales. This is basically all piano music
                  is. Most of the piano music your familiar with is the boring, pre-fab,
                  G Major stuff by <strong>Bach</strong> or Mozart.
                  While these are masterpieces in their own right, they aren’t for us.
                  Chopin came about a hundred years after them and was on our side. He’s
                  the John Petrucci of the 17th century. He used massive chords, searing
                  left-hand runs, complex chord progressions, key changes, and had a keen
                  understanding of major/minor/augmented/chromatic scales, even tritone,
                  as every good metal guitar player should. I say from experience, this
                  stuff expands your musical imagination like nothing else, and you <em>will</em> see it in your playing. If you wanna see what I mean, copy/paste “<strong>Revolutionary Etude</strong>” to YouTube. Listen to the whole thing (c'mon, you’re reading this; you don’t have anything better to do).</p>
                  <p>Yo Mama is so bad at the cello, but Yo Yo Ma is not. Sorry, too easy, I
                  know, just trying to get your attention. But this guy understands his
                  medium in a Dimebag-esque fashion. Every note is played with lucid
                  attention to detail. They both capture the attention of the listener
                  and keep you begging to hear the next note. Remember the part of Master
                  and Commander where Russel Crowe is string-syncing (lip-syncing? ) to
                  that kick-ass cello ballad? Ya, that’s our guy. I can't help but think
                  of the guitar solos of "<strong>Walk</strong>" or "<strong>Psycho Holiday</strong>."
                  By listening to people who understand every nuance of sound their
                  instrument makes and use each one to their advantage, we learn to do
                  the same. Understanding how this is done this with different
                  instruments is essential to this process.</p>
                  <p>Musical skill
                  comes from practice. Musical talent comes from understanding. Both are
                  equally important, but the extent of the latter separates the good from
                  the <em>great</em>. You want to be a great musician. Understand classical music will bring you one step closer.</p>

              <p>.....you wear a Mastodon T-shirt, I listen to Mastodon too, that doesn't mean I 've to agreed with you. Metal is Metal, classical is classical. Why bring in Bach or Mozart into the scene. Tell me Mastodon is great, I agreed. Tell me Tch don't know what whisky, I give a thumbs down. If everytime when we listen to heavy metal music and need to incorporate some classical music into it, can imagine how messy it is.</p>
              <p>Enjoy metal as it is, try not to be so classically endowed. Keep it separated, as what the band "Offsprings" said in their song. The screaming and growling in metal is sweet music to me, the symphony from an orchestra might put me to sleep.....</p>
