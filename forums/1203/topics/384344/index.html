              <p>Five years since the death of “Dimebag” Darrell Abbott, and the world can not forget him. The circumstances in which he and several others died that night have changed the club experience forever; security is tight even in the smallest venues for fear that another deadly attack may occur. After his passing, countless tributes were given in his honor in the form of concerts, cover songs and personal statements from friends and fellow musicians. To add to the long list of tributes, Metal Hammer Magazine’s 200th issue being released on December 16 will include a “Dimebag” Darrell tribute album. Top metal bands such as Evile, Machine Head, Kiuas and Chimaira have come together to cover their favorite Pantera songs for the fifth anniversary of the tragic event.</p>
              <p>Former Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo gave an emotional statement about the deaths of Dimebag and four others stating, “I’m so sorry to the whole world. I love Dimebag Darrell ‘cause, let me tell you something, there was not one mother fucker like him…I love him like a brother loves a brother. Vinnie Paul, my other brother, I’m so sorry…What is the world coming to? This has changed the world. I hope you realize that.” In an interview with Revolver Magazine, he said, “I'd give one of my fingers to fix everything somehow, go back in time, or to have been there. This is a harsh thing to say, but if I saw some stupid son of a bitch coming at my guitar player with a gun, I would have knocked his block off, you know? I would have taken a bullet for that motherfucker."</p>
              <p>Dimebag’s brother and former drummer of Pantera Vinnie Paul comments on his brothers passing in an interview with Guitar World Magazine, “It's ruined my life and it's taken away so much joy and happiness from so many people. I guess what I'm trying to find is an answer for why this happened…"I know that Dime will live on forever, though, just like Jimi Hendrix and Randy Rhoads. It just happened way too goddamned soon. The music we made together will be around forever, but the thing that kills me is that we'll never get to do it again.”</p>
              <p>Many fans of the world-famous band are still hoping for a reunion; at least between Vinnie Paul Abbott and Phil Anselmo. But others believe that without Dimebag, Pantera would be incomplete, and a band reunion should not be attempted at all. There’s one thing that they do agree on; Vinnie Paul and Phil Anselmo mending fences. Because of a dispute before Dimebag’s demise, the two have not spoken to each other since. Just after the incident, no one knew the reason behind the slayings. Blame was thrown on many people, but the truth is that only one delusional man was responsible. The world would like to see the two talking again before the 10th anniversary creeps up on us.</p>
