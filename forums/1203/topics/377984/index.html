              <p>Celebrating their 25th year as a band (at least on Earth), Gwar is tearing across the U.S., destroying this planet city by city. I was lucky enough to have a quick chat with vocalist Oderus Urungus about how he's dealing with this special tour and what he was going to do to me after the show. A transcribed version follows.</p>
              <p>Buick Mckane : My God, that is a big rat (codpiece). Hello. Don’t get too close. I don’t want to get pregnant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus Urungus: You can get pregnant just looking at me, baby. I’m so hot. You probably are pregnant already.</blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: I hope not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: I’ll send you money. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Okay, that’s fine. Welcome to New Orleans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Yeaaaaaah! </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Happy 25th anniversary!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Thank you, dear. It’s very wonderful to still be alive after all the bullshit I’ve been through. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: How have you been celebrating?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Well, we’ve been playing shows every fucking night, we’ve been selling our new record “Lust in Space,” we just cut a new video called “Let Us Slay,” but that’s all bullshit because tonight we’re in New Orleans, one of Gwar’s absolute favorite places to play in the entire motherfuckin’ world. And it is on! </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s fucking awesome. Alright, so you just released “Lust in Space.” How’s it going?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Well, it’s going great. We’re back on MetalBlade Records. Yeah, that’s really cool. Uhhhh, I guess that’s about it, really. When you put out twelve records, it’s all kind of like the same after a while. It’s just that the fucking record is awesome, the tour is awesome; we’re out with a couple great fucking bands. Every band on this tour is on MetalBlade, every freakin’ fuckin’ one. So that tells you about MetalBlade or something. I don’t know what it tells you, but it tells you something. Something wonderful. So, yeah, it’s been great and etc., etc. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: You’ve been on the show Red Eye on the Fox Channel a few times…</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: That’s right, I am now the official interplanetary correspondent for Fox News. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Alright, are you going to do your own show one day?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Well, it they had any fuckin’ sense, they would, but, honestly, every week, I keep expecting to get the call that says it’s all over, but instead they just keep promoting me. Like now when I’m on, I do the whole fucking show. “Everybody Loves Oderus,” “The Gwar Show,” “The Gwar Network;” I don’t see why these things haven’t happened, and they’re fucking going to if I have anything to say about it. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: You tour so much, when are you going to take some time off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: We don’t have any time, we don’t need time. All we need to do is play shows, smoke rocks, bang hot babes, fight intergalactic assholes and save the world from fucking Cardinal Sin. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Speaking of hot babes, on your last album, you talked about a guy who came to interview you said when a guy came to interview you, you raped his girlfriend, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Well, it wasn’t really rape. It’s only rape if she doesn’t want you to have sex with her, right? </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: She wanted it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Well of course. I mean we tried to make it into rape, but she was just too into it. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Okay. Well, what are you going to do to me after this interview? I’m sorry, but my hand keeps hitting your rat, but it’s huge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Oh I know it’s kind of… (hitting Buick with his big rat codpiece). Well, I don’t know, baby. I’ve got to rock the house, but if your still alive after the show, then maybe we’ll hook you up, make you eat some rohypnols and we’ll see if we can park a car inside of you. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s sounds pretty painful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: You into it? </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: It does sound kind of cool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: You’ll love it. We’ll parallel park, turn the windshield wipers on, everything. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Sounds fuckin’ awesome. What is the craziest thing you’ve seen in a moshpit?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: A dude on a wheelchair being fucking passed around over the crowd. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: That’s what the last guy said! (Bobby Thompson of Job for a Cowboy)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: I’m beginning to think it’s actually the same dude. Just everywhere we go, this dude shows up in a Mosh Wheelchair. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Anything else you want to say?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: I want to say to the world: Gwar fucking rules! I want to say thank you to the motherfuckin’ people of New Orleans. This has always been a huge Gwar town. It’s the coolest fuckin’ city in the United States of America. It’s great to be back here tonight. Support Gwar in our big two-year long 25th Anniversary, and hell yeah “Lust in Space” MetalBlade Records. Gwar, Job for a Cowboy, The Red Chord, the fuckin’ tightest tour out there this fuckin’ Fall. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Whooo! Yay!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Yeah, yay. What she said. What the babe said. This is a righteous babe. </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buick: Thank you, Oderus, so much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Oderus: Aright, we’re going to party later, right? </blockquote>
