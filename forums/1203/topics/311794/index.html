              access the company's computer system in 279 of these instances. <br><br><strong>Mats Björkman</strong> denies the allegations and claims that someone else must have used his entry card. But his accomplice <strong>Stefan Håkansson</strong> has admitted his role in the theft and has implicated his colleague.<br><br>The
              scheme was uncovered after a tip was received that the record stores in
              Stockholm were selling CDs that were shipped from the Borås-based
              warehouse for a much lower price than those sold by their competitors. <br><br>The
              information about the weight on orders had been manipulated to conceal
              how much merchandise had been delivered. A package that according to
              the computer system contained 8 CDs in reality turned out to include
              more than 100 CDs plus a few box sets and DVDs.<br><br>According to the prosecutor, <strong>Björkman</strong> was the one that was in contact with the retailers and that received the money for the transactions. <br><br>The agreement between <strong>Mats</strong> and his accomplice was that they were to split the profits — which were
              estimated to be SEK 1.3 million (approximately $213,000) — equally.<br><br><strong>Mats</strong> stated in court that he doesn't undertand why <strong>Stefan</strong> would lie about him being involved in the theft scheme but he thinks it might be because <strong>Håkansson</strong> was trying to protect other people who might have been responsible for stealing the merchandise.<br><br>Before he went to court, <strong>Mats</strong> told the local paper <strong>Borås Tidning</strong>, "I'm innocent, no question about it."<br><br>During the court proceedings, he continued to deny his involvement in the theft while the other man confessed.<br><br>Based on the evidence, the court concluded that <strong>Håkansson</strong> had no reason to lie about <strong>Björkman</strong>'s role in the scheme and determined that prison was the appropriate punishment for both men.<br><br><strong>Björkman</strong>'s accomplice received a sentence of one year and nine months.</div>
