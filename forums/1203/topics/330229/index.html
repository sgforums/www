              <p><br> The most well-known lineup (both LPs &amp; the EP) was Becerra, Lalonde, Torrao, and Sus.<br> <br> Possessed are hailed as the godfathers of the death metal genre (not to
                  be confused with the 70's psychedelic rock band from the UK.) They're
                  considered the first death metal group with the name coming from their
                  first demo entitled, "Death Metal." <br> <br> After the album "Beyond the Gates" was released, Larry Lalonde started
                  to have guitar lessons with Joe Satriani, who ended up producing the
                  "The Eyes of Horror" EP.<br> <br> Possessed was formed by guitarist Mike Torrao and drummer Mike Sus
                  (both around age 14 at this time), who then decided to bring in Barry
                  Fisk on bass. Fisk committed suicide shortly thereafter, and Jeff
                  Becerra from <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=19893">Blizzard (US)</a> came into the band, and soon was joined by second guitarist Brian
                  Montana. This lineup recorded the 1984 demo "Death Metal", and also an
                  appearance on Metal Massacre VI with the song "Swing of the Axe". <br> <br> At this time, Brian Montana was let go due to his subpar guitar
                  playing, and also because he did not fit in well with the band's image.
                  Larry Lalonde, previously in Blizzard with Jeff, was brought in, and
                  after some gigs with <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=173">Exodus</a> and other bands, the band was signed by Combat records, and the
                  legendary "Seven Churches" was recorded. After some US touring with <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=72">Slayer (US)</a>, <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=128">Venom</a>, and others, a second album was released, "Beyond the Gates".  This album led to a European tour with <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=115">Voivod</a> and Deathrow, and a US tour with <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=126">Dark Angel (US)</a>, the legendary Gates of Darkness tour, as <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=126">Dark Angel (US)</a> was touring in support of "Darkness Descends".  <br> <br> Tensions were rising within the band, and a final EP, "Eyes of Horror", was released. There were two gigs with <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=138">Megadeth</a>, and then Possessed broke up, with Mike Torrao putting the band on hold. Larry went to <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=684">Blind Illusion</a>,
                  where he found Les Claypool and founded Primus, of all bands! In 1991,
                  Torrao recruited Bob Yost on bass, Walter Ryan on drums, and Mark
                  Strausberg on guitar, and recorded a demo tape and played three gigs.
                  Then, Yost left, and was replaced by Paul Perry, and a second demo was
                  recorded in 1993, and that was just about the end. Jeff Becerra was
                  shot in a robbery, and paralyzed from the chest down, but has had a
                  successful career since (he did not go insane, or become born again!).
                  Mike Torrao works as a landscaper and has some musical projects
                  happening too, while Mike Sus got a degree in psychology, and is a
                  counselor in a drug treatment clinic. Possessed is now reformed with
                  Jeff's long-time friends from <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1470">Sadistic Intent</a> filling in on all instruments, while Jeff now only handles vocals due to his disability.<br> <br> (Most of this info taken from Lord Vic's site... http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/1409/possessed/posmain.htm )<br> <br> Funny fact: It's interesting when Larry Lalonde is asked about his past
                  being in this very "satanic" group, he denies having any part in
                  Possessed. Strange...</p>

              <p>Recomended: Seven Churches.<br><br>Milestone album in Heavy Metal history. It was this album where death metal was named. <br><br>The opening song, The Exorcist, slow at the start but get ready because you're in for a fucking awsome ride! Death Metal classic, you got to love it! Distorted dual guitar riffs which are insanely fast! Although it lacks the technical bit... imagine hearing this in 1985!<br><br>Solos are superb, well placed and not over used.</p>
              <p>Vocals are one of a kind, most other Death Metal vox i've been listening to, usually have that 'blowing in the water sound'... not jeff's! Jeff's vocal is one of the best part in this album along with the speed and aggression of the guitars and the song's themes.<br><br>Like every other death metal classics, their drums lack of variety... bass and snares and once in a blue moon the cymbal... While they're lacking in variety, the beats, and use of beats varies,
              which is a good thing too. It's not the same beats with the same drums
              over and over, so there is a little variation, but not enough to save
              it from sounding repetitive.<br><br>Bass is okay, blends in... maybe its just the recording at that time which makes the bass seem half pass six? Only can hear the bass well in the song: Holy Hell.<br><br>GET THIS ALBUM!</p>
