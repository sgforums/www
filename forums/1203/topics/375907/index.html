              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Brian "Head" Welch Responds To James "Munky" Shaffer's Comments About Being Rejected To Rejoin Korn</strong></span></p>
              <p>In light of the <a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=48313"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">recent interview that went online</span></span></a> where Korn's James “Munky” Shaffer states that the band said "No thanks" to the return of Brian "Head" Welch to the band, Head has released a statement of his own:</p>
              <p>"I recently learned of an interview that Munky gave where he said that I came to KoRn and asked to be taken back in the band. That's definitely not a complete and accurate picture. The full truth is that for about a year, ever since Jonathan publicly said he wanted me back in KoRn, KoRn's managers have been requesting my manager to work on getting me back into KoRn. The calls were initiated by KoRn's managers, not my manager. I shut the door on their requests many, many times over the last several months, through my manager. However, Fieldy personally called me during KoRn's last tour in Europe and we talked as friends for a long time. He also told me if I ever wanted to rejoin KoRn, or open for KoRn as a solo artist, the door was always open. Since Fieldy is sober now and a Christian like me, I thought it may be a good idea to visit with Fieldy, a friend of mine, to see what he was up to and what it was all about. I had a great time re-connecting with Fieldy. I mainly went to his house to connect with an old friend. The KoRn stuff we talked about was secondary, but it was discussed. Fieldy thought that Jonathan, Munky, and I should all meet AS FRIENDS; re-connect; and maybe discuss the possibilities. Both Jonathan and Munky refused that meeting. I learned a lot visiting with Fieldy. I learned that I love and miss my friends, but the visit confirmed to me that I have a different calling in life than to reconnect musically/professionally.</p>
              <p>"As far as Munky's comment that 'everything has been divided already' that is also not accurate. In fact, from January 2005 when I left, and for the next 4 years, KoRn failed to pay to me royalties that were due to me on records that I did with them. However, I don't believe this was done intentionally. We are trying to be patient and work with their management to get the financial issues resolved so that 'everything can be divided as we agreed long ago in our contracts.' I am optimistic that we can resolve it as friends.</p>
              <p>"I continue to wish nothing but the best for KoRn, and that includes all of my friends there--Fieldy, Jonathan and Munky."</p>
