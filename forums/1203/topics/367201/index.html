              <div id="showItems_ctl00_storyPanel" class="regular">Guitarist Phil Fasciana of long-running Florida death metallers MALEVOLENT CREATION was reportedly involved in a bizarre shootout at a convenient store in his hometown of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. According Fasciana,
              he pulled into a small store at around 3:00 p.m. Friday afternoon (July
              3) to get something to drink and walked right into a robbery in
              progress. "I went in this little store on my way home to get a
              chocolate milk, of all things, and little did I know, I was walking
              into a life-or-death situation," he says. "When I walked into the
              store, I did not notice anyone else in the store until someone started
              screaming at me and pointed a gun at me. I<strong> nearly shit myself, because
              the dude looked wacked out of his mind</strong> and fired four shots directly at
              me and I went down to the ground because I thought I was surely shot.
              After about 30 seconds, I realized I was not hit at all and the shooter
              thought I was dead or injured and started attacking the store worker
              when <strong>I snuck up behind the burglar and talked [to] him</strong> and took the gun
              out of his hands and told him to get out of the store. He then reached
              in his sock and pulled another gun out and pointed it at me and that's
              when I fired two shots into his head, killing him instantly! <br><br>"Never
              in my life has anything so twisted happened to me before and I would
              like to forget it ever happened, but I had no other choice. <strong>Lucky for
              me, the stupid crackhead burglar had the worst aim in the world </strong>and
              missed me with all four shots from about 10 feet away! Needless to say,
              all charges have been dropped and <strong>the store owner has offered me a
              lifetime of chocolate milk! Ha Ha! <br></strong><br><strong>"I have been in some scary
              situations before, but having someone shoot out you from that close and
              miss is a fucking miracle</strong> and I have no remorse for killing the
              assailant who tried to take my life and the store owner's. <br><br><strong>"I gotta move out of this town!! I have enough problems as it is!! </strong><br><br>"I
              am very lucky and could easily be dead at this moment, but I'm not and
              I'm gearing up for our Mexican, South American and European headlining
              tour which start at the end of July.<br><br>"I would like to put this
              behind me and not talk about it anymore. It was the most fucked up
              thing I have ever been involved with, besides my ex-girlfriend!!"<br><br>UPDATE: According to Phil, the entire incident was captured on the store's surveillance video, but the police has yet to release the tape.<br><br></div>
