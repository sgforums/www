            <div class='col-md body'>"RRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG"<br><br>The alarm clock sounded rather louder despite putting it on snooze again.<br><br>"Damn! I am late yet again!"<br><br>Hurriedly, i took a quick shower and put on the dirty clothes still on the laundry basket.Breakfast has been set and everyone appeared to have left the house. I hurriedly rushed to the carpark.<br><br>"What the hell! No car again?<br>How am i going to reach school for crying out loud?"<br><br>I took no chances and rushed to the bus stop, hoping and wishing that my bus would come soon. Momentarily, I thought I saw Dad in the car but i was too paranoid to be having doubts. Today's tutorial was rumoured to be the crux of the whole module.<br><br>My bus came and 2 hours later, i found myself showered by 25 pairs of angered glares as soon as i entered the classroom.<br><br>"Oh well! Why am i the only late person here? Please let there be another latecomer" I muttered to myself.<br><br>True enough, someone knocked and the door creaked open. Under the shower of the sunlight rays, basked in the glow of her radiance, stood a girl beautiful enough to carry me off to Neverland.<br>The teacher,stunned yet surprised, introduced to us the new student she has been talking about the past week.<br><br>"Je mÂ’appelle Isabelle", she muttered in fluent French. (my name is Isabelle)<br><br>"You can take a seat beside Andy here.You don't mind, do you?", the teacher snided to me with a wry smile.<br><br>"I'll be glad too" i replied with eagerness.<br><br>Her face was flawless with complexion of clay with stardust. Tall, slender yet maintained her elegant poise. I was too awed to be concentrating right now.<br><br>A million glances later, the class ended and i learnt nothing once again but the meaning of beauty.<br><br>My friends were busy asking me where to go to lunch but Isabelle just stood there, oblivious and clueless what she was supposed to do.<br><br>"Aimeriez-vous aller au dÃ©jeuner avec nous?" i asked her. (Would you like to go to lunch with us?)<br><br>She was obviously stunned that i spoke in her tongue but she cooly replied.<br><br>"Non remercie. Mon papa me choisit en haut"(No thanks. My dad is picking me up)<br><br>"Prendre le Soin et vous Voit" i told her with a wink in my eye. (Take care and see you)<br><br>As i entered the lift lobby, a familiar screeching halt of a car braking filled the lobby. It must be her dad. Bad driver.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">-to be continued-</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The rest of the day with Isabelle went fine.<br>We talked briefly about her life in France and her transition to Singapore. Little did i know that she owned a vineyard there.That struck a chord but i couldn't place where. A day with a beautiful girl like her makes me look forward to come to school early. I hope.<br><br>Thinking of sending her home, i called up my dad and asked whether he will be picking me up later from work.<br><br>"Dad, will you be picking me up from school? My friend may need a lift home", i asked excitedly.<br><br>"Sorry son, i have an important appointment later from work. Where are you schooling again,Son?",he answered.<br><br>"Uhhh its ok, Dad", i replied rather expectedly.<br><br>I was dejected.We hardly talked at home and he has his own life and i have mine. Half the time, i do not know where and what he does with his time.<br><br>"Je suis dÃ©solÃ© mais mon papa est un petit morceau occupÃ©", i told her sadly (I'm sorry but my dad is a little bit busy)<br><br>"C'est bon.Je peux parler anglais un morceau Ã  propos", she told me. (its ok. I can speak english a little bit by the way)<br><br>"Oh ok then. I see you tomorrow"<br><br>The whole evening, i was fidgety. I kept thinking about her and had abrupt feelings. I kept asking myself whether she is my dream girl or not. Everywhere i looked lay a figment or a mirage of her face.<br><br>That evening, whilst having dinner with my dad and brother, I cropped something up at the dinner table.<br><br>"Guys, I just met the most beautiful person in the whole world. I'm pretty sure you guys are gonna get a new member of the family soon," i swooned.<br><br>"She spoke the language of love and i think i...", i wanted to continue but..<br><br>"Young man, don't you think you are too young to fall in love. I married when i was 20 and i almost regretted it," he interrupted.<br><br>"Didn't you marry Mum when you were 28?," my brother and i remarked in unison.<br><br>"Err, oh yeah." slowly but cautiously he replied.<br><br>Ever since, our mother passed away when i was 5, we have grown accustomed to our dad's philandering ways but he has yet to remarry. Always saying he will forever remain fiercely loyal to her even upon death. He even had his own set of 7 core values.<br><br>After dinner, we proceed with our own activities. My brother was busy chatting with his girl online. Dad went out to meet someone while here i am lying on my bed thinking of someone.<br><br>A few hours later, the phone rang.<br><br>"Hello?", i asked.<br><br>"Andy, i won't be coming home tonight but please be reminded to be at the usual restaurant at 8pm. I have something to announce," my dad hurriedly told me.<br><br>"No problem at all", i replied.<br><br>Even while sleeping, i kept dreaming about her.<br><br>The next morning....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I made sure i woke up early was on time today. My woke-out-of-bed hair was now neatly combed and gelled up. I arrived early for class hoping to be the first to greet the belle of the class.<br><br>Surprisingly, my dad had left early for work today and took the car with him, leaving me no choice but to take the bus for 2 consecutive days.<br><br>Being half an hour early before a morning class may prove to be a costly mistake because no one would like to bask under the hot morning sun and have beaded droplets of sweat cascading your face.<br>Nevertheless, the prospect of being the first person to say good morning to her was too tempting to resist..<br><br>Seconds ticked by and the heat became intolerable, i decided to take a cool cup of Coke to quench my thirst and cool down my body.<br><br>"Ker-plunk. 10 cents. Ker-plunk. 20 cents. Ker-plunk. 30 cents."<br><br>"Damn! I am short of 10 cents,"i muttered silently as i search both the pockets of my jeans.<br><br>"Ker-plunk. Swoooooooosssshhhh"<br><br>"There you go.10 cents"<br><br>A familiar voice protruded heavenly to my tender eardrums as i was still searching for the much-needed 10 cents.<br><br>I turned around and there she was. The goddess of my love. The guardian of my dreams. The ink in my printer. The blood in my veins.It was Isabelle.<br><br>"Errr. Thanks. You just arrived?" i asked trying to mask the embarrasment earlier.<br><br>"Yeah. My dad sent me here before going to work. What about you?" she asked me temporary blinding me with the glow from her pearlies.<br><br>"My dad? Lets not talk about him. He doesn't care about my family. Hey! Thats the teacher. I think we better go in now" i answered rather emotionlessly, hoping the subject will be changed.<br><br>It was fun having her as my classmate and new friend. We helped one another and even shared some secrets though we knew each other for only 2 days.<br><br>During lunch, i couldn't help but ask her if she had any plans tonight.<br><br>"Hey Isabelle. I'm just wondering whether you are free tonight? I kinda wanna ask you out for dinner", i asked after finally mustering enough courage.<br><br>"Sorry Andy. I have plans tonight with my family. Some other day perhaps", she replied.<br><br>"Its ok. Maybe you can treat me to dinner first. Haha.", i teased.<br><br>The whole day went great and alas, it was time for us to go our separate ways once again. I remembered about the dinner Dad had asked us to go and immediately called my brother so could meet him first before going to La Creatuix De Pignon at Shenton Way.<br><br>We arrived at the restaurant rather early as there were not many patrons yet. I asked the waiter for the reservations made by my dad and was shocked to see him requesting for a table of 5 despite having only 3 people in our family.<br><br>We were ushered to our seats and waited rather patiently for my dad and his guests to appear. Never did we expect playing arm wrestling in a posh restaurant would be a great idea and a great time killer.<br><br>"ANDY!!!"<br><br>I turned around and i had the shock of my life to see Isabelle here as well.<br><br>"Having dinner Isabelle? Where are you sitting? You are with who? Your first time coming here?" i asked excitedly, flooding her with questions.<br><br>"Yup. With my family. What about you? Apparently, my dad wants me and my mum to meet some special people."she answered.<br><br>"Yeah! We're waiting for my dad," i told her.<br><br>"Oh! There comes my dad!", i remarked.<br><br>"There comes my dad!", Isabelle said, at the same time with me.<br></div>
