              <p><br>what is originality? angmoh bands' are original and singapore's not? you mean to be original for a singapore band, they need to marry a anklong with an axe just to be original? playing good rock songs and sounding as good as oasis is sell-out? duh...</p>
              <p>if you have the opportunity, try gatecrash the band audition for slots in this year's baybeat 09.</p>

              <p>will check out bb auditions. i must say though .. again, this is another mere observation .. bb has always had a hari raya feel (go figure) .. so much so that i'm quick to forget i'm at a music fest. then again, the malays have always been at the forefront of pop culture (music/arts/fashion) in singapore. kudos to them.</p>
              <p>edit: if i may cite an example, electrico .. i'm not a fan, but it's undeniable they brought something different .. something that the local music scene has not produced before .. for one, it was something that was not deathmetal or plain power chord riffs paired with mundane straightforward lyrics.</p>
              <p>again, to each his own - i'm not here to incite hate - provoking debate is good for change (whether better or worse) .. anyone have any more good local bands to intro?</p>

              <p><br>a new sound. suffice to say, i cannot tell u for certain what it is our bands lack. if i, or anyone for that matter, could pin it down, the arts would become science, and creating the next hit would be nothing more than following a set formula. but as we have seen, with each generation, comes a new sound .. music evolves .. and i think it's this that our bands lack .. whatever is in the mainstream, they emulate .. but mere emulation will not get you anywhere (unless of course u downplay it by blaming the common listener like me) except a set as a cover band.</p>
              <p>i'm proudly singaporean, and i wish i could support our local bands as much as i do our local labels/produce/industry .. but i'm not about to blindly do so in the spirit of nationalism (that is the crux of ur argument isn't it? that i'm too struck and stuck with foreign music) .. the fool i would be.</p>

              <p><br>and when you talk `big time', the lack of success is restricted to the english bands. if you look at the regional acts, like chinese or even malay acts, there are fair share of success that these singaporeans acts have garnered. go figure. is that a mental thing or a `not good enuf' issue? you need not look far beyond malaysia, the philippines or indonesia; the level of support for their bands/music are infinitely better than in singapore.</p>
              <p>agreed some bands do not make the grade and the production and mixing standards are not up to scratch, but that has to do with the dearth of good producers and money is always an issue. a few bad apples doesn't make the whole crate bad.</p>
              <p>here in singapore, we are all filtered off the the bad overseas bands. so, the measure of standard is always higher.</p>
              <p>i am sorry you feel your are in a pesta hari raya gig but when i was last there, i didn't see anyone in baju kurung. you go with a pre-conceived notion, you validate your own mind. no one can tell you otherwise so. nothing to discuss here.</p>
              <p>`plain power chords and mundane straightforward lyrics'? gimme a break. are you doing a thesis on music lyrics? and i didn't know `lemon tree' n `who let the dogs out?' are power, meaningful lyrics either. enjoy music for what it is.  </p>
              <p>for a start, go to timbre when you can and also check out wake me up music sites for gig dates. i am not a fan of most of the bands there but they have a good stable of bands there. maybe it will stretch your mind a little bit. </p>
