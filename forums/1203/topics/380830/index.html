              </span></p><p>Guitarist Justin Stubbs of Father Befouled has issued the following statement about drummer Antichristus taking his own life:</p>
              <p>"They say only Death is real, but when you are faced with it, it is always hard to comprehend. Last night I was informed that our drummer, Antichristus, had taken his own life. It is hard to put into words what this means, but I am shocked. AC (we are not revealing his real name - his wishes) was enigmatic and mysterious to all those who knew him, but at the same time he was an amazing friend and one of the most dedicated individuals I, and the rest of the band had ever known.</p>
              <p>"His final recorded output with Father Befouled was to be the upcoming 'Rotting Godless Thrones' 7" for Nuclear War Now! Productions. Unfortunately all we have are rough drum rehearsals of the songs, and I am not sure if we can use any of them for the release. I will have to see what can be made usable and make the decision.</p>
              <p>"His drumming will also be heard on our 'Profane Grace of the Trinity' split 7" with Cemetery Urn on Relapse Records, due out in January. We recorded this track over a year ago, and it was actually his first efforts for the band. AC was also the drummer for our brothers Prosanctus Inferi. Luckily they recorded their LP for Hell's Headbangers back in August. Not sure of the release, but it will certainly be out soonish. IT will be his finest effort in memorium.</p>
              <p>"Lastly, AC also had a solo project entitled UNHOLY DEATH (named for the NME album). I was working with him to release his demo on cassette through Archasm. I, and his family feel it would be, without a doubt, his wish to see this happen. The demo was not finished, but I will release what I have, in it's unfinished entirety.</p>
              <p>"We also feel that he would never want his decisions to hinder the progress of Father Befouled, so in that regard, we shall continue. For our future release(s), Decrepitaph's Elektrokutioner will become our drummer for recorded output. Future live performances at this point are not an option. We will eventually make a decision in that regard.</p>
              <p>"His talents went beyond his time spent with Father Befouled, and his knowledge and dedication to the occult were immense. He was a truly gifted person, and to be blunt, too much so for this world. May he not rest in peace, but further explore his darkest imaginations now reality."</p>
