              <p>With rumors swirling since <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> drummer <strong>Charlie Benante</strong> and bassist <strong>Frank Bello</strong> were seen together with former <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> vocalist <strong>Joey Belladonna</strong> late last month in New York, the band — <strong>Benante</strong>, <strong>Bello</strong>, and guitarists <strong>Scott Ian</strong> and <strong>Rob Caggiano</strong> — is elated to announce that <strong>Belladonna</strong> has officially rejoined the band.  In his once and current capacity, <strong>Belladonna</strong> will make his first appearance with <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> this summer when the band joins <strong>METALLICA</strong>, <strong>SLAYER</strong>, and <strong>MEGADETH</strong> — the "Big Four" founding bands of the thrash genre — to co-headline a series of <strong>Sonisphere Festivals</strong> in ten European cities, as well as playing a handful of <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>-headlined shows (itinerary is below).<br><br>"I am super-excited about this," said <strong>Scott Ian</strong>.  "<strong>Joey</strong> and the rest of the band came to see me play at a club in New York, I hadn't seen <strong>Joey</strong> for years, since the end of the reunion tour.  <strong>Joey</strong> taps me on the shoulder, instant big hug, it felt like no time had gone by.  The band dynamic is an interesting one — in <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>, <strong>Joey</strong> and I spent so many years of our lives together, we grew up together,
              we know each other so well, so it was like no time was lost."<br><br><strong>Belladonna</strong>, an essential part of <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>'s lineup from 1985 to 1992, sang on some of the band's most popular albums including <strong>"Spreading the Disease"</strong>, <strong>"Among the Living"</strong> and <strong>"Persistence of Time"</strong>.  He had reunited with original members of <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> for the 2005-2007 <strong>"Among the Living Tour"</strong>, but this situation is different.  Explained <strong>Belladonna</strong>, "I had been in touch with <strong>Charlie</strong> and <strong>Frank</strong>,
              then I got a call from their manager who said that everyone wanted me
              back in the band. I thought, 'are you guys for real? You want me up
              there, fronting the band like it was before?' I was thrilled. We've
              already started to reconnect with the old ways of having conversations.
              Everything is easy going and feels really good."<br><br>"We're going to do these summer shows and gel as a band," explained <strong>Charlie Benante</strong>, "get comfortable playing with each other again, and the energy from that should go right into making new music."<br><br>Immediately following the final <strong>Sonisphere</strong> festival in early August, the band will fly back to the U.S. and begin
              writing and rehearsing for a new album that's expected to be out in
              early 2011. <br><br>"We've got an unusual luxury of hindsight," added <strong>Ian</strong>.
              "We finished an album a year ago, we've lived with those 12 songs since
              then, and we can look back on them and see what we really love and what
              we can make even better, especially with <strong>Joey</strong> back in the fold."<br><br>Added <strong>Benante</strong>, "There are five or six songs from a year ago that we don't want to change, we love them the way they are, other than having <strong>Joey</strong> making them his own with his vocals. Then there's another five or six
              that we may want to rework, and then there are a bunch of other tunes
              that are still in the early stages, that we want to finish.<br><br>"The band has been on an emotional roller coaster since last summer," <strong>Benante</strong> continued, "but I think everything that we've had to deal with during that time was pushing us toward this, to <strong>Joey</strong> being back in <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>, and the timing couldn't be more perfect or appropriate.  To have <strong>Joey</strong> with us playing these shows with <strong>METALLICA</strong>, <strong>SLAYER</strong> and <strong>MEGADETH</strong> is the way it should be — as <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>'s vocalist from '85 to '92, he was part of the 'Big Four.'"<br><br>"<strong>John</strong> was a real stand-up guy about the situation," said <strong>Ian</strong>, about <strong>John Bush</strong>, <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>'s vocalist from 1992 to 2005 and for some of <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>'s most recent live shows.  "He knew we wanted to move forward at full speed, that we needed a total commitment to <strong>ANTHRAX</strong>,
              and he knew that wasn't what he wanted. We certainly wish John well.
              We've had so many great times with him, and we appreciate his stepping
              in last summer at the last minute, and performing with us since then.
              He will always be an integral part of the <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> family."<br><br>With worldwide sales in excess of 10-million, <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> is about to celebrate its 29th year as a band.  Over its career, <strong>ANTHRAX</strong> has received multiple gold and platinum albums, multiple <strong>Grammy</strong> nominations, and a host of other accolades from the press, industry and fans.<br><br><strong>ANTHRAX</strong> has scheduled the following dates:<br><br>Jun. 16 - Warsaw, Poland @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 18 - Wil, Switzerland @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 19 - Mimon, Czech Republic @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 20 - Vienna, Austria @ Arena Wien<br>Jun. 22 - Sofia, Bulgaria @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 24 - Athens, Greece @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 26 - Bucharest, Romania @ Sonisphere <br>Jun. 27 - Istanbul, Turkey @ Sonisphere <br>Jul. 31 - Knebworth, UK @ Sonisphere <br>Aug. 01 - Lokerse, Belgium @ Lokerse FeeSten Festival <br>Aug. 03 - Hengelo, Netherlands @ Metropool <br>Aug. 05 - Moscow, Russia @ B1 <br>Aug. 07 - Stockholm, Sweden @ Sonisphere</p>
