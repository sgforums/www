              <p><strong>God Fobid's Doc Coyle Releases Statement About Beer-Throwing Incident At Lamb of God Show</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://files.list.co.uk/images/2009/02/05/lamb-of-god.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="565"></p>
              <p>GOD FORBID guitarist DOC COYLE, who was filling in for LAMB OF GOD guitarist Mark Morton on their opening trek with METALLICA, has issues an official statement through MetalBlast regarding the much-publicized incident in which a fan threw a cup of liquid at his face during a performance.</p>
              <p>“I’m sure many of you have seen the video of me getting pegged on stage while I was on Metallica tour filling in for Mark from Lamb of God. Although 95% of the comments were really supportive, I just wanted to clarify a few things about the incident. First off, it was a beer, not a water. A big ol’ tall boy plastic cup of beer, and whoever threw it must have been a quarterback because it was full and hit me square in the eye at full steam. It felt like I got sucker punched. I had a mark by my cheek bone and it was swollen all night. I surprised I didn’t have a black eye. The way it hit me is probably the reason why I reacted the way I did. I’m no tough guy, but I wasn’t really thinking. I just reacted. I really don’t know what I would’ve done if anyone would’ve have owned up to to throwing it, but I have no clue if I would’ve hit the person. I can say that I’m not violent at all, and don’t think violence is a productive way to solve problems. I’m glad nothing came of it, but obviously the person was pretty cowardly to throw it and not own up to it. Anyway, shit happens. I just think it’s kind of funny how it spread on the internet. Beer in the face and all, it was still more than an honor to play with Lamb of God and open for Metallica.”</p>
