            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It's Official: MEGADETH Taps NEVERMORE/JAG PANZER Guitarist CHRIS BRODERICK </strong><br><br>As BLABBERMOUTH.NET first reported on January 7, MEGADETH mainman Dave Mustaine has finally officially confirmed that the band has parted ways with guitarist Glen Drover and replaced him with Chris Broderick (NEVERMORE, JAG PANZER).<br><br>"I've noticed [on the Internet] that people are pissed with me over the way things were handled with Glen quitting the group," says Mustaine, "but they're gonna be pissed even more when they hear how fierce we are with Chris! MEGADETH is playing at a new level."<br><br>In a November 2007 posting on the forum of MEGADETH's official fan club, MegaFanClub (accessible to members only), Mustaine stated about Drover, "sadly, Glen is having a really difficult time handling the demands of touring and we are finding that we are having to cut our European run down already, but that it is going to be one of the last long ones for some time."<br><br>Chris will make his live debut with MEGADETH on February 4 in Finland, where the group Â— Mustaine, Broderick, drummer Shawn Drover and James Lomenzo on bass Â— is kicking off a long string of international dates which wrap March 14 in Bangalore, India.<br><br>Chris Broderick has been playing guitar since he was eleven years old and has been teaching for the last 15 years. Styles range from classical, rock, blues, and jazz. He started taking lessons at 14 years of age studying guitar as well as voice, violin, and piano. Chris has a degree in classical guitar music performance at the University of Denver and the Lamont School of Music. He has performed in many master classes including ones given by David Russell, Benjamin Verdery, and his primary instructor, Ricardo Iznaola. In addition, Chris has taken classes such as jazz improvisation, chord voicing, advanced music theory, and sight-reading.<br><br>The third installment of Gigantour Â— the acclaimed traveling heavy music festival launched in 2005 by Mustaine Â— will kick off April 12 in Denver, CO with headliner MEGADETH, Swedish metal band IN FLAMES, Finland's CHILDREN OF BODOM, Arizona's modern extreme JOB FOR A COWBOY and Oakland, CA heavy power trio HIGH ON FIRE all confirmed. The 29-date trek will criss-cross North America and wraps May 22 in Phoenix, AZ.<br><br>Mustaine sums up the philosophy behind Gigantour, hailed by Revolver magazine as "the mother of all shred-fests": "If the bands and the fans are treated well, then the entertained and the entertainers go home happy Â— it's a win-win situation." Since its inception in 2005, Gigantour has galvanized bands that emphasize true musicianship and virtuosity, offering them a new opportunity to showcase their talents. "I think that in a small way, we are cleaning up the environment of crappy bands," he says, laughing. "All of the people that really love this kind of music know that they can count on these bands to deliver the goods this year."<br><br>Gigantour features bands hand-picked by Mustaine with a sharp eye on true musicianship and a heavy focus on top-notch guitarists. The first incarnation in 2005 included DREAM THEATER, FEAR FACTORY, NEVERMORE, LIFE OF AGONY, SYMPHONY X, DRY KILL LOGIC and BOBAFLEX, while the 2006 trek included LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY, OVERKILL, INTO ETERNITY, SANCTITY and THE SMASHUP. The trek always offers a strong connection between fans and musicians.<br><br>Gigantour 2008 tour dates featuring MEGADETH, IN FLAMES, CHILDREN OF BODOM, JOB FOR A COWBOY and HIGH ON FIRE:<br><br>Apr. 12 - Denver, CO The Fillmore<br>Apr. 13 - Albuquerque, NM Journal Pavilion<br>Apr. 15 - Dallas, TX Nokia Theatre<br>Apr. 16 - Corpus Christi, TX Concrete Street Pavilion<br>Apr. 17 - Houston, TX Verizon Wireless Theatre<br>Apr. 19 - Louisville, KY Louisville Gardens Sun<br>Apr. 20 - Atlanta, GA Tabernacle<br>Apr. 22 - New York, NY Hammerstein Ballroom<br>Apr. 24 - Worcester, MA Palladium<br>Apr. 26 - Baltimore, MD Merriweather Post Pavilion<br>Apr. 28 - Quebec City, QC Pavilion De La Jeunesse<br>Apr. 29 - Montreal, QC Bell Centre<br>Apr. 30 - Toronto, ON Arrow Hall<br>May 01 - London, ON John Labatt Centre<br>May 03 - Detroit, MI DTE Music Center<br>May 04 - Cleveland, OH Time Warner Cable Amphitheater<br>May 06 - Chicago, IL Aragon<br>May 07 - Milwaukee, WI Eagles Ballroom<br>May 09 - Minneapolis, MN Myth<br>May 10 - Winnipeg, MB Convention Center<br>May 11 - Saskatoon, SK Prairieland Exhibition Hall<br>May 12 - Edmonton, AB Shaw Conference Center<br>May 14 - Calgary, AB The Corral<br>May 16 - Vancouver, BC Pacific Coliseum<br>May 17 - Salem, OR Salem Armory<br>May 19 - San Jose, CA Event Center @ San Jose State<br>May 20 - San Diego, CA Cox Arena<br>May 21 - Los Angeles, CA Long Beach Arena<br>May 22 - Phoenix, AZ Mesa Amphitheatre<br><a href="http://www.megadeth.com/chris/Broderick.mov" rel="nofollow">Heres a vid of the new guitarist playing sleepwalker, quicktime required!</a></div>

My family life has always been my priority. In the end, I was unhappy with the situation, which magnified me wanting to spend more time with my family and realizing that it's time for me to move on to the next chapter in my musical career.<br><br>"First, I want to spend some good quality time here at home with my family for a little bit before getting into anything serious. Obviously, I have not spent the last several years of my life working hard to stop now. That would be insane, to put it mildly. This is what I do, and I am excited about what the future in music has in store for me.<br><br>"I would like to thank Dave [Mustaine, MEGADETH mainman] for giving me a great opportunity to be a part of MEGADETH for the past three-plus years. To be a part of this band with my brother Shawn [drums] and tour the world was awesome, to say the least.<br><br>"I have a lot of great memories and met a ton of great people along the way, both fans and people in the industry. I am also very proud to have been a part of bringing MEGADETH back to the forefront and firmly putting the band back on the map.<br><br>"Last but not least, I would like to thank all of the fans, the MEGADETH road crew and all of my endorsements, as well as everyone who has supported me in making my time with MEGADETH a very memorable experience."<br><br>Glen Drover's replacement in MEGADETH is Chris Broderick, who has previously played with NEVERMORE and JAG PANZER.<br><br>Chris will make his live debut with MEGADETH on February 4 in Finland, where the group Â— Mustaine, Broderick, drummer Shawn Drover and James Lomenzo on bass Â— is kicking off a long string of international dates which wrap March 14 in Bangalore, India.<br><br>The third installment of Gigantour Â— the acclaimed traveling heavy music festival launched in 2005 by Mustaine Â— will launch April 12 in Denver, CO with headliner MEGADETH, Swedish metal band IN FLAMES, Finland's CHILDREN OF BODOM, Arizona's modern extreme JOB FOR A COWBOY and Oakland, CA heavy power trio HIGH ON FIRE all confirmed.
