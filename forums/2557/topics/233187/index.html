We seemed to have taken a step back with the recent break, but I am confident we can get back on track with regular games back again.  We just need to stay focused.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok boys.....<br><br>We can really do better, excuses aside, we often let ourselves down.<br><br>Its important for us to improve tactics and parts of our game, but the most important thing is to improve our mental aspect....<br><br>If you can end the game and tell yourself that you played your best, ran all you could, chase every ball and there was nothing more you could have done in the match... then that will be enuff.<br><br>We really have to believe we are able to play better and not panick whenever we let in early goals... this is definately an area we can improve on.<br><br>Heads up lads.... i can smell a win coming for REDS this sunday....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though I am the most guilty of all for the last match, I will still have to fully agree with what Bernard has said.  I still stand by what I said in that I focus more on the way we play and whether we stick to our game plan.  However, we need to have a real go to perform our best and win every game.  As what we've said countless of times, the objective is to go back knowing we did our best.</div>

Both were there for the taking and we could really have easily have gotten maximum points if we had been more focused as a team.<br><br>As i highlighted today, its another 2 points lost.<br>Instead of having 9 points from 3 games, we only have 5 points.<br><br>I know that we are a social team just here to have fun on sundays, but i really think that we can try to challenge ourselves and try to win every game from now on.<br><br>I am frustrated that we drew today. I make no apologies for it.<br><br>Enuff said, we go for the win this coming sundays....<br><br></div>
