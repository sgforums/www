DUH!!!<br><br><span class="normal">1)When team has possession of ball, spread out to give option. Especially during our goal kicks or when center back has possession of ball.<br><br>2)When have possession of ball, to pass to team mate, preferably the midfielder directy ahead of you.<br><br>3)After passing the ball, to support the player with the ball in a conservative fashion... meaning NO OVERLAPPING!!!</span><br><br>4)When team loses possesion, full backs are to already be in position to defend. then defend like dog or die trying....<br><br>Other roles and responsibility include taking post when defending corners etc...<br><br>above are words of wisdom from me.... haha...  at least i think that's all a full back needs to do.<br><br>Russell will explain how the rest of you clowns are suppose to play your positions.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok... I've been really busy the whole of last week, so I really didn't have the time to sit down and do this.  I will try to find the time in the coming days.  To warm myself up to this task, I will begin with the <strong>Forward Left/Right </strong>position.  I will refer to the left, but as you all should know by now, the mirror image will apply to the right:<br><br>1) When Left Back has posession of ball, drop deep slightly to provide option.  If given the ball, can play simple pass to Centre Left or others around him.<br><br>2) When Centre Left / Centre Mid has possession of ball, give option to left flank.  If given the ball, can make run down the flank to cross / cross from deep / play ball back to Centre Left.<br><br>3) When attack is played on opposite side, to make run into the box to receive cross.  If ball is played to Centre Forward, to provide option to Centre Forward.<br><br>4) When team loses possession, track oppponent right-back.  Get back in front of him and look out for penetrative runs.  Be prepared to give option to midfield and defense when possession is won back.<br><br>5) When defending corner on our left, to take out short corners.  When defending corner on the right, to stay up front for counter attack (please try to stay at least 5 metres away from opponent).<br><br>As you can see, the Forward Left / Right position involves the defense, midfield and attack, so all (even keeper) should understand his role too.  Let me know if there's anything you're unsure of.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, the next position to be covered will be the <strong>Centre Left / Right </strong>position.  Again, I will be referring to the Centre Left position and the Centre Right will be a mirror image:<br><br>1) When Left Back / Centre Back has posession of ball, drop to provide option. If given the ball, can look for Forward Left to play ball to the flank, through the centre to Centre Forward, or play simple pass to others around him.<br><br>2) When Forward Left has the ball on flank, to stay open behind him and provide option for pass back.<br><br>3) When Centre Mid has the ball, to provide option for simple pass.<br><br>4) When attack is played on opposite side, to drop back slightly to centre of midfield.<br><br>5) When team loses possession, to cover midfield with 2 other midfielders.  Provide support to left side if opponents attack on left.  Provide support to centre if opponent attack on right / centre.<br><br>As mentioned, the main role for the midfielders is to dominate the midfield in BOTH attack and defense.  They will provide support to both the defenders and forwards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>It seems that this thread is all about Russ and myself....<br><br>Perhaps i didn't make it clear what i had in mind when i started this topic.<br><br>I want the guys to use this topic to clear any doubts you have about any position in the team and also to give suggestions how better we can improve.<br><br>Please feel free to share how else we can improve as this is OUR team, not Russell's team... so DEMOCRACY!!! :p<br><br>I know the last time some of you guys brought up that the defense seemed outnumbered when the opponents midfield make forward runs. I have given this some thought but still feel that we should still be able to manage. However, i admit that this is an area that we can look into and try to fine tune.<br>Guys, if you have any suggestions how to curb this potential problem do contribute.<br><br>p.s --- Russ you doing a good job... keep the instructions for the various positions coming.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As what Bernard said, please feel free to share your thoughts and concerns on the various positions in this formation.  Don't keep me wondering if anybody else on the team is reading any of this stuff!  In fact, feel fre to talk about ANYTHING in this forum.<br><br>Ok, next position to cover will be <strong>Centre Back</strong>.  The roles will generally apply to both Centre Backs.  As usual, I will refer to the left side:<br><br>1) When we have goal kicks, to stay open and provide option to Keeper.<br><br>2) When Left Back / Centre Back has possession of ball, to drop back to provide option with front facing opponents' goal (for obvious reasons!).  If given ball, can play simple pass to players around him in defence / midfield.<br><br>3) When Midfielders have the ball, to stay open behind and provide option for simple pass.<br><br>4) When attack is advancing deep to opponent half, to push up offside trap to near halfway line, taking note of opponent strikers / wingers.<br><br>5) When team loses possession, track opponent strikers.  Similiar to fullbacks, be in position to defend, then defend like dog or die trying.<br><br>6) When attack coming down left side, be prepared to cover Left Back in the event he gets beaten.<br><br>While both Centre Backs will apply the above, one will control the defence and play deeper than the other.  The one controlling has to constantly decide on when to play offside vs defend deep and control defence accordingly.  If repeatedly under extreme pressure, to call for support from midfield.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>REDS Issit Liverpool?<br><br>You must see how good is yr DM , cos he is the one who cover any hole at the back if a fullback is out of position-eg during attacking. Every position depand on one another, if the team move together they can put offside trap for the opponent. Fullback always work with the person infront and overlap each other on attacking , make space, draw opponent and create assist to striker. I like to play on the left tho I'm a right footer cos it's easier to shoot on right foot with the goal on yr right side cos the angle is better.<br><br>CM normally don't consider Left or right, it's front and back cos they work differently. Front one work with 2 striker on attack and back one ,DM, cover defenders.<br><br>Striker is one front one back ,back is the one sometime known as play maker,<br>and CM front work with striker no.2 which is the playmaker or both can call playmaker is the heart and soul of the team who rule the midfield and attack with their creative and footballing brain. No.1 Striker is we all known is the no.1 top scorer with the killer instinct and eye on the goal.<br><br>On the flank you don't encounter the main attack head on, is the speed that matter and block all crosses. Both LM and LB work together and same goes to RM and RB.<br><br>As for CD, is about hard tackle and win the ball. If yr defence out number - CD must always keep an eye on the opponent strikers position at all time. Positioning is base on awareness during the game, if a player have too many thing in his head they can't see far on what happening next.<br><br>Too many instructions will only make the player lose concentration. They must know their primary task b4 thinking of how to support each other and cover others position during counter attack by opponent.<br><br>My 2cents though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About tracking back on counter attack, better to follow one opponent nearest to u even though he din get the ball. Let say you r the midfielder running back towards yr goal and infront of you is 4 opponent 1 with the ball, you don't chase the person with the ball let the defenders do it , just mark the person closer to you. Close marking give the opponent no option to pass the ball and force to take the solo route , the worse is one to one with the keeper which is only 50-50 chance better than they can pass around making u chasing the shadow.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, as I mentioned during the last debrief, I think we have slowly begun to drift away from the way we began playing the 4-3-3 formation.  Please take some time to think about how you started playing our roles vs how you have been playing recently.  I am also guilty of this and will try to stay focused for this Sunday's game onwards.</div>
