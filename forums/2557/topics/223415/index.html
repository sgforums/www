            <div class='col-md body'>I've opened this topic for you guys to voice your thoughts on how you felt our matches went.  I will mainly be focusing on the 3 areas that I have mentioned, but I hope you guys will talk about the other areas of the game as well.  Feel free to highlight the good and the bad.<br><br>As for today's match, I think we worked hard for the 2-0 win and it was well-deserved.  What was really pleasing to see is that we had several more chances and I hope it's a sign of good things to come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I know many of us are still trying to get used to our roles for this new formation, but I feel that everyone has adapted quite well so far.  Of course there are still some players who are drifting from their primary roles, but I think these will be sorted out as we play more games.  If we keep this up for our coming matches, I'm confident our teamwork can improve by leaps and bounds.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The last game at Riverside was another well-deserved victory for us.  We created many chances and managed to shut out the opponents for most of the game, with their solitary goal coming just before the final whistle.<br><br>We were not able to play the way we wanted to, but this was mainly due to the small size of the pitch.  However, we still managed to create many chances and got 3 goals.  What was once again very encouraging was the commitment every player showed on the pitch.  The defenders also appear to be gaining in confidence, teamwork and understanding among each other in the last few games.  Moving forward, we must work towards teamwork and understanding between defenders, midfielders and forwards.<br><br>I really must say that overall, all players are playing to their roles most of the time.  Some errors were mentioned during the match debrief, but I trust that players mentioned will take all comments constructively as ways to improve and not as personal criticisms.<br><br>Two victories in a row with hopefully more to come.  Good job guys!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am glad that we are winning 2 games in a row. Keep it up Reds. I believe we will definitely perform better as weeks pass by.<br><br>Just would like to highlight that during last week's game at Riverside Sec, I observe one or two players are holding the ball too long and trying to do much more than his primary role. In this formation, we have to know our basic role and more teamwork is expected. Hopefully, individual skills would only happen whenever necessary or there are no players supporting.....<br><br>Btw, Bernard did a terrific job to bring back this forum back for us...

            <div class='col-md body'>Today's game was very messy to the rain and the condition of the pitch.  While we lost the game, I was happy to see that we were playing much better than the opponents.  We created so many chances, but somehow failed to convert them.  I take part of the blame for that too!  We were even able to play the ball around a bit on the muddy pitch.<br><br>Given the conditions we were playing with, I do not think I should criticise any player for this game.  What I do want to say is that I was happy to see the non-core players fitting into the style that we are trying to adopt.  Alan and Boon fitted in relatively well for their first game in the new formation.  Ian showed a lot more composure and looked much more comfortable and stable than his previous game.<br><br>As I have mentioned, I will not be too concerned with the results for the coming matches (especially with such playing conditions!).  I just want you guys to continue improving the understanding and teamwork with our new style of play.  I have seen much improvement and long may it continue in the coming weeks.</div>

THOUSAND APOLOGIES!<br><br>But that aside, i have to agree with Russ to a certain extend, the pitch conditions did affect our preferred style of play. It would have been alot easier for us if the pitch was dry.<br><br>On a more positive note.....It's very encouraging to see everyone settling nicely into the "game plan" Its good to see everyone knows what has to be done without constant reminders.<br>Special mention to Alan, Zach and Junior.<br>All 3 of you had good games today(in my humble opinion!)<br>Keeping to your primary roles and playing the game the way we want it to be played!<br><br>with all that said, HEADS UP REDS!!!<br>If we keep sticking to our game plan, we are bound to improve and i foresee much more enjoyable games to come!<br><br>Bern<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agreed that the muddy pitch condition disrupt our playing style. The management team of Bern, Russel &amp; Ang had done a great job in revamping the team playing style of 4-3-3. It make the Sunday game more pleasurable to playÂ…. dun like the feeling of being trashed every weekÂ… maybe we shd have more variation of the 4-3-3 formationÂ… e.g. 4-3-3 (defensive mode, muddy pitch (long balls), attacking mode, etc)<br><br>I noticed that our team have some good wingers with strong run and penetration capabilitiesÂ… like Calvin and Zack.. if they can hold the offside line.. and the center midfield can turn and chip the ball just outside the left/right penalty box for themÂ….  they will score lots of goals for usÂ…. not many teams have wingers of such capabilities.. in such a leagueÂ….<br><br>During this match, there is one instanceÂ… I am covering the left backÂ….  I got 3 opponents running at meÂ….. when they overrun meÂ… I saw my fellow defenders (center back/Alfred and right back/Pat) each have one man on them as well. We are talking about Five opponents running at three defenders!! when we are leading 1-0?? We need the team manager to address thisÂ… just like what Liverpool manager always says; to tune the minor detailsÂ….<br><br>After saying so much about the match, is there a Christmas chill-out session for the team??<br><br>Finally, I missed Jem todayÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by juniorion:</div><div class="quote_body">I totally agreed that the muddy pitch condition disrupt our playing style. The management team of Bern, Russel &amp; Ang had done a great job in revamping the team playing style of 4-3-3. It make the Sunday game more pleasurable to playÂ…. dun like the feeling of being trashed every weekÂ… maybe we shd have more variation of the 4-3-3 formationÂ… e.g. 4-3-3 (defensive mode, muddy pitch (long balls), attacking mode, etc)<br><br>I noticed that our team have some good wingers with strong run and penetration capabilitiesÂ… like Calvin and Zack.. if they can hold the offside line.. and the center midfield can turn and chip the ball just outside the left/right penalty box for themÂ….  they will score lots of goals for usÂ…. not many teams have wingers of such capabilities.. in such a leagueÂ….<br><br>During this match, there is one instanceÂ… I am covering the left backÂ….  I got 3 opponents running at meÂ….. when they overrun meÂ… I saw my fellow defenders (center back/Alfred and right back/Pat) each have one man on them as well. We are talking about Five opponents running at three defenders!! when we are leading 1-0?? We need the team manager to address thisÂ… just like what Liverpool manager always says; to tune the minor detailsÂ….<br><br>After saying so much about the match, is there a Christmas chill-out session for the team??<br><br>Finally, I missed Jem todayÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div></blockquote>Junior, I would really like to know what you mean by strong run and penetration capabilities before I comment on that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Anyway, the need for different modes of play within the formation is a valid one.  I actually did want a change in mode during the 2nd half and realised that I didn't communicate it properly.  I will take note of that for future games.<br><br>Having said that, I believe we must focus on keeping one mode as our style of play (or default play) and work on it.  When we do have a clear idea of that on an individual basis, we can then work on other modes (or as the Liverpool manager says."Other possibilities:...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).</div>
