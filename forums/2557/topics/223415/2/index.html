The management team of Bern, Russel &amp; Ang had done a great job in revamping the team playing style of 4-3-3. It make the Sunday game more pleasurable to playÂ…. dun like the feeling of being trashed every weekÂ… maybe we shd have more variation of the 4-3-3 formationÂ… e.g. 4-3-3 (defensive mode, muddy pitch (long balls), attacking mode, etc)<br><br>I noticed that our team have some good wingers with strong run and penetration capabilitiesÂ… like Calvin and Zack.. if they can hold the offside line.. and the center midfield can turn and chip the ball just outside the left/right penalty box for themÂ….  they will score lots of goals for usÂ…. not many teams have wingers of such capabilities.. in such a leagueÂ….<br><br>During this match, there is one instanceÂ… I am covering the left backÂ….  I got 3 opponents running at meÂ….. when they overrun meÂ… I saw my fellow defenders (center back/Alfred and right back/Pat) each have one man on them as well. We are talking about Five opponents running at three defenders!! when we are leading 1-0?? We need the team manager to address thisÂ… just like what Liverpool manager always says; to tune the minor detailsÂ….<br><br>After saying so much about the match, is there a Christmas chill-out session for the team??<br><br>Finally, I missed Jem todayÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>ok... ian is missing from the equation here. where is he? i believe, on the ground, hauled down by someone, but the ref ignored the foul.<br>i believe unless we have a tv replay to prove it, shld we need an evidence.<br><br>Team managers, shld my defensive qualities be very much a let down to the team, do keep me informed of the ways to improve or move me to a more suitable position for me to contribute to the team.</div>

While we lost the game, I was happy to see that we were playing much better than the opponents.  We created so many chances, but somehow failed to convert them.  I take part of the blame for that too!  We were even able to play the ball around a bit on the muddy pitch.<br><br>Given the conditions we were playing with, I do not think I should criticise any player for this game.  What I do want to say is that I was happy to see the non-core players fitting into the style that we are trying to adopt.  Alan and Boon fitted in relatively well for their first game in the new formation.  Ian showed a lot more composure and looked much more comfortable and stable than his previous game.<br><br>As I have mentioned, I will not be too concerned with the results for the coming matches (especially with such playing conditions!).  I just want you guys to continue improving the understanding and teamwork with our new style of play.  I have seen much improvement and long may it continue in the coming weeks.</div></blockquote>thanks for the positive remark. i've restricted mysf to our own-half for this game and no running with the ball. Totally no intention of even going past the half-way line. Bt i still receive comments dat i'm too "high" up. I'm alittle confused abt this to be frank. I suppose i shld line mysf with the centre-backs? If yes, frankly, i wasnt told of this before, but i guess it shld be pretty easy for me to adjust to dat bah.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I do not think we had a fantastic game, it was a definite improvement from the previous 2 games.  Raf was instrumental in our victory and Ang did well to score the the first 2 goals.  Rafi also made some crucial saves that kept us in the game too.  I will not comment on my own game...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>As mentioned, we have to try to play to the formation that we have decided to employ.  Please read (and read and read) the thread on the formation and take note of your role and the roles of the others.  You need to know what you have to do, what to expect of those around you and what those around expect of you.  I would rather see a player have a bad game while playing his role, than to see a player play well individually, but not sticking to what he is supposed to do.<br><br>Raf's pointers on how to defend more "effectively" was very interesting and we can definitely learn from him.  We should make it as difficult as possible for our opponents to beat us.  However, please do not go all out to start tugging and pulling in the next match!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Let's build on this and have a better game next week!</div>
