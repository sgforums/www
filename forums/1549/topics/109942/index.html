I've met someone" ...<br>agreeing to her wish to 'just be friends'.<br><br>... asking her freedom back bcoz 'she'd be happier with him' ...<br>asking u to 'forget that everything happened' and be 'normal' friends again.<br><br>... hearing that u're treated as a big bro ...<br>sharing her future plans for the guy with you.<br>u stopped being friends bcoz her bf asked her to being denied in front of people.<br>telling u lies where she'd been when actually, she was with a 'new friend' or an 'old flame' ...<br>she told u she'd be leaving u to return to her ex (d one she left 4 u!) breaking someone's heart ...<br>fighting for that one thing that would make you happy ...<br>that is, holding on to a person who can not guarantee you his/her commitment unless he/she fixed himself/herself...<br>then, you are left hanging for the moment...<br>then he/she says, time will tell...<br>but you still decided to hope in him/her and trust him/her ...<br><br>PRETENDING you're OK when inside you're dying...<br>PRETENDING to be strong....<br>and RECOGNIZING your weakness ...<br>lying in bed each night, thinking of that special person you can never have...<br>being with someone you can't actually love...<br>pretending you don't love a person whom you actually love...<br>being in love...<br>letting go even if you really don't want to...<br>having no right to say you are hurting, because it was your decision ...<br>seeing the person you love hurt because of you...<br>and not being able to help that person...<br>having the courage to say I LOVE YOU to the person you love and finding out afterwards that things will never be the same again when he/she doesnt treat you with the same closeness as before ...<br>having to face the fact that someone is capable of completely destroying the wall that you have set for yourself, leaving you weak and vulnerable admitting that you love someone despite her/his imperfections ...<br>finding out that the more you try to hate her/him, the more you end up loving her/him, perhaps even more than before...<br>realizing how stupid your mistakes were that led to your break-up.<br>the thought that this girl/guy, used to really love you and you loved her/him as well but you didn't give enough and she/he gave up on you ...<br><br>Sharing the one you love with SOMEBODY else....."<br>making a promise....and realizing that when the time has come for that promise to be delivered....<br>the commitment is no longer there... the hardest thing about love - believing it exists.<br>After you've been hurt...<br>learn to forgive ...<br>learn to trust and love again ...</div>
