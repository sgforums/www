go,<br>and u will never move on from where u started...<br><br>people take wrong directions all the time..<br>if not,how do we ever realise our mistakes..<br>and make better choices..<br>late it might be for your life so far,<br>but it is never too late for your life ahead..<br>maybe through wrong directions,<br>you made the wrong choices..<br>but does it mean that through the right directions,<br>you would always make the right choices?<br>if everything seems like a big trial..<br>hold on to your faith..<br>for at least,you had a chance to live a choice..<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>with a new year comes a new beginning,<br>every month is a new chapter,<br>every day is a new chance,<br>every hour is a combi of minutes,<br>every minute is a prelude to an hour,<br>and every second is every moment that i've been thinking of you...<br><br>love still hurts as much as it used to,<br>i have a kind of love in me,<br>some love that lets me think and care about you,<br>and the more wanting to be with you,<br>but love made a twist and i could never be with you,<br>caring for you and holding your hand is possible but we could never be together,<br>not even thinking about being together coz it would hurt me so much to even think,<br>sad it might be but this feeling would never go...<br><br>some people told me that maybe i should wait,<br>till you have ended your chance with her,<br>but i could not,<br>afterall it's a 2 year's of story together,<br>i couldn't wait and i couldn't go on without thinking of you,<br>trying to get on without you for the past few years,<br>has been great and good,<br>or so i thought,<br>but seeing you again proved me wrong,<br>i may not think about you,<br>but neverless you have never left my heart,<br>not in the past and not now,<br>with all the choices of getting you in my life and forgetting about you,<br>i am at a cross road now,<br>waiting for a kind soul who would just give me instructions to follow,<br>unfortunately life do not work out this way,<br>and so here i am again,<br>at the crossroad i was years ago...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>just like birds in the skies,<br>i would hope to be close to you,<br>but no matter how close i am to you,<br>there is just this one thing that keeps me away,<br>your heart,<br>the further you are from me,<br>the nearer i want to be to you,<br>but the nearer i am to you,<br>the further you are from me,<br>i can't forget the past,<br>and i can't go back to the past<br>to change the things<br>which should not have happened,<br>i do not have magic powers to change the past,<br>the more i wanted to,<br>the more it would haunt me,<br>but i do know that i have the power to change the future,<br>to change the way i look at you,<br>to change the way i think and miss you,<br>to finally let go of you and our past,<br>i know it would be hard,<br>it must be hard so that i would never take the past to the future,<br>i would not say i would try or i would do my best,<br>i would tell myself,<br>i must do it,<br>it's now or never,<br>if not then when?<br>things would drag on and on and on,<br>it's like a neverending story,<br>and so from this moment on,<br>i shall look high up into the sky and tell myself that,<br>just like the birds in the sky,<br>i am going to look far and fly high instead of flying close to you,<br>i promise...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>hiding in your arms<br>i could feel the warmness of you and your love<br>but as time passes me by<br>the warmth turns into coldness<br>and soon i was overwhelmed by the coldness<br>that has since turned into snow<br>i looked around for the once felt warmth but to find none<br>then i finally realised that you are gone<br>really gone<br>with no sympathy or empathy<br>no love or concern<br>not even a single tear in your eyes<br>you have once again left me all alone<br>in this long cold rain<br>only for me to wait for another passer-by<br>just like how i waited for you..."<br><br></div>
