            <div class='col-md body'>A few weeks ago, I was rushing around trying to do some Valentine's Day shopping done. I was stressed out and not thinking very fondly of the weather right then.<br><br>It was dark, cold, and wet in the parking lot as I was loading my car up. I noticed that I was missing a receipt that I might need later. So mumbling under my breath, I retraced my steps to the mall entrance. As I was searching the wet pavement for the lost receipt, I heard a quiet sobbing. The crying was coming from a poorly dressed boy of about 12 years old. He was short and thin. He had no coat. He was just wearing a ragged flannel shirt to protect him from the cold night's chill. Oddly enough, he was holding a hundred dollar bill in his hand. Thinking that he had gotten lost from his parents, I asked him what was wrong.<br><br>He told me his sad story. He said that he came<br>from a large family. He had three brothers and four sisters. His<br>father had died when he was nine years old. His Mother was poorly<br>educated and worked two full time jobs. She made very little to support her large family. Nevertheless, she had managed to skimp and<br>save two hundred dollars to buy her children some Valentine's Day<br>presents (since she didn't manage to get them anything on Christmas).<br><br>The young boy had been dropped off, by his mother, on the way to her<br>second job. He was to use the money to buy presents for all his<br>siblings and save just enough to take the bus home. He had not even<br>entered the mall, when an older boy grabbed one of the hundred dollar<br>bills and disappeared into the night.<br><br>"Why didn't you scream for help?" I asked. The boy said, "I did."<br><br>"And nobody came to help you?" I queried. The boy stared at the sidewalk and sadly shook his head.<br><br>"How loud did you scream?" I inquired. The soft-spoken boy looked up and meekly whispered, "Help me!"<br>I realized that absolutely no one could have<br>heard that poor boy cry for help. So I grabbed his other hundred and made a run to my car.<br><br>P.S. I didn't expect it would be such an ending. So mean.<br></div>
