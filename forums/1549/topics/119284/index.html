Money to replace cloth is called "Cloth Money".<br><br>The red packet should be marked with the kind of present they represent. However, the most important present should be brought in person. These include the "Dragon and Phoenix cake", Chinese cake (8 pieces), a pair of candles, a pair of Chinese couplet and fruit (one dozen) etc.<br><br>For Chinese cake, 8 pieces are enough. Others may substitute it by cake coupon.<br><br>Other presents can also be considered, such as car, house or red packet money.<br><br>Actually, the simplest way is to replace all of this by one red packet with "Gift money" marked on it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bride Leaving Home<br><br>In open air, a red umbrella is used to shield the bride, as the opening of the umbrella will symbolize her bringing many descendants to the groom's family.

Some regional custom requires that the family should return the head and tail of the roasted pig to the groom's family symbolizing the good beginning and end of the wedding.<br><br>Simplified procedure<br><br>Roasted pig can replace most of the gifts and the pig should be bought near the bride's house.<br><br>The return can be done on the wedding day or the next day after wedding, but not 3 days after the wedding.<br><br>For the return on the wedding day, it should be done after the couples meet the groom's parents and relatives. After the return, the couple can go back to the groom's house or to the restaurant. Actually, it will save more time and money if the return is done on the wedding day because you don't have to hire the car and the wedding gown again. Moreover, the new couple can go for the honeymoon the day after the wedding.<br></div>
