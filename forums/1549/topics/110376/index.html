I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet, made her arms gentle enough to give comfort... !<br><br>I gave her the inner strength to endure childbirth<br>and the rejection that many times will come even from her own children.<br><br>I gave her a hardness that allows her<br>to keep going and take care of her family and friends,<br>even when everyone else gives up, through sickness and fatigue without<br>complaining....<br><br>I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all<br>circumstances. Even when her child has hurt her badly....<br><br>She has the very special power to make a child's boo-boo feel better and to quell a teenager's anxieties and fears....<br><br>I gave her strength to care for her husband, despite faults<br>and I fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart....<br><br>I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife, but<br>sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him<br>unfalteringly....<br><br>For all of this hard work, I also gave her a tear to shed.<br>It is hers to use whenever needed and it is her only weakness....<br><br>When you see her cry, tell her how much you love her, and all she does for everyone, and even though she may still cry, you will have made her heart feel good.<br></div>
