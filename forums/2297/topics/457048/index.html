              <p>Yes, both your workings are essentially correct. Just a couple of comments.</p>
              <p>------------------------------</p>
              <p>The 2nd proton dissociation of H2SO4 is significant. Afterall, your own calculations indicate the pH to be less than 2. Therefore, it's technically inaccurate* to say "<em>Assuming little ionisation of HSO4-",</em> rather, what you meant was "<em>Assuming it's mathematically valid to approximate equilibrium molarity of HSO4- back to its initial molarity</em>". Mathematically, such an approximation would be valid only if the initial molarity was at least 1000x larger than the Kc (eg. Ka) value, which it's not, in this case. Which means you cannot use approximation, and have to solve the quadratic equation (eg. via a graphing calculator). However, Cambridge has specified that for 'A' level purposes, they will ensure that in their questions, the initial molarity is always at least 1000x larger than the Kc value, so that the approximation is mathematically valid.</p>
              <p>(* there's a 2nd reason why your statement is technically inaccurate. "Ionization" (unless you specify "2nd ionization energy", etc) implies to generate an ion from a non-ion, hence to say "H2SO4 ionizes to HSO4-" is fine, but to say "HSO4- ionizes to SO4 2-" is technically inaccurate. Hence, a better phrasing for Bronsted-Lowry acids would be "proton dissociation" rather than "ionization", and a better phrasing for Bronsted-Lowry bases would be "hydrolysis" rather than "ionization" or "dissociation").</p>
              <p>------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Yes, your method for determining molarity of OH- is correct : you have to re-use the Kb formula in the new volume, instead of just dividing the initial molarity by 2. This is because the position of equilibrium shifts (as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle) when more water is added, providing for a greater availability of protons for the NH3 base to abstract, hence generating more OH- ions in the new equilibrium compared to simply dividing the previous molarity of OH- ions by half, ie. 0.0007 &gt; (0.001)/2, but because the new molarity of NH3 is itself halved in the newly doubled volume, hence the new molarity of OH- is still less than the previous molarity, 0.0007 &lt; 0.001.</p>

              <p>Sulfur dioxide and oxygen reacts to form sulfur trioxide</p>
              <p>2SO2 + O2 &lt;--&gt; 2SO3   Kp = 0.13 atm</p>
              <p>Some SO3 was added to a container and equilibirum was reached.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The flawed question both contradicts and proves itself. It implies that at initial, only SO3 was present. Hence the initial pressure of SO3 = P - 0 = P, since P is (ridiculously) defined as total pressure at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span></strong> time, hence the question proves itself and there's no need for any working.</p>
              <p>I'd advise you to advise your students not to bother chasing the dodgy and the dubious. Many JC prelim paper questions are so problematic (every year, there will always be many JC teachers who disagree with, openly sneer at and even outright ridicule the prelim paper questions and/or mark schemes from other JCs, and instruct their students to ignore the question and/or mark scheme) that I routinely tell my students to skip many of such questions entirely.</p>
              <p>I prefer to set my own questions, and/or use more reliable quality sources such as practice questions from various University textbooks (which I use for teaching my BedokFunland JC students).</p>
              <p>Be discriminating when encountering dubious, dodgy questions, in your (students') practice work.</p>

              <p>That was my original suspicions at first, it was part of a question (provided no other info was omitted) they had to answer for a test.</p>
              <p>For one thing, it didn't exactly specify if O2 and SO2 was already present in the first place, so I wasnt sure if it that should be taken in consideration...or if it even matters at all.</p>
