              <p>Hello, I am a sec 4 student living in the east near tanjong katong. I am planning to go to JC next year, but however, I am confused over certain things.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I want to go to a jc that is near my house. So i figured that its either TJC, or MJC(vjc is near, but its too hard). Is there any other JC's in the area near east coast? Does anyone know the cut off point of the 2 streams in these schools?</p>
              <p>ANd in JC, can you choose any subject you like? Just pick and match? Or is it like secondary school, one course one fixed set of subjects.</p>
              <p>Secondly, what is this H1/h2/h3? I don't get it at all.</p>
              <p>Finally, is anyone in these schools above? how is it like there?</p>

              <p>Most JCs have fixed subjects combination which you can choose from. It is like the sushi package, you can't take out the tuna sushi just because you don't like it, though you can choose another package of sushis which does not contain tuna sushi in it.</p>
              <p>An exception will be YJC, where you are allowed to mix and match subjects. Subjects are mainly divided into two types, Science and Arts subject. There is a basic rule though for all JCs - you must have at least one contrasting subject. This means that you can have 3 Science subjects but your 4th subject must be a Arts subject.</p>
              <p>H1,H2 and H3 represents the difficulty and level of the subjects. Each subject has these 3 levels of difficulties.</p>
              <p>The standard JC student will have 3H2 and 1H1 subjects or 4H2 subject. H3 subjects are taken only by those students who are very outstanding in that particular subject, and wants more exposure to it.</p>
              <p>An example will be H1, H2 and H3 maths. H1 maths is the basic stuffs, slightly advanced from A-maths, H2 will be much tougher, whereas H3 mathematics will combine elements of uni level mathematics.</p>
              <p>Any other questions?</p>

              <p>I guess the only question left unanswered is on how the two JCs you mentioned are like. But, I am only capable of answering your question about MJC.</p>
              <p>MJC's art stream is 9 and science stream is 10. What is it like there? Honestly, I don't know, because I'm not sure how the other JCs work. But you should know that you'll have to mug very hard in JC but you should expect to not score As,Bs,Cs etc easily but often end up in U, S and E. The promotion criteria in MJC is to have a minimum of S grade for all subjects (which is a sub-pass), and an E for GP. One U will land you in another year of JC1 or in a group called advanced whereby your parents plead to the school that you'll work hard in JC2, and more than that will land you in another route (i.e poly). The thing about this is that, they're rather strict about this criteria, and other than moderation, would not show any mercy to you if you land up in this situation. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, it has a good and condusive environment for you to study in because nearing the examinations period, the study benches will be full of people mugging, alongside with many teachers available for consultation.</p>

              <p>So are there any other JCs in my area? I can infer from reading your answer that MJC is very strict. I always thought that the science stream would be harder to get in compared to the arts stream.You mean just one fail and you're done for? I assume U is ungraded, and S is Subpass. What is E?</p>
              <p>I went to the TJC and the MJC website. I took a look at the subjects combinations offered but i still don't get it. ANd TJC is harder to get in compared to MJC right?</p>

              <p>Strict in terms of academic only. As long as your hair/uniform isn't untolerably untidy, they will not do anything to you.</p>
              <p>E is a decent pass in A levels. However, getting an E in A levels is not good. With all the moderation and whatever curves you have, getting a C is already very risky. But I believe in all if not most JCs, your results in school are usually hitting the U/S/E grades to push you to do better.</p>
              <p>MJC believes to rather let you get a decent diploma than to get a useless Alevels cert at the end of 2 years which brings you nowhere. Therefore, they are extremely strict in letting you promote/stay on in the school.</p>
              <p>The determination of the cut off point is from the highest point that enter that particular stream, so it isn't always the case whereby science stream will have a lower cut off than the arts. </p>
              <p>And yes, TJC has lower cut off points. Truth be told, usually MJC holds people who are TJC/VJC-rejected. </p>

              <p>If I'm not wrong, TJC's cut off point is 5.</p>
              <p>I'm sure many should have told you this, but it can be quite useful. Do 5 questions of each subject per day (from various topics) and by the time you reach O'levels, you would have practised a lot of questions and not panic since you still remember your past topics. </p>
              <p>You may post whatever questions you have in SGForums together which your worked solutions so that people can correct your mistakes, instead of simply posting one whole string of questions. :)</p>

              <p>If you're afraid that it is not enough, do more questions for the subject you're weaker at. And by 1 question, I mean one complete question at O's, not just a short question.</p>
              <p>There are bound to be black sheep everywhere, even in TJC. Nevertheless, the probability of finding them is very small. The higher probability lies in knowing people who are selfish and do not help you in your studies. </p>

              <p>There are people who studied hard for months before the "O"s, but their results are so-so only.</p>
              <p>There are people who studied a few nights before, yet they got outstanding results with 1s and 2s.</p>
              <p>The main thing is not about what time you start the "hardcore" studying routine, it is about how you go about your daily school life. If you have worked hard all the way and paid attention in class <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>consistently</strong></span>, there is little chance of you not scoring well.</p>

              <p>To be truthful to you, B4 isn't a very good grade.</p>
              <p>If that is what you have been getting all these while, I suggest that you work harder starting from now and change your learning and reading methods if necessarily.</p>
