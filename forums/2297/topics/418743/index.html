              That may have been the case in the past. Nowadays, it is a rather sought after course of study.

              <p>For local entry to dentistry in NUS through poly, there is only one known case thus far if I am not wrong. Thus, JC will be a better route, unless you aim to study dentistry in overseas unis.</p>
              <p>Each undergraduate batch will only have about 40 people, as compared to about 300 in Medicine. Thus, you can see how incredibly competitive it is going to be.</p>

              More info can be found at the NUS, Faculty of Dentistry website. Do search under prospective students, you should find the answer to Biology or Physics there.
              
              The competition in recent years has been very keen. Applicants are first short listed based on academic results. Of course there are some who merit special considerations. Those who make it through are invited for a manual dexterity test and an interview. I believe that the final decision is made there.
              
              The only poly student (that I know of)  who was accepted because he had excellent credentials and impressed at the interview. His story was reported in the local media.
              
              Most of the successful applicants had 'A' levels and had straight As. Then again most students took the 'A' levels...    
              
              The IB student I know of had perfect score of 45.
              
              Hope this info is helpful. Wishing you a Blessed Christmas and a wonderful new year .

              That may have been true years ago. I believe that it is no longer the case. 
              
              Yong Loo Lin, School of Medicine about 250.
              Duke-NUS  about 50. Applicants to Duke must have a basic degree  
              Look out for the NTU medical programme.
              
              It is so competitive nowadays..... . Just glad my time is over.

              <p>Just to add on, hehe-haha-hoho, remember, it is still possible to enter dentistry in NUS even if you enter poly. If one person has done it before, it means that others may be able to do it as well. (Though this one person is really a very impressive individual - not many people can keep up good grades while frequently volunteering and helping out in community service areas.)</p>
              <p>If you are really determined to become a dentist, and you are unable to make it to NUS dentistry (Touchwood), you can always go overseas to study, though you must be prepared to work really hard, as overseas studies will be very expensive.</p>

              <p>More info can be found at the <span>NUS</span>, Faculty of Dentistry website. Do search under prospective students, you should find the answer to Biology or Physics there.</p>
              <p>The competition in recent years has been very keen. Applicants are first short listed based on academic results. Of course there are some who merit special considerations. Those who make it through are invited for a manual dexterity test and an interview. I believe that the final decision is made there.</p>
              <p>The only poly student (that I know of) who was accepted because he had excellent credentials and impressed at the interview. His story was reported in the local media.</p>
              <p>Most of the successful applicants had ‘A’ levels and had straight As. Then again most students took the ‘A’ levels…</p>
              <p>The IB student I know of had perfect score of 45.</p>
              <p>Hope this info is helpful. Wishing you a Blessed Christmas and a wonderful new year .</p>
