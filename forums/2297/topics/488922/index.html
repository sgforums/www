                      Entropy change tells you about the measure of disorderliness before and after a chemical reaction. Why do you need entropy, in addition to enthalpy?<br><br>When considering the choice of a job, profession or career, you need to consider both job satisfaction, as well as how well it pays you. Both factors are important.<br><br>Of course, which factor is more important at this point in time to you, also depends on your family financial needs, eg. how much you need to support your family. <br><br>Your family financial needs is represented by temperature. Job satisfaction is represented by enthalpy. Job pay is represented by entropy.<br><br>If your family financial needs (temperature) is high, then job pay (entropy) takes priority over job satisfaction (enthalpy). If your family financial needs (temperature) is low, then job satisfaction (enthalpy) takes priority over job pay (entropy).<br><br>For the choice of a job / career / profession that successfully suits you and allows you to proceed forward in your life, both job satisfaction and job pay need to be considered, and is affected by a 3rd variable, family financial needs. For a chemical reaction to successfully proceed in the forward direction (ie. for Gibbs free energy to be negative and thermodynamically feasible and favorable), both enthalpy and entropy need to be considered, and is affected by a 3rd variable, temperature.

                      Yes, Gibbs free energy change depends on 3 variables : enthalpy, entropy and temperature.<br><br>By definition, *enthalpy change* of formation of elements in their standard states have a zero value, while the *entropy* of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to zero.<br><br>Here's why standard entropy change for most reactions isn't zero : consider (as an example) the formation of ammonia : notice that in the balanced equation for N2 and H2 elements to combine chemical to form NH3, there are 4 moles of gases on the LHS, and only 2 moles of gas on the RHS, which therefore results in a negative entropy change (whether at standard or non-standard conditions).

              still occur *provided* that such a thermodynamically non-feasible
              reaction is *coupled* with a separate, external chemical reaction
              that *is* highly thermodynamically feasible and favorable, and
              hence highly spontaneous, ie. a large magnitude of negative Gibbs
              free energy change.<br> <br> Such a coupling would ensure that the *overall* Gibbs free energy
              change of both coupled chemical reactions would, in totality, still
              be negative, thermodynamically feasible and hence
              spontaneous.<br> <br> Examples of thermodynamically non-feasible or non-spontaneous
              reactions from H2 Biology that certainly continue to occur
              (otherwise you wouldn't be alive to read this), would be
              photosynthesis and protein synthesis.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the detailed explanation. You brought up an important point that systems can be viewed in either isolation or coupled.</p>
