              <p>JC is never wrong choice in a world obsessed for degrees.....the best diploma is still only a diploma....</p>
              <p>and agreed totally....its much harder to jump from poly to uni unless u r very very good....so be smart...go JC...chances are so much higher....provided u strive hard too...</p>
              <p>no offence...but the general perception is that poly is vocational ... studying for a skill compared to academically all round liberal arts/ science students...that breeds the culture of "elitism" which produces lawyers, bankers, doctors....and what have you professionals.......</p>

              <p>I will strongly advise you take the JC route for aerospace engineering. </p>
              <p>If you are talking about other engineering courses such as computer and triple E, taking the poly route is fine as long as you work hard and commit yourself to your studies.</p>
              <p>However, aerospace engineering takes in only a small amount of poly students each year (which you can literally count with 1 hand), and sometimes not even any at all for certain batches. Even for JC students, they need near perfect results at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very least</span> to go in. In certain years where there is more competition, they will require straight "A"'s instead. </p>

              <p>No such thing as top 3% nowadays. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>A lot depends on which faculty and courses you are taking - There are some engineering courses where there is a good 30% or so poly students. The rest 70% are not all JC students, as there are foreign students as well as others applying with alternate forms of qualification.</p>

              <p>if u missed your academic chance to JC, dun be disheartened as well....u can go poly as the next best alternative...which you have at least undergone through the well established and strict technical regime that our poly is known for....and while u r in there, strive towards NTU or NUS......and if u know u cannot make it again, think many steps ahead and ask your lecturers for the best foreign university....and its best to go full time 4 years (with B. Eng Hons) than part time which is less recognized.... </p>
              <p>if u said u have no knowledge or dislike maths....then it is a real disadvantage for u in any engineering courses....</p>

              <p>1) Yes. For some JCs such as YJ and JJ they allow it. For others, you can appeal for it if your L1R5 is good. Note that you will likely need to appeal to take up H2 Maths. </p>
              <p>2) That is good. Work hard and wait for your "O"-lvl results and see which will be a better choice for yourself. Of course, you will have to consider other factors such as other areas of interest.</p>
              <p>3) I can't say anything for diploma. But from what I heard, for those with aerospace engineering degrees, it is still not easy to get a job in related fields.However, if they do, the pay is comparatively much more higher than that of various other fields of job.</p>

              <p>If you plan to do Aerospace engineering, then you better take JC route.<br> <br> 2 Years backs, I was like you. I wanted to an Aerospace engineer, but I 
                  don't where to go. In the end, I chose JC over poly due to financial 
                  constraints. But I never regret my choice as I have already reserved a 
                  place in aerospace engineering in NTU to study. If you go poly and can't
                   make it to Uni. Then, you will stuck with diploma for the rest of your 
                  life, unless you can afford oversea degrees. Let me tell you the truth, a
                   diploma holder will work as a technician rather than the tittle of 
                  "aerospace engineer"in aerospace industry, don't expect high salaries. 
                  In JC, if your result can't make it to aerospace engineering in Uni, you
                   still can take up other courses like mechanical/electrical engineering 
                  which will also eventually lead to you to become an aerospace engineer.</p>

              <p>If you are a Singaporean guy, the JC route has more advantages.</p>
              <p>Imagine for a 4 year uni course, you study for the first year, then you break for 2 years to serve NS, before coming back for the next 3 years</p>
              <p>Vs doing a 4 year uni course directly without any breaks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The former is a little similar to going through the poly route to uni.</p>

              <p>It is going to be very tough, and you will likely need help from tuition.</p>
              <p>All the mods here will agree with me though, that it is very possible to do well if you get a good tutor and is willing to work very hard.</p>

              <p>is it that hard to enter university engineering via the poly

              in the future….and i am thinking of going via the poly route
              because i have no a maths knowledge,and go to university via the JC

              <p>NO. </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, you still have to study MATHS when you go poly. And that is maths 1, maths 2 and engineering maths. In fact, u study more maths than in JC in that 3 years. As engineering diploma prepare you to work as an engineering assistant when you graduate.</p>

              <p>I got one student from YJ and one from MI who didn't take A maths but took the 2010 A levels H2 maths.</p>
              <p>Both of them are quiet confident they can get A.</p>
