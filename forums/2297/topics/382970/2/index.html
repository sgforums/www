              <p>/me facepalm...</p>
              <p>TS is looking for clarification and since ur first post, u have not mention little or anything to do with Fern... in the end, U keep insisting and continue to talk abt "grading not important", "your working habits", "your view on life". "your view on the system"...</p>
              <p>Instead of providing clarification, you have to go out of point, write some fancy stuffs that is better off at speaker's corner...</p>
              <p>Why try to complicate everything when TS is simply asking for clarification ??? Again, I'll rephrase... TS is not trying to challenge the system or anything and is just simply trying to understand why did the teacher says it's wrong...</p>
              <p>I'll still suggest TS go ask the teacher for an explanation... I personally dun think anyone could help the teacher explain as they themselves are not exact same person as the teacher... For all u might know, the teacher could have been lacked of slp and made a mistake? might never know until u asked...</p>

              <p>Ya, I got this from Wikipedia. Really a zillion thanks to everybody for your valuable views.</p>
              <p>Given 2 Qs set on fern and all answers directed to "Fern is not a plant". The understanding is definitely wrong, and this is not careless mistake.</p>
              <p>Since the teacher will be my kid's form teacher next year, I have to handle it tactfully. Not only Science, English and Maths also taught by her. I sincerely hope that the teacher is willing to calrify with open mind.</p>
              <p>I think I will approach the teacher first, give her opportunity to explain. If School is responsible, I will check with the School/Subject-Master. If nobody able to answer, then I have no choice but to turn to MOE for help.</p>
              <p>I hope not to cause unneccessary tension and too hope that nothing will affect the teacher's career path. Juz for clarification, and try to alert the School and public, if education is given on loosen ground, wat expectation can we set for the next generation? Check up your kid's homework and test papers, no matter how busy you are (negligent, this is my mistake).</p>
              <p>Again, a zillion thanks to everybody.  :)</p>

              <p>My kid makes mistake everywhere :(</p>
              <p>Spelling/grammatical etc. I asked her any advice from Science teacher since she is also the English lang. teacher. My kid shared that the teacher ever claim that she need not do teaching yet still can get her money. I don't quite understand this. But this is side track,  I just want to keep things simple.</p>
              <p>MOE wld be my last resort if I cldn't get any satisfactory answer from the School. I respect the School and all the staff, hope not to sour any relationship with them, lets hope so...</p>
              <p>My kid learnt about 4 groups namely animals, plants, fungi and micro-organism.</p>
              <p>So I agree that for Q18., Bacteria is wrongly classified. However, what written on the white board as correction was "Fern".</p>
              <p>For Q14, I still feel that "Toad" is the most suitable answer.</p>

              <p>toad is animal lah..... the only misleading thing about toad ii that its amphibian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, amphibian = ectothermic (cold-blooded) animal that metamorphose from a juvenile water-breathing form to an adult air-breathing form. so still animal. </p>

              You know what's the funny thing. It's that these teachers probably mark to the best of their knowledge, and there are certain things that are beyond the level of students to grasp yet.
              
              It's just like in primary school, algebra is not taught yet, but when I learnt how to use algebra in basic equations instead of models, I was marked wrong during homework and etc.
              
              In this case, I think if the term 'amphibians' is not taught yet in the syllabus, then the teacher should not expect students to be able to answer questions like that.
              
              Say for example in my sexuality class, they ask if it is possible to contract aids from saliva. Theoretically it is said that it is not possible, but backed up research has proven that huge quantities can lead to contracting aids. Yet on the other hand, you ask when does it occur when someone with aids provides you large quantities of saliva, But, it is possible.
              
              I suggest you clarify with the teacher =). If I were you I would understand if somewhere in the textbook it states the right answer, and your child got it wrong, then that's not the teacher's fault. If the teacher suggests the possibility of her students going online to do research, contest scientific research, and provide proper backing to the student's findings, then I think she should be teaching at a higher level instead.

                              <p>Ya, I got this from Wikipedia. Really a zillion thanks to
              everybody for your valuable views.</p>
              <p>Given 2 Qs set on fern and all answers directed to "Fern is not
              a plant". The understanding is definitely wrong, and this is not
              careless mistake.</p>
              <p>Since the teacher will be my kid's form teacher next year, I
              have to handle it tactfully. Not only Science, English and Maths
              also taught by her. I sincerely hope that the teacher is willing to
              calrify with open mind.</p>
              <p>I think I will approach the teacher first, give her opportunity
              to explain. If School is responsible, I will check with the
              School/Subject-Master. If nobody able to answer, then I have no
              choice but to turn to MOE for help.</p>
              <p>I hope not to cause unneccessary tension and too hope that
              nothing will affect the teacher's career path. Juz for
              clarification, and try to alert the School and public, if education
              is given on loosen ground, wat expectation can we set for the next
              generation? Check up your kid's homework and test papers, no matter
              how busy you are (negligent, this is my mistake).</p>
              <p>Again, a zillion thanks to everybody.  :)</p>

              Indeed, we are all PARTLY responsible for our children's future, and it is good to know there are parents who are active in their kid's lives, school etc. Your child is in good parenting hands =D

              <p>u might wanna teach ur kid another lesson of life earlier.... and ie. all human made mistake, teacher are no exception. It's not a matter of can LISTEN to the teacher or not in furture,since they only teach what they know best to their knowledge. So, dun just listen blindly....</p>
              <p>Learn to question what is being fed at an early age, like the westerner. It is a rather handy tools for life.</p>
              <p>Seek 2nd opinion or look up/research whenever in doubt.</p>
              <p>The key here is, dun just accept what is been given. Learn to ponder on it and arrive at ur own conclusion.</p>
              <p>Form ur own tot and lastly, apply ur knowledge whenever possible.</p>
