                                <strong>"Air fern" - This not a plant at all but an animal, a hydrozoan, and distantly related to jellyfish and corals. It is harvested, dried, dyed green, and then sold as a plant that can "live on air". While it may look like a fern, it is merely the skeleton of this colonial animal. </strong>

              She is primary 3.
              The Q is to place the follwing under animal group P.
              1.  Fern
              2. Toad
              3. Leather Belt
              4. Silk Blouse
              My kid answered 2. Marked wrong. Correction is 1 (Fern).
              
              Another Q asked about which item is wrongly classified?
              1. Plant ----- Fern; Morning Glory
              2. Animals ------ Elephant; Swan
              3. Fungi ----- Mould; Bacteria
              My kid answered : They are correctly classified. 
              But marked wrong. Correction is Fern is wrongly classified.

              <p>Probably the first question is which is not in an animal group. The correct answer is 1. Fern.</p>
              <p>The second question should be 3. as bacteria are not a fungi.</p>
              <p>Hope this help.</p>

              <p>people see my english marks in certificate very poor but i still can make it at work, in fact better than some managers i work with. one look at the english email they sent i look i am much better in writing than them. also people see some of my olevel subjects very poor - think can hit me hard at such areas. but they were wrong. grades means nothingand the results were dated many years back. time passes and who know how much i had learn in the years that lapse. so unknowingly they hit me now at my strongest point.</p>

              <p>so don't take marks and grades in school too seriously.</p>
              <p>people see my english marks in certificate very poor but i still can make it at work, in fact better than some managers i work with. one look at the english email they sent i look i am much better in writing than them. also people see some of my olevel subjects very poor - think can hit me hard at such areas. but they were wrong. grades means nothingand the results were dated many years back. time passes and who know how much i had learn in the years that lapse. so unknowingly they hit me now at my strongest point.</p>

              <p>Yes. My real worry is "learning the wrong thing/knowledge under the name of compulsory education".</p>

              <p><br>well if that question marks the line between getting 78 marks and 80 marks, one step into a higher grade for exmaple then its all about grades - it can determine if you get to where you want to be, at work or further education.</p>

              <p>yes there is nothing wrong about persuiing what is just and right. but maybe the teacher go by the book, to mark fern as an animal instead of plant, a flaw in the system and grading so there is nothing wrong about that.</p>

              <p>i did try to apply such actions at work, but at the wrong time, wrong situation on wrong people it will mean hell for the rest of the time within the company.</p>

              <p>but just remember not to go to hard even if you know what you are doing is right. you can apply that at work since after education work is a very differnt think. sometime it will go by the book but most of the time it won't.</p>

              <p>as for question 2, its abit harder. unless u perform possible choice of elimination. As mention above, bacteria aint fungi.</p>

The organisms live as <a class="ilnk" style="color: #003399; " href="http://www.answers.com/topic/parasite">parasites</a>, symbionts, or saprobes (see <a class="ilnk" style="color: #003399; " href="http://www.answers.com/topic/saprophyte">saprophyte</a>). <strong>Previously classified in the plant kingdom</strong>, fungi are nonmotile, like plants, but lack the vascular tissues (phloem and xylem) that form the true roots, stems, and leaves of plants. Most coenocytic (multinucleated) or multicelluar fungi are composed of multiple filaments, called hyphae, grouped together into a discrete organism called a mycelium. The cell walls of fungi are of chitin or other noncellulose compounds. <strong>In many ways fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants</strong>, and they have been thought to share a common protist ancestor with animals. A recent classification system suggested by nucleic acid (genetic material) comparisons places the fungi with the animals and the plants in an overarching taxonomic group called the eukarya.</span></p>
