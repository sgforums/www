              <p>i agree.lol.gifted students tend to be much more capable of expressing the ideas,theories.they are also much more confident than 'normal' ppl.the bad thing is,majority of them are dismissive of ppl they think are not their intellectual equals as in the case of my friend.my other friends blatantly asked me what i was doing with him and also asked me why my friend was so stupid.all of us are scholars except for my other friend,who was notorious in our medic course for his blurness and inability to digest information as fast as the rest of us.</p>

              <p>I asked a simple fucking question. If they are the top 1% of the entire population then theres obviously something to it. Theres nothing wrong in trying to follow the steps of those in a better league than you.</p>
              <p>I believe that there is a gifted programme even in uni?</p>
              <p>Instead of being critical and dismissive, either help or dont. No need to give me the "why care about them?" attitude.</p>
              <p>They might really be at the top in secondary school and then burn out at tertiary level JC. But if they can do so well then there must be something to it. Thats what Im asking for!</p>

              <p>Gifted students... You either have it or you don't. Seriously.</p>
              <p>No matter how hard you work, it's just something you're born with. (Of course if you have it but you don't work you could still lose it though.)</p>
              <p>Really, much of it is based on innate learning abilities. They have natural talents for learning.</p>
