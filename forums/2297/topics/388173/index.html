              <p>Today it's 16 of january 2010 , I'm in ITE initially and i'd become assiduous about my future everyday i enter ITE gate. I got 7 GCE N(A) passes and i'd thought that i should take Private 'O' level while still taking course in ITE. I'm 17 this year and if i did very well for GCE 'O' level as a private candidate 2010.. I will stand a chance to enter JC. Do you think it's a good way? or just silly? I need your opinions badly thanks. Btw , i'd know that to enter JC i need to be a good CCA student right? - No, don't worry i got it as 'As' in my secondary education.</p>

              <p>It will be incredibly tough, as you will have to juggle your ITE studies with your "O"-level studies. If you lose this gamble, your ITE results will not be good enough for you to enter poly, and your "O"-level results will not be good enough for you to enter both JC and Poly.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you need not a good CCA record to enter JC. A good CCA record is necessary only for those entering top JCs and requiring the 2 points cut-off.</p>
              <p>Do you like your studies now in ITE? If you do, I will suggest that you focus on your studies and try to be one of the top in your cohort, and move on to poly. </p>

              <p>dont be stupid...</p>
              <p>go and study hard for your ITE and move on to POLY...</p>
              <p>Otherwise if you insists on re-taking O levels then do it and get into POLY afterwards.. Dont bother about going to JC. Going to JC does not necessary give you a higher chance of getting into Uni. In fact you might just die at the hands of th A Level, which then you might be dont know how old and yet with only O level qualification, since you might have flunked your A level.</p>
              <p>Go to a POLY instead. A POLY cert is better than A level cert. You can go from POLY to Uni if you study harder. POLY exams are easier and if you get good grades and GPA, you will still be able to enter Uni.</p>
              <p>Forget about JC. If you cant make it to JC on the first try, then dont bother. You must have other alternatives prepared!!</p>

              <p>study jc for wad?</p>
              <p>The end product is to get into a uni.<br>The route of ite &gt; poly &gt; uni is more feasible than ite &gt; private O's &gt; A level &gt; uni</p>
              <p>Simply because:</p>
              <p>Path 1: Even if you screw up ite or poly,and you get a managable pass, you still can get a decent job and study part time if needed</p>
              <p>Path 2: Screw up private O's and because of O's screw up ite (due to lack of concentration on one aspect) or if you are lucky, do well for O's and screw up jc, you still can only teach tuition if you screw up jc.</p>
              <p>Anyway i might sound blunt, but you didn't make it the first round over, what makes you think you can do it the second time?</p>
              <p>Any think about it, even if you make it to jc, how would your peers look at you? coming from ite to join a jc. I might sound cynical but thats the real truth</p>

              <p>alot of N(A) peeps i my school went from s4 N level to s5 O levels in hoping to get into poly, but they failed and end up like those N(T) peeps and enter ITE. Not to pour cold water or what, it is a matter how you guage yourself. So if they cannot even make the jump to poly, what makes you think you can jump to JC? some of my classmates made the cut for JC, but guess what, retained in J1 and same 3 years to those in poly.</p>
              <p>Like most have said, study well in ITE and if can go into poly and to be honest, the ITE peeps in my poly are much more matured and hardworking than those who came in from sec sch directly.</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="../../../users/262457">Zen.hackerz</a> , i support you to retake your O level. If you can get better results, then you can save 1 year as you can apply for poly immediately, or JC if you want to. The age limit for JC is 20 years old, therefore you shouldn't have any problem getting into any JC if you are qualified for it.</p>
              <p>I disagree with the others here, if you want go JC by all means please go JC. For your information, the lower A level rank point for Uni course is 58 points ( Civil Engineering in NTU), that is like straight Cs &amp; below for your A lvl. However, you might have a hard time coping with JC subjects as they are quite tough. But if you are really hardworking enough, getting decent grades shouldnt be much of a problem to you.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;"><em>ITE in AMK is the most shitiest infratructure i've ever seen and i don't dare to go to the toilets and canteen over there because i really look down towards ITE...(no offence) it makes me throw up when i see someone eating in the 'refugee canteen' not 'cafeteria'..</em></span></p>
              <p>It is clear that you want to go to JC out of your contempt for ITE, and nothing more. </p>
              <p>If your attitude remains like this, I can tell you that whichever path you choose to take (be it JC, poly, or ITE) is going to be an absolute waste of time, because education is wasted on people with an attitude like yours.....</p>

                                      NITEC (jan 2010 intake) at AMK or CW-AM. well , I've taken my <strong>GCE
                                      'N(A)' Levels in the year 2009</strong> as a school candidate and i got 16

                                      at my parents to let me pursue my studies at MDIS College by taking
                                      GCE 'O' Level and quit that miserable ITE..but they deny because my

It would be better if you work part time and study. Not only will u get $$ but also stand a better chance at ur Os.

              <p>Why should you take 'O' while you are in ITE. You should focus in what you are doing now and do well in it. Get into Poly after that. Does not make sense for you to do 'O', what if you didnt do well? Isnt a waste of time.</p>
              <p>Are you in the right program in ITE by the way, something which you are interested in? Or you are just wasting your time there?</p>

              <p>Waste time in ITE huh, no waste time in the courses in your private school huh ?</p>
              <p>At least ITE is a recognised qualification and widely accepted by the employers in Singapore.</p>
