              <p>Hi all :)</p>
              <p>This is my first forum and i really need urgent advice.</p>
              <p>Im 14 and its my Sec 2 streaming year. Its SUPER important that i choose wisely cus it'll affect my career choice later. im confused about what kind of combination i should take to help me get into the career i want next time. i wanna be a cardiologist or a dentist :)</p>
              <p>i understand to be a doctor, i'll have to take triple science. Can a double science student stilll be a doctor? Like a dentist?</p>
              <p>My dilemma is to choose between Pure Physics or Pure Biology. I personally prefer bio.Pure chemistry is compulsory in my school. i've asked numerous people and they said its better to opt for Bio. But my brother said that Pure Bio and Pure Chem cannot take me anywhere.. is tat true? My fren said to opt for physics cus now Bio in secondary school is not necessary , but in JC it matters alot. But if you dont take Bio in sec, you cant take Bio in JC..is tat true?? My classmate also wants to be a doctor, but he's opting for physics. I hv no idea why... should i follow him?? &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>But what if i cannot be a doctor? Can i still  do other stuff with Pure Chem and Bio??</p>
              <p>To be in a double science class, overall percentage must be at least 70%. Math and Science must have distinctions. My Overall percentage is 71.8% ;(</p>
              <p>This is my Overall percentage grades:</p>
              <p>English Language : A2</p>

              <p>Either double pure sciences at 'O' levels, as well as at 'A' levels, will still allow you to qualify for Medicine in the Uni. You just need Chemistry as the compulsory science.</p>
              <p>When applying for Medicine, it's true that 'A' level Biology (with Chemistry) has a slight advantage over 'A' level Physics (with Chemistry), but either subject combination is still acceptable as prerequsite.</p>
              <p>Some JCs may require 'O' level Biology, before allowing you to study 'A' level Biology. But most JCs will allow you to choose 'A' level Biology without 'O' level background, as long as your overall 'O' level results are good.</p>
              <p>But other than for Medicine, it's certainly true that 'A' level Physics (which you'll be allowed to take only if you've 'O' level Physics) will open a lot more doors in terms of Uni science courses, compared to Biology. Almost all engineering courses require Physics.</p>
              <p><em>But what if i cannot be a doctor? Can i still  do other stuff with Pure Chem and Bio??</em></p>
              <p>Of course you can. As long as all your 'A' level grades are good, you can still do lots of "other stuff" with a Chemistry and Biology 'A' level subject combination (moreso thanks to the more universally required 'A' level Chemistry than to 'A' level Biology, but 'A' level Biology can still be helpful when applying for other medical-related, life-science related, biology-related courses other than Medicine itself).</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p><br>No need to take triple science. Even in JC you'll have to drop one science with that rule that forces you to take a contrasting subject. You'll probably be better off taking Bio and Chem at pure level now, A math, E math, pure history and elect geog+SS. Oh yea, and HCL and CL.</p>
              <p><br>I went to take triple science and wasted my time, had to throw away 2 yrs of work upon entering JC. You can take BCMH or BCMG in JC, no problem.</p>

              <p>Take trip science if you can.</p>
              <p>If you end up doing double science, I would say that it will be better for you to take physic over bio, as physics will open more doors. Just go take a look at the university course requirements, and you will be amazed by how almost all engineering courses require physics.</p>
              <p>If you don't intend to pick up A level physic nevermind, since some NTU engineering courses require a minimum background in O level physic. Try to fulfill some of those requirement first.</p>
              <p><strong>BUT </strong>if you are a person who doesn't really enjoy math, in that case if would be more fun for you to take bio, since you will not be happy doing physic, a subject with heavy math contents.</p>
              <p>I remember secondary sch bio as the most fun science subject among the trip science. You get to do dissection, compared to titrations reaction in chem, and rolling of balls in physics. (Physics experiments are damn boring!!!)</p>

              <p>Rather than thinking about what else you can do if you fail to enter medicine, think about what else you will WANT to do. </p>
              <p>You should also ask yourself how badly do you want to enter medicine. If you can't enter local uni, will you consider overseas uni? Or will you consider taking other degrees first or even working first?</p>
              <p>Remember, interest can be altered easily, whereas passion is what will spur you on and carry you through.</p>

              <p>Either will do. Pure Chem -&gt; H2 Chem -&gt; Medicine is what you need. Of course, you have to be a perfect scorer in A, but that is 4-year-time to you from now.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, have you planned what if you failed to obtain straight As for all your A level subjects and cannot go for medicine? Make you choice based on that then, as in the end, only the top 1% of the Jc graduates can make into medicine/denist school</p>
              <p>Most of the engineering courses only require H2 Maths but not H2 Physics, some require H2 Chemistry, I suppose very few requires H2 Biology. In addition, bioscience requires bio and physics/applied physics science require phy.</p>
