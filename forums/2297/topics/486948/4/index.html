              and peroxyethanoic acid is higher? lol totally didn't have any idea

              <p>Hello my fellow A-level warriors. First time on the forum~!</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am from the upper tier schools and I personally found it manageable and comparable to past year papers, hopefully it can make up for the egregious numbers of careless mistakes in my paper 2. My school mates all around did actually say it was challenging so don't fret if you didn't feel confident about your answers, hopefully we can all work hard together for paper 1 which should be the last or last few papers for most of us next week. Not too sure about calculations though until the numerical answers are available but the organic mechanisms were decently manageable. (Haha sir would you mind if you can post numerical answers for the calculations after you did the paper)</span></p>
              <p>Did question 1,2,4,5 because I took a quick glance at 3 and found b and the last few parts of d challenging and decided to give it a miss and go with the safer option of 2 because I was stumped at question 5 and only had 25 minutes for the last question but luckily managed to finish just when the invigilator called for time.</p>
              <p>I think the reduction of esters into 2 alcohol groups may seem very out of syllabus to us and you have every right to feel aggrieved that such a question appeared but ultimately Cambridge is only given our syllabus and learning outcomes so we cannot exactly blame them for not knowing what is in our lecture notes or not. Ultimately there were a few clues in the question like one of them being chiral and L being definitely chiral must mean that M would not be chiral and hence two similar groups must be present. I personally did encounter reduction of esters in a 2014 prelim paper before and was vaguely remembering what is formed, so I confirmed it by using the degree of unsaturation formula which many schools have tested before and you would have likely come across it during your topical practice. There are also many weird questions where for example we are taught that hydrogenation of alkenes require high temperature and pressure but in question 5 room temperature is utilised which contravenes what we learn. So end of the day, Chemistry is really about applying all our knowledge in some form or another to be able to counter Cambridge out of the blue tricks here and there, also I believe the vettors at SEAB are teachers before and cognisant of what we learn so they wouldn't be so heartless as not to drop any hints in the question.</p>
              <p>For H2O2 I wrote stabilisation by intramolecular hydrogen bonding as well because I remember Cambridge tested some form of it last year in the last question of paper 3 I think, not too sure whether it is the right way to explain but thankfully UltimaOnline has clarified our worry.</p>
              <p>For peroxyethanoic acid I think perhaps the only difference being an additional O makes the distance to C=O further hence the dispersal of the negative charge conjugate base occurs to  a lesser extent. Only difference and possible reason I guessed.</p>
              <p>Jia you guys don't fret about what is done, some people have good days and bad days but there is a margin of error for the higher grades so not too worry. I personally flung paper 2 quite badly by making numerous careless mistakes.</p>
              <p>Also, don't bother about what your friends say, many of them may be masking their true feelings and deep inside know truthfully how well they did. Those who gloat and not care about others' emotions aren't really nice people you should be around then. Remember, "Those who don't mind (your feelings) don't matter, those who mind matter". Jia you for paper 1 and your remaining papers.</p>

              Regarding calculation answers, as mentioned earlier, some JCs and some other private tutors will probably make the full solutions available online sometime. Don't worry about calculation answers. As long as you showed clear working, Cambridge will give you some marks even if you made careless mistakes.<br><br>
                  "<i>For peroxyethanoic acid I think perhaps the only difference being an additional O makes the distance to C=O further hence the dispersal of the negative charge conjugate base occurs to  a lesser extent. Only difference and possible reason I guessed.</i>"
                  <br><br>
                  No. As mentioned in a preceding post in this thread, the correct reason for the lower acidity of peroxycarboxylic acid, is that unlike carboxylic acid, the peroxycarboxylate conjugate base *cannot* be stabilized by having it's negative formal charge delocalized by resonance over 2 O atoms (as is the case with regular carboxylate conjugate bases). Stabilization by resonance delocalization of charges require conjugation, ie. sideways overlapping of unhybridized p orbitals, which is not present due to a sp3 O atom between the O- atom and the sp2 C atom.

                  First of all, the molecule isn't linear. Secondly, you're right that the bond angles are still not ideal. But for A level purposes, Cambridge will accept intramolecular hydrogen bonding as the reason.

              Not for H2 syllabus. Even if it's E-Z rather than cis-trans, just say "geometric isomers" you'll get the mark liao.

              <p>Hi I'm wondering if my answers for 1c can be accepted:</p>
              <p>H2o2 is more acidic because its conjugate base is more stable due to the dispersion of the negative charge over 2 electronegative oxygen as compared to one for water.</p>
              <p>Peroxyethanoic acid is less acidic due to intramolecular h bonding which makes it less easy to be deprotonated.</p>

              Your H2O2 answer ok, your peroxycarboxylic answer not ok. I posted the correct reason earlier in this thread liao.
