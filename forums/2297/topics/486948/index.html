              This thread is for 2014 H2 Chemistry Paper 2, Paper 3 and Paper 1 discussions. 
              <br><br>
              I may make comments on the questions and answers after each Paper. A level students are welcome to post here in this thread, with their queries to check their own answers after each paper.
              <br><br>
              For starters, as you have only 1 day left before Paper 2, you may wish to revise the entire H2 Chemistry syllabus using the many excellent summary notes, tables and mindmaps for H2 Chemistry that are free-to-download (you just need to use your Facebook account to login) from Owlcove.sg ( <a href="http://owlcove.sg/">http://owlcove.sg/</a> ).
              <br><br>
              Lastly, remember to get at least 8 hours of sleep the night before each A level paper, and also be sure to have a very light meal (just enough to supply sufficient glucose to your brain for the 2 hour duration) just before each paper, for only then will you be capable of performing your personal best.

              For those who are interested, the A grade threshold for H2 Chemistry is approximately 75%, give or take 1-3 % based on the bell-curve for the cohort.
                  <br><br>
                  So if this year's Papers 2, 3 and 1 are ridiculously easy, it may take up to 78% to score an A grade. Likewise and conversely, if this year's Papers 2, 3 and 1 are ridiculously tough, it may take as low as 72% to score an A grade.
                  <br><br>

                              <br>My personal take is, don't bother trying to predict Planning. Every year for the past 4 years, all 20 JCs fail spectacularly at predicting Cambridge's Planning question.<br><br>Regardless, those of you who are JC students, if your JC predicted any Planning question for this year, feel free to share it here for Mugger and all your fellow students?<br><br>Then 75% for A grade it is. If this year's papers are similar in difficulty to last year's papers.

              The cut-off score to get A grade in the Korean CSAT (A Level equivalent) Mathematics paper is 100%! Just 1 mark gone (even if it's just 0.1% of overall score), and there goes your A grade! Lol!

              For Korean CSAT, ask the Koreans.
              <br><br>
              For A Level H2 Chemstry, the overall % of students scoring an A grade is always somewhere between 20% to 30% (varies with each year; the bell-curve is not a absolute inflexible one, but only a relative modifier). The 'worst' JC has approximately 1% of students scoring A, while the 'best' JC has approximately 70% of students scoring A.

              If the question allows condensed formula for optical isomers, then it's true you cannot write "H3CH2C-" but you must still write as "CH3CH2-". But if the Cambridge question requires "displayed structural formula" meaning you must show all the individual bonds, then you should really draw out both optical isomers exactly as if they were mirror images, eg. if LHS optical isomer shows -O-H, the RHS optical isomer should show H-O-.
              <br><br>
              Cambridge accepts either formal charges on the individual atoms, or overall ionic charge outside the square brackets (which represents "summation" of individual formal charges). But for dot-and-cross diagram, don't show formal charges, just only show the overall ionic charge outside the square brackets, as the positive formal charge looks too similar to a cross.

              Yes, you should get full marks for drawing 4 isomers (either two sets of optical isomers, or 1 set optical isomer and 1 set geometrical isomers).<br><br>
                  <br><br>
                  - Tertiary carbocation more stable (since alkyl groups are electron donating by induction).
                  <br><br>
                  - H2O is the competing nucleophile (present in higher molarity than Br-)
                  <br><br>
                  - After H2O nucleophile adds onto carbocation intermediate, deprotonation generates the final product of bromoalcohol.
                  <br><br>
                  <br><br>
                  The immediate product is phenylammonium chloride, which is ionic and hence difficult to seprate. Hence deprotonation is required to separate the molecular phenylamine via steam distillation.
                  <br><br>
                  Based on P2 alone, an A grade should still be approximately 75%.

              <p>Hi Ultima, thanks for taking the time to respond to our queries with regards to today's paper. Got a question for you too, hope you don't mind.</p>
              <p>If I recall correctly, there was a question asking for the graphical relationship between rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction and concentration of CO2 (aq). My answer was a steeper but concave downwards curve followed by a straight line with the same gradient as the previous answer, which I believe was a straight line with a positive gradient if I'm not wrong. Something like a rate of reaction against concentration of substrate curve, just without the plateau. My understanding is that the x-axis was concentration of CO2, and not the enzyme/substrate, hence my answer, but I've observed that many others drew the same curve with a plateau. Hopefully you can clarify my doubts!</p>
              <p>Have a nice day all. :)</p>

                  Alohamadda, yes you're right, it needs to be "excess". No need to specify "ethanol", just "alcohol" will do. In fact, many students didn't even mention ethanolic/alcoholic solvent. These students may or may not be penalized (Cambridge Mark Scheme does vary a little between different years).

              Position of equilibrium for all 3 reactions shifts to the LHS. Hence pH increases.
              <br><br>
              No, spectator ions not allowed.
