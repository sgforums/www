              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  I went through a similar experience before and dropped econs after JC 1 promos. Try the subject for a while more.</p>
              <p>  Interestingly, I dislike PW too, when I was a supervising tutor :) The way it is conducted needs to be improved upon, I feel.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>I do badly in econs all the way throughout J1, Cs</p>
              <p>J2, even got D and E for common Test 2. That was when all other activities ended. So I spent the next 4 months, doing zero maths and physics and just do econs. Read finish 4 different textbooks and look through their case studies. Did about 20+ schools worth of MCQ (that time got MCQ) and did a lot of newspaper cuttings and research. Read through quite a few magazines on econs as well.</p>
              <p>Improve to B in prelims. Not happy enough, so borrowed all my friends essays who got A and read through why they score. Also wrote a few of my essays and passed to my teacher to help comment. Do a lot of essay outlines to know the points.</p>

              <p>Lemme just say this:</p>
              <p>Yr 1: I failed every single Econs essay test, and many data-response and MCQ tests.</p>
              <p>Yr 2: I started to pass my tests, but they were mostly borderline.</p>
              <p>I just barely got D or E for the Promos and the common tests.</p>
              <p>I just sucked it up and studied slowly, steadily, and thoroughly. I spent a few months (from March Yr 2 to the Prelims) creating highly-detailed mindmaps to help me understand the concepts and get a better feel of them. If I had to fail a few more tests along the way, so be it - I just learnt from my mistakes and moved on.</p>
              <p>I got B for the Prelims, and I just continued building it up from there.</p>
              <p>In the end, I got A.</p>
              <p>If you want to do well, do it slow and steady, and don't be afraid to make mistakes so long as you learn from them. Just see it this way: make all the mistakes now so that you won't do those mistakes when the sh*t truly hits the fan.</p>

              <p>Sounds more or less the same as what we went through......</p>
              <p>Getting 1 - 3 out of 25 sounds abnormal, but was the norm in J1.</p>
              <p>Asked the teacher why and the standard answer was: L1 answer...fail!!</p>
              <p>I stared at the 2 sheets of paper thinking if I write more, shouldn't it be the merrier?</p>
              <p>Of course that was not the case and it took some time of trial and error and hounding after the teachers to sieve out all the tricks, word-play, and what-nots the questions can throw at us. Find the loaded words and things will usually go right.</p>

              <p>i was lucky in that my teacher made econs very fun... ms deborah how from hwa chong. to the point where As and Bs were attainable when all my other friends had problems with grades...</p>
              <p>it would be good if you can study the LORMS scheme and then craft your answer according to the L3 level... i.e. evaluation and suitable analysis using appropriate graphs to illustrate.</p>

              <p>so most of you guys encountered the same problem. guess i'll heed the advices and hang in there for a bit. those encouragements are seriously making me feel much more better!</p>
              <p>omg eagle, what an improvement! i am definitely confident that i will be able to follow in your footsteps, lol at least i'll try :l</p>
              <p>i wish i was like you SBS261p, i think the teacher plays a very significant role in our absorption of the contents. if they made it fun and engaging, it certainly would make the entire lessons less of a chore and bore. so lucky to have a  teacher like yours!!</p>

              <p>Well you can see the trend regardless. All those who got A for econs study like crazy dogs to get it. As did i. Never did love econs, probably never will. But shows A is not entirely impossible. You just need to work hard and get work your own way out of studying econs. Following the schools standard studying method is not neccessarily the best way for you. Definitely didn't work for me. That's why you see me missing during econs lecture. =)</p>
              <p>Regardless find your own way of studying that works best for you. =)</p>
