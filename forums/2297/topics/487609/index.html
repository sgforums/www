              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I am applying into MI tomorrow and I urgently need help on deciding which H2 and H1 to take. All advice appreciated. Appeal cases you have to decide on the combination- its different if you applied through JAE where you get to choose after the orientation.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Please reply to this post asap! Sorry this is last minute but I need answers within an hour! Latest within 2+ hours!! Thanks a billion!</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">H2:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1) I like the organisational behaviour part of management(and am good at it), but detest the marketing part to the core. I just cant seem to get marketing no matter how hard I try. But I believe if I put in extra extra *^ extra effort I can do well. But then Im afraid i might pull down other subjects if i put in so much effort just for the marketing part of management. Also there are no notes available so i only depended on the syllabus to decide if i will be able to understand the subject. I dont know which book is taught for this subject so I have no idea if i will blank out if i really study the book taught in MI.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2) I really have no affinity for economics and hearing the name:economics already turns me off. Really dont know if i can manage to study something i have no interest in for 3 years. I read the syllabus a little and think i can understand it a little, but i really dislike money/math/marketing. So please tell me if there is marketing in economics. I am also not confident in understanding those graphs studied in maths as well. I have no interest in money and really think that i wont like this subject at all.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">3) I understand nothing about geography and when i searched for notes on h2 geog i was blank in my mind. I took pure lit and elect history so i have no background in geog. All the terms are alien to me. I think i can catch up if i put in effort as well since many people say geog is easy to score but i have my doubts since there are already so many key words in geog that i dont understand. I see myself spending half my time studying for geog flipping through the dictionary which is really tiring too.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">H1:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1) I really dislike amath and got a D7 for my o levels. I will score well if the exact question i memorised comes out. I really dont want to study math, but i heard many people say math is the easiest to score, you just need to mug (wonder if you need the brains as well). But that was when i could choose if i wanted to drop amaths. i think if i had no choice but to study it i might actually do well... i have no idea i have no confidence in maths at all cause my mum keeps saying i suck at maths even when i have proven her wrong during primary school with fantastic math results(but that was emath not amath). I think im quite smart too so who knows maybe i'll actually get it if i try hard enough? But then again, i hope i dont lose balance of the other subjects, if not i'll just get A for H1 Math and flunk the rest with a U grade *touch wood*</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2) I like bio but only got a C6 for o levels, probably cause i didnt put in much effort. I am good at memorizing things, because i have a fantastic memory but i dont know how to use it, so i remember everything other than studies. But I do believe that if i discipline myself i can memorise quite a bit of studies... If I take bio h1 and history h2, is it too much memory work? I'm afraid i cant memorise them all and flunk them all. Is h1 maths a safer option if i want to secure A for all my h1 and h2 subjects?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I will definitely be taking H2 lit and H2 history(unless people can convince me to take geog instead of history which i highly doubt so. oh by the way i suck at history and got a D7 for combined humanities. but i can understand history way more than geog though. and as i said my memory is good if i put in effort...so advice pls...  :)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">PLEASE HELP ME URGENT IN NEED OF HELP THANK YOU VERY MUCH</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">*BOWS IN ADVANCE....* :)))</p>

              <p>On the contary, some students find math hardest to score. It depends on individual ability as I believe no subject is easy without effort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without H1 Math you will be confined to social sciences or arts courses in university. Even subjects such as economics, business you need a H1 Mathematics. If possible I would suggest you take H1 Math.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H1 Bio is alittle useless in my opinion as if you are going to science related courses in biology most likely you will need a H2 biology. However non science courses you don't need H1 biology at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In summary I feel H1 Math is more useful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck</p>
