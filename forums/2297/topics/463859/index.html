              <p>I like science like biology and chemistry and seeing how theories come to life during application such as doing hands on. But seeing how bleak the biotech, R&amp;D research industry is in singapore now...(heard that local bachs grad cant get job in the biotech industry, or have to be reduced to washing test tubes in the labs for the phd researchers), i am seriously contemplating if its worth pursuing passion over salary, job prospects esp since im not from well to do family with money to burn. Hence im deciding to go for the more practical aspect of science like engg since can earn more money and also quite good industry and pay liddat. however math and physics are like impt for engg and i didnt take amath in sec sch and also no physics in upper sec unless u consider lower sec -.-</p>
              <p>so considering np's chemical and biomolecular engg and molecular biotech, which is more suitable for me considering my background leh?</p>

              <p>Can't provide advice for poly, but I'd say to try as hard as possible to get into university after poly, even if it's just for engineering. Once there, find a way to do part of your degree in a good overseas university and/or better yet, do research under a prof who publishes very frequently.</p>
              <p>As for math and physics, you're right that they are extremely important. If you want to be successful in this route, I'm afraid there's no other way than to study those subjects intensely to make up for what you've left behind. </p>

              <p><strong>Limited choices with biotechnology diploma</strong><br> Mon, Nov 19, 2007<br> The Straits Times<br> <br> I REFER to the article, '2 top cancer research groups to set up shop 
              here' (ST, Nov 5). It stated that the arrival of two prominent research 
              institutes was a 'strong validation of Singapore's importance as a 
              research node'.<br> <br> While the presence of these two new research institutes here further 
              cements our role as a regional hub, we should not neglect the local 
              population.<br> <br> This year, the biomedical research industry in Singapore came under fire
               because a large amount of money was invested in this area with little 
              returns in terms of conclusive data.<br> <br> Relate this to the fact that most research scientists here are expatriates on expatriate pay.<br> Wouldn't it be more cost- effective to hire local graduates who can do these jobs?<br> <br> I am aware that one of the most prominent research institutes here does 
              not offer scholarships to polytechnic graduates for further studies and I
               believe this discounts the fact that there are keen minds in 
              polytechnics today.<br> <br> I studied biotechnology at diploma level, under the impression that I 
              would have good prospects in terms of future studies and career 
              advancement.<br> <br> However, the fact is that only the top 10 per cent of polytechnic 
              graduates are accepted by local universities. This leaves the remaining 
              90 per cent of life sciences students with limited choices.<br> <br> These choices include going overseas to pursue a degree in biomedical 
              science (which not everyone can afford), or jumping ship and pursuing a 
              degree that has nothing to do with life sciences. I have, unfortunately,
               opted for the latter.<br> <br> Also, I would like to point out that most polytechnic students have at 
              least four months of industrial experience, due to student internship 
              programmes that are a prerequisite of most diploma courses.<br> <br> In fact, one of my former polytechnic classmates, who is currently 
              studying in a local university, often has to guide his classmates, who 
              graduated from junior college, in the correct use of laboratory 
              equipment as well as safety protocol.<br> <br> <strong>Furthermore, I have noted that even with a good degree, job openings in biomedical research institutes are hard to come by.</strong><br> <br> That said, one question I feel should be addressed is this: Why groom us when there is little intention of hiring us?<br> <br> Denise Mohan (Ms)<br> <br> The Life Science Conundrum<br> After the hype, grads now realise that there’s no place for them in the industry<br> Today, 9 Oct 2006<br> Loh Chee Kong<br> <br> IN 2002, when Singapore universities had barely begun producing their 
              own life sciences graduates, Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Agency for 
              Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), famously rattled those 
              unndergraduates when he said that they would only be qualified to wash 
              test tubes.<br> <br> But four years on, armed with their Bachelor’s degree, some of these 
              graduates are learning the truth of his words the hard way. Many from 
              the first cohort have ended up in junior research positions or 
              manufacturing and sales jobs in the industry - positions that do not 
              require a life sciences degree. Others find themselves completely out of
               the field.<br> <br> Said Edmund Lim, 27, who graduated two years ago, and now works as a property agent: <strong>“One
               of my classmates is working illegally in Australia, peddling 
              psychotropic drugs to clubbers. Many of my classmates have gone into 
              teaching. Others are in pharmaceutical or equipment sales.”</strong><br> <br> Another life sciences graduate, who declined to be named, found a job 
              recently at a tuition centre, after failing to land research-related 
              positions for over a year despite numerous job applications.<br> <br> Already an established base for pharmaceutical manufacturing, Singapore 
              has been trying, in the past five ears, to move beyond manufacturing to 
              more high-end research that is “value-added”.<br> <br> According to the industry’s annual reviews compiled by A*Star and the 
              Economic Development Board’s Biomedical Sciences Group (EDB BMSG), an 
              average of a thousand new jobs were created annually for the past five 
              years. Last year, there were 10,200 manufacturing jobs in the industry, 
              almost doubling the 5,700 jobs created in the then-fledgling sector in 
              2001. By 2015, EDB targets the number of such jobs to hit 15,000.<br> <br> But the booming figures mask a Catch-22 situation: The current shortage 
              of PhD holders in the biomedical sciences cluster is hampering 
              Singapore’s bid to attract multinational companies to move their 
              high-end research projects here. Without a PhD, most of Singapore’s life
               sciences graduates are only qualified to work as research assistants.<br> <br> And both graduates and diploma holders vie for these positions that 
              could pay less than $2,000 a month. In the industry’s manufacturing 
              sector, life sciences graduates compete against their peers from other 
              general sciences and engineering disciplines. They face even stiffer 
              competition in the sales sector, where paper qualifications take on less
               significance.<br> <br> A*Star’s Biomedical Research Council oversees and coordinates public 
              sector biomedical research and development activities. On the surplus of
               life sciences graduates, its executive director Dr Beh Swan Gin told 
              Today: “It is not a situation that can be easily communicated, as there 
              are many factors involved. Simply put, a PhD is essential for progress 
              as a researcher. And there are still not enough Singaporeans pursuing 
              PhD studies.”<br> <br> Adding that the local universities should not pander to the students’ 
              demand for the subject, Dr Beh said: “The job market of today and 
              tomorrow, is the market the universities should focus on. The 
              manufacturing and commercial jobs have always been there, albeit there 
              are more of these now. NUS (National University of Singapore) and NTU 
              (Nanyang Technological University) should get better data on the demand 
              for life science graduates at the Bachelor’s degree level.”<br> <br> In 2001, NUS’ Science Faculty rolled out an integrated life sciences 
              curriculum and NTU started its School of Biological Sciences (SBS) a 
              year later. Meanwhile, the polytechnics also introduced more life 
              sciences courses. Thousands of students jumped on the bandwagon, with 
              demand outstripping the supply of places in these courses.<br> <br> Professor Tan Eng Chye, NUS’ Dean of Science - who believes that it 
              could take another five years for the industry to establish itself - 
              acknowledged that his school’s intake of life sciences undergraduates 
              was “a bit too high”.<br> <br> “When we started offering a major in life sciences in 2001, 550 students
               took up the programme. For the subsequent intakes, the number 
              stabilised at about 450. But we would be more comfortable with about a 
              hundred less,” said Prof Tan, who added that many students were 
              “unrealistic” about their job prospects.<br> <br> Said Prof Tan: “A lot of students were probably all hyped up to look for
               R&amp;D jobs. And when they can’t get such jobs, they could be 
              disappointed. If they want to do research, they should further their 
              studies.”<br> <br> Nonetheless, some headhunters, like Kelly Services’ Lita Nithiyanandan, 
              predict that it is “only a matter of time” before these “highly valued” 
              graduates find willing employers. Said Ms Nithiyanandan: “As most of 
              these multinational life sciences companies have recently set up or 
              moved their R&amp;D centres to Singapore, they require senior and 
              experienced research professionals at this stage to streamline 
              operations and get compounds approved fast for clinical trials. Once 
              these centres are more established they will definitely need fresh 
              graduates for researching new compounds.”<br> <br> She added: “Overall, Singapore’s biomedical scene is evolving as a 
              mature hub for Asia Pacific. This would create opportunities across the 
              board for skill sets through the value chain from fresh graduates to 
              mid-level research and analysts to high-end PhD professionals.”<br> <br> Straits Times Oct 9, 2010<br> Biomed Sector<br> EARLY LOSERS: Dreams that fizzled out in unforgiving industry<br> <br> WHEN a starry-eyed Stephanie Tan enrolled in a local university to do a 
              biomedical science degree seven years ago, she had dreams of a career in
               a cutting-edge industry that seemed at the heart of life itself.<br> <br> Those dreams did not last long outside of the rarefied air of university.<br> <br> <strong>Her
               bachelor's degree landed her a series of jobs selling medical 
              equipment, but after they 'bored her to tears', the 26-year-old quit to 
              sell insurance.</strong><br> <br> Ten years into the biomedical science drive, disillusionment has set in 
              among graduates like Ms Tan. They are also feeling the sting of the 
              words of Mr Philip Yeo, then chairman of the Agency for Science, 
              Technology and Research. He said famously in 2002 that a basic science 
              degree qualified someone to wash test tubes, a remark that caused much 
              debate then.<br> <br> Blunt, certainly, but painfully true eight years on, with experts now 
              openly admitting that to get anywhere in the field, a PhD is a must.<br> <br> Both the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang 
              Technological University (NTU) offer biomedical courses at undergraduate
               level and beyond, and produce a total of about 600 graduates each year.<br> <br> But records show that <strong>only about one in five goes on to do a higher 
              degree or undertake research work. Others end up in fields like 
              education, health and finance.</strong><br> <br> NUS' provost and deputy president (academic affairs), Professor Tan Eng 
              Chye, said a recent survey of life science graduates found that most had
               managed to get jobs.<br> <br> 'This is the same with most graduates from other non-professional 
              degrees. We have many examples of our biology graduates who build on 
              their science training to be successful in other areas of work.'<br> <br> The acting chair at NTU's school of biological sciences, Professor Alex 
              Law, added: 'Even if you have basic training in the sciences, it will 
              serve you well in life.<br> <br> 'Understanding science is not just an academic pursuit, but helps a 
              person understand everyday encounters, ranging from household appliances
               to the debate on stem cells.'<br> <br> But the Government's strong push for biomedical sciences and the lavish 
              funding it has attracted have meant that other fields have lost out in 
              the talent stakes.<br> <br> Professor Peter Ng, head of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research,
               told The Straits Times: 'I believe there was a time when some people 
              felt that only biomedical sciences were important and the rest of 
              biology was obsolete, redundant or irrelevant.<br> <br> 'The baby almost got tossed out with the bath water. No one denies that 
              biomedical sciences are important but we must put things in 
              perspective.'<br> <br> Some scientists were as starry-eyed as Ms Tan about biomedical sciences'
               bright prospects. They came up with promising inventions and tried to 
              turn them into enterprises, but several learnt the hard way that good 
              ideas do not necessarily translate into money-spinners.<br> <br> Researcher Lee Chee Wee, for example, had dreams of new cancer drugs 
              when a decade ago, he discovered a way of altering drug molecules. But 
              funding dried up long before he could take his discoveries to market, 
              and he ended up paying for expenses out of his own pocket, almost 
              becoming bankrupt in the process.<br> <br> Even more experienced players had some hard knocks in an industry famous
               for its failures. United States-based biotech firm ViaCell, for 
              example, exited Singapore in 2007 after funding from the Economic 
              Development Board was pulled due to targets not being met.<br> <br> NUS deputy president (research and technology) Barry Halliwell explained
               that in the early days after being set up, companies are extremely 
              vulnerable. 'Spin-offs need a lot of nurturing. We could improve in 
              making more money available to them,' he said.<br> <br> Dr Ting Choon Meng, a general practitioner who has built up a successful
               medical device company - HealthStats International - based on his own 
              cutting-edge technology, agreed.<br> <br> Inventors and businessmen are two different creatures, he said. 'What we
               lack are not good researchers and inventors. What we are really in need
               of is that special group of people who can take inventions and build a 
              viable and scalable business model around it.<br> <br> 'Right now, we expect the inventor to also be the person to run the 
              company, develop business strategies and have great plans to penetrate 
              markets.'<br> <br> Not only was he hampered by a lack of experience, but also local 
              investors had no faith in him, he added. 'There's still this perception 
              that local is not as good, and that must change.'<br> <br> CHANG AI-LIEN<br> <br> Read more here:<br> <a href="http://forums.sgclub.com/4093298_post7.html">http://forums.sgclub.com/4093298_post7.html</a></p>

              <p>FYI, whether at the poly diploma or Uni degree level, chemical engineering (for example) is :</p>
              <p>33.3% physics<br>33.3% chemistry<br>33.3% mathematics</p>
              <p>Many students think it is mainly chemistry, but chemistry is only 33.3% of the syllabus / curriculum / professional work of a chemical engineer.</p>
              <p>Practicality &gt; Passion. Especially in Singapore where both chronic unemployment and cost of living is ever increasing year on year for Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>But at the same time, unless your physics and mathematics are strong, engineering is a no-no. Many students (both in poly and especially in Uni) drop out of engineering courses halfway, becoz they can't tahan the heavy maths and physics.</p>

              <p>You can't run away from maths and physics in the engineering and sciences. But you can always catch up with enough hardwork. Emphasis on hardwork! It's the degree of learning you put into it. Maths is the tool for science (much more on engineering, physics and chem) while Physics extends into Bio and Chem too. E.g. atomic structure overlaps with Physics. </p>
              <p>If you're choosing between bio and chem, my take is chem offers a lot more flexibility, you can enter biotech, chem, pharma, food science industries and learn on the job (which is what everyone does anyway).  </p>
              <p>But word of caution! Chem after O levels takes it to a whole new level. A level students have chem tutors like UltimaOnline, me and a few other full time tutors to help but poly courses, you need to really be motivated.  </p>
