              <p>there's not really a thread here on how to study, in general. so, I create this thread.</p>
              <p>well, I'm would like to know what you all think.</p>
              <p>I'm a Polytechnic student about to start year two from 20 April 2015, but in this context, it does not really matter if I am in Polytechnic, Junior College, ITE or private school. </p>
              <p>recently did a reflection upon myself. I realise I do not really have a structure in life. As in, I do not really have the discipline to study. Maybe that's why I have not been doing well in my studies since I started secondary school.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of creating a time-table to follow. In this time-table, there's ten hours allocated to sleep and all the provisions for school and if I want, work. The purpose of having this time-table is to ensure that I have time to study.</p>
              <p>basically, my intent is to set aside hours to modules based on credit units. for example, if a module has five credit units, I allocate five hours to study on it every week.</p>
              <p>what do you all think. Is time-tabling a good solution to improve my studies?</p>
              <p>other than that, the other thing that I am thinking of trying is to adjust the kind of food I eat every day. as in, the amount of calories, nutrients, etc. I consume. This is to ensure I have energy to do work.</p>
              <p>I would like to know how do you study. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">If possible, how do you study while work, while still able to achieve good grades? </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Is it through cramming hard on studies in the weeks towards mid-semester tests and end-semester exams, or do you follow time-table or something?</span></p>
              <p>Of course, at this age (19), I know how to grasp concepts and learn. I have been through all that already. but all along, it's usually just mugging and regurgitating at last-minute, especially for Social Studies at Secondary School. but you know la, regurgitate also not always regurgitate 100% or 100% correct de.</p>
              <p>last semester, I ventured out to work. I took on a part-time job and went to take on an extra module (diploma-plus). Nearly destroyed my GPA. as I reviewed, I realise I have not really been spending enough time on my modules. basically, my life was in a mess.</p>
              <p>moving on, I am thinking of following a time-table. whereas for job, I do not want to take on any part-time job already. anyway, I have calculated myself. even if I live on my parents money now, next time go out to work earn around 2/3k a month, within a few years can re-pay already. so, what for work now?</p>
              <p>What is the best way to study?</p>
              <p>What is the best way to achieve good grades, while live a healthy life?</p>
              <p>other than having a time-table to follow and consuming sufficient amount of nutrients, what are some other ways to live a life where I can do well in my studies and stay healthy?</p>
              <p>I'm sorry if my writing is not clear. Literally writing everything I want to say. Nonetheless, I hope you can share with me tips on how to study. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Let this also be a thread for people who have not been doing well in studies to find ways to improve.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Be attentive during lectures, attempt all tutorials, take additional notes expecially what is said but not written down, do corrections, practise past-year exam papers, consult tutors.</p>
              <p>  Work on the core for fitness via the traditional exercises that are really great - chin-ups, sit-ups, planks, running.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> You can also google online or go to library to look for materials/books on enhancing your memory. There are memory techniques that some people have found out. There is a bestseller book by Adam Khoo "I am gifted, so are you."</p>
              <p> You can also google for healthy diets. There are plenty around.</p>

              <p>Well, I have been through almost one week of polytechnic. </p>
              <p>Actually, I think the key is to be street smart. and know how to learn.</p>
              <p>Basically, to be disciplined.</p>
              <p>Apart from that,it's to stay focus on what you want.</p>

              <p>Constant revision is the key. Make notes to help u revise.</p>
              <p>Don't look at solutions, must try to solve for answers yourself, then will find out at which part you get stuck.</p>
              <p>Read through notes daily, do tutorial questions before class, duno one go tutorial class ask.</p>
              <p>Start to do past year paper 3 weeks to 1 month from exam. Don't do them too early or too late, use past year paper to test how well u know the concepts. In poly maybe can use past year paper to spot questions, in uni different. Can only use to test how familiar you are.</p>
              <p>Last time in poly i always last min. Now in uni also last minute <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Timetabling for revisions never ever worked for me. </p>
              <p>What worked: </p>
              <p>(1) All homework must be done. Even if you have no time during the sem to finish all, before your final examinations, all must still be done. <br>(2) If you want to score well, it's not street smart that helps, but exam smart.<br>(3) Get all the past year papers you have to practice before exams. Print them early. Get the materials ready for final exams.<br>(4) When in doubt, always ask questions. You can always ask your lecturers, tutors or even just Google for the answer. <br>(5) Make notes and do corrections on all your mistakes to reduce the probability of making them again.<br>(6) Always be thinking and reflecting on your course materials, not just regurgitate. </p>
              <p>The only serious planning I did was to plan what I wanted to score, right to the detail of planning how much to score for each test that was to be calculated in the final score. I made a record of how much I scored, and calculate according to its weightage of the module's final score. For example, an mid sem exam that has weightage 10%, I score 48/50. I would write it in my notebook that 9.6% has been secured. <br><br>For that particular module mentioned, there were 3 mid sem exams, 10% each, and a final exam of 70%. So out of 30%, I secured above 28%. To score an A, I use the O Level score as a gauge, which is 75%.  This number varies according to the difficulty of the module of course. So to hit 75%, I would need 47% out of the remaining 70%. That means I would need a score of at least 67 marks out of a 100 marks paper. <br><br>And when I do practices on past year papers, this is the target I will aim for. If I fall short, I would think and reflect which other areas I can improve on to bring my score higher, or what "skills" I am missing to solve a particular question. <br><br>I did all these while in uni, and at that time, I was also doing exercises 6 days a week, of which 2 days are swimming, 2 days are 4km jogs and 2 days are for weightlifting. </p>
