              <p>Hello I'm looking for both O and A Level chemistry guidebooks.</p>
              <p>For A level chemistry, I can't seem to find books by CS Toh in popular bookstores. But there seems to be abundant of books by Thomas and Chris. They look the same to me. What's the difference?</p>
              <p>For O level chemistry. Is there any revision books that focus on the mistakes made by students? I can't seem to find such a book at bookstore. I found a website that sell this kind of books, but it is ebook, and I'm not sure whether is it reliable.</p>

              <p><br>Thomas Bond &amp; Chris Hughs are ex-business associates of CS Toh, but they work independently of each other now. Their books are totally different in every way, looks can be deceiving.</p>
              <p>If you can't find CS Toh's books in Popular bookstores, you can either ask Popular to bring them in for you, or you can order them directly from CS Toh (his website link can be found on my website), or from his distributor Peter Soh (his contact details are on CS Toh's website).</p>
              <p>Sean Chua (author of that e-book) used to tutor only 'O' levels, but just a couple of years ago started to enter the 'A' level tuition market. Since that book you mentioned is an 'O' level book, I've no comment about it (since I specialize in 'A' levels).</p>
              <p>You're a tutor yourself, <a href="/users/286792">EiN930</a>?</p>

              <p>Hello. Yup I'm a tutor myself, specializing in O Level chemistry. But I do intend to go into A level chemistry, so I need to familiarize myself with it. I'm actually a chemistry undergraduate in the local Uni. </p>

              <p>I'm looking for such o level revision books so that I hope can help my students improve their grades. I feel tutoring is not just about addressing concepts, but also to help must my students beware of the common mistakes and also how to improve their answering techniques. Just wondering how come no one write such a revision guide.</p>

              <p>As for the "interesting story", buy a couple of CS Toh's books from Peter Soh (CS Toh's distributor). Then when you meetup with him for the transaction, ask him about the history between CS Toh and Thomas/Chris.</p>

              <p><br>If you've passion for teaching, you should definitely give it a shot! (I resigned from MOE for personal, primarily health, reasons, but I always encourage students with a passion for teaching to seriously consider it as a career)</p>
              <p>There are some differences, and some similarities, in teaching in a secondary school versus JC. For some teachers, the differences (in terms of the type of problems the students may have which you'll have to counsel, the depth of academia and intellectual stimulation, etc) are important. For others, the similarities (of making a difference and guiding the lives of young people) outweight the differences.</p>
              <p>Teaching, like any other profession, does have its share of problems and politics. But it offers you an opportunity to reach out to young minds in a way like no other profession.</p>
              <p>MOE teaching versus private tutoring : both have pros and cons. But if you have personal reasons (eg. health needs, financial stability needs, etc) to want to go one way over the other, then so be it. It's still teaching and making a difference, either way.</p>
              <p>Do give MOE teaching (either sec sch or JC) as a full-time profession some consideration, and keep us posted on any developments! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>Sorry I have to dissapoint you but MOE in general will not assign you to teach in a JC as you did not go through A yourself. Even with a bachelor degree in science, honours, majoring in chemistry, you will most likely receive an offer to teach at secondary school.</p>
              <p>In JC, teaching and classroom management are not so difficult (at least I feel in this way), the challenging parts are: 1. teaching project work (which almost all JC1 will be involved); 2. Personal Development lesson(which all civic tutors/personal mentors will be involved). 3. College Development Committee Duties (which almost all teachers will be involved) </p>
