              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>My L1R5 = 11 points, Minus 2 pts for CCA and 2 pts for Higher Chinese = 7 points</p>
              <p>Maths A1, A Maths A2, Physics A2, Chemistry A2</p>
              <p>Can I choose to study Bio H2 in JC? Will the JC allow me to take it if I am willing to do the background preparation and put in extra effort. And if the JC does allow me try Bio H2, do you think it will be difficult for me to do well?</p>
              <p>Anyone knows of students who have done this before?</p>
              <p>I do not want to study Physics in JC. So I am thinking of this combination: Chem H2, Bio H2, Maths H2 and Econs H2 (may be H1)</p>
              <p>Please help. Thanks</p>

              <p>Don't think so, since sciences in JC are usually built upon the foundation of secondary school science.</p>
              <p>You might want to check with the school.</p>
              <p>P.S. Why not take physics in JC since you've already had a foundation for physics? Did you take biology in secondary school? If not, you might not know what to expect..biology is quite tedious.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Certainly. Generally AFAIK, schools don't have any pre-requisites for studying Bio. If you don't like physics then you oughtn't choose it. I've personally known friends who didn't take O level Bio and eventually took H2 Bio and got A.. You need to see if you're the "Bio" or the "physics" kind of person. Some people just can't do physics but can do well with memorising phrases and lots of info. Be forewarned though, the content is heavy (no joke), but to me, it was gratifying as it was very interesting and applicable. Good luck and all the best! ;)</p></div>

              <p>did you take biology at o-level?</p>
              <p>which jc did you apply for? do you think they will allow us to take bio H2 without o-level bio? If they allow me, i will work very hard for it - for all we know we may even beat those who have o-level bio, right?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>You don't need O level Bio knowledge </strong>(A level tests different topics and things as compared to O levels), though of course its better to have studied O level Bio, because topics like enzymes/macromolecules which appears in O &amp; A level Bio are essentially the same; A level just delves a level deeper and before they do that, they will "intro" the topic first, which is O level stuff. There may be times people already understood some fundamental concepts but you don't. It is not a big hindrance though. The hindrance comes in the subject itself - bio is a very content heavy subject.</p></div>

              <p>hi gohby, you are such an encouragement!</p>
              <p>right now, for every one person who tells me to go ahead with Bio H2, there are 9 persons telling me not to do it....</p>
              <p>But i think i am going to be brave and do it if the jc allows me to do it. When i called a particular jc two days ago, and they said i could try it. But if i do not do well in the june common test, then at that time they might advise me to take it at H1 level which is fine with me. I still have my Econs at H2, Chem H2 and Maths H2</p>
              <p>Have you done Bio H2 before? When you say it is content heavy, do you mean the amount of things to study is a lot more than for physics and  chemistry?</p>

              <p>H2 bio is more of memorising and slightly less compared to physics in terms of level of understanding. <strong>slightly less. </strong>a hell lot more memorising of chunks and chunks of text though.</p>

              <p>what you take in jc really depends on ur course of choice in uni. <strong>Do not </strong>condemn yourself to certain options because of certain bad decisions you made in JC.</p>
              <p>For example, to do most engineering courses in uni, you <strong>must have at least 2 sciences(bio or chem + physics at H2 level). </strong>H2 Math is a must in ALL engineering courses.</p>

              <p>Taking only 1 science subject (chem or phy) will allow you entry to the faculty of science only. for physics, you have more options: common engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering.</p>
              <p>Note: NTU allows Science stream students with only O level physics to apply for engineering courses, but these students will have to take a one yr physic bridging module.</p>
              <p><strong>if you are keen to be a dentist or doctor: </strong>though it is not specified that applicants have to study bio, applicants with H2 bio stands a much higher chance than physics students.</p>

              very detailed. H1 is really useless. Lysine. there is no point in studying phy if u HATE it. you can go bio H2, but, but, really really be prepared to put in a lot lot lot time and energy into it in order to survive(so ur other sub will definitely be compromised). If you just SLIGHTLY DONT LIKE physics, I still encourage you to stick to physics.

              <p>hi gohby, you are such an encouragement!</p>
              <p>right now, for every one person who tells me to go ahead with
              Bio H2, there are 9 persons telling me not to do it....</p>
              <p>But i think i am going to be brave and do it if the jc allows me
              to do it. When i called a particular jc two days ago, and they said
              i could try it. But if i do not do well in the june common test,
              then at that time they might advise me to take it at H1 level which
              is fine with me. I still have my Econs at H2, Chem H2 and Maths
              H2</p>
              <p>Have you done Bio H2 before? When you say it is content heavy,
              do you mean the amount of things to study is a lot more than for
              physics and  chemistry?</p>

              <p>Haha <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> 3 years ago I was in the same dilemma as you. Though I took Physics and Biology (pure) in O levels, I feel that I am more adept in answering physics because there are more calculation questions, and personally I found calculation questions easier because I don't need to write (sometimes a lot of) sentences and key words just to secure that mark. However, Bio was more interesting, so I took H2 Bio after 3 months. :P It took me a modicum of courage though, since people predominantly choose Physics over Bio. I didn't regret; in fact, I'm very glad that I took Biology, even though that came at a cost of studying right into the wee hours + frustration right before the exams.</p>
              <p>Actually all A level subjects are content heavy. (You can check the syllabus at SEAB's website) But Bio came across to me as particularly content heavy because there are many chapters, and in each chapter, be prepared to memorise<strong> a lot</strong> of key phrases and sentences. You don't do that for physics, since physics is more on understanding physics concepts. I won't say the content is a lot more as compared to Physics and Chem, since these subjects have a different set of requirements and can't be juxtaposed simply. But for me, I would find Physics easier than Bio. However, that differs amongst people too. Though it's a general consensus that Bio is very rigourous, there're people who are just more Bio-inclined, and therefore, find it easier than physics.</p>
              <p>I hope I had given you a comprehensive picture for you to make a wise choice. Go with your dreams, and don't look back! :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thank you all for your advice. I feel much better after reading all your replies. I have decided to take H2 Biology in JC. I have a feeling if I work hard, I will do better in Biology than in Physics. The most important reason is I am aiming for a career that requires H2 Biology.</p></div>
