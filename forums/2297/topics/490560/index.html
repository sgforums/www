                  Graphite and graphene may both be considered allotropes of carbon, but graphene is also the basic structural element of other carbon allotropes, including graphite (which is composed of layers of graphene stacked together with van der Waals interactions between graphene layers), carbon nanotubes and fullerenes (including Buckminsterfullerene). 
                  <br><br>The melting points of graphite and diamond are very similar, and pressure dependent. It's a common misconception among O level and A level students (and even some school teachers and private tutors) that the melting point of graphite is lower than diamond because less energy is required to overcome the weak van der Waals forces between graphene layers of graphite, compared to the tetrahedral giant covalent lattice structure of diamond. Because just overcoming the weak van der Waals forces allows you to write with a graphite pencil, but not melt it. To fully and properly melt graphite requires breaking the partial double bonds within each graphene layer, which brings us to the next point.
                  <br><br>Graphite is more thermodynamically stable than diamond, because of the partial double bond character for each C-C bond in graphene / graphite. The stronger the bonds (and obviously the partial double C-C bonds in graphene / graphite, are stronger than the C-C single bonds in diamond), the more exothermic the bond formation enthalpy, and hence the more thermodynamically stable (as illustrated by the Gibbs free energy formula).

              Graphene is pure C, no H.<br><br>Diamond and graphite is a giant covalent molecule, which means, depending on the exact size of the piece of diamond or graphite in your hand, there could be millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions of C atoms present. Eg. a piece of diamond which has a mass of 12g has 12/12 = 1 mol = 6.02214086 Ã— 10^23 C atoms present.

                      Ah ok right. Graphane (CH)n, is basically hydrogenated graphene, with each C atom being sp3 hybridized instead of sp2. It can also be thought of as a 2D analog (ie. version) of diamond, but with each C atom bonded to a H atom (alternating above and below the sheet).
                      <br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Graphane.png"><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphane">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphane</a>
                      <br><br>About diamond, basically you're right, different pieces of diamond have different no. of C atoms, which is why there's no such thing as molar mass of diamond. To tell how many moles of C atoms are present in a piece of diamond, we take the sample mass of the diamond, and divide it by the molar mass of C, ie. 12g.
