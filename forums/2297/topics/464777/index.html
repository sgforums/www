              <p>What are the differences? Is it better to take private diploma instead of a local one? I currently qualify for a polytechnic but after hearing that private is much faster and is somewhere equal with a local one, should I go for a private diploma?</p>
              <p>I intend to attend a university in the future.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for clearing my doubts. If there is any required detail, please tell me.</p>

Ask yourself these few questions. <br><br>I am not biased to private dip courses but if you wanna take a diploma, better option is to take it at our local poly.But if lets say the course you want to do either the cut off is too high for you or it is not available,then you might wan consider private dip</p></div>

              <p>Erm... if you're serious on joining the gov sector and climbing up that ladder... it's a local uni through the JC channels. </p>

              <p>Minister! Thats a good goal for a start (shall not drag politics into here).<br><br>I always say, realistic aim, but it doesnt mean that you cannot dream big. What i mean is that set your goals realistically, for example, to become a Minister (typically lah, i just saying)...1st finish A level (or Diploma), get into local Uni, finish your degree (best if you are scholarship holder), good position in government sector, den u climb climb climb, promote promote promote to up up up up upz there position, den get noticed by the governing party, invite you for tea, den general election u go in, win, be MP, Prime Minister appoints a position for you, then u perform, u climb, den tadah!, if you good, then Prime Minister appoints you to be Minister of ___________(fill in the blank)<br><br>to cut my grandmother story short, at every stage of your life, give a deep thought of what is the next step for you, then you make the best decision for yourself</p>

              <p>My apologies, i just edited the A level part. Diploma also can. <br><br>Honestly, if you dunno wad you can do in the future, its time that you sit down and think through. You dont need to come to a conclusion right now but use ur heart to feel and ask yourself what u like? As i said above, for every stage in your life, you need to sit down and give a serious thought, best if you can write down and work it out. Dont think of the end "product" first (for your case, its being a Minister) before you can even reach the next stage.</p>

              <p>Ah you've started thinking about life. </p>
              <p>An alternative method to figuring out what you want to do in the future is to figure out and eliminate what you do NOT want to do in the future. </p>
              <p>Most of the time, this also means you will have to experience some aspects of a job, fact find and extrapolate from there.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some private dips can cut months or years and accelerate the process of going to a uni, eg. SIM ones and Kaplan. But I heard quite expensive and quite intensive. Govt depts usually recognises the polys and JCs and NUS/NTU/SMU and prestigious overseas uni. SIM is a gray area??? as it is only recently announced as the fifth/sixth university.</div>

              <p>Private diplomas mean nothing much to the employers as these diplomas are usually issued by the private schools themselves.</p>
              <p>Need to proceed to the degrees awarded by the foreign universities to mean something to the employers.</p>
              <p>While the local poly diplomas are well recognized by the employers in Singapore and the government.</p>
              <p>Results are actually more important. Employers will still consider the candidate with a private diploma if he or she scored many distinctions as compared to the candidate with a local diploma if he or she needs to take supplementary papers every year and with grades on the borderline.</p>
              <p>There are some local poly diplomas that have no alternative private diplomas eg nursing, marine engineering, aerospace engineering ......</p>
