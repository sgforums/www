              higher maths subject for software engineering such as Calculus, Applicable-Maths, Additional-Maths, Physics and advanced level of maths. Does anyone knows are there any night class school that teach

              <p>Ask your friend to take up night classes at ITE, that is the best choice for him now.</p>
              <p>There are quite a number of people like him over there who has taken a break from studying for a few years and wants to make a comeback.</p>
              <p>It is a good thing that your friend has a target. Tell him to keep it in sight, as it is going to be very tough for him to start from scratch.</p>

              <p>Hi Mugen, </p>
              <p>As stated, the programme is for both working adults and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those out of formal school system</span>, so I believe that your friend should be eligible for it.</p>

              <p>Hi, sorry for bumping this topic again, I have some other questions to ask, my friend ask me that if he sign up for the ite night class maths, how long will he take to finish the maths and can he be able to study higher level maths such as calculus, special level maths etc?</p>
              <p>He told me that he is also interested in studying electrical engineering too, so what skills subjects does he need to study electrical engineering, is it the same as software engineering? but my guess might be either maths or physic, not sure if it is correct</p>

              <p>Hi Mugen,</p>
              <p>I believe it will be more appropriate if your friend sends an e-mail to ITE for exact answers to his questions.</p>
              <p>As a side note, could you kindly post up the link to the course which your friend is planning to take for us to see? </p>

              <p>Hi Mugen's friend,</p>
              <p>I have found some Mathematics courses for engineering, but most of them are post-diploma courses such as these:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQD1NXIzdTEwP_AC8zA09_4-AQwwAzQ3MfU_2CbEdFANkrWEI!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/Lib-SPWS/site-spwebsite/lifelong+learners/part-time+courses/certificate+in+mathematics+for+engineering">http://www.sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQD1NXIzdTEwP_AC8zA09_4-AQwwAzQ3MfU_2CbEdFANkrWEI!/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/Lib-SPWS/site-spwebsite/lifelong+learners/part-time+courses/certificate+in+mathematics+for+engineering</a> </p>
              <p>The next best option will be to seek a good Mathematics tutor to help you out. The types of Mathematics you listed out range from secondary level to degree level, thus I do not think a single course will cover all of them.</p>
