              <p>2 more questions</p>
              <p>A student tried to prepare 2 salts, barium sulphate and sodium nitrate using the method described in the paragraph below</p>
              <p><em>Aqueous barium nitrate was mixed with aqueous sodium sulphate and the precipitate of barium sulphate was obtianed by filtration. The residue was dried in an oven</em></p>
              <p><em>The filtrate was heated until the solution is saturated. Crystals of sodium nitrate was formed when the saturated solution was cooled</em></p>
              <p>i. State one omission in the preparation of barium suplhate.</p>
              <p>Surely not the part on drying in oven?(though it sounds weird) My guess is that he did not find out which was the salt in excess? Well.</p>
              <p>2. Boron is a non-metallic element found in group III of the periodic table. It can be extracted from its oxide B2O3, by heating with powdered Mg in the absence of air. The products are boron and MgO.</p>
              <p>ii After the reaction the boron is obtained from the reaction mixture by the following steps</p>
              <p>i washing with warm dilute HCl acid (<strong>reason: to ensure Mg has been completely reacted and is not found on boron)</strong></p>
              <p>ii washing with a solution of NaOH ( <strong>to neutralise dilute HCl used to wash boron</strong>)</p>
              <p>iii. washing with distilled water (<strong>to remove any remaining impurities found on boron)</strong></p>
              <p>Please help me check if the reasons I gave for the procedures are logical and correct</p>
              <p>Also</p>
              <p>What is the difference between Cl-37 and Cl - 35</p>
              <p>My ans: They are isotopes of chlorine with different number of neutrons.</p>

              <p>Charge of PO4 is 3-<br><br>Regarding why its an acid, maybe talk about how it can behave like an acid which is to dissociate to give H+ ions and not use the word contain.</p>

              <p>Normally we don't dry things in the oven. We will always use a dessicator for drying of compounds since heat can cause the salt to loss its water of crystalisation and thus affect your product obtained.</p>
