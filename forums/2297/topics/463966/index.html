              <p>For those who don't make the cut into regular JCs, but are still more suited to the A levels route rather than the Poly route, there are only 2 choices :<br><br>1) Millenia Institute<br>2) Private Candidacy<br><br>If you're on a tight budget but can afford to spend the time, spend 3 years at MI to get A levels. MI is a "everyone deserves a second chance" godsend for students who fail to make the cut into regular JCs, but are still more suited to the A level route, rather than the poly route (unless you know for sure what you wanna do for a career for the rest of your life, do not go Poly or you may regret it and become a Poly halfway Dropout aka PhD).</p>
              <p>If you're financially well to do and want to save time, get private tuition for all subjects and it's possible to get good results as a private candidate. But private candidates take note : <br><br>1) You'll lack the JC Project Work component which puts you at a slight disadvantage when applying into local Unis, especially the more competitive courses. Some admission offices for some courses, may allow you to be exempted from PW consideration. Contact the NUS, NTU, SMU offices for clarification and confirmation.<br><br>2) You may <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/eservices/iERS/Registration.html">register as a private candidate with MOE</a> if you satisfy the minimum age requirement of 17 years as at 1st January 2013. If you do not meet this age requirement but are in a real hurry to get your A level qualifications, you can alternatively do the International A levels (no age requirement) via the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org.sg/en/ielts-and-exams/school-exams"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #500080;">British Council (choose from either the Cambridge International A Levels, or EdExcel A Levels).</span></span></a><br><br>3) For guys, MINDEF will force you to do NS once you reach 18 years old if you're not in a govt school or govt approved school. These days, MINDEF will no longer grant exemption or deferment from NS easily.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p> <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br>I took up Combine Science and scored A1, I develop a passion for physic in secondary 4/3... So is it possible for me to take up H2 Physic? Well i suck at chemistry in secondary school because all my teacher did was to force us to memorize the tables. Is H2 chemistry just pure memorizing? </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Another concern is that i don’t plan to take up tuition if i enter JC. Is it a must to have tuition? Managed to survive sec 1-4 without tuition because it just don’t work with me... i like to do self-study, on time on target.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H2 Phys is mostly understanding with some memorizing.</p>
              <p>H2 Bio is mostly memorizing with some understanding.</p>
              <p>H2 Chem is 50% understanding, 50% memorizing.</p>
              <p>With only memorizing, you cannot get A for H2 Chem (you used to be able to, until recently when Cambridge started asking beyond syllabus Uni level chem questions to reduce the number of As awarded for H2 Chem, in part because Medicine compulsorily requires H2 Chem, and too many students with straight As apply into too few places for Medicine each year).</p>
              <p>As for tuition, this depends on both :</p>
              <p>1) the individual student : some students do not benefit significantly for tuition generally, while other students benefit tremendously from good tuition.</p>
              <p>2) the individual tuition teacher or tutor : some tuition classes are no different, and hence no better, than attending JC lectures or tutorials. Solo tuition is significantly more expensive, but can also be significantly more beneficial.</p>
              <p>Combining both points above,</p>
              <p>3) different students benefit differently from different tutors, or put in another way, different tutors are suited for different students. Depending on the student's individual learning styles and needs, tutor A may be better for you, while tutor B may be better for your friend.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and do your best without tuition first, and see how well you do for the Mid Year Exams. But a word of caution (to all new JC students reading this).</p>
              <p>Students going from Sec school to JCs, need to be made acutely aware, right from the very start, that A levels are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">much</span></strong> tougher than O levels. It's not just a continuation of O levels where you left off, but a whole new level altogether. And to top it off, you only have half the time (2 years instead of 4 years) to prepare yourself for an exam that is arguably 10x tougher than the O levels.<br><br>The number of J1 students who fail to promote in each cohort of each JC, is unneccessarily high, in large part because most J1 students still think they are in Sec school, and are ill-adjusted and ill-prepared to accept (at all levels, particularly in terms of commitment required) that A levels are 10x tougher than O levels, and required 10x the hard work, right from the very first day they enter a JC.<br><br>For students who barely pass their Promos, they struggle badly to catch up in J2. This is an uphill struggle, already so because of the many subjects each demanding the student's 100% attention and focus, and made all the worse by the endless avalanche of homework tutorials and assignments, not forget the ridiculously time-consuming Project Work, CCAs, etc.<br><br>One final piece of advice to JC students :<br>You'll be chronically sleep deprived, this is guaranteed. But know that it has been scientifically and medically proven that, the worse your magnitude of sleep deprivation, the worse your degree of brain damage (both reversible and irreversible). You'd be shocked how much better every cohort's A level results would be, if JC students were allowed just 2 hours more sleep every day.<br><br>If I were the principal of a government JC, I'd start school for all students and teachers at 10am (earliest!) instead of 7.40am. Unfortunately for JC students, the kiasu trait of Singaporeans (including the government and civil service) won't stand for this.<br><br>Bottomline : be sure you take care of your health and your brain, and manage your personal schedule with discipline to get as much sleep as possible every day. Be streetsmart and judicious in terms of the endless homework tutorials needed to be done, as well as involving yourself in time consuming CCA activities, etc. Not every tutorial for every subject will be marked by your teacher. Sufficient sleep and a healthy brain and body should take priority.<br><br>Lastly, make full use of SgForums HomeWork forum to post your questions (eg. H2 Chem questions), lots of helpful folks (eg. myself, but only for H2 Chem) here on SgForums to help you out with your questions here.<br><br>Have fun in these 2 super short years in JC!</p>

              <p>Hi <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> </p>
              <p>sooooooooooooooooooooooo</p>
              <p>I'm an express student who did terribly for my Os, 27 points, and now I'm stuck with only higher nitec. So now I'm wondering if I should repeat sec4 or just go on to higher nitec for a two year course. My mom suggested to go to higher nitec and take private Os again this year and see if I can qualify for poly courses next year. The problem is, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to quit ITE in the middle of the semester just to switch to poly. And am I allowed to combine the points from both of my certs if I do go through with tthat plan? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for the help!</p>

              <p>I'm choosing between NYJC and MJC, (COP 9 for both) From past year forums, I read that NYJC is quite popular choice amongst students, and I'm afraid that I won't be able to enter NYJC as I barely touch their COP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>NYJC:</p>
              <p>- easier to go <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>- starts school at 8:30</p>
              <p>MJC</p>
              <p>- must change bus and all~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>- Less popular than NYJC</p>
              <p>- high retainment rate (50% I read ?)</p>
              <p>So.. which jc should I put as my first choice? </p>

              <p>Also, I would like to ask about the subjects. </p>
              <p>I took core geog for O level's and got an A2 for it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>And I'm thinking of taking PCME with Econs at H1 level, however, my brother said that I should continue taking geography as I have already studied it before. I would like to know whether geography is harder at A level's, and which is more relevant to me in University. I wouldn't mind taking something science related or business related.. </p>
              <p>Is econs one of the prerequisites for studying business in University, or do I just need to excel in my H2 math?</p>

              <p>I'm an express student who did terribly for my Os, 27 points, and now I'm stuck with only higher nitec. So now I'm wondering if I should repeat sec4 or just go on to higher nitec for a two year course. My mom suggested to go to higher nitec and take private Os again this year and see if I can qualify for poly courses next year. The problem is, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to quit ITE in the middle of the semester just to switch to poly. And am I allowed to combine the points from both of my certs if I do go through with tthat plan? </p>

              <p>Hey there.</p>
              <p>I probably have a different account of the O-Levels compared to many, but I have some questions I probably need answered.</p>
              <p>The school I am in now offers an Integrated Programme curriculum, which would fast-track me to Junior College education. The only drawback is that you have to pass the O-Levels for Higher Chinese in order to not take Higher Chinese in JC.</p>
              <p>So yeah, I failed Higher Chinese O's, and I was wondering if I private-candidate O-Level Higher Chinese this year (and pass), would the JC I am in accept this qualification?</p>
              <p>Also, I was told that a minimum of a passing grade in Higher Chinese O-Levels is mandatory for study in local universities. Is that true?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
