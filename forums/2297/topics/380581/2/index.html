              <p>My entire school flipped the paper over to the SEQ portion when
              they said "your time begins now," and a collective gasp echoed
              throughout the auditorium.</p>
              <p>I expect 21/25 for SBQ section, and 5/25 for SEQ question.</p>
              <p>Did the bonding question, because out of all the three topics of
              which I studied none, bonding seemed like the one that you could
              bullshit your way through with general knowledge and common
              sense.</p>
              <p>I await SBS N SMRT's sentiments on this.</p>
              <p>Though I was not surprised Venice didn't appear as an SEQ
              question, I WAS surprised that Globalisation came out in place of
              Healthcare/Population. Globalisation came out for 2008 and 2009 N'
              Levels, and now it has come out for 2009 O' Levels.</p>
              <p>On the bright side, the ones taking their O' Levels next year
              know that Venice is 99.9% coming out.</p>

The people in my school, even thought thinking that venice would come out, never bothered to learn it.

              <p>My take:</p>
              <p>It was quite managable. I believe i could strike a good score because i managed to attempt all 4 SBCS questions (with purpose except for 1d) and attempted the Globalisation question. I just write my essays as if i was presenting a documentary on TV. You may find it weird why my writing style is different. I can tell you that you might find that my favourite show is a documentary/factual programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, most of my classmates could not believe that Venice didn't come out. I was taken aback but as i mentioned earlier, i found the Globalisation question easiest to do. I did consider the transnational terrorism but rejected it because i have inadequate knowledge to answer part a).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck for the History component and the Design And Technology Papers tomorrow (or rather today).</p>
