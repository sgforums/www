              <p>It's good that you are seeking help early. If you put in constant hard work throughout the year, you should be able to achieve good results.</p>
              <p>Pinpoint out what you're good and bad at. Put less effort into the subjects you are good at and more effort into subjects you are bad at. Tell us if you are not doing so good in any other subject.</p>
              <p>Stay in a library and practise everyday. Do not be near anything that distracts. Find some mugging friends to help motivate you to persevere. If they talk too frequently for you to concentrate, or if you feel that their questions about academics are too easy for you, leave or find another group of friends. Arrange for consultation sessions with your teachers early in the year, as they will be too busy with other consultation requests later in the year.</p>

              <p>It's possible,Just finished my O levels and scored &lt;12 for my L1R4.(with cut-off) motivation&gt;research and record your target poly course on a handbook so that you can always remind yourself of where you want to get to.( aim for L1R4 of 10 with cut-off so that you are able to reach your target.) Study with a group of highly motivated classmates/schoolmates after school,in school/library.  Study tips&gt;follow ZhengK's advise,being in a library will indirectly force you to not use your phone.  <span style="color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Have a note book to record your doubts to clarify later.

Recount?Expository?Narrative?Argumentative? compre&gt;use pockets of free time wisely to practise compre(TYS).(before class starts,tutorials) Pass your compre to your english teacher for him/her to evaluate your mistakes.Learn from your mistakes. Inference can be nutured through practise,while vocab can only be done through consistent reading(but if you don't like to read,you should pay close attention to the vocab words that your teacher is going through and memorise it.) Oral&gt;practise this preferrably,after the june holidays.</p>

              <p>Help in Social studies&gt;essay&gt;be exposed to more questions.(ask your teacher for a question,do it and let her evaluate.)You will be able to understand how to link to the question with enough exposure. Memorising elaboration and examples will help a lot. SBQ&gt;Do the same as how you practise compre and always let your teacher evaluate.</p>
              <p>did badly for my MT,sorry can't guide you with that.</p>
              <p>I suppose your Science and Mathematics should be fine.Right now,divide more attention into  specific 2 subjects that you will hope to improve during this term(not neglecting the other subjects too.)The 2 subjects will  be likely to improve. Continue this method in the second term(march-june) on (subject importance&gt;what you feel you want to improve)</p>
              <p>Countering distractions&gt;I suggest you go to a library as mentioned earlier to study.That does not mean you can't use your phone.Take 5-minute breaks after 45-minute study sessions to check your phone and etc.Don't procrastinate and get back to work.Mind over matter. Each time you want to use your phone,ask yourself whether it is worth it. Friends that are influencing you to have fun&gt;now isn't the time,ignore those friends or tell them nicely that you are busy preparing for O's(the latter is better as it encourages those friends who are not as hardworking to realise the importance of studying.Peer pressure hehe.) </p>

              <p>Second part(destress)</p>
              <p>Why destress?</p>
              <p>The academic workload gets tougher as time passes.Even,a mugger like me,who enjoys studying may feel the strain of studying.It is important to balance your study/rest/friends/family time.Don't let yourself get too caught up studying especially during O levels and prelims.</p>
              <p>Other forms of Destressing other than the phone and computer</p>
              <p>Alright,you can play sports such as basketball,soccer with your friends after school,then go back to studying or vice versa.However, don't play too long and lose track of time,have a watch just in case. </p>
              <p>Talk to your family members about your problems,maybe they can console you or guide you.Talking to friends may also help.</p>
              <p>Take a short power nap(I usually lie down on the table instead of the bed to do this,so as to not over-nap)</p>
              <p>Misconceptions(I will continue to add further)</p>
              <p>Many may say that completing TYS  for O levels is enough. That's not true.You must be exposed to questions from the prelim/MYE papers of the top-notch sec schools such as Catholic High,Fairfield Methodist,Nan Hua High.These schools have groomed their students to score 6A's and above repeatedly for the O' levels. Try to get the papers from your teachers,if that doesn't work,ask your friends. </p>
