              <p>Hey , </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am just student who just finished my O level's and I am still struggling to decided whether to choose JC or poly. </p>
              <p>After i went for an engineering headstart camp , I am quite interested into aerospace technology but considering that it is only a headstart liking , I am worried that in the future I may lost interest into this area as I grow up. However, considering that going poly I am able to be prepared more for CAAS, is another reason I am considering for poly. </p>
              <p>While many of my friends say that with my better results , I should go to JC as I may have a change in my thinking in the future and with JC, I have more doors open up for me when I reached uni.</p>
              <p>So, which path should I really take ? And, is there any difference between the paths I take ? Do help me :-) </p>

              <p>Aerospace technology is a very exciting and competitive field, I believe, but the thing is that if your results are that good, you will probably be aiming to get into university in future, and it is very hard to get into NTU's Aerospace Engineering course if you have a poly background.</p>
              <p>Hence, I recommend that you go to JC first. If your results are good enough, you can get into NTU's Aerospace Engineering course, or any other engineering course you may be interested in in future.</p>

              <p>The 10th percentile cut off point for NTU aerospace engineering for JC students are AAA for 3 H2 subjects and B for H1 subject, C for project work and C for GP.</p>
              <p>While the cut off point for <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">NTU aerospace engineering for poly students is not available and the reason given by NTU is that the sample size is too small.</span></p>
              <p>Basically, this means that there is very, very few poly aerospace engineering students are admitted into the NTU aerospace engineering programme. While there are comparatively more JC students are admitted into the NTU aerospace engineering programme. There is the 10th percentile and 90th percentile cut off point for JC students for NTU aerospace engineering programme.</p>

              <p>What you learn in poly will lay the foundation for your course in University.</p>
              <p>If you are really interested, you will get to Aerospace Engineering through whichever route.</p>
              <p>If you are not sure about which route to take, then you better take the JC route as you may change your mind later.</p>

              <p>By right, what you just said is true and is applicable to most other courses. But for NTU's Aerospace Engineering, it is very competitive and based on the statistics identified by Lee, it seems more viable to go to JC if the intention is indeed to get into this course in future.</p>
              <p>Something else that Beep may want to think about. In the case that you fail to get into NTU's Aerospace Engineering in future regardless whether you chose to go to JC or poly (choy!), would you rather be armed with a Aerospace Technology Diploma, or armed with an A level cert which will qualify you for some other university course besides Aerospace Engineering? You might want to do a research on what kind of jobs a Aerospace Technology Diploma can get you, the kind of pay you can get, the promotion prospects, and the job scope.</p>
