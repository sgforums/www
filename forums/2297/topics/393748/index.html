              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I got a question. Let's say a person is currently studying in ABC Junior College, not exactly prestigious, and in fact one of the less-than-academically-inclined Junior Colleges in terms of ranking.</p>
              <p>What happens if that person does EXTREMELY well in his promotional examinations, such as straight A's and everything. If that person wishes to appeal out from ABC Junior College to a more prestigious Junior College for his 2nd year of JC education, is that possible?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Personally I would strongly advise against that. The pace of lesson in these "prestigious" JCs may not be suitable for you and the students of these "prestigious" JC may not provide the best learning enviroment for you. ;)</p>
              <p>If a particular students have obtained straight As. I would advise him to take up a H3 subject (You would probably have to travel to one of the prestigious JCs).</p>

              <p>Anything is possible, and it is up to the 'elite' JC's principal to decide if he/she is willing to admit you in. In other words, case-by-case interview basis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But one valid concern the new principal and HODs will have, is that your previous JC would have covered different topics for all subjects. Eg. for Chem, some JCs complete OC (Org Chem) in J1, while other JCs start OC only in J2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But apart from that, there is also the dubious issue of 'loyalty' and 'elitism'. Both JCs (previous and new) might frown upon you for wanting to switch JCs just to get yourself a nicer, more 'elite' JC brand name on your certs. It's like you're not loyal to your company, you scream "every man for himself!" and jump ship at the earliest opportunity. Both old and new bosses (and the industry in general) might frown upon your behaviour. (it's similar to, if a girl can betray her current bf behind his back to have be with u, she can also do the same with u once she's ur gf).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You're probably doing this thinking it can help you get into an elite Uni course, eg. Medicine. In fact, your interviewer for your elite Uni course might also frown upon your behaviour, meaning your plan in effect backfired.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And really, it doesn't matter which JC you're from (eg. RJC, MI, private candidate), it's the quality of the 'A' level cert that matters. If you're the boss, would you discriminate against an employee from a 'lousy' JC, or poly, or ITE? There is no right or wrong answer, simply a matter of ethics. Do unto others as you would like others to do unto you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, if you're sure that's what you want, go ahead and request for interviews with the principals of 'elite' JCs, after you obtain your stellar Promo results. You may or may not succeed.</p>

              <p>  One may be a big fish in a small pond, but become a small fish in a bigger pond.</p>
