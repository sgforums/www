              <p>I think this is going to be highly controversial but i wanna share my opinion. I have seen a lot of school dropouts. Quite a number of them have these characteristics. They are usually the gangsters you see loitering around in shopping centers, being rowdy at night at the void deck area, having unprotected sex with other ah lian leading to unwanted pregnancy, smoking and having tatoos all over body,acting as loanshark runners, involving in gang fights etc.</p>
              <p>These people are a nuisance to the society in my opinion. Is it possible for them to contribute to this country in any manner? What is worse is that they might have too much free time and in the end they might spend those free time on having sex  leading to unwanted pregnancies. What's gonna to happen to these children? Some might opt for abortion. Others might gave birth to the child and later decides to abandon the child. A large proportion of them might not have the financial ability to bring up their child and yet they continued to have sex and give birth to more children. Who's gonna to pay for the raising of these kids? It's the taxpayers because these will be the people who will most likely ask for financial assistance.. Responsible citizens would have to pay for the irresponsible behaviors of these people. Isn't this unfair? I believe that there's a high chance the kids would turn out to be like their parents(due to the fact that the parents have more kids and lack of moral values in the parents leading to poor upbringings).. bringing further social problem.. In essence, it is an evil cycle.  </p>
              <p>Wat can we do to solve these problems? Maybe import more FTs so that more people can pay tax to support these leeches? I got some other ideas but I think it's too highly controversial to be spelt out in public.. People might thought that I am a supporter of Hitler...</p>
