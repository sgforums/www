            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hello! I'm currently in a dilemma. Should i go for H2 Eoncs or H2 geography? I'm going to take H2 Physics, Maths and Chem. What's the differene between these two subjects? I've taken geog ( elec ) at sec school and am able to do quite well. However, looking through the A level syllabus, I noticed that there's much more things for geog than econs. Can somebody please advise me. Thanks in advance ! (:</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi(: I had a hard time choosing btw those two too but now I think I'll choose econs, cos after going for the h2 geo briefing in my sch ytd, I learnt that there're a lot to memorize for geo. And econs will help in your future cos after learning it you'll look at things in different perspective. Not sure how though that's what my teacher said. And according to my friend, geo doesnt have much use, unless you want to be a geo teacher next time or take up some geog related jobs. But not sure how true that is. I'd considered taking geo cos I took pure geo in olevels and I thought it'll be safer to continue with geo. And since econs is a new subj for me, I dont have much confidence that I'll do well in it. Hopefully i'll make the right choice &gt;&lt;</p></div>

              <p>H2 economics are taught with little Maths because the intent of the syllabus is to emphasize on concepts that are applicable to the current economics issues.</p>
              <p>Maths especially calculus are used in university economics because it is easier to analyse the effects of a change of the variables on a given economic situation especially the use of partial differentiation to analyse the effects of a change of a variable with other variables remain constant.</p>
              <p>With the use of maths in university economics, students can formulate their own economic model eg the AS-AD model can be easily modified with a different assumption and the effects can be easily analysed.</p>

              <p>The unfortunate consequence of such an approach is that students are not exposed to the real quantitative nature of the field. One cannot just pass an essay off as 'analysis' without statistical testing of relevant data. Nobody, at least at the professional level, would believe it. Yet many students, I suspect, graduate from their A levels thinking that writing hand-wavy essays is what economics is all about. Imagine the shock they would get when they are made to do regression after regression when they start university.</p>
