              <p>A list of MOE recognized Universities available within Singapore :</p>

              <p>Bookmark/Add-to-Favourites the above webpage url, which includes website url hyperlinks to every single University on the MOE-approved list. You'll need to peruse the individual University websites to further information on entry requirements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You (all graduating 'A' and 'O' level students) should be aware, that competition today for University entry, is tougher than ever before in the history of Singapore. And this is already including consideration of the increasing number of new Universities available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While entry requirements naturally differ across courses, the average grade entry requirement for most local University (eg. NUS, NTU, SMU) courses is approximately an 'A', 'B', 'B', where a few years ago, a 'B', 'C', 'C' would have sufficed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For entry into the most popular courses, even all A's will not be enough. This is due to some insanely intense competition with the top 'A' level students in the entire world, most of which (these top students) come from top Singapore JCs (this is a recognized fact by Ivy Leage Universities in the world). Some JCs such as RJC and HCJC offer (or are planning to offer) diplomas in addition to the 'A' level certificate (for which most of their students will get a perfect 'A' level certificate of straight As), and many top students boast International Baccalaureate instead of, or (more insanely) in addition to, a perfect 'A' level certificate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be a student of today's Singapore, is not an enviable position indeed.</p>

              <p>Lol ultima, how is it possible for one to get an International Baccalaureate and A level cert? Why would anyone do both programmes?</p>
              <p>Well yes I know you need top grades to enter, I was asking more on the cca record side, can you give an example of what level of achievement is required for entry and/ or scholarship?</p>
              <p>Only most such details on the net are rather vague.</p>

              <p>On university side, you need to have an idea on which faculty you are aiming for; different faculties have different entry requirements.</p>
              <p>And if you are a guy, you can still take your time to think. I switched from NTU to NUS during my first year of army.</p>

              <p><br>In terms of constraints set by the institutions, and the extensive time required for either program, it's true that it's neither feasible nor permissible to undertake both at the same time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, because there's a significant intersection of syllabus content, and the similar level of rigour and difficulty, in theory, a student capable of obtaining a high scoring 'Advanced' Level Certificate would be capable of performing very well on the International Baccalaureate Diploma, and vice-versa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if somewhere, somehow, someone manages to obtain both certificates (either simultaneously, consecutively, or semi-simulconsecutively), he/she would be at an advantage for University entrance... however, this very idea belies the ludicrous extent of paper chase pseudo-meritocracy that today's society is hopelessly mired in, with countless hapless victims of the merciless Sg education system callously flung aside every year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But like every man, you have a responsibility to your family (including future wife &amp; kids) to provide food on the table, so cheong your upcoming 'A' levels and 'O' levels to the best of your ability, and All the Best to everyone! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
