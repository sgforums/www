              <p>Hey everyone. Finished my A levels last year and I didn't do any good. </p>
              <p>My results are:</p>
              <p>H2 subjects:</p>
              <p>Mathematics:C</p>
              <p>Economics: E</p>
              <p>Chemistry: C</p>
              <p>H1 subjects:</p>
              <p>Eng Lit: C</p>
              <p>Gp: D</p>
              <p>Pw: A</p>
              <p>MT: D</p>
              <p>I guess what I'm really trying to say here is A's was tough and that it left me crying in one corner of the room so therefore I DO NOT want to retake A levels if it means that I'll become a sobbing mess all over again.</p>
              <p>Ive also been rejected by NUS NTU and SMU and now it's nearing June and I still have not gotten any reply from SIM UOL Accounting and Finance. My parents want me to go to local universities only and I'm sure they have doubts in supporting if I were to choose SIM if I do get a seating there. </p>
              <p>Does anyone here have any advice for me? I was thinking of either taking up SIM or working for 3 years and keep applying for local universities till I get accepted by one (this includes me appealing for all 3 again and again) or shld I just apply for a diploma at a local polytechnic for this next batch of applicants? The latter would mean that I'd get a second/better chance at entering a local university especially if I were to work doubly hard. </p>
              <p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this too. </p>

              <p>If the polytechnic diploma thing has been done before by quite a few other students in your situation, and it has worked for them -- meaning they worked doubly hard and eventually got into a local U -- then I would go for that. ("Believable plan.")</p>
              <p>The idea of appealing again and again to the local U's is not a believable plan, sad to say. The local U's don't work that way. They are quite hard-nosed about accepting applicants cos they are oversubscribed multiple times.</p>
              <p>Make a "believable" plan. And then go for it! Wish you well.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #5d5ebc;">Jandme4</span>, you've already stated your stand clearly that you don't wanna retake A levels, so I've no wish to persuade you further on this.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless and regardless, my ethical conscience compels me to speak out for the case of private candidacy over local JCs for A levels.</p>
              <p>Annoying issue of PW aside (which as ChemGuide mentioned, may be easily replaced by another H1 subject; though this may differ from Uni faculty to Uni faculty, you should personally check with the relevant admissions office), private candidacy for 'A' level candidates (particularly retake candidates) can be superior to retaking in a JC.</p>
              <p>Granted it helps if you've the $$$ for private tuition, but even if you do not, self-study as a private candidate could (this depends on your own self-motivation and self-discipline) be healthier than self-study in a JC.</p>
              <p>I find the JC system hugely inefficient and a huge waste of time. The majority of students don't listen at all during lectures, and half-heartedly engage in tutorials.</p>
              <p>In addition to the damaging stresses of endless assignments, tutorials and exams, there's the perpetual lack of sleep for Singapore students (everyone needs 8 hours of sleep daily, JC students average 5 hours of sleep daily), which is a death sentence by diabetes, heat diseases, high blood pressure, and chronic headaches. Not to mention it lowers your IQ and examination performance.</p>
              <p>A word of practical caution : unless your (personal or family) finances are strong, you may have to work (preferably part time over full time) to pay for your expenses, including private tuition; as many parents regard retaking as a waste of one year and may be unwilling to continue giving the same amount of pocket money as previously.</p>
              <p>But even if you need to work, for your own sake, be sure you get sufficient sleep. Otherwise, it's no better off than being in a JC, and being tortured by lack of sleep.</p>
              <p>'A' levels is simplified preparation for University. As such, the 'A' level papers themselves are fairly easily to self-prepare as a private candidate (again, preferably with the guidance of tuition). Some anti-tuition pple say, "if you engage tuition, it means you're a mindless zombie just memorizing what your tutor tells you to memorize; it's bad preparation for Uni where you have to be wholly self-sufficient."</p>
              <p>Such anti-tuition pple are misled : perhaps their accusations are valid for inferior tuition services, but not for the work of superior tuition services, which guide you to think more deeply for yourself, which can be replicated (even for those without the financial means for tuition) by self-motivation and self-discipline, eg. by the use of discussion groups and forums online and resources online (dozens and hundreds of reliable websites online for any A level subject).</p>
              <p>Lastly, one important bonus as a private candidate : you're not bound by the silly contrasting subject requirement. I've always felt that science students should have the freedom of option to take Triple H2 Science, instead of being forced to study some silly contrasting subject you've no interest in. As a private candidate, you're now able to do so.</p>

              <p>Dear Jandme4, I do understand your situation. You should not reapply for the universities again and again, you're trying for an accountancy course aren't you? Those are very competitive and they won't become less competitive as time goes by. I don't advise you to apply for a course that you aren't interested in just because you can get in ie. European studies. </p>
              <p>I was in a similar situation in 2008. I got into NTU, HSS. I just graduated and I still don't know what to do with my degree. I'm also looking to retake my A levels so I can apply for a course I'm interested in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are two things you can do. You can either retake your A levels (please go back to your JC to do this, if they won't take you back, see if your teachers will help you out in private). You may want to do a different set of subjects, figure out what your weaknesses are. Why did you not do well for your A levels? Do you need to change your study habits? Are you an internet addict? Do you need psychological help (ie. you can't focus, your time management skills are non existent, see a psych to work it out). </p>
              <p>Or you can go to polytechnic, just apply with your O level results. I think this option is better, and you will have to be much more disciplined. </p>

              <p>Hello thank you so much for the reply! I second your opinions on the JC systems as my problems either arose or worsened due to the stress JC exerts on students (sleep disorder, headaches, etc.).</p>
              <p>Your reply is really good news to me as I'm currently considering the idea of taking 'A's as a private candidate but am feeling rather guilty for wanting to do so.</p>
              <p>I am a J2 student but I can't seem to continue due to several health problems and depression. I tried to move on but now I realise, within JC my problems only get worse, even though my teachers are understanding and helpful.</p>
              <p>After CT1 I gave myself 3 months to improve my grades. I have sought help from the school counsellor, teachers, doctors and psychologist but my problems continued and CT2 was a bigger disaster than CT1. My explanation for this is that every time my condition got a lil better, I went to deal with the undone work I'd been left with, then I realise my work have accumulated (in fact more like multiplied) even more, because time awaits for no one and that JCs are hasty in finishing the syllabus. The pile up was so scary that I have completely no joy in catching up with the school's progress. It destroys my effort in being happy and healthy and I'm trapped in this vicious cycle unless I'm out of JC.</p>
              <p>I've a few problems if you don't mind answering them...</p>
              <p>1) In fact I don't even want to take 'A's this year... I'm hoping to drop out so that I can start proper therapy earlier (if possible). Also, I don't see the point of taking 'A's ill-prepared.</p>
              <p>I've already taken SPA exams but if I choose to withdraw from the 'A's now will I receive the grades of the SPA component next year?</p>
              <p>If not I'll have to sit for science subjects with practical papers as a private candidate, which I've completely no idea how to prepare... </p>
              <p>2) Will private candidates of 'A' Levels be disadvantaged in any way in admission to local universities?</p>
              <p>3) I know NUS accepts PW result from a separate sitting... It'll be great if you can provide information on NTU and SUTD&gt;&lt;.</p>
              <p>4) Private candidates may not have T3A records (Top 3 Achievements). If I'm fully recovered, I guess I can do some thing... Actually outside JC I've more freedom to do what I want, be it overseas project or long-time service, unlike some JC students who do CIP for the sake of doing...</p>
              <p>My question is, I already don't have T3A.. if I didn't manage to do much of those things... how bad would it affect my uni admission?</p>
              <p>5) When you said "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">I've always felt that science students should have the freedom...

              <p>Totally nothing to feel guilty about. In fact, you should feel good about it. As a private candidate, you can finally get enough sleep and feel healthy and good.</p>
              <p>1. No, you can't use your SPA results in such a case. You have to sit for the practical exam. There's no need to prepare much for the practical paper. You can download the UK A level practical papers to have a look through them. Link to Cambridge website is given on my website (google "BedokFunland JC" ).</p>
              <p>2 &amp; 3. No significant disadvantage, unless you're applying into an elite course (eg. Medicine or Law). I'm not sure about the PW issue, you should contact the NUS / NTU / SMU / SUTD Admins Office to confirm. Regardless of PW, bottomline is : as long as you get excellent grades (as a private candidate), you most certainly stand a better chance of entering the course of your choice, over a JC student with average grades.</p>
              <p>4. Again, it depends on which Uni course you're applying for. For an elite course (eg. Medicine or Law), every little bit counts. For all other courses, bottomline is your A level subject grades. Don't worry about anything else.</p>
              <p>5. The "12 units" thingie and UAS computation is really for Uni admission, rather than A levels per se. Meaning, as a private candidate, you have the freedom to take any number and type of subjects without restriction. But if you're applying into a local Uni (eg. NUS, NTU, SUTD, etc), then you have to adhere to the UAS requirements. The Universities may have the discretion to consider special subject combinations (eg. such as one without a contrasting subject) as long as all your grades are excellent. But again, you should contact and confirm this with the Admins Office of the University of your interest (which may differ from Uni to Uni, even amongst the local Unis).</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Sorry I can't be of more precise help, you still need to, should, and must contact the Admins Offices of the local Universities yourself to confirm details. Regardless of official info released by MOE, policies may and will differ between Unis, as well as change from year to year.</p>
              <p>All the best for your private candidacy (next year?), and feel free to post any H2 Chem queries here, should you require assistance for them in your A level preparation.</p>
