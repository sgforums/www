              <p>1)that weighing machine thing is crap.</p>
              <p>he earns one dolar from each thing he sell. thus u only calculate from those he sold.. thus answer is 2<br><br>2) the waiter did not rob them. the author is just playing with words. 9x3 = 27.</p>
              <p> out of the 27 ( 25 dolars is for hte meal, 2 is for the waiter) the other 3 dolars is the money they get back.</p>
              <p><br>the author is playing with words and using a mathematical eqn</p>
              <p>the correct example is actually 27 + 3 dolars they got back. insteaed of adding the 2 dolars the waitor got which is actually in the 27 dolars already..<br><br>3) i have to agree with u.. i am not sure as i calculated the probability to be 50 percent as well<br><br>4) i would swap as i bet i made the wrong choice increasing my probability by alot.</p>
              <p>5) i would choose lucy as well =)</p>

                                          for $10, and sold it for $11. How much profit did he make?</p>
              <p>This is interesting <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Cost=$8, sold=$9, profit=$1</p>
              <p>Buy again cost=$10, cost + initial profit $1= $9 cost</p>

              <p>I've updated my original post as follows :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Updated/Edited :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I initially thought of 'marking' the replies here and scoring them, all of them one-by-one; but as it turns out (and you can see this for yourself), the way the replies are posted, (eg. "solution already posted in riddles forum", instead of a proper explanation in your own words), it makes properly marking and scoring the replies quite difficult, if not impossible. Besides, I can tell you guys are having more fun discussing the riddles with each other, rather than just having your replies marked, and obtaining a score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to this end, I'll not 'mark' or score you guys, but instead, leave you to continue discussing and debating these rather brilliant riddles. Rest assured, these are not 'nonsense' riddles without answers; everyone of these 5 riddles are valid exercises in logic, IQ, mathematics and intuition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Continue having fun! <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if any of you are curious about your score and would still like me to score you, edit *one* your posts and *ASK* specifically to be scored (eg. "Please tell me my score based on this post"). This is required because some of you post all over the place, bits and pieces of answers in different posts, making it difficult to mark and score your post.</p>

              <p><br>Quite the contrary, if you can recognize the intelligence in the question. The person who authored this classic riddle is skilled in the art of misdirection. Somewhat akin to Chris Angel and David Blaine.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's some wisdom I share with my students :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>~~~ When someone says something nice about you, it doesn't mean you're nice, it means they're nice.</p>
              <p>When someone says something nasty about you, it doesn't mean you're nasty, it means they're nasty. ~~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I advise my students not to use disrespectful terms like "lame", or "dumb", or "spastic", because such terms are insensitive and disrespectful to people with walking disabilities, vocal/communication disabilities, intellectual disabilities, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just sharing. (You certainly don't have to agree with what I, or anyone else says.)</p>
