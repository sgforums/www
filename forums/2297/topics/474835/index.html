              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Phew! It's finally over.</strong></p>
              <p>And Kiss92 DJ Arnold Gay chose an unusual way to mark the end of the PSLE season - helping his son to light a bonfire with his school assessment sheets.</p>
              <p>   The 46-year-old also invited his son's friends and his friend's children to throw piles of worksheets into the fire in an incense-burning drum.</p>
              <p>   He said it started off as a light-hearted comment when his primary 6 son was having a stressful time coping with schoolwork.</p>
              <p>   "I told my son half-joking that I'll prepare a bonfire for him to burn everything once his PSLE is over.</p>
              <p>   "I thought he would have forgotten about it but he didn't, so I kept my promise," he said.</p>
              <p>   Mr Gay bought the drum for $5 to prepare for the bonfire on a driveway outside his house in Katong last Saturday.</p>
              <p>   His 12-year-old son asked a few of his close friends from school to join him, while Mr Gay got some of his friends to bring their children to take part.</p>
              <p>   In total, 20 children joined in.</p>
              <p>   "It was symbolic for the kids as they released their pent-up frustrations from preparing for their exams. We could see from the happy looks on their faces that they really appreciated it," he said.</p>
              <p>   Mr Gay's friend, Mr Adrian Lee, whose two daughters took part in the bonfire, felt it was a good idea.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The 46-year-old managing director said: "It's a stress-reliever for the kids as they have had a tough time preparing for their PSLE. It signifies a new beginning."</p>
              <p>   Mr Gay's way of celebrating the end of the exams drew mixed reactions from netizens who left comments on the Kiss92 Facebook page after a photo of the bonfire was posted there.</p>
              <p>   Some agreed it was a good way to de-stress, while others felt it was not an enviromentally-friendly method of getting rid of the kid's worksheets.</p>
              <p>   Mr Gay didn't think there was anything wrong with what he did.</p>
              <p>   "The things we burnt were stuff such as worksheets, assessment books and homework that couldn't be reused again," he said.</p>
              <p>   "Just seeing how happy the kids were to put everything behind them made me feel that I would do it again."</p>

              <p>I did something similar when my girls had their PSLE, expect we didn't have a bonfire as (we) live in an HDB flat but we threw all PSLE-related stuff into the rubbish chute.</p>
