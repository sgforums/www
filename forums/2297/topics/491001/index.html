              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My grades for both subjects in sec 4 are similar, physics around 90 and bio around 83. Actually I like both subjects almost equally &gt;&lt;</p>

I like the equations and maths, they simplify many things, and we don't need to write essays. I also go for physics junior olympiad &gt;&lt; Even though I like physics, I don't think I will be a physicist in the future, but I am considering engineering :)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Biology:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">For biology, I find it much more difficult to study for (memorisation and essay writing which I am bad at), and I also don't score as high as physics. But I find it more interesting and I am interested in the life sciences side like being a doctor (very difficult) or doing research about diseases and developing medicines.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Which do you think I should study, physics or biology? For biology do you need to write many essays, is it very difficult to phrase things correctly? Is it difficult to enter engineering through the bridging course if I don't have a physics a level? Will there be a lot of focus on evolution in biology? (I don't really believe in it)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Thank you for reading this! It's abit long &gt;&lt;</p>

              I've a friend who was assigned by his HOD to lecture this topic in a certain JC, but being a devout Christian who didn't believe in Darwinism (or at least the idea of human beings evolving from apes), he started off his mass lecture (in front of the entire JC cohort) with, "<i>For the record, being a Christian I *know* Darwinism is just bullshit, but since I've to lecture this topic anyway, for the moment let's just pretend Darwinism is for real, shall we? All right, here we go...</i>"

              If there's bridging modules for Physics, there'll definitely be bridging modules for Biology. And as I said, even for Medicine, you don't need H2 Biology. Don't worry about Life Sciences (especially since you're split 50-50 between Engineering vs Life Sciences), Physics opens so much more doors for you in the Uni. Just about the only Uni course for which H2 Biology is compulsory, is Pharmacy.

              <p>Hello, I agree with Ultimaonline. If you are keen to do life science or medicine or pharmacy in university, then take biology.</p>
              <p>If you are keen on engineering, then do Physics. Physics, arguably, opens more doors than biology. You can survive as an engineer with an Honours degree from university, but it will be tough for a life science grad with an Honours degree (just my ground observation).</p>
              <p>I have a ex-student who has a PhD in life science, then he says market is really not too good for PhD biology students. To do life science research, you need a PhD and not just a basic degree.</p>
              <p>I also have a ex-student who has an engineering degree, then he switched to marketing as he says there are too much paperwork and admin for him. Singapore has a great demand for engineers and also life science grads.</p>
              <p> I know someone who did triple science in NUS High. HCI also has some candidates who take triple science (real heavy workload).</p>
              <p>Basically, you need an idea of what you want to do in university, then work backwards to JC subject combination planning.</p>
              <p>From my ground observation, usually those who do PCME are better in chemistry than those who do BCME. Physics and chemistry at H2 level are synergistic.</p>
              <p>Cheers!!</p>

              <p>Hi Psalm, you are welcome. I hope I have advised correctly. Maybe you also wanna go to National Library in Victoria Street and skim through some college physics and biology textbooks. You may have a gut feel of which subject you prefer.</p>
              <p>The Campbell biology textbook has evolution integrated in most chapters. If you encounter an enthusiastic biology tutor, the tutor may integrate evolution into many lessons throughout JC1 and JC2. Not all biologists subscribe to the theory of evolution. It is a theory and not a law.</p>
              <p>We welcome others to comment too so as to aid those who are choosing subject combination in Feb for the new JC1 students.</p>

              <p>Hi, my take is that the bridging module in 2 months is grossly insufficient to cover the amount of content you learn in the 2 years of A Level. You will definitely still struggle in engineering Physics without H2 Physics background.</p>
              <p>Since you were in the Junior Physics Olympiad, depending on the training you had (num of hours and the trainer), a fair number of topics are the same as that of A level. It will be a fairly ok transition for you into H2 Physics. Projectile Motion, Conservation of Momentum, etc, are just some of the common topics between the olympiad and H2 Physics. </p>
              <p>Coupled with lesser topics for the new syllabus of H2 Maths, you might have an easier JC time if you take Physics. The extra energy you probably have could be put to good use in your remaining two core subjects.</p>
