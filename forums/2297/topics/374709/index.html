              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>  We have work to do and lives to lead. Does work define your life or do you determine a life that you want to lead? Read this inspiring speech by Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Anna Quindlen at the graduation ceremony of an American university where she was awarded an Honorary PhD.</p>
              <p>  Enjoy the read! Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>
              <p>&gt; "I'm a novelist. My work is human nature. Real<br>&gt; life is all I know.<br>&gt; Don't ever confuse the two, your life and your work.<br>&gt; You will walk out of here this afternoon with only one thing<br>&gt; that no one else has. There will be hundreds of people out<br>&gt; there with your same degree: there will be thousands of<br>&gt; people doing what you want to do for a living. But you will<br>&gt; be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life.<br>&gt; Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just your life<br>&gt; at a desk or your life on a bus or in a car or at the<br>&gt; computer. Not just the life of your mind, but the life of<br>&gt; your heart. Not just your bank accounts but also your<br>&gt; soul.</p>
              <p>&gt; People don't talk about the soul very much anymore.<br>&gt; It's so much easier to write a resume than to craft a<br>&gt; spirit. But a resume is cold comfort on a winter's<br>&gt; night, or when you're sad, or broke, or lonely, or when<br>&gt; you've received your test results and they're not so<br>&gt; good.</p>
              <p>&gt; Here is my resume: I am a good mother to three children.<br>&gt; I have tried never to let my work stand in the way of being<br>&gt; a good parent. I no longer consider myself the centre of the<br>&gt; universe. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh. I am a good<br>&gt; friend to my husband. I have tried to make <span id="lw_1252370155_5" class="yshortcuts">marriage vows</span><br>&gt; mean what they say. I am a good friend to my friends and<br>&gt; them to me. Without them, there would be nothing to say to<br>&gt; you today, because I would be a cardboard cut out. But I<br>&gt; call them on the phone and I meet them for lunch. I would be<br>&gt; rotten, at best mediocre, at my job if those other things<br>&gt; were not true.</p>
              <p>&gt; You cannot be really first rate at your work if your<br>&gt; work is all you are. So here's what I wanted to tell you<br>&gt; today: Get a life. A real life, not a manic pursuit of the<br>&gt; next promotion, the bigger pay cheque, the larger house. Do<br>&gt; you think you'd care so very much about<br>&gt; those things if you blew an <span id="lw_1252370155_6" class="yshortcuts">aneurysm</span> one afternoon or found<br>&gt; a lump in your breast?<br>&gt; Get a life in which you notice the smell of salt water<br>&gt; pushing itself on a breeze at the seaside, a life in which<br>&gt; you stop and watch how a red-tailed hawk circles over the<br>&gt; water, or the way a baby scowls with concentration when she<br>&gt; tries to pick up a sweet with her thumb and first<br>&gt; finger.</p>
              <p>&gt; Get a life in which you are not alone. Find people you<br>&gt; love, and who love you. And remember that love is not<br>&gt; leisure, it is work. Pick up the phone. Send an email. Write<br>&gt; a letter. Get a life in which you are generous. And realize<br>&gt; that life is the best thing ever, and that you have no<br>&gt; business taking it for granted. Care so deeply about its<br>&gt; goodness that you want to spread it around. Take money you<br>&gt; would have spent on beer and give it to charity. Work in a<br>&gt; soup kitchen. Be a big brother or sister. All of you want to<br>&gt; do well. But if you do not do good too, then doing well will<br>&gt; never be enough.</p>
              <p>&gt; It is so easy to waste our lives, our days, our hours,<br>&gt; and our minutes. It is so easy to take for granted the<br>&gt; colour of our kids' eyes, the way the melody in a<br>&gt; symphony rises and falls and disappears and rises again. It<br>&gt; is so easy to exist instead of to live.</p>
              <p><br>&gt; I learned to live many years ago. I learned to love the<br>&gt; journey, not the destination. I learned that it is not a<br>&gt; dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you<br>&gt; get. I learned to look at all the good in the world and try<br>&gt; to give some of it back because I believed in it, completely<br>&gt; and utterly. And I tried to do that, in part, by telling<br>&gt; others what I had learned. By telling them this: Consider<br>&gt; the lilies of the field. Look at the fuzz on a baby's<br>&gt; ear. Read in the back yard with the sun on your face.</p>
              <p>&gt; Learn to be happy. And think of life as a terminal<br>&gt; illness, because if you do, you will live it with joy and<br>&gt; passion as it ought to be lived".</p>
