              Hello
              
              I am a repeating JC1 student taking H2 Bio, Chem, Math and H1 Econs. Last year I took H2 Phy, Chem, Math and H1 Econs.
              
              When I found out that I was retained I was very dissapointed and decided to change that maybe I should change my subjects. Honestly, I was very confused and changed my subject combination a few times and hastily decided to take up bio. But on hindsight, I should have just stuck with my subjects last year, after all I actually liked the subjects.
              
              Now every single day, I am angry with myself for making the wrong decision. There is no turning back because the school will not let me change anymore. Other JCs do not want to allow any more transfer so the only option would be going to MI.
              
              I am just afraid of all the stereotypes of MI and maybe the lecture notes aren't as good and i might be affected by them.
              
              My parents and friends are telling me to persevere on just stay in my current JC.
              
              Poly is not an option for me because there are no courses that I am interested in.
              
              Please help!

              <p><br>That's quite a dilemma you've gotten yourself in.</p>
              <p>H2 Bio has more stuff to memorize than H2 Chem + H2 Phys *combined*.</p>
              <p>It's true that if you're the type who is easily influenced by your peers and social environment, MI requires you to have somewhat more self-discipline than some other JCs. In addition, it's a 3 year course, which means you'll spend : 1 year retaking + 3rd year at MI = 2 years longer than your peers.</p>
              <p>Your decision will hinge on your honest assessment of yourself on two points :</p>
              <p>1) Can you find the interest, effort and discipline to memorize all that stuff required of H2 Bio?</p>
              <p>2) Can you find the interest, effort and discipline to be self-motivated and focused regardless of your peers and social environment, for the next 3 years?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, are you certain that MI will accept you at this point in time? MI reserves the right to accept or reject any late-coming applicant (regardless of his/her grades), through several rounds of interviews with the vice-principal.</p>
              <p>Be sure you stay with your current JC until you've secured a place at MI. You don't want to end up not having a place at any JC as well as MI, and having to take private 'A' levels all by yourself.</p>

              <p>Hey bearybear,</p>
              <p>That's a big mistake u made by changing from physics to bio. If u are not the hardworking memorising type, the strategy should be dun take bio. At least if u had repeated the same combi wth physics, u could try to understand better as physics is more on understanding rather than pure memorising.</p>
              <p>But anyway, since u are into the new combi already &amp; its already halfway of your JC1 repeat year, try to make the best of it. Dun change school, remain in your present JC and try to pass JC1 promo exams and go to JC2.</p>
              <p>Btw, which JC are u in?</p>

              Thank you for your suggestions and opinion, I really appreciate it especially in times of difficulty.
              
              I like my JC, the environment, friends and teachers, if I go to MI, I am afraid that I am not able to get over the fact that I worked really hard for o levels and made it into jc but in the end went to MI
