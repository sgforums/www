              <p>I just posted this about MI on this thread here "<strong>Millennia Institute (MI) anyone planning to go?" </strong>:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/millennia_institute_mi_43570.html">http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/millennia_institute_mi_43570.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I posted :</p>
              <p>'A' levels is just 2 or 3 short years in JC or MI. It's all about yourself, and how willing to be self-disciplined you are. Don't assign responsibility to (ie. don't blame) the JC/MI for your own ('A' level) results/grades. As long as you're willing to have self-discipline, as long as you want that NUS/NTU/SMU course bad enough to cheong your 'A' levels, it doesn't matter which JC (or MI) you're in, all that matters is yourself.<br><br>If you're planning for a course in NUS/NTU/SMU, you need Project Work, which means you need to go to JC or MI. Private 'A' level candidates or courses like PSB Academy do NOT include Project Work. If you do not have Project Work, your 'A' level cert is useless as far as NUS/NTU/SMU is concerned.<br><br>And remember that half of all Poly students regret their course of study (but it's too late; your diploma determines your futuer study or future career). If you haven't yet decided on a suitable Poly course (eg. if you haven't decided on a future career yet), but you can't make it to a JC either with your 'O' level results, then you should seriously consider MI.</p>

              <p>according to many of my friends MI has a school population of over 65% malays/indians ppl rather play psp in library than attend lectures cause basically the teacher's teaching it dosent make any difference whether u attend or not..Some science teachers even view their MI students as "aiya this students already so XXXX.. we no need to work so hard and use their students' laziness as an excuse to their principal..the study atmosphere there cmi...</p>
              <p>Ordinary ppl will come straight away tell u that "nvm as long as u work hard u can blah blah blah.." but come on at alevels u r competing with the TOP brains in this nation,to go MI and study with those ppl while competing with the tops like RJ,HC,Victoria,Temasek or even neighbourhood jcs like Innova and CJC would be committing total suicide..</p>
              <p>While i myself is only from a neighbourhood JC and when i look at MI's papers its like (Heng im not there)...better go to a JC if u can, try the neighbourhood ones if your score dosent allow you to pursue admission to the top ones..if not poly like many of my friends in MI eventually does after wasting like 1/2years there..</p>

              <p>bad. if you cant go jc, your probably shldnt go the MI route. since A lvls involves even more studying and stress than Os.</p>
              <p>And as seen from Os, you cant handle any of that; tats why you end up in MI</p>

              <p>big cable, you're just GENERALISING. first of all, have you ever been in that school to witness what your friends said to you? second, the sole reason why your friends from MI couldn't make it to year 2 is because they are lazy. no other excuses.</p>
              <p>to OP: no matter which school you go to, your ultimate goal is to score good grades for the As. people influence you everywhere you go, be it in a good or bad place, but ultimately, it is YOUR resposibility to make sure that you score. trust me, not all MI students are as bad as what bigcable mentioned, there are also good students from that school.</p>

              <p>if you intend to take the As, of course the main purpose is to get into any of the 3 Unis. then what else? right? so meaning to say, even if you sit for the As, but don't intend to go to Uni, i really don't see the point, unless your plan is to enrol into some of the poly courses that require A-levels, like physiotherapy etc.</p>

              <p>if you intend to take the As, of course the main purpose is to
              get into any of the 3 Unis. then what else? right? so meaning to
              say, even if you sit for the As, but don't intend to go to Uni, i
              really don't see the point, unless your plan is to enrol into some
              of the poly courses that require A-levels, like physiotherapy
              etc.</p>

              <p>Yes, but only if you spend 2 years. To spend 3 years to get 'A' Levels, you have no guarantee that you will get into the 3 local unis.<br><br>

              <p><br>But even with lousy A level results, you can also go and get a degree with UniSIM so why go the poly route which takes 3 years when the A level only takes 2 years?</p>
