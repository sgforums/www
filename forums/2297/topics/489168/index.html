              <p>Enrolled into poly this year, I hated what I am currently studying(still got As &amp; Bs for most of my module) to make things I stay at relatively far from the poly I am currently studying in(2hrs to reach school without being late).</p>
              <p>I am considering studying A levels as a private candidate, prefer to manage my time and study at my own pace.</p>
              <p>Side note: I still have not served NS yet.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, taking A levels as a private candidate is certainly an idea worth considering. Choose your A level H2 and H1 subjects wisely (based on NUS / NTU / SMU / SUTD requirements for various Uni courses).<br><br>Also be sure you personally check with MinDef regarding your NS enlistment date (tell them you're taking A levels as a private candidate), to avoid being charged in the event of a misunderstanding. It will be likely that you'll only have 1 year (as opposed to 2 years for JC students) to prepare for your 2016 A level exams, before you'll be forced to enlist for NS.</div>

                      Yes, that's actually an excellent idea. Complete your NS first, then take A levels as a private candidate with a satisfying peace of mind (that you've discharged your patriotic NSF duty liao, and no worries about kena charged for AWOL from enlistment).
                      <br><br>Excellent, welcome to the Teaching community. I always encourage my students who have a passion for teaching to sign up with MOE, like I did. I never regretted joining MOE as a teacher, just as (when the time is up) I never regretted leaving MOE and becoming self-employed (for many reasons including personal and medical, but not financial : afterall, most private tutors do NOT earn more than an MOE teacher*, but they do certainly get more sleep which is crucial for coping with medical conditions).<br><br>* Of course, there are always outliers in any private profession, whether medicine, real estate or banking.
