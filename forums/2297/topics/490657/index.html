              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I'm secondary 3 this year and I'm taking the following subjects for my O-Levels next year :</p>
              <p>English - 51</p>
              <p>Additional Mathematics - 20</p>
              <p>Mathematics - 53</p>

              <p>Principles of Accounts - 63</p>
              <p>(My SA2 results are above, I'm exempted from MT)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I kept getting F9 for A Maths and I'm in a dilemma if I should drop it or not.

She says that A Maths is not required to pursue accountancy courses, but if I do well in it, it is a bonus to me. Is that true? I intend to pursue an Accountancy course in Poly though the Direct Poly Admission. Is A Maths going to do any help in accountancy courses? Can I still enter University after getting a diploma? What is the minimum should I get for my O-Levels to qualify for DPA?</span></p>

              <p>The entry requirements for accountancy for NP is found here</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.np.edu.sg/ba/courses/acc/Pages/acc.aspx">http://www.np.edu.sg/ba/courses/acc/Pages/acc.aspx</a></p>
              <p>It should be about the same for each poly I guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It does appear that A Maths isn't necessary for it, either E Maths or A Maths will do. So that's the bare minimum criteria. Theoretically you qualify, so your school HOD isn't wrong. It sure sounds very convincing to get you to drop the subject [to help the school grades. Brutal truth: They should be coming up with ideas to help you score better instead, my opinion. But it's way easier to just ask you to drop the subject.]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The actual scenario isn't as optimistic I believe. And I'm pretty sure you may be disappointed by the time you receive your O level results [think long term].</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The question now isn't what subjects you take, but what you score for it. I don't know much about the poly side, but this is what I found out</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.tp.edu.sg/admissions/course-intake-and-last-aggregate-scores">http://www.tp.edu.sg/admissions/course-intake-and-last-aggregate-scores</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.nyp.edu.sg/nyp/slot/u179/future_students/pdf/2015Intake_2015ELR2B2.xlsx">http://www.nyp.edu.sg/nyp/slot/u179/future_students/pdf/2015Intake_2015ELR2B2.xlsx</a></p>
              <p>If I interpret it correctly, you need a minimum L1R4 of 12 to 14 points to get into accountancy. </p>
              <p>Look at it this way, your English (L1) is already 6 points. So is your E Maths. This already adds up to 12. Even if your remaining subjects get A1, that's still 16 points. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thing is... why give up on A Maths so early without trying or fighting to be better for it? It will indirectly help you in your E Maths since you will be spending lots of time on two maths subjects.</span></p>
              <p>There's really no secret to scoring well for Maths... or Physics<br>Step 1: Understand concepts<br>Step 2: Practice on different question patterns with proper presentation<br>Step 3: Drill</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">With your grades, I will say... you really need help on it for Step 1 and Step 2. Step 3, you have to do it yourself.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On entering university with diploma... I can say it's going to be a very very tough process. But that's not the issue yet. The key is, can you even qualify for the poly course of your choice.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Accountancy has lots of math and figures and indirectly uses A Math. Also, if you go to poly then to NUS, NTU, accountancy needs some A Math in NUS, SMU, NTU. Business in the unis also has quite substantial A Math and JC math in it. So you need to reconsider accountancy. Also, accountancy is the one of the most competitive course in polys and the unis.</p>
              <p>So, A Math is a very important subject. Almost all faculties in poly and NUS, NTU, SMU use a little or some or much A Math except for maybe art, literature, history.</p>
              <p>So i advise you to continue taking A Math and to seek tuition.</p>
              <p>Having 5 subjects for O levels is not advisable (and dangerous), as majority of the candidates have 6-9 subjects.</p>
              <p>Best regards.</p>

              <p>Well in the same predicament as you,except that i am a sec 4 student who have just finished O levels.</p>
              <p>My A math results for each exam was a consistent f9,from sec 3 all the way up to prelims.Tend to sleep through every A math lesson in class as it is too boring,so barely learnt anything much.</p>
              <p>It was until the 1 week September hols did i buck up and revised through a math tys like a no life retard for 5 days,without revising other subjects.</p>
              <p>But by then....it was already too late.</p>
              <p>After taking this year O level A math paper,i was definitely happy that i will be able to pass,but not able to get an A1(is always good to dream big).The highest grade i can score is only an A2,or minimum a B3.I have friends who were high flyers in a math exams(a2/b3),only to flunk the o level a maths paper and be pissed that their dreams of getting a distinction are dashed.</p>
              <p>Well my point is...paying attention in lessons can be a rather important factor in helping u understand A math,but that may not be necessarily true.As long as you revise hard on your own,it is definitely possible you will see an improvement.</p>

              <p>Hi Golizd,</p>
              <p> I do agree with you about the NTU situation, and accounting requiring basic algebra. However, in overseas uni, some unis require accountancy students to take calculus as a module in accountancy, to act as a weeder.</p>
              <p>Also, if a student decides in JC to switch to business finance or economics instead of accountancy, he really needs A Math and JC Math or poly math as there are some statistics involved in business course.</p>
              <p>In postgraduate studies of accountancy, differential equations could be required for certain modules of accountancy in overseas uni.</p>
              <p>I advocate taking A Math in O levels as it is considered a "hard" subject compared to "soft" subject eg. home economics. JC and poly may view A Math more favorably than "soft" subjects.</p>
              <p>The analytical skills learned in A math could be transferrable to accountancy modules. NTU may change the syllabus and require students to take calculus next time.</p>
              <p>This example requires calculus for business students and maybe accountancy students :</p>
