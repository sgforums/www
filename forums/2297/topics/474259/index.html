              <p>The debate flared up again when Indranee claims there is no need for tuition.</p>
              <p>That I agree too.</p>
              <p>But ST came up with interviews and it was clear most people feel they need tuition.</p>
              <p>The reasons for which boggled me no end.</p>
              <p>I am a tuition teacher too. And I always make it clear to my students that I detest the tuition industry. </p>
              <p>It is my opinion that most students simply fail to either use their resources at hand (one student claims asking MOE teachers could incite embarassment, like smlj?), or simply lack the drive.</p>
              <p>You can keep blaming the education system for stifling, but it is up to the individual to find ways to make it advantageous. </p>
              <p>For those who take JC tuition, can they expect to carry on having tuition into uni, and by extension, jobs?</p>
              <p>For those who go to tuition "not knowing what they do not know", when will they wake up their idea?</p>

              <p>How absolutely hypocritical. You claim you hate the tuition industry and yet you're a tuition teacher. Oh wow.</p>
              <p>All I can say is, you'd never understand somebody else's plight/needs/whatever unless you've tried taking a walk in his shoes. For some people, the teaching style in school might not suit them. Not all teachers are friendly and unapproachable too. There're many reasons why one might need tuition. So you didn't need it while you were in school. Good for you then (and your parents' pockets).</p>
              <p>I respect your right to free speech but I would not hesitate to admit that your posts on sgforums irk me. What good does it do to fan the flames in the bus forum? Maybe it gives you a sense of accomplishment? After all, it makes you think you're doing good and educating the younger generation right? Well, get off your high horse. There're ways to put things across without coming across as sarcastic and obviously you've not mastered the art of that. How does that make you any better in comparison?</p>
              <p>I have no intention to be drawn into an argument, and I will not post further on this matter. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Oh the irony indeed. To console myself I choose not to teach the dry stuff, focusing instead on applications and argumentative stylistics to strengthen their knowledge bank.</p>

              <p>Feel the plight of students?</p>
              <p>I feel more the plight of this country of we carry on this crazy tuition path.</p>
              <p>As a tuition teacher, how would you feel if your student persists in "I dont know why I am in this system, but I think I shld be there anyway"?</p>
              <p>Can we really blame the education system for leading to individuals lacking in imagination?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I am a tuition teacher myself. Been teaching for eight years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And I can say this much: with few exceptions, most of my
              students do not need tuition. What they need is a change in attitude. I have
              always told them that if they just paid attention in class and did their
              homework conscientiously (i.e. honestly and to the best of their efforts), they
              are already 80% on their way to academic success. The other 20% comes from
              their own efforts in revising their work for their exams.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I challenged them to just simply do that and make their
              parents fire me for being redundant. Hasn’t happened yet. Looking at the (lack
              of) quality of their school homework, I can see why. And looking at how they
              often failed to do the homework I assigned them, the issue is a lack of the
              proper attitude.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And before anyone says I’m being too harsh, let me just say
              that I just assign four or five simple questions from their own textbooks. If
              they understand my lessons (as was the impression I got), the assignments can
              be completed in twenty minutes. If they can’t remember the lessons, then they
              need to read up more. Simple as that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And don’t anyone tell me about how some of them are less
              privileged or have family problems or whatever. Please lah, some of them live
              in condos and have parents who drive BMWs and take them for nice long holidays.
              My father is a taxi driver, my mum was a housewife, and we ran in financial problems
              when my father got into an accident just before my Sec 4 prelims and couldn’t
              drive. And I still got on pretty well without tuition.    </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Some may say that I am being hypocritical for teaching the
              kids while saying that they do not really need tuition. But the truth of the
              matter is that without my intervention, they will be worse off because of their
              attitude problems. Some of the kids tell me outright that my tuition sessions
              are the only time when they actually revise for their tests and exams. Without
              a tutor, they just couldn’t be bothered.</span></p>

              <p>When I took up the tuition class about 4 years ago, I thought I was doing something that could help students appreciate what they learn better.</p>
              <p>But it is increasingly harder to justify to myself, teaching students who are there.......for the sake of being there, and being absolutely stubborn and blind to reason.</p>
              <p>As I recall, after I asked why nobody was paying close attention to something I was teaching, the student said: Oh because I wasnt taught yet, and will be taught soon anyway, I suppose.</p>

              <p>I still remember when I was in sec 3, I was forced to stay back after school to finish my homework which I had forgotten to do (I sompah I really forgot lol).</p>
              <p>I sat next to this N(T) guy who was being punished as well.</p>
              <p>After we finished our work, we chatted a bit to pass time.</p>
              <p>He said: I am from N(T), I know people kua suay me (see me no up). But I know I wont make it in the express stream. And I want to pursue accounting. So I chose to do N(T), and head to ITE to pursue what I want.</p>
              <p>Its been more than a decade already since that time. But the fact that I still can recall it fresh from my mind can tell you how much he impressed me, even till today.</p>
              <p>I think learning about one's limits and desired pursuits are important too.</p>
              <p>Which begs the question, why aren't people willing to look elsewhere to learn, when they clearly aren't enjoying it (or even trying to for the matter), in the education system?</p>

              <p>Perhaps that is one of the great ideas conceptualized to reduce the time students have for tuition, on top of the crushing volumes of homework I see <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCAs are a great way for students to interact outside of just studying, but what about trainings for Mon, Wed, Fri, as well as potentially weekends?</p>
              <p>How about certain CCAs that have weekends training or weekends camp? What happened to the 5-day work week initiated by our dear PM in Aug 2004? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><br>Sure, no more school lessons, but replaced with school CCAs.

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think school teachers have it hard, and I give my due respect to all school teachers in Singapore. The least a student can do is to show some mini appreciation on Teacher's Day, something that is apparently missing in a few schools based on stories I heard. </p>

              <p>I got tuition on english because I'm so weak in English back in the secondary school days, just because I'm from HongKong, a place where lessons are conducted in Cantonese and my living environment is totally chinese style. Thanks to tuition I manage to get a B3 for my Os and subsequently I made it into JC and finally to NTU. Now I'm a bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. </p>
              <p>Different people have different needs, some people are really weak in certain areas and need additional help, not all of them are academically inclined. </p>
              <p>I have teacher friends who shared with me that they are doing more administrative and CCA work than the actual teaching. Most of the time they need to conduct remedial classes is because they can't finish the cirriculum, what makes you think that they have the time to take care of every student's needs?</p>
              <p>There is a price to pay when the government wants the kids to be an all-rounder.</p>

              <p>Tuition has its place and merit then.</p>
              <p>That point I gamely concede.</p>
              <p>But I still hold to the point that in many cases, it might very well be needless if some soul-searching and self-discipline is instilled.</p>
              <p>Certainly from my perspective, I dont buy the argument that kids should have tuition simply because others have tuition.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I am not a parent myself, so I fail to grasp the "kiasu-ism" that is so pandemic with regards to tuition.</p>

              <p>I used to question a number of teacher friends, who they know in recent years that have been promoted for exceptional teaching. Sadly and not suprisingly, none could answer.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  When I was still in the service, I am aware that all teachers have KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to meet and they cover various areas (ability in teaching, contribution to value-added results, Civics Tutor responsibilities, Project Work Supervising Tutor responsibilities, CCA teacher/overall-in-charge responsibilities, Committees' responsibilities, etc...).</p>
              <p>  An able teacher (who is given a good grade) is one who is not just able to teach competently and deliver good results but one who is also able to contribute to the progress of the school significantly. If we have two teachers A (only teach competently) and B (able to teach competently, leads the school's team to championship and spearheads a school's strategic initative), teacher B will be ranked higher than teacher A. It is not that teacher A has been penalised, it's just that teacher B has been given more recognition by an appraisal system that looks, at large, contributions made by teachers.</p>
              <p>  As for the grades given to teachers by the appraisal system, I vaguely remember the following:</p>
              <p>  A - Officer performs above expectations in ALL areas of responsibility.</p>
              <p>  B - Officer performs above expectations in MOST areas of responsibility.</p>
              <p>  C - Officer performs above expectations in SOME areas of responsibility.</p>
              <p>  D (5%) - Officer performs AS EXPECTED.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>P.S. I wonder if these have changed?</p>

              <p>In the first place, the larger tutoring businesses will not trust each other, each looking to protect it's own bottomline against its rivals, and it's doubtful if such an organization can even materialize at all.</p>
              <p>If it does somehow get set up, it will be susceptible to abuse, ie. profitable large tutoring businesses will gang up to squeeze out smaller operators and individual tutors.</p>
              <p>And being a private organization, inclusion or registration will have to be optional, and not legislated as compulsory, so most tutors and tutoring businesses would decline to register themselves in such an organization (which will cost you membership fees, with no significant tangible benefit).</p>
              <p>MOE will (quite rightly) deem it a waste of tax payers' money to legislate and regulate what MOE has already formally declared as "an unncessary industry".</p>
              <p>Edited post to add :</p>
              <p><em>Moreso than in other service industries, the tuition industry is successfully self-regulating, in that if the students/parents (increasingly demanding these days) do not quickly see satisfactory improvement in results, they will simply drop the tutor / tuition center, and move on to the next one, until they are satisfied with results.</em></p>
              <p><em>As every student and tutor is unique, different students with different learning styles will respond differently to different tutors with different teaching styles. Student A might find tutor B much better, while student B might find tutor A much better.</em></p>
              <p><em>I actually have had students who used to receive tuition from some other very famous and reputable tutors (in separate, unrelated cases, involving different famous and reputable tutors, not just for H2 Chemistry, but for other H2 subjects as well), but the students told me (initially to my surprise, before I better understood that different-students-need-different-tutors) that they found these tutors to be 'sucky' or 'cannot teach' or 'waste of money', etc.  </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, the man behind the ATA already tried to implement this in Singapore, and he gave up in disgust :</p>
              <h3>Aug 19, 2010 - ST Forum</h3>
              <div>CONSUMERS UNPROTECTED</div>
              <h1>Tuition industry lacks regulation</h1>
              <p>I WAS surprised and relieved to see the article on Sunday ('Is your child's tutor qualified?').</p>
              <p>I am the chief executive officer of the Australian Tutoring Association (ATA) and last year, while in Singapore, I met two large tuition companies here to speak about issues that the tuition industry could address.</p>
              <p>These issues included:</p>
              <div>
              <ul>
              <li>Tutor qualifications;</li>
              <li>Child protection;</li>
              <li>Truth in advertising; and</li>
              <li>Consumer protection.
              <p> <br>Both businesses expressed interest in forming an association similar to the ATA. However, neither has acted despite both recognising serious issues in the industry.</p>
              <p>In Australia, the ATA has given consumers a choice between those places offering accountable, honest and open tuition, and those that do not.</p>
              <p>We do this by having members agree to abide by our code of conduct, which is available online to consumers and to which all members are accountable.</p>
              <p>Why isn't there a tuition association in Singapore which benchmarks minimum standards for all tutors?</p>
              <p>Why is the industry unregulated?</p>
              <p>Who is most vulnerable?</p>
              <p>A responsible industry has a representative body. It seems odd that in Singapore, where there is a real focus on education, the private sector is not called upon to demonstrate more initiative with regard to consumers.</p>
              <p>The worst aspects of the sector in Australia are similar to those that occur here: Online tuition and the use of agents (in the case of tuition agencies that are not registered with the Ministry of Education).</p>
              <p>I think serious questions should be asked about the tuition sector in Singapore, and all related businesses should be subject to greater consumer scrutiny until there is a representative body that is prepared to publicly call for minimum standards and work with the Government as well as consumer protection and educational bodies.</p>

              <p><br>What's good for the students, is to have more tutors and tuition centers to choose from, so that if the students judge the tutor / tuition center to be ineffective or not worth the money, they can quit and readily try out another.</p>
              <p>Having more tutors and tuition centers to choose from, is an already ongoing and accelerating change (according to statistics the government has access to), which will result in the 'bubble tea' bubble bursting, and (according to the 'survival of the fittest'), tutors / tuition centers in it just for the money and not for the genuine teaching, will find it hard to survive in the saturated competitive industry, and will quit the business.</p>
              <p>Legislation wise, there will no changes to the industry, as for fundamental reasons, MOE must and will continue to declare private tuition "an unnecessary industry".</p>

              <p>If the ministry puts all the best learning resources from the schools and JCs on the online portal, the demand for tuition will decrease significantly.</p>
              <p>For example, if a H2 Maths student has access to the learning resources in the popular website ggmaths.net, he or she will be less likely to take tuition.</p>
              <p>In the website, there are lecture notes and worked out full tutorial solutions for each topic, tests with full solutions, detailed worked out full solutions for all the JCs prelim papers from 2007 to 2012, revision notes, very useful summary notes and formulae.</p>
              <p>A H2 maths student can study on his or her own with these learning resources and do relatively well. In addition, many JC H2 Maths lecturers arrange these prelim questions into topics and give them as exercises, assignments and tests to their students.</p>
