              <p>If the ministry puts all the best learning resources from the
              schools and JCs on the online portal, the demand for tuition will
              decrease significantly.</p>
              <p>For example, if a H2 Maths student has access to the learning
              resources in the popular website ggmaths.net, he or she will be
              less likely to take tuition.</p>
              <p>In the website, there are lecture notes and worked out full
              tutorial solutions for each topic, tests with full solutions,
              detailed worked out full solutions for all the JCs prelim papers
              from 2007 to 2012, revision notes, very useful summary notes and
              formulae.</p>
              <p>A H2 maths student can study on his or her own with these
              learning resources and do relatively well. In addition, many JC H2
              Maths lecturers arrange these prelim questions into topics and give
              them as exercises, assignments and tests to their students.</p>

              <p>There are still a number of questions which they don't understand the solutions and needed help.</p>

              <p>The question lies in whether the resources online are correct or wrong, whether the solutions are accepted by cambridge or not, or whether the explanations are in syllabus a not.</p>
              <p>For example, an O level student searching for definitions of Newton's 2nd Law would have encountered both the O Level definition and the A Level definition, both of which are correct at their respective levels.</p>
              <p>There are many more such possibilities that it is extra work for the students to distinguish the "correct" and the "wrong", and the extra time and energy for all these is already sufficient for the student to delve deeper into the subject matter.</p>

              <p>Indeed, there are some solutions that the students do not understand and there are some wrong solutions. However, when the best learning materials of schools and JCs are put in the MOE online portal, the very experienced and best teachers and lecturers will be in charge. They will ensure that solutions will be easy to understand and no incorrect solution.</p>
              <p>The issue of whether something is within the syllabus will also become a non-issue with these very experienced and best teachers and lecturers.</p>
              <p>Very few resources in the popular bookstore is really useful. For example, the learning resources on H2 economics in popular bookstore is not really useful if a student compares the model essays sold in the popular bookstore with the model essays (PEEL) provided by the JC H2 economics lecturers.. The more useful resources in popular book are for H2 Maths.</p>

              <p>I
               have also encountered those who really wish to learn....and total CMIs 
              who have no idea why they exist in the system and refuse to heed my 
              words.</p>
              <p>All the arguments for tuition are largely rubbish IMO.</p>
              <p>The resources are at the disposal for the kids if they really want to improve their grades.</p>
              <p>If
               you need tuition for self-supervision purposes, or because you feel the
               teacher cant reach out to you in class, then tuition still doesnt solve
               the fundamental problem why you cant access these resources!</p>
              <p>After
               all, for those who will make it to uni (which will be half the cohort 
              in due time), do you still expect MODEL ANSWERS, and hand-holding still 
              all the way?</p>
              <p>Sure, you might say: Not everyone is like you, so lucky no need tuition.</p>
              <p>RUBBISH</p>
              <p>I was made to be this way because I had to. Even more so now.</p>
              <p>Recently
               my prof supervisor, concerned that I couldnt get help from the other 
              teaching staff, decided to connect me with MIT peeps, in an attempt to 
              try and help me. Clearly I am not a know-all.</p>
              <p>I can imagine a 
              lot of the kids would turn down the offer because "scary", "sekali I 
              look stupid" etc etc (reasons for tuition). I was a bit intimidated with
               the prospect, but I said: Why not? And proceeded to rattle off a list 
              of queries for the MIT peeps to answer.</p>
              <p>It boils down to attitude and self-belief.</p>
              <p>Has our system been unable to cultivate that??</p>

              <p>The problem is that JC H2 Econs students who do not answer in PEEL format tend to get lower marks :) Furthermore, many students tend to lose focus when they answer the questions in their own preferred way and get low marks. :)</p>

              <p>The resources are at the disposal for the kids if they really
                  want to improve their grades.</p>
              <p>If you need tuition for self-supervision purposes, or because
                  you feel the teacher cant reach out to you in class, then tuition
                  still doesnt solve the fundamental problem why you cant access
                  these resources!</p>
              <p>After all, for those who will make it to uni (which will be half
                  the cohort in due time), do you still expect MODEL ANSWERS, and
                  hand-holding still all the way?</p>
              <p>Sure, you might say: Not everyone is like you, so lucky no need
                  tuition.</p>
              <p>RUBBISH</p>
              <p>I was made to be this way because I had to. Even more so
                  now.</p>
              <p>Recently my prof supervisor, concerned that I couldnt get help
                  from the other teaching staff, decided to connect me with MIT
                  peeps, in an attempt to try and help me. Clearly I am not a
                  know-all.</p>
              <p>I can imagine a lot of the kids would turn down the offer
                  because "scary", "sekali I look stupid" etc etc (reasons for
                  tuition). I was a bit intimidated with the prospect, but I said:
                  Why not? And proceeded to rattle off a list of queries for the MIT
                  peeps to answer.</p>
              <p>It boils down to attitude and self-belief.</p>
              <p>Has our system been unable to cultivate that??</p>

              <p>Basically the economics education in Singapore does not require own thinking until they have reached the honour degree, master and PHD levels to which they have to write the academic exercise, master and doctoral thesis. The content will have to be different from what have been published ie something new and different from the economic theories :)</p>
