              <p>A company called CHLOROMAN makes chemical from rock salt (sodium chloride). NaCl arrives at the factory by pipeline as brine. CHLOROMAN sells the chlorine to a PVC manufaturer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If PVC manufacturer goes out of business, CHLOROMAN must find a new market for its chlorine AT ONCE. Why must CHLOROMAN do so? Suggest another buyer for which CHLOROMAN might sell its chlorine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer isn't good but I'll tell you what I write so someone could improve on it... I wrote that chlorine, being a reactive halogen, will easily react after being put in place for a long time. So it has to find a new market. The buyer: Swimming pool? rofl.</p>

              <p>Indeed as I predicted based on reduction potentials, it is Cu+ rather than Cu2+ that is reduced. This is less likely to occur with a Cu2+ salt (consider their different reduction potentials). By Le Chatelier's principle, the greater molarity of water as a solvent (as I've already earlier mentioned, the reducing agent is unlikely to be the protons or the sulfate(VI) ions from the sulfuric(VI) acid, which are both oxidizing in nature) enables the reduction of Cu+ ions to elemental Cu to be feasible. The trick here, is that the opportunity for such to occur, is presented by the protonation of oxide anion.</p>

              <p>Regardless, most things are possible, but under specific circumstances. Just because a question implied a theoretical possibility, does not necessarily mean it's practically feasible under normal circumstances.</p>

              <p>I would say at O's or A's level, most students won't be questioning the conditions of reactions nor understand the conditions required but will just plainly accept the question as its given. There is no time to argue with the teacher in the exam that the question is not practical and has flaws which makes the answer impractical etc</p>
