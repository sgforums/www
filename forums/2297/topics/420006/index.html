Its where all the noisy people go to.. the non studious kind..i dare not venture into such school ): another course might have caught my interest, biomedical science. can anyone let me know more about it too? haha since i've got 23 i have no other choice but poly.. i guess i've got to try to like something.. my friends suggested MI though... pls help! thank you!</p></div>

              <p>u still got plenty of time to look carefully at all the polytechnic courses u are eligible. Polytechnic courses descriptions in the booklet are very generic, which mean, they dont go into details. For this reason, u should go down personally to the polytechnics and find out more. Open house is a good thing. Find a few good friends to go with u.</p>
              <p>Ppl go JC for the purpose of going to Uni,  now that u cant, u can aim to be top 5% of a polytechnic course and u still can go local Uni. If cannot also nvm, go private Uni (although lesser recognised but still a degree)</p>

              <p>I agree with what you have mentioned, but just to quote what you said about Open House, the Polytechnic Open Houses were from 6 to 8 January, now they are having JAE Course Counselling. Do head down to get the Lecturer's advice</p>
              <p>I'm sorry to say, but the courses you mentioned Biomedical Science (in NP, SP, and TP) have a COP of either 9 or 10 (RP COP is 22), and Psychology have a COP of under 13 in various schools. You can find out more information <a href="http://www.polytechnic.edu.sg/polyguide/JAE.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Your score isn't that bad, so it is of no cause to worry so much. Just take your time to make your right choice. (:</p>

              <p>Oh Biomedical Science.</p>
              <p>Your results can make it to RP Biomedical Science, and I was from there. Tell you more about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The modules offered at RP Biomed is very similar to those of NP SP and TP. Basically you get to learn more about how our body work. If you have taken up Biology at O Level, then I'll tell you.. you will learn more about human body and various biological process at molecular level. you will be intrique by how our body works.</p>
              <p>Other than that, you will be trained in laboratory to deal with biological samples like saliva and bacteria. You will learn many different types of testings which will be beneficial when you come out to work. These lab session provides you with hand-on activity, and will keep you on par with other poly's biomed.</p>
              <p>Biomed sci is all about learning the science of our body, and using technology for better understanding. when you are at third year, you get to choose your specializations. I took the general specialization which learns about disease (cancers) and understanding the molecular strucuture of proteins.</p>
              <p>Ask me if you want to know more. Actually, I studies Biomedical Science at Poly.. and when I compare Biology A Level, the contents are very similar. Except, we get the hands on practical skills that is applicable to real-working world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, MI is 3 year route to A Level. Less stressful as compared to JC. You get more time to learn concepts and theories. In my opinion, the better choice. 3 years does not mean lousier, it means giving student more room and time for comfortable pace of learning. MI culture is totally different from ITE culture. Let me put it this way</p>
              <p>JC - Very stress (everyone study like hell)<br>MI - comfortable pace (still study, similar to a little more stress than sec sch)<br>ITE - comfortable (mix of practical and theories skills, most able to coe)<br>Sec Sch - comfortable pace (study)</p>
              <p>You are still young, and you may not understand how to become a psychiatrist. It is a journey that will require at least 7 years of degree programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not have a clear idea of what you want to do, MI might be a better options.</p>

              <p>Psychologists are unable to prescribe drugs and they are unable to administer electroshock therapy treatments.</p>
              <p>Try going to a poly and you might have a higher chance of getting to medical school (unless you're able to excel well in the sciences with your current grades). Most probably the education system has changed; many years ago, you'll need Biology, Chemistry and Physics at Advanced level (GCE) in order to get into a Medical School in the UK.</p>

              <p>my advice is, since your results qualifies you for poly, then go poly.</p>
              <p>dun die die for the sake of taking A lvl go MI.</p>
              <p>MI and poly both are 3 years, but at the end of the day, A lvl is worth less than a diploma cert.</p>
              <p>furthermore, it is well-known that MI has weaker students as compared to other JCs, thus, what they teach is tone down, and therefore standards are lower. in the end, it is how you stand among the rest of the A level students that counts.</p>
              <p>MI might not be able to prepare you adequately for that purpose.</p>
              <p>it would be better to save the pain, and go straight to poly, and get a more useful diploma, which also command higher pay outside, lest you did not manage to make it to uni.</p>
              <p>and it would be good to check out jobs which you want to make a career of, and know what does the job requires.</p>
