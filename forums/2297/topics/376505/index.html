              <p>Alright I just got my prelim results and I can say that I did'nt do so well ( 19points -.-" )</p>
              <p>My results are as follows :</p>
              <p>English - B4</p>
              <p>Emaths - B4</p>
              <p>Science - C5</p>
              <p>Combine Humans - B4</p>
              <p>DnT - A2</p>
              <p>( Not in list - Chinese - C6 and Amaths - C6 )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Is it wise for me to use this 1 month to drive 1 subject all the way to A1? ( example, revise PURELY English day and night without or giving very little time to my other subjects )</p>
              <p>2. To those who has taken their O levels; which subject will be the easiest to score? As in which subject is certain to get at least A2 as long as I put in lots of effort into it ?</p>
              <p>To put it BLUNTLY, which subject no need study also can get distinction :/ ?</p>
              <p>3. Is the saying " Prelims are usually harder than 'O' levels itself " true ? With just 1 more month to go, is there hope for me to push my results from 19 to let's say 14 ?</p>
              <p>4. I'm still new to this forum so please pardon me on this. Is it alright to seek tuition here? As in let's say I want to buy tuition services and there's a tutor willing to tutor me in real life ( I can't find any tuition slots now, those near my area are already packed ). </p>
              <p>I don't know much about the " No advertising " thing here but if this is possible, I would like to seek any tutors out there interested to tutor me ( mainly Science ( phy/chem ) and maths ). Drop me a PM.</p>
              <p>I would gladly remove this part if this cannot be posted.</p>

              <p>I am a Chemistry Tutor, can't help you in the physics aspect though. But if you want, you can start of with the questions here <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/376501">http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/376501</a>. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Prelims are usually harder than 'O' levels itself", to a certain extent it is true. Depend on the standard of the paper set. Now it's not the time to dwell with which is harder which is easier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which subject(s) are you strong in. Though 'focusing' in purely one subject per day is not recommended by me, but I find it good for intensive revision sessions. Different students has their own ability in different subjects, I can't tell you which subject is easier for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need to put in effort is achieving in the subjects. There aren't any subject which you will attained distinction without consistence effort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not worried about your DnT though, but if you really want to make some A1/A2, perhaps you can work with your Emaths and Sci(Phy/Chem).</p>

              <p>do consider focusing on humans and maths as it is a subject required for both poly and jc courses.  yes eng fail can only go poly, with alot of restricted choices thou . if ur school average standard u get b4 most likely wont fail O lvs. unless u fark up xxx</p>

              <p>I understand your point i.e A1 for maths and sciences, but E8 for English. This happens quite commonly. I used to be like this too. Well, I can say that they are more of an analytical mind rather than the language person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For you, I would call you an all-rounded. Foundation is there, but still make mistakes some time. It's not a bad thing. What I can advice is.. Improve your English a little by practicing comprehension, and report writing format (know these format well ahead instead of last minute thing).</p>
              <p>For sciences, If you have doubts, Please post your questions here. You need to know the concepts well before you can attempt the TYS or any questions. Hammering the TYS isn't a wise solution at this stage. </p>
              <p>Buck up on your Concepts first, if you have questions or unsure about what the concepts is talking about, you can post it in this forum too. We have experts in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Engineering and the whole forum is your solutions. </p>
              <p>After you've know your concepts wells, then you can hit the TYS. This process is what I called "exposure to different types of questions", which is then your ultimate tools for preparing O level. </p>

              <p>Alright I just got my prelim results and I can say that I did'nt
              do so well ( 19points -.-" )</p>
              <p>My results are as follows :</p>
              <p>English - B4</p>
              <p>Emaths - B4</p>
              <p>Science - C5</p>

              <p>1. Is it wise for me to use this 1 month to drive 1 subject all
              the way to A1? ( example, revise PURELY English day and night
              without or giving very little time to my other subjects )</p>
              <p>2. To those who has taken their O levels; which subject will be
              the easiest to score? As in which subject is certain to get at
              least A2 as long as I put in lots of effort into it ?</p>
              <p>To put it BLUNTLY, which subject no need study also can get
              distinction :/ ?</p>
              <p>3. Is the saying " Prelims are usually harder than 'O' levels
              itself " true ? With just 1 more month to go, is there hope for me
              to push my results from 19 to let's say 14 ?</p>
              <p>4. I'm still new to this forum so please pardon me on this. Is
              it alright to seek tuition here? As in let's say I want to buy
              tuition services and there's a tutor willing to tutor me in real
              life ( I can't find any tuition slots now, those near my area are
              already packed ). </p>
              <p>I don't know much about the " No advertising " thing here but if
              this is possible, I would like to seek any tutors out there
              interested to tutor me ( mainly Science ( phy/chem ) and maths ).

              <p>your result is not that bad... Can get you to poly, which is not a bad route to take NOW.</p>
              <p>(although I am a single digit player) that is</p>
              <p>Maths and Science is simple. The tip is to work through the things that you that dont know and thats' it.</p>
              <p>Well can see that you are a nature, DnT guy. Some people tend to be better in certain subject than others. Just work towards the field you are naturally gifted in and you will be on your way to success.</p>

              <p><strong>not wise, that way you won't know what went wrong with your other subjects. You should spend time re-learning and practising on your weaker subjects.</strong></p>
