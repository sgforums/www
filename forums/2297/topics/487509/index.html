              <p>Hi I have decided to put Temasek poly Aerospace engineering as my first choice which I am likely to get as i am way below the cop. My goal is to go into University, possible NTU or NUS and get a degree in physics or Aerospace engineering. </p>
              <p>I want know ....</p>
              <p>1. What should i do now during my holidays so as to get a headstart in poly?</p>
              <p>2.How does GPA works? I do know that it is according to the module and test but how do they mark it? Is it according to something like the bell curve?</p>
              <p>3. Project work. I heard of many cases of 'backstabbers' and 'slackers'. What should i do if I have partners like this and how should i deal with them?</p>
              <p>4. Any other advice for me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any kind souls can help me on this? Thank you</p>

              <p>Others tips</p>
              <p>Practical works you cannot study practical so you must always attend your lab classes NEVER SKIP LAB CLASSES DON'T BE LATE listen careful everything to what the lecturer told you if you make mistake in your lab learn from your mistake and not sure what to do ask the lecturer till you 100% understand.</p>
              <p>You will get to learn analogue and digital electronic in 1st year those two are the primary module you need to understand 85% - 95% if you want to score well in your course because almost every other module in year 2 and 3 you will need them have relation to analogue and digital electronic.</p>
              <p>You must also score well in electrical principles or electrical circuit those two module are year 1 engineering foundation of engineering important modules they are like the core to engineering the foundation if you can understand 95% you won't have problem in year 2 or year 3.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if you have programming for engineering but i personally think it should have since almost all engineering course has programming. Programming is something you cannot study you must really understand and practice like maths you cannot study maths if you wanna be good in maths is when you understand the pattern keep practice till you understand the pattern same case as programming practice make perfect.</p>

              <p>If you have already enrolled in your poly course, get your time-table and are waiting for your lesson to start, depend on your module code from the time-table you can check with your poly's book store whether the module's textbook is already printed and you can buy them to study first. If you are those 'garang' type, then you can also visited your poly library to study their books and material.</p>
              <p>Finally if I remember correctly, if you are an poly student, you can access inside your student portal to check and study for the past year final year poly's examination papers and the latest are usually start from last year. You might like to go to your poly's library to request their staff to help you in exploring your portal. </p>

              <p>Engineering need to have good (strong) foundation on O level Advanced Mathematics. I have taken Engineering Mathematics 1 and I am now taking Engineering Mathematics 2B. There is a lot of Trigonometry, Exponential, Logarithm, ... in both Engineering Mathematics modules. </p>
              <p>It would be good if you have experience in doing soldering. When I just started my course last year April/May, I struggled through and made lots and lots of mistakes while doing soldering. Have to re-do and re-do again. Why? Because this was my first time doing soldering. Why? Because I did not take DnT at O level. Well, mine is in the school of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. All EEE students in my Polytechnic have to do soldering work once in a while (eg. every week). I am not sure if Aerospace Engineering students have to do soldering work or not.</p>
              <p>Whereas for Project work, in my nine months in Polytechnic so far, I have done many many many.. projects, in the name of "project", "assignment", "assessment", etc. basically, it's either individual or group. I know in this context you are referring to the group project. Well, just do your work in the project and make sure everything is recorded (eg. recorded in WhatsApp group, email, sms, minutes, notes-taking, etc.). If there are any disuputes, just show the evidence.</p>
              <p>One advice: Polytechnic life is about consistency. You have to work hard throughout. The moment you become complacent, that's it. It is tough, unless it becomes a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">habit</span></strong> to work hard. Your attitude has to be there right from the start and must maintain right all the way until you graduate three years later. </p>
              <p>That said, the key thing is how you prepare for the tests and examinations, and everything that is graded. Polytechnic is not always stressful. You have to do things at the right time. When it's time to study, you study. When it's time to play, you play. You got to set your priorities right. Spend at least some hours studying concepts on a regular day. On days when exams/tests are nearing, spend more/all hours on studying, do past tests/exams papers and clear all your doubts.\</p>
              <p>Bell curve? I am not sure about it. I do not think there is. You may want to ask the lecturers (in polytechnic, we call teachers 'lecturers') at your polytechnic about it. Personally, I believe everything is fair and meritocratic. Whether majority do well or majority do badly, the passing is always at 50%.</p>
              <p>Whereas for work, I would recommend administrative/office work because it may cultivate the habit of sorting things in order and submitting work of quality and on time. For example, a clinic assistant in a clinic, doing paper work in an office, etc. Doing administrative/office work may be a headstart because it may give a sense of how Polytechnic life may be like: meeting deadlines, meeting expectations, doing team projects, balancing work, study, life and play. Besides, admistrative/office work their pay is high (at least $6 per hour).</p>
              <p>Like I have said, you have to set your priorities right. If along the way you intend to seek employment, </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- have at least one entire day in a weekend (saturday and sunday) free to do homework, do revision, etc.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- totally do not work when exams/tests are near (within one or two weeks).</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- if you have school the next day, have at least two hours to study the day before.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Another advice: Have six to eight hours of sleep everyday. Drink two to three litres of plain/mineral water everyday.</p>
              <p>Then the other thing is clothes. To be honest, no one really cares what clothes you wear. Of course, if you are boy, do not wear girls' clothes. If you are girl, do not wear boy's clothes. Every polytechnic have their own T-shirt (with polytechnic name on it), but many people prefer to wear other T-shirts. Basically, the outfit most people wear is T-shirt and jeans. Normal ones will do. What matters is comfort.</p>
              <p>Still got what else... mmm..... oh yea. The food. I have visited TP before. TP canteen food is very cheap. Then still got what... the internet. SP students have free wifi (SPstudent) that usually runs at 65mbps. NP students have free wifi (NPwireless). I am sure TP has free wifi for students.</p>
              <p>Other than that... not sure if TP have or not, in SP, we have this e-learning portal where students can go online to download powerpoint slides and other lecture materials to do self-study. If need to contact lecturer, their email can be found at the e-learning portal and the student portal. </p>
              <p>Oh yea, speaking of which, if you need/want to contact (send email, send powerpoint slides, send word document, etc.) someone but you do not have their email, you can search for his email at the student portal and e-learning portal (if he is in the same class as you).</p>
              <p>Well, I'm not sure what else to write. </p>
              <p>Okay la. One more I can think of... the computer lab, IE lab, DE lab, etc... have free access, which means after school if you need to do lab work, you can go to labs with free access to do work.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all the best!</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">I highly doubt that there is a bell curve system in poly. The gpa is arranged according to performance scores. If you want 4.0 GPA,target for 80 and above.(highly possible for maths) Moderation may exist if the paper is too tough,then perhaps the bell curve may come into play.</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Slackers&gt;1.attack the person based on facts of slacking&gt;how many times he/she is late and miss so many deadlines.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">2.Set goals,expectations and objectives to pressure the slacker into working.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">3.Set up a reward system for the team.</p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Other advices:</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Take up a CCA.&gt;active way of destressing and relieving yourself,as opposed to staying at home and partaking at your own activities.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">&gt;A good opportunity to interact with others and work as a team(teamwork-based CCAs)</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Don't take up too many CCAs or time-draining CCAs.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">e.g. Dragon Boat&gt; 3 training sessions a week,which takes up the entire afternoon till early evening.By the time you go back home,you are too tired to do your assignments. One of the training days,may also require you to come back on weekends.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Don't just be a loner and study all day long&gt; Make some friends and hang out with them from time to time. You want a balanced lifestyle,not one that is tilted towards solely on academics</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Set deadlines for your assignments&gt; Don't do it last-minute,start immediately! If anything urgent happens,you will be able to complete your assignment on time.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Study with a group of motivated friends during exam periods(depends on individual)&gt;Research shows that one can retain 90% of what he/she learns by teaching others. So,you want to be able to interact and learn from each other to speed up your revision time.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Adding on to NanaHou Network comment on core foundations&gt; Don't throw away everything you learnt into the drain after each module. You can revisit them during holidays,etc. Some of them are very important for your future modules.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Learn to say no &gt; You don't want to be easily pushed around by peer pressure. Some times, peer pressure can be bad for you. That's when you have to say no!</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Don't burn out&gt;Have a day off every week and relax. Keep calm for that day and don't think about studies.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">All the best for your poly years!

              <p>Hi I have decided to put Temasek poly Aerospace engineering as
              my first choice which I am likely to get as i am way below the cop.
              My goal is to go into University, possible NTU or NUS and get a
              degree in physics or Aerospace engineering. </p>

              <p>Hello</p>
              <p>I am in the same situation as you in 2008. <br><br>However my path is slightly different from you, but i still manage to end up in NTU EEE. <br><br>From what i saw in TP's Diploma in Aerospace Engineering website, i think that this course is a mixture of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering. I come to this conclusion because there are modules like <span style="color: #ff0000;">Circuit analysis, Electronic Device &amp; Circuits, Aircraft Electronics and DIgital Systems</span>, and <span style="color: #ff6600;">thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, gas turbine engines, basic aerodynamics</span>. The ones in red are more electronics based, while the ones in orange are more mechanical based, thus it seems like a mixture of electrical and mechanical.</p>
              <p>However, from what i know, in NTU, the degrees are either "Mechanical based" or "Electrical and electronics" based. <br><br>Lets say you decide to apply for a EEE degree after getting the diploma, you may need to work harder in uni compared to your fellow classmates from a pure EEE diploma because they learnt more electrical stuffs. <br><br>If you decide to apply for a mechanical engineering degree, you may need to work harder compared to others who come from pure mechanical engineering diploma, because they may have learnt more stuff.</p>
              <p>The reason why i am sharing this is because i took almost same path as what you want take. I applied to Singapore Polytechnic's EEE, in year 2 i specialised in Aerospace Electronics. I learnt a bit of SAR-66 airworthiness stuff, aeronautical engineering science, thermodynamics fluids etc, and this results in me learning lesser electrical modules.</p>
              <p>In my first sem in uni, i wished i have taken a full EEE diploma. Even though it is not very important, but hope this will let you be more "mentally prepared" when you apply to uni 3 years later.</p>

              <p>1. Brush up on your A maths (if you have), be very very familiar with mathematical manipulations, like log, partial fractions, trigonometry(how to play the tricks to simplify equation), differetiation and integration(chain rule, product rule, integration by substitution, integration by partial fraction), algebra manipulations, probabilty and stats, matrices(inverse matric, determinant, cramer rules etc). Engineering maths will build on some of these.<br><br>2. A simple way will be to think as if you are an online store selling many products. Your store's overall rating will be called the GPA. Each product you sell will get a rating, how well the product get rated will determine on how well you did on your exam. How well the rating of this product affect your shop's overall rating will be determined by the "academic unit", the more the academic unit, the more it will affect.<br><br>So if you your shop sell 5 products, Product A,B,C,D,E. Product A,B,C have a high weightage while D and E have little weightage. If the rating for product A,B,C is very bad, your shop's overal rating will still drop even if product D and E gets very good rating.</p>

              <p>Laptop (Notebook) brand/model not important. Just make sure it is 64-bit (or at least 32-bit), and the other essentials are there.</p>
              <p>Software wise, the polytechnic will provide free to every student all the necesary software. </p>
              <p>I'm using a Acer aspire laptop with intel core 15. It is among the cheapest model for notebook, but I am using it relatively well, with windows 8.1 - that's why I say notebook brand/model not important. :)</p>

              <p>I will answer to each of the following chronologically. Number 2 qn I can't really help you figure because I'm not very particular into GPA points, you can ask for your closer siblings, family members, relatives, your trusted friends or your teachers directly</p>
              <p>1- I think the best time to do in the holidays is to find some things that is important to you first, what are the things that you find plesant and fullfiling to do; such as writing diaries to keep up with your languages, giving services to others, providing solutions and suggestions to those in needs online, or volunteering some events at meetup.com to enhance you interaction and significance</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- There are good and bad company all around us, those that are not too self centred, typically generous, compassionate, honest, specific and sincere to your acceptance, are those that you can count on. Even though the possiblity is slim for backstabbers, you should void those that are too active, meaning those who make a fun lot of out of you, either online or on the spot that can leave your emotions hurt or those who posseses an 'erotic' impulses type. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After all, you're still at a growing phase, don't relate to something that has not even happen. Cherish the moments and cheers!   </span></p>
