              <p>I think perhaps all of us students face this problem.</p>
              <p>Our science teachers gave us tons of papers to do, which is really good. But almost all of them do not include answer sheets. We have to go back school to mark what we do. The reason they offer is that we might sell the papers with answers to the bras basah vendors, who wld sell to the public, which is an infringement of copyright and unfair for the teachers that set the papers.</p>
              <p>I think this method of learning is really ineffecient. This effectively is lowering Singapore's ability to do well in O levels since almost alll the sec schools are affected. It would be much much more convenient if we had the answers at the back of the papers. Most importantly, cant MOE just sue the vendors or at least impose a penalty? MOE can definitely win a lawsuit since it is a big government organisation.</p>
              <p>What are your opinions? Or am i mistaken, and that there is really no cure to this situation.</p>
              <p>Enlighten me. Thanks</p>

              <p>That's where you're wrong. Schools are in a competitive state. Then what for do people send their students to good schools and not to other available schools. The only way to rank a school as good or bad is by the results the students score in standardized exams where everyone's questions are the same, i.e. O-levels.</p>
              <p>Even if the firm belief is that the teachers make the difference, the only way to measure this difference is by the school's annual O-level results.</p>
              <p>So obviously, any advantage one school has, in the way of exam papers and solutions, the school is going to jealously guard this advantage.</p>
              <p>But I must say, any school which is acting this way must be barely at the edge of being an average/good school. This school will want this kind of advantage to maintain their superiority or does not want it's secret out and end up like just another average school.</p>
              <p>But enough of these negative feelings. On the bright side, at least this policy also forces the students to work through the problem completely on their own. I remember when preparing for O-levels, i will always peep at the answer if i get stuck. Was quick to learn but never really built confidence to face difficult problems head on.</p>
              <p>Go with what your school requirements and after you leave, then be a judge as to the pros and cons of this kind of secrecy.</p>

              <p><br>Firstly Bras Pasar isn't the one that produces the paper. I've spoken with the owners. They have a "supplier". BP merely sells them.</p>
              <p>And speaking of which how would you know about BP? You sneaky turd... you bought from them, did all the papers and benefited from it and now youre suggesting a lawsuit against them?</p>
              <p>Finally everyone gets papers from school and can easily buy asessment books and stuff. Having the resource is one thing, and doing it is another thing.</p>
              <p>If just having papers would be like an elixir to scoring high marks, then alot of people will score straight As (atleast for prelims since O lvls has the bell curve)</p>

              <p>I have never brought from Bras Basah exam papers before. My school provides enough papers and i thank the school for that. How did i know of Bras Basah? As i have said in my post, thats BB is the reason my teachers dont include the answers.They say that scripts without answers have a big decrease in value. BB is prolly the big famous one. There are many other stores.</p>

              <p>The reason i actually have this complaint would be because i actually do the papers, and face problem in marking it. Also, the more important process is when you actually mark and learn from your mistakes.</p>

              <p>Don't worry. You don't have to spend a cent next year. I have collected 30ish sets of O level EM/AM and N level NA/NT prelims 2008 papers each... total of hundreds of papers (which I am still sorting out). Most of which come with answer keys. Freely available to everyone who send in a paper in pdf format which is not in my database. So if you still have those papers your teacher gave you. Keep them and send in to me in exchange for free access to my database.</p>

              <p>I am thinking of how to implement a sharing ratio system... such as can download 10 papers for every paper sent in. Why can't be just freely available to all? Let's just say for those papers I got from a teacher friend, I got to convert paper 1 &amp; 2 from doc format into pdf... then combine into 1 pdf. Rename the pdf files. And those I scan... have to scan, then combine jpg into pdf file, optimise for size... after that I got to upload, configure download system. The work in preparing the documents is approximately a day for every 20 sets.</p>
              <p>Now spread the work around and everyone just spend 30mins contributing a few sets of papers and everyone benefit.</p>
