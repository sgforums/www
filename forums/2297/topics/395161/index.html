              <p>Hey, Im only fifteen now. But im starting to get worried about my future JC. As i am bad in my academics. And i really do want to go into a jc no matter what, i just cant bring myself to go home and tell my parents that i ended up in a poly due to my poor academic.</p>

              <p>English, MT (Chinese), E Maths, POA, Humans (Geog and SS), and Combined Sciences(Physics and Chem).</p>
              <p>My english is weak. borderline fails all the time. My chinese is worse. My maths is usually around 50 to 60 Plus only. Same goes for my POA, my Geog also borderline pass. My SS usually fail. around 40 Plus, And both my sciences are borderline passes.</p>
              <p>Help! What should i do? Im really worried. </p>
              <p>Any tips on what should i do to improve my subjects? And my english? Like what books to read?</p>

              <p>Now, you are sec 3, right? There's a big leap from sec 2 to sec 3. Perhaps, that's the reason. Sec 3 is the period where CCA and studies clash together a lot. Tell you what. 5 time CCA pon 1 time. Use the 1 time to study damn hard.Pon 1 time wont make a difference in your CCA.</p>
              <p>If you are in good school, they purposely give harder than o level. the teachers will push you a lot in sec 4. If the school is bad, you gonna work out on your own liao plus a lot of hardwork.</p>
              <p>See your other mates and your friend in other schl. if it goes the same for them. If same, then no worries. Cambridge will pull up all marks. What you can do now is do your tys NOW, finish it before others</p>

              <p>hey, to be frank, from your post, i really dont encourage you to go to a jc..</p>
              <p>firstly, many people struggled with GP, which requires memorising of facts and strong english, if not you will really have a hard time with it..</p>
              <p>secondly, you are taking combined science right? the jump from sec school pure science to jc science is already a big one, so from combined science to jc science, it will be a even bigger one.. as for arts stream, good english is important..</p>
              <p>thirdly, you're not taking amaths, which may be a disadvantage for you if you go jc..</p>
              <p>is there any reason why you insist on going jc? because going poly isnt a bad choice either.. it doesnt matter where you go, what is important is your attitude..</p>
              <p>if you're really set your mind on jc life,  then work hard for it yea! make full use of the time you have left to o's.. </p>
              <p>all the best to you! =)</p>

              <p>Commenting on the subject regarding english, it is NOT impossible to improve vastly. If the command of english is not metacognitive to you(which means u learn english by 'feeling' it) ,you have to learn it by rote. Since you know that your english Sucks, try to express complex ideas in simple words. You would not be penalised in 'O' levels for doing that, so long there is varying sentence structures for your essays and you are grammatically sound. For now since you are Sec 3 , try to do a composition every once weekly for now (since you have CCA commitments and other commitments) , just do a essay and a comprehension under exam conditions and let your teachers grade it for you. Once you hit Sec 4 , increase the frequency to once a day. You should see an improvement in grades if u earnestly practice. Oh ya, Don't treat english as a subject ( in fact don't do that for the rest of ur subs) Learning has to be fun and alive for you to effectively grasp the mechanics behind it. ( No , i am not a Teacher) . This was what a tutee of mine did , and she jumped from C5 to A1 in the O's. Please learn a standard list of bombastic words so that you can sound more adroit in essay writing to your teachers.</p>
              <p>So if you dont get a crap of what i am saying , i am going to summarize it.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>1. Dont make any subject feel like a subject( whatever you studied is in fact the accumulation of mistakes and discoveries by our predecessors, so it is alive in a sense)</p>
              <p>2.During your Sec 3 year , try to attempt an essay and comprehension weekly. ( to be graded by your teachers)</p>
              <p>3. For christ sake , you can start improving your english by typing grammatically correct responses in  any sense of informal writing like your SMSes.</p>

              <p>i would prefer you to go for poly rather than jc. my cousin studying jc, always say he is very stress in school. in my poly years, i somehow feel more slack than stress <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> though there will be tons of project for you to do. but rather than just depend on one paper which determine you will pass or fail.</p>
              <p>English -you should start improving ur english by reading newspaper or storybooks. oh you need to do some practise on comprehension and compo. if you are going for jc, english is a very important subject you must pass very well with.</p>
              <p>MT (Chinese) - as far i  can remember, chinese paper is the first paper to be tested, and if you did badly, there will be second chance for you to retake it together with other subject. for chinese try use han yu pin yin to memorise what the words are called. Try read some chinese newspaper or storybook to improve your chinese. or if you are too lazy to do it, just watch some chinese drama with eng sub or english drama with chinese sub.</p>
              <p>E Maths - only word for you is to practise and practise. your teacher would give you some homeworks to do or give you revision before exam. just practise what you have learned in class until you have fully understood the concept.</p>
              <p>POA - poa is quite easy actually. just understand the format and knows where to put the amount will do. i think right now secondary school is using the type T account if i am not wrong.</p>
              <p>Humans (Geog and SS)- i didnt really took geog for olvl but in my secondary 2, i did score distinction because i memorise the all the theory part until my brain going to burst.</p>
              <p>Combined Sciences(Physics and Chem) - for physic, u need to understand the concept and not just memorise the formula. For chemistry,i did the opposite, i memorise the formula and the theory part. i believe practical test can help you score in o lvl also. when u you are doing practical in school, please do it seriously. you may not know it may appear in o lvl practical test</p>

              <p>From your description of your marks, I seriously and sincerely advise you to go poly.</p>
              <p>For whatever reasons that you want to go JC, the only and most productive way is to revise and revise for your current subjects. You have to develop this habit so that <em><strong>IF </strong>you make it to a JC, at least you have this habit to help you survive in JC.</em></p>

              <p>cut off for electrical course:10 points or less</p>
              <p>cut off for other courses:15 points or less depending on popularity and needs of industry</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>there is no way u can fail english ,its only comprehension and composition.</p>
              <p>maths is easy....just get 10 year series with all the answers worked out</p>
              <p>science is the toughest part......physics and chemistry.,,,,get 10 year series</p>
              <p>other 2 : chinese and another easiest subject to get marks.</p>

              <p>Dear <a href="/users/265975">qianhuiful</a>,</p>
              <p>Getting into poly is good. I know of students who are trying to get in but failed.</p>
              <p>You might be a late bloomer. That means you shine academically at a later stage. </p>

              <p>Agreed. If youre bloody smart, go to JC and become an elite. Otherwise, just settle for poly like the rest.</p>

              <p>Hello my advise to you is to try to visualize yourself at O levels and Alevels</p>
              <p>Maybe you will do well enough at O lvl but are you sure you can do well at Alvls?</p>
              <p>After A levels is uni admission and if you do badly at Alvls, you really has got nothing to fall back on.</p>
              <p>Besides,  at O's, the top elites has got IP so they will not take O lvl, but at A's they will be competing with you.</p>
              <p>So think about it.There is nothing wrong going to a poly</p>

              <p>Don't worry about JC. If you have try your best, but the achivement is still bad. You should comfort yourself you have tried your best. It is not necessary to feel sorry. But I want to give you some suggestions. First, you should put your concentration on class. The time in class is very important. When you listen to the teacher, you should try to remember what the teacher says and think about it at the same time. Don't forget take notes which you can review after class. second, you must ask you teacher questions which you don't know. Third you should arrange the time which you spend on your subject. The hardest should be given more time, but the easiest subject also should be give time but less. Or your achievement will be glide. By the way, don't review the content you have learned after a long time, or the familiar thing will become stranger to you.</p>

              <p>Hey, Im only fifteen now. But im starting to get worried about
              my future JC. As i am bad in my academics. And i really do want to
              go into a jc no matter what, i just cant bring myself to go home
              and tell my parents that i ended up in a poly due to my poor
              academic.</p>
              <p>The subjects i take are:</p>
              <p>English, MT (Chinese), E Maths, POA, Humans (Geog and SS), and
              Combined Sciences(Physics and Chem).</p>
              <p>My english is weak. borderline fails all the time. My chinese is
              worse. My maths is usually around 50 to 60 Plus only.
              Same goes for my POA, my Geog also borderline pass. My SS usually
              fail. around 40 Plus, And both my sciences are borderline
              passes.</p>
              <p>Help! What should i do? Im really worried. </p>
              <p>Any tips on what should i do to improve my subjects? And my
              english? Like what books to read?</p>

              <p>Just some advice, if you are to enter JC as a border-line student, and you remained as a border-line case, odds are you will be in worse state than a poly diploma holder once you finish your "A"s. </p>
              <p>Rather than worrying about JC/Poly, aim to get your grades up first.</p>
              <p>Adding on, never think of Poly as being inferior to JC - It is true that JC students have that advantage when it comes to entering local unis, but those who already have an aim can be better off in poly, as they learn what will be more relevant for their future job. </p>

              <p>you would be better off sticking to poly route.</p>
              <p>based on your current subject combination, which lacks pure science and A math, you are at a severe disadvantage. if you intend to enter science stream in JC, you would need pure sci and A math background, as demanded by most JCs.</p>
              <p>and not to mention that you need to score well for your o level, and get into a decent JC. It is widely understood that most of the local uni placings will go to the applicants from the top and elite JCs, and whats left is then given to students from lousier JC, (by order of merit) From what i heard, schools like raffles and hci have 60-70% of the cohort scoring 3 h2 As and above, and that amounts to like close to 1500 students? they will be the ones to clinch the most popular courses.</p>
              <p>if you end up in the bottom JCs, you have to work extra hard outside of the curriculum, as teachers would have to slow down their pace, in order to allow the weaker students to cope with the lesson progress. while students from top JCs are going full speed all the way.</p>
              <p>the school environment also plays a part. students from neighbourhood JCs may also tend to be more slack, and you might not realise that you are in bad company until its too late.</p>
              <p>to sum it all up, unless you can get into the top10 JCs, poly will be a better route to uni.</p>

              <p>Building on what Deathmaster has said, choosing the right JC is important. The better JCs have always had a good track record so it should not go wrong entering one of them.</p>
              <p>I don't know if its too early but in my opinion, I think you should really think hard about what you want to do in the future, because firstly, the subjects you choose in JC may affect the choice of your courses in University especially if you are in the Arts stream. Secondly, if there's a particular course you have in mind already, you may want to choose to go Poly instead. Studying at JC level is a far cry from O Levels, if you really have decided on a course and you meet the cut off point for the course, I don't think you should go through the entire JC rigour. </p>
              <p>Regarding your results, it is perhaps, as what AcidBoy has said, a ramification of the leap from Secondary 2 to Secondary 3. Nothing to worry about for the time being. But keep working hard and see if your results improves. If it does not, I suggest seeking a tutor, especially for English (because it is difficult to spot your own mistakes, especially for grammar errors, without someone pointing it out to you since it has already been ingrained in you from young). </p>
              <p>Also note that some JCs are only willing to offer you 1 H2 Science Subject if you take combined science. They may not even offer you H2 Maths if you do not have Additional Maths background. That's just what I've heard.  </p>

              <p>Hey, think u  should really pull up your grades first.<br>U didnt mention if u are intenting to enter the art or the science stream.</p>
              <p>Like mentioned above, no amaths = no H2 maths (unless u go YJC)<br>combine science students are only allowed 1 h2 (that is if u As the combine science)</p>
              <p>So with your current subject combination u are mostly going to be in the arts stream.And the courses available for them are...</p>
              <p>left with...</p>
              <p>Architecture, industrial design, project &amp; facilities management, real estate.</p>
              <p>Art, design and media, arts&amp;social sciences,  social sciences, chinese, communication studies, economics, english, linguistics&amp;multilingual studies, psychology, sociology and sports science&amp;management.</p>
              <p>U can X all the law, medcine, business...(unless u can straight A)</p>
              <p>and science courses since u wont have 2 sciences.</p>
              <p>It looks alot? dun forgot there are about what 20 JCs fighting for it.<br>V disadvantaged compared to those taking two sciences...</p>
              <p>suggest u dun close door to poly.<br>JC life is much MUCH MUCH tougher than secondary.</p>
