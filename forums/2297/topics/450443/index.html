              <p>Good, you have done the first step. Now try to refer to this thread.</p>
              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/447330">http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/447330</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The key words/phrases that you have highlighted are: Fast food restaurants, popular among Singaporeans of all ages, affect their future health, made healthier and more appetising.</p>
              <p>The statement implies that fast food are unhealthy and long term consumption of fast food may poses health problems. Your tasks is to explore the options and possibilities of how these fast food can be made healthier and more appetising.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you know about fast food and fast food restaurants? They are processed food. Food preparation technique wise, most use deep frying method because it's fast (that's why it's call fast food =P). Find out more about generally how fast food restaurant prepare their food, you can list down...</p>
              <p><br>What you don't know --&gt; How eating fast food may cause health problems in the long run. What are common types of health problem associated with fast food? At what age group particularly susceptible to such problems?</p>
              <p><br>Why you need to find out is how to make fast food healthier, appetising, and appealing. Try exploring the food preparation techniques and offer a more viable means of preparing food. Making food look appetising --&gt; your creativity using food as an ingredient. My suggestion is add in more whole and real food.</p>

              <p>Hello smiley,</p>
              <p>Im sure Darkness_Hacker99 have given you a very good idea and concept on how you can do your coursework.</p>
              <p>Are you doing "O" levels F&amp;N?<br> I did F&amp;N back in 2008, and you can download my coursework here: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/ai6vrwch6y7csd5/sgForums_FNN_Sample.pdf">http://www.mediafire.com/file/ai6vrwch6y7csd5/sgForums_FNN_Sample.pdf</a><br><br>Feel free to use any information you found useful in my coursework, but please do not copy and paste entirely, as they may do plagarism checks, and that may cause you to fail this subject. <br><br>Also I did not get an "A" for this subject as my coursework is not perfect, so don't follow too closely, always clarify with your teacher if you have any doubts.</p>
              <p>In the file i uploaded you can see how i did my TA, Priority List, R&amp;D etc..</p>
              <p>I believe what your friend meant by opening up more is that you need to link further(you can use the who what when where why how questions to help you), for example:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fast food restaurants</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>What are the major restaurants? eg. mcdonald, long john silver, kfc, etc</li>
              <li>How they manage to cook so fast? eg. <span style="color: #ff0000;">deep frying, using frozen/process food</span><br></li>
              <li>They share common <span style="color: #ff0000;">cooking methods</span> like the above. <br><span style="color: #ff00ff;">From here you can expand the above informations, like:</span><br>Deep frying is bad for health due to the excessive use of <span style="color: #ff0000;">oil </span>in cooking, during cooking, the food soak up the oil, etc.... <br><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Again, you see the keywords coming out(eg. oil), then you can continue opening up more things to say:<br><span style="color: #000000;">Oil are divided into many types, such as butter, vegetable oil etc. It is also known as fats, fats have adv/disadv trans fats are bad for health<br>What are trans fats? then exlpain again in your research.</span></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cooking methods, which are healthy/unhealthy? <br></span></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People of all ages</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Diff age group need different nutritient levels, you can take a sample of mcdonald's nutrition facts label, and then since mcdonald deep fry things, you can take a nutrition fact label of kfc and compare here and there.</li>
              <li>List wad nutrients diff age group need. Like teenagers need to eat more of _____ than elderlies. <br>Again, take another fast food resturant's nutritient fact label and see if it meets people of all ages(even if they do, just say they lack a bit of calcium/vitamin A  etc)<br><br>From here, you can see what are the nutrients that are lagging, and then you can look through what vegetable/meat/fruit contain the vitamins, and then start planning your meal. <br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Lastly, this is what i cooked for my practical if you are interested:<br><img src="http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg21/MyPillowTalks/FNN/DSC02834.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="334"><br>Recipe included in the coursework.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, your teacher is just scary you about the dropping of subject, my teacher keeps threatening to fail our whole class also</p>
              <p>Feel free to post here again if you have any questions</p>
