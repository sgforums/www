              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>For every 1L bought, 200ml will be given free. Hence, she will have 1.2L instead of 1L.</p>
              <p>1L + 200ml = 1.2L</p>
              <p>10L / 1.2L = 8 and 1/3 packets, which should be rounded up to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>9</strong></span> packets.</p>
              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>Since 1kg of fish cost as much as 3/4kg of prawns, 4kg of fish will cost as much as 3 kg of prawns.</p>
              <p>Hence, 2kg of prawns + 3kg of prawns = 5kg of prawns cost SG$60.</p>
              <p>1kg of prawns cost $60/5 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>$12</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>A model diagram will be needed for this question. I will explained it later if no one else does so.</p>
              <p>Q4.</p>
              <p>Not enough information. I could be mistaken though, given that I am on flu medication now.</p>
              <p>Q5.</p>
              <p>Another model diagram question.</p>
              <p>Q6.</p>
              <p>A speed-time line will be good for this question.</p>
              <p>Amount of distance travelled by tortoise in 1 and a half hour will be amount of distance travelled by rabbit in half an hour.</p>
              <p>Mr rabbit took 1 and a half hour to travel the same distance as what will take the tortoise 4 and a half hours.</p>
              <p>Hence, Mr tortoise will reach kent ridge at 9am + four and a half hours = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.30</strong></span> pm.</p>
              <p>Q7.</p>
              <p>Another model diagram question.</p>
              <p>Cost of tickets for 5 adults = $15 X 5 = $75.</p>
              <p>Cost of tickets for 8 children = $10 X 8 = $80</p>
              <p>Total cost = $155</p>
              <p>Amount of sets of 5 adults and 8 children = $620/ $155 = 4 sets</p>
              <p>Amount of children = 4 sets X 8 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>32 children</strong></span></p>
              <p>Q8.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Amount of red cube = 1 red cube.</p>
              <p>Using the ratio to compare,</p>
              <p>Amount of yellow cubes = 3 X 3 X 3 = 27 yellow cubes</p>
              <p>Amount of green cubes = 2 X 2 X 2 = 8 green cubes</p>
              <p>Total amount of cubes = 27 + 8 + 1 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>36</strong></span> cubes.</p>
              <p>Q9.</p>
              <p>10% of girls = 5 children</p>
              <p>Amount of girls at first = 5 X 10 = 50 children</p>
              <p>Amount of boys at first = 120 - 50 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>70</strong></span> boys.</p>

              poured to <strong style="font-weight: bold;">A</strong>so that
              the amount of water in <strong style="font-weight: bold;">A</strong> was doubled. After these
              pourings, the barrel each contained 20 litres of water. How many
              litres of water were in the Barrel <strong style="font-weight: bold;">A</strong> at first?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Hi</span></p>
              <p>Use working backwards, you should be able to get 25 litres for
              barrel A in the beginning.</p>
              <p>Play around, A --- 25 , B --- 15 , then A --- 10 , B --- 30 and
              finally, A --- 20, B --- 20</p>
              <p>Have fun</p>

              <p>Thank you baiyun for the correction. I just had my dinner, and is feeling better after some medication.</p>
              <p>On a side note, it seems that a lot of people are down with flu lately, I just hope it has nothing to do with H1N1. Get well soon too, Mr Wee.</p>

              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Blue      l__l__l__l = &gt; 3 units</p>
              <p>Yellow  l__l__l = &gt; 2 units</p>
              <p>Since there are 100 more blue balls than yellow balls, 1 unit = 100 balls.</p>
              <p>Total number of balls = 5 units = 5 X 100 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>500</strong></span> balls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q5.</p>
              <p>Tom  l__l__l__l__l__l__l</p>
              <p>Jerry l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l</p>
              <p>Tom has 3/5 as much as Jerry.</p>
              <p>If Tom gives Jerry $150,</p>
              <p>Tom l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l</p>
              <p>Jerry l__l__l__l__l__l__l__l</p>
              <p>Hence, 3 units = $150, and 1 unit = $50</p>
              <p>Amount that Tom has = 6 units = 6 X $50 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>$300</strong></span></p>
