              <p>H2 are ur main subjects that you choose to study so science subjects for those who wants to enter the science stream and humans subject for those who wants to enter the arts stream.</p>
              <p>H1 has to be a contrasting subject so a science for the arts students and a humans for the science students.</p>
              <p>H3 is a sort of an advanced level of that subject which is for those who did well in their H2 subject during promos and can consider taking H3 in their J2 year. H3 is sort of similar to uni level 1st yr courses.</p>

              <p>Hi Audi,</p>
              <p>Do allow me to share with you some information about Junior Colleges. Subjects are separated into H1, H2, and H3 levels, with the first being the easiest and the last being the toughest.</p>
              <p>Subjects can be grouped into Science or Arts subjects, with economics being an exception, as it can be taken as both a Science and a Arts subject.</p>
              <p>Some Junior Colleges do allow a student to take two Science subjects along with two Arts subject, but generally speaking, all students are expected to have a contrasting subject. For example, if you take three subjects from the Science side, you must have a subject from the Arts side.</p>
              <p>ACJC students who take up the IB programme has a very different curriculum though, which you can read more about from here:</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme</a></p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme"></a>The subjects taught in JCs are roughly the same as those in Secondary School, though there are some special subjects, especially those offered by VJC, which are unique to the post-secondary level.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>There are alot of degrees offered by unis so its not possible to list them all out.</p>
              <p>A bachelor degree is the degree you will get when you go uni after JC/poly while a masters is a higher level degree after bachelor followed by a phd at the top.</p>
              <p>Not all uni offers honours which is generally 1 extra year over the general bachelor degree. All NTU degrees are honours degree while for NUS its generally the top ~25% who are allowed to go on to do their 4th honours year.</p>
              <p>There are 4 classes of honours. 1st, 2nd upper, 2nd lower, 3rd class honours with 1st class being the best. Dean's list is something like the honours roll where the top 5% of each sem who meet a certain GPA is allowed to be on the list.</p>
              <p>The number of people in a course varies depending on the course. Some courses can have less than a 100 yet some others can have close to 1000 students.</p>
              <p>Intakes for medicine and law should be rather small. U should check NUS website on how many places are available each year.</p>
              <p>Arts and social science depends on which course you major in. If you do geog, hist, lit etc, its more likely you will go to be a teacher since career choices are limited in those courses but pyschology, sociology, econs majors etc have a slightly wider pool of jobs to choose from.</p>

              <p>Hi Audi,</p>
              <p>When a person take up a university course, he or she will start off with the Bachelor Degree course. Upon completion of it, he or she proceed to take up the Masters Degree Course. With the completion of the Masters Degree course, he or she will be able to take up the Doctorate course. Do note some outstanding students are able to bypass the Masters Degree after completing their Bachelor Degree, and take up the Doctorate directly.</p>
              <p>When a person completes his or her Bachelor Degree course, depending on his or her results, he or she may be given a Honours along with the Bachelor's Degree. The honours given are as followed, from highest to passing:</p>
              <p>1) First Class Honours </p>
              <p>2) Second Upper Class Honours</p>
              <p>3) Second Lower Class Honours</p>
              <p>4) Third Class Honours</p>
              <p>5) Pass with Merit ( Not always applicable, depends on the degree course itself )</p>
              <p>6) Pass</p>
              <p>In universities, the grading system is similar to that of polytechnics. Each module, which is like a mini-course, will have a certain number of Academic Units (AU), which represent the number of hours the module has in a week. Depending on one's results, a grade will be given for each module, and a certain amount of points will be attached to the grade.</p>
              <p>For example, a student who gets an "A" will have the maximum possible points of 5.0, whereas a student who gets an "A-" will have 4.5 points. </p>
              <p>The CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) will be a calculation of the points you receive for each module, and the number of Academic Units for each module. It is also the main factor in deciding which Class of Honours an undergraduate will receive upon graduation.</p>
              <p>As for the Dean List, besides being the top 5%, there are usually other criteria which varies from faculty to faculty. For example, a faculty may require students to also have at least 15 AUs and a SPA (Semester Point Average) of at least 4.5 for a student to be in the Dean List for that particular Semester. For certain universities, the Dean List is compiled annually, thus requirements may be based on the entire study year instead.</p>
              <p>For different courses, there are different amount of undergraduate intake. For example, Dentistry allows an intake of only roughly 40 undergraduates whereas Medicine allows an intake of about 300 undergraduates. Thus, for dentistry, there will only be at most 2 people on the Dean List, whereas for Medicine, there will be a maximum of 15 undergraduates on the Dean List</p>
              <p>I hope this answers your query.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

                  to do their 4th honours year.</p>
              <p>There are 4 classes of honours. 1st, 2nd upper, 2nd lower, 3rd
                  class honours with 1st class being the best. Dean's list is
                  something like the honours roll where the top 5% of each sem who
                  meet a certain GPA is allowed to be on the list.</p>
              <p>The number of people in a course varies depending on the course.
                  Some courses can have less than a 100 yet some others can have
                  close to 1000 students.</p>
              <p>Intakes for medicine and law should be rather small. U should
                  check NUS website on how many places are available each year.</p>
              <p>Arts and social science depends on which course you major in. If
                  you do geog, hist, lit etc, its more likely you will go to be a
                  teacher since career choices are limited in those courses but
                  pyschology, sociology, econs majors etc have a slightly wider pool
                  of jobs to choose from.</p>

              <p>Just to share, a PHD ( Doctor of Philosophy ) is the most common form of doctorate, but there are also other forms of doctorate such as LLD ( Doctor of Laws ), ScD ( Doctor of Science ), EdD ( Doctor of Education ) ... etc.</p>

              <p><br> again, you're wrong. It's not ACJC which offers the IB. It's
                      ACS(I). ACJC only has an an A-level programme.</p>

              <p>Hi Lee012lee,</p>
              <p>Thank you for the clarification and sharing. I initially thought that a PhD in Medicine is offered in NUS as it is stated here that Graduate students will graduate with a MSc or a PhD degree:</p>
