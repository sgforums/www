              <p>How is your English results? How good is your memory work? And most importantly, are you more interested in Literature or History?</p>
              <p>Upper Sec Literature is quite different from that of Lower Sec, thus ppl who done generally well for Lit in Lower Sec might not do so for Upper Sec.</p>

              <p>Hi Joanne, </p>
              <p>Having studied Literature for 2 years, how do you find it? Do you like the subject? I will advice that you take the subject only if you have an interest in it, and knows that you will be able to handle it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you feel that you will not do as well if you take up History, which is highly memory-based, and that you do not like Literature, you may wish to consider other Humanities subjects such as Geography or Social Studies.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>Erm. No.</p>
              <p>Look at the H1/H2 Geography requirements now. You can take Geography in JC without having taken it in Secondary School...</p>
              <p>i.e. secondary school literature is just as useless as secondary school geography in terms of having a headstart on the subject for JC.</p>
              <p>So the best advice we can give TS now is, take it only if you are good at it and/or if you like literature.</p>

              <p>halooooo</p>
              <p>i took elective lit. cause i liked it.</p>
              <p>and yes, lower and upper sec lit  a lot a lot of difference.</p>
              <p>maybe for lower lit ur essay write 1 or 1.5page but upper lit  sometime requires 3 ~ 4 pages ?</p>
              <p>so yea. take it only if u like it. perhaps u wan take pure, just in case u find u canot cope with lit.</p>

              Thanks for all the posts.(:
              It helped me, but I still have no idea if I should take Literature.
              I mean, I guess I like Literature, but I'm not sure if i'm able to cope with it. Thanks!

              <p>Neither will you know for sure whether you can cope with any of the other humanities subjects. However, the most important thing is your interest in Lit, which is missing from the other subjects.</p>
              <p>Anyway, passion is one thing, but remember, commitment is the most important thing.</p>
