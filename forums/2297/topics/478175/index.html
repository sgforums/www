              hi, i am a student from nus and i went through the jc path like u. 
              
              to be honest, i think u are making a mountain out of a molehill. i mean fine, you have your goals and expectations to meet. but trust me, many years down the road, your o level results or your jc wont really matter. 
              
              or rather let me phrase it in a different way. whether you get into the course of your choice in uni will not depend on which jc you come from. rather, it would be how well you do in your A levels (and university interview for course like law, med and dentistry) and every jc student fight on the same level of place field. 
              
              you can think about it this way. everyone starts at the same starting point during the "jc race". different jc means u are at different lane but ultimately, everyone runs the same distance. everyone got to put in the same effort
              
              so yup, go out and enjoy while you can. A levels is a tough nut to crack. your 2 years in jc wont be as easy as sec school.

              <p>Think of it as a big fish in a small pond. If you are the best student heading for "lousier" schools, no doubt that the staff there will invest hugely on you because you are the so called "prized one" and is heading to do the school proud. </p>

              <p>Hi Hotcookiescream, I understand what you're saying. I've looked through NUS and NTU IGP, and my friend who went through both a levels and poly have offered me advice too. I'm now convinced that either way is possible for the same results. I was just heartened with the fact that I will most possibly not make it to my dream school. Alright moving on, I'm more inclined to go for poly. I'm taking time to look through modules and although the good courses are very attractive to me, it seems like it'll also be harder to score. Honestly, I'm attracted to being 'looked up' as a student from a good sch/course, but I guess that does not help w offering me a great future LOL.</p>
