              <p>Okay, so i am having a rlly hard time now trying to decide on whether i shld drop to combined science or not, posting on this forum is like one of my last few resorts of gaining advices! Constructive advices would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!                                                                                              </p>
              <p>So to start off, i take pure phy, pure chem, amath, pure hist and hmt. I have alr taken my normal chinese olevel last year, which I've obtained an A1. Recently, for my prelims 1, i did badly and that is why i am comtemplating on whether i shld drop to combined sci or not. I got 26 for my L1R5 this prelims. Well, math and humanities are not my concern, because i am pretty sure that i will be able to do well for them in the olevels. I just need to brush up some skills and start studying harder. My major concern is the 2 pure sci. In my sch, they are constantly encouraging us to drop subjs, thus the friends ard me are either dropping their pure humanities or their pure sciences. That is also why I am even more confused on what to do because of the pressure from sch and influence from my peers.                                                    </p>
              <p>I have been failing pure phy since sec 3 but i am starting to show some improvements through the class tests in sec 4. I've either got a B or at least pass all the class tests this year. But for this prelims, I got a F9. For chem, i've been failing it since the mid of sec 3. I do pass some class tests, but it is always borderline passes. Same for failing, i've always failed chem by a few marks. And for this prelims, i got an E8. I know that my friends and teachers have been asking me to drop to combined sci, but it is not in favour of my own or my parents' decision.                                                                                                                  </p>
              <p>I dont intend to pursue a sci course in future whether in poly, jc or uni. But i am rlly keen in getting into a JC. Hopefully either SAJC or SRJC. In the counting of L1R5, i need not count in any of my sciences because i have enough subjs and counting in a sci is not a must, so getting Cs for my sciences in olevels would not be much of a big concern. As stupid as i may sound, i would rlly rlly like to hold on to my pure sciences but i am just afraid of the comdems i may get and that I may not even pass them in the olevels. I am willingly to work rlly hard for the last 5 months, and hopefully at least get a B for one of them. I am also concerned that if i drop to combined sci, one of my sci would definately pull down my overall marks. So i would rather stick to pure sci. Cos if i screw up one of it, it will only affect that subj.                            </p>
              <p>So yeah, that is all that i have to say. And i would like to know your views. Pls also advice me on what shld i do! Thank you so much! (:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P/S. I got a total of 4 bonus point with my cca point and hmt. If this info helps.</p>

              <p>You got to decide for yourself. Just reminding you of the pros and cons, of dropping to combined science :</p>
              <p>Pro : Easier to get better grades, due to easier content and more forgiving bell-curve.</p>
              <p>Cons :</p>
              <p>#1 - You need a minimum of 'A1' or 'A2' grade for combined science, to be eligible to take H2 Science in JC.</p>
              <p>#2 - In combined (phys + chem) science, one of your subjects might pull down the other.</p>
              <p>If you're going Poly or JC Arts, you have more reason to drop to combined science. If you're going JC Science, then it's a toss up between the Pro and Cons I mentioned above. </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>If you can afford it, please go for tuition. Only 4+ months left to your 'O' levels.</p>
              <p>I provide only 'A' level JC H2 Chemistry tuition, while ChemGuide (Mr Chong) provides both 'O' level and 'A' level Chemistry tuition. Give him a call?</p>

              <p>Thank you for your prompt reply! </p>
              <p>I may have forgot to mention, but I am hoping to get into a hybrid course in JC. Which means one sci and one humans. So I guess sticking to pure sci would help?</p>
              <p>Pls advice. Thank you!</p>

              <p>Not really, either way.</p>
              <p>What would definitely help, is that you get your A1 grade, whether it is combined science or pure science, is much less important.</p>
              <p>Again, it goes back to the Pros and Cons mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>It's easier to score A1 in combined science, but you've also recognized the risk that one of your sciences might pull down the other, in combined science.</p>
              <p>If you can get <a href="http://olevelpurechem.blogspot.sg/">Mr Chong</a> to tutor you, whether it's combined science or pure chemistry, you would stand a much better chance of getting your A1 grade.</p>
