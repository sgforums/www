              <p>I have a junior, who has finished SPM (Malaysian O Level Equivalent) in November 2016, results to be posted in March 2017. </p>
              <p>She applied for the scholarship last year with her Malaysian Secondary 4 results and gotten the ASEAN scholarship. (The tested SPM syllabus is completion of Secondary 4 and 5 (No Express Stream here))</p>
              <p><em>*updated* </em>Apparently she got into TPJC (just knew a few days ago), after getting accomodation somewhere at Bedok Angilcan House, not Raffles' Place.</p>
              <p>Is the school given to the scholars fixed by MOE? Will there be a chance of appeal to better JCs like VJC, RI, HCI, NJC or even NYJC?</p>
              <p>This is her results for Sec 4 and 5:<br><img src="https://snag.gy/HgU9ZW.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Mathematik - E-maths<br>Mathematik Tambahan - A-Maths<br>Fizik - Physics<br>Kimia - Chemistry<br>Biologi - Biology</p>

              <p>I'm not sure how is the process by the Singapore MOE for their selections of students.</p>
              <p>But this girl is quite bright, hopefully she might can still come out with 4 As in PCME combo in TPJC. If not it is a real waste of good talent. </p>
              <p>Are facilities provided by JCs in Singapore fixed? Like Recording during Lectures, using of Slides/Notes with annotations in the video? Prelims and Tutorials given to students.</p>
              <p>As in Malaysia, these type of facilities aren't valid even in overpriced private universities, and some of them still using the Coursebook, extract and copy main points on board and explain method.</p>
              <p>Students here some are heavily reliant on external tuition classes, as secondary school here, not all teachers are dedicated, and most core syllabus stuff learnt is quite redundant and pointless, as most teachers are focused on the "weaker" groups, draging behind the brighters ones in secondary school.</p>
              <p>Also, compared to what I've been through studying Cambridge A-Level here in Malaysia, I rather let her stay in TPJC, than moving back to Malaysia joining private A-level colleges here (Malaysia's Sixth Form(STPM) is not popular for most local students because the lack of proper checking in papers). </p>
              <p>As, she is considering dropping her ASEAN scholarship, to move back to Malaysia to join another Private College for Cambridge A-Level, and reapply to NTU, NUS for her undergraduate degree.</p>

              If she really wants to, she can personally visit the other JCs with all her documents to request a transfer these few days (ie. before lessons begin), although the chances are very low (even if she's using Singapore O level results, let alone she's using Malaysian SPM results).<p>Advise her stay on in TPJC, it's an ok JC, and if she finds the 1 hour MRT + bus travelling time from Raffles Place to TPJC too long, then she'll just have to try to find accommodation nearer to TPJC.</p><p>Every JC teaches differently using different materials (lecture notes and tutorial questions), newly prepared every year by the JC's Department (eg. Chemistry) teachers.</p><p>Remind her to post here on SgForums if she needs help with her H2 subjects, eg. H2 Chemistry.

              Whether she go TPJC or VJC, it'll be convenient for her to come my BedokFunland JC, if she ever decides she wants H2 Chemistry tuition ;)
