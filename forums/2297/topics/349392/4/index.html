              <p>Dear students,</p>
              <p>  I understand how you feel about your bleak future given a not-so-desirable A-level result. Go on to embrace your worry, uncertainty, disappointment, sadness, etc. for a short while, and pick yourself up when you are ready to move on and take the next step.</p>
              <p>  I would strongly encourage you to try to apply for the courses you want to study (despite the odds of not getting them and that you may have to appeal) and ponder hard over feasible alternatives as well. Alternatives could be your other interest areas (or strengths you may have) or routes that may take a slightly longer time for you to achieve your ambitions. Always remember that what matters ultimately is that you reach your destination(s) eventually.</p>
              <p>  Let me share with you a nice quote from the book 'The Alchemist' which has given me much inspiration and optimism ever since I left the teaching service to walk a path that is less trodden: 'When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it'.</p>
              <p>  Jiayou and stay hopeful always, thanks!</p>
              <p>P.S. I strongly encourage you to read 'The Alchemist'. I have the softcopy, which I'll be happy to share with you (thus you save $$$) via email. Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              ive got a few questions about engineering.
              
              what's common engineering? do we get to specialise after first year, that is, specialise into mechanical, civil, electrical, bio, etc. do we have to choose which engineering course we want to take from the first year onwards or do all students take common engineering first then specialise into the various courses?
              
              are engineers, like accountants, most likely not be out of job, even in a recession?
              
              say student A graduated with an arts degree and student b graduates with an engineering degree and assuming the economy is doing as bad as it is now, is it true that student b has higher chance of being employed?
              
              thanks!

              so unless you know which engineering course you want in first year, you choose common engineering correct?

              <p>Just to let you guys know, I got ADD/C for my 'A' levels (not this year's) &amp; I got into NTU Engineering only after appealing. Even then, it still wasn't that easy as the faculty called me up for an interview by the professors! </p>
              <p>So for those who didn't do exactly too well, I hope this serves as an "inspiration" in a way? (P.S. I think this only applies to NTU Engineering only. I think NUS Engineering would be tougher or almost impossible...)</p>

              <p>so unless you know which engineering course you want in first
              year, you choose common engineering correct?</p>
              <p>but wont those who choose common engineering be slower than

              <p>Yes, at least in NUS case common engineering students will be slower if they go on to Industrial and Systems, Chemical or Biomedical. But only slightly slower by one or two modules.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I need some advice. I'm interested in taking
                  Electrical Engineering but am unsure of whether to go for NTU or
                  NUS. I've checked out their module but it's like almost the same to
                  me. Can anyone offer me any advice or maybe the differences between
                  the 2? Anyway my grades are B for GP and A for the others.</p>

              <p>I think you can look at factors like distance or lifestyle to help you decide. I think it is too close to call either. I know for a fact that NUS common engineering modules of C programming, maths and basic electrical engineering are tougher than the NTU counterparts (when I compare notes with NTU friends). Also it is "harder" to score in NUS(comparing CAP/GPA among my circle of NUS NTU friends) because everyone's A levels results are better and the insane amount of foreigners. But in conclusion, NUS and NTU still hard to differentiate, except for material science and Eng(NTU confirm better!).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm personally from NUS Industrial and Systems Eng, anyone interested in the course or NUS engineering in general I will try to help. </p>

Heard alot of ppl saying that ntu's eng. courses are more focused on prac while nus's is more on theory?  And.. lots of ppl are advising me against taking elec. eng. cause of bad employmen prospect...

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Do read the employment page and have a feel of what jobs are hot at the moment.</p>
              <p>  Do stay abreast with current affairs to understand what Singapore is focusing on presently and what technologies are emerging on a global basis.</p>
              <p>  From what I know, nanotechnology, defence science, aerospace, tourism and hospitality, green energy &amp; energy conservation, aged care and management are in the rage.</p>
              <p>  Thanks and good luck in your application!</p>
              <p>P.S. Please remember your H2 mathematics (complex numbers, applications of differentiation, applications of integration, sequences and series, differential equations, probability and statistics) because the knowledge will be required again in your foundational engineering maths in year 1 both in NUS and NTU.</p>

              <p>I think it's gonna be pretty hard for you with ADD/C to even enter NUS common eng, unless you can make an appeal based on a special talent or something.</p>

              <p>Electrical engineers are still very sought after, both in the public and private sectors. All my friends from EE, graduated June 2008. ranging from 3rd class to 1st class honours, found jobs.</p>
              <p>But it also depends on your area of specialisation.</p>
              <p>Do your own research and trust your stats. Also, study your interest, don't study for the market. The market changes after you exit; if you are a guy, it's 6 more years to go. Even for girls, it's 4 more years. Many things can change.</p>
