            <div class='col-md body'><p>Oh yeah! What are the components of blood that prevents entry of microorganisms? I wrote fibrin threads and RBCs (since they're part of a clot) at first but changed them to fibrinogen and white blood cells. Since fibrin threads aren't part of the blood but are formed from soluble fibrinogen, which is part of the blood. And since there's phagocytosis and production of antibodies by white blood cells which kill foreign bacteria... But I'm not sure if they'll accept white blood cells since it doesn't BLOCK microorganisms from entering the body but rather prevents them from spreading. I just thought RBCs was a little lame for an answer :P</p></div>

              <p>Oh yeah! What are the components of blood that prevents entry of
              microorganisms? I wrote fibrin threads and RBCs (since they're part
              of a clot) at first but changed them to fibrinogen and white blood
              cells. Since fibrin threads aren't part of the blood but are formed
              from soluble fibrinogen, which is part of the blood. And since
              there's phagocytosis and production of antibodies by white blood
              cells which kill foreign bacteria... But I'm not sure if they'll
              accept white blood cells since it doesn't BLOCK microorganisms from
              entering the body but rather prevents them from spreading. I just
              thought RBCs was a little lame for an answer :P</p>
