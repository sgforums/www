Why do birds not get electrocuted when they fly onto those high overhead electrical cables which carry large amounts of current?</div>

Thus, electrons come out of negative terminal and go to positive terminal. </div></blockquote>To add on, there's such a thing called electron drift velocity. It is the speed at which electrons move through the wire, and is usually &lt;1 cm/s. The reason why it moves so slowly is because what you have learnt that metal is a lot of +ve ions in a sea of electrons is a wrong model. This will be learnt further in A levels or uni (not sure), or in physics olympiad/physics S.<br><br>Why do electrical equipments start immediately when u turn on the switch? The main reason is because the electrons moving at the start caused other electrons to move by electrostatical repulsion, and this repulsive force is extremely fast. Hence, all the electrons in the wire will start moving at around the same time... This is a very simplified explanation by the way...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ispyyy:</div><div class="quote_body">If u r just using fomular, potiential difference means voltage...<br><br>If u want to noe more, then u will need to imagine...<br>Why do we need to know the difference???<br>Coz, to understand the movement of all universal things...<br><br>For example,<br>Wind - Air will move from cold to hot<br>Committing suicide - Suicider will move from high ground to low ground<br>Current - Move from lower potiential ground to higher potiential ground<br>Human - Move from low paying job to high paying job<br><br>Still dont understand???
