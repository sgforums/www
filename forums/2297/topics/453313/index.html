              <p>Hello, i have learnt a little bit about resume writing.</p>
              <p>I believe it is important to state your Name and Contact Number in the resume.</p>
              <p>As for the educational portion, i believe it is important to write down your education informations, such as education background and other informations related to your education.</p>
              <p>Other things you can include in your resume could be things that are relavent to what the job needs.</p>
              <p>It's ok to lie abit, but i hope your teacher wont fail you for doing that.</p>
              <p>As for my resume, i have a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering (High Voltage Engineering), Masters of Technology, B.Eng EEE, DEEE</p>
              <p>Prior to my Masters degree, i am a LAE(Licensed Aircraft Engineer) for 4 years, specialising the repair and maintainence of avionics onboard commercial aircraft such as Beoing 747, Airbus A320.</p>
              <p>I have also done extensive research in the areas such as fabrication of microfluid devices.<br><br>I also have experience in nanotechnology, especially in the areas of heat dissipation  of nano electronics in space going vehicles.</p>
              <p>My area of interest will be in acoustic sciences and sound engineering.</p>

              <p>Assuming you are fresh out from education, you have no relevant work experience from poly (unless your attachment is related)</p>
              <p>You should state relevant work experience or experience for companies in related field or work experience that shows exemplary qualifications in your previous jobs.<br><br>Other than that, put emphasis on what you had achieved during school, project, extra curriculum activities that you think is relevant to the job you are applying for on your resume.</p>
              <p>Write a self introduction on your capabilities, (such as willingness to travel, learn new skills) Explain briefly, yes briefly, on your capabilities like if you mention you like to learn new skills for example, you went to library read books for that particular subject, attended classes, or even join a matured group that does the activity regularly etc, 1-2 points per capability is enough. Don't write more than 6 capabilities and dont write more than 10 pts. Hirers don't need essay writers.</p>
              <p>The length of the resume should be between 1-2 pages if you applying for a job in US, 3-4 in Europe/Asia. The resume should be concise and 3-4 page is a guideline for people who had loads of related work experience. You should be looking at 2 pages max.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 22pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hook potential employers with a well-written resume</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">AN IMPRESSIVE curriculum vitae (CV) or resume is a must for anyone applying for a job in today's conditions of economic uncertainty and intense competition.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>  However, many jobseekers mistakenly believe that a good CV or resume itself is sufficient to land them their desired job.</p>
              <p>  As a result, they are likely to spend more time and effort in crafting their job application than on preparing for the job interview.</p>
              <p>  The end result is usually a tedious document that tends to reflect the jobseekers' desperation rather than their suitability for the job.</p>
              <p>  Searching for a job is actually a two stage process. The first stage is crafting a good job application to gamer an interview. The second stage involves putting effort to perform well at the interview to get the job offer.</p>
              <p>  Numerous resume templates are readily available on the Internet. However, there are basically only four formats.</p>
              <p>  Jobseekers therefore need to carefully , use an appropriate format that matches the expectations of the employer and the profile of the position they are applying for. Which format is appropriate depends largely on the educational qualifications, competencies, experience and accomplishments of the jobseeker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Choose from four formats</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Education-centred: This format is generally suitable for new entrants with little or no work experience. The primary focus is on educational qualifications, academic achievements and key skills. Skills can include internship , volunteer work and other campus experiences relevant to the applied position. Any employment history is briefly summarised or avoided.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Experience-centred: This is an appropriate format for people with many years of working experience but who lack educational qualifications and training. As experience is the major focus, facts on the person's employment history are listed in reverse chronological order, that is, starting with the latest job role.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Expertise-centred: This format is only suitable for professionally qualified individuals with specialist qualifications, extensive training, experience and achievements in a specific field or industry. Prominence is given in the document to work experience supported by summaries of key competency areas, expertise and career accomplishments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Integrated: This is appropriate for young graduates with the necessary educational qualifications and a few years of relevant working experience. The emphasis is on the candidate's educational level and skills - and hence, his potential to achieve - while his employment history and relevant experience underscore his suitability for the position.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Four important elements</span></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">No matter which format is used, fundamentally four elements are important in making a job application impressive:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Suitable length: A resume is essentially a summary of what is covered in slightly more detail in a cv. Generally, a resume is about two pages long and a CV about five pages. Employers usually evaluate and judge a job application within five minutes when there are many applicants. Within this time frame, the document should be able to attract the employer's attention to salient information about the applicant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Professional image: The first impression of the jobseeker comes from his job application. As such it should be neat, consistently well organised and readable. Sentences should be short and clear with consistency in headings and fonts. Long paragraphs, slang, jargon, inappropriate email addresses and unsuitable photographs that do not project a professional image should all be avoided.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Relevant content: Tbe CV or resume has to be clearly structured to help the potential employer find important information easily. Generally, strengths should be highlighted and weaknesses given less emphasis. Avoid sending a single standard document for all job applications. Each document should be tailored to emphasise only competencies and experiences directly relevant to the job position applied for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Error-free: Sufficient thought and time must be invested to carefully write, edit and proofread the job application. There should never be any factual, typographical, spelling, grammar or punctuation errors in the final document.Even a small error can dent a professional image and cost the jobseeker the opportunity for a job interview.</p>

              <p>Boring resumes that's gonna add into the pile of white paper. lol. ... sure you can follow what other forumners have posted, but u can do much more than that.</p>
              <p>Where is the personalisation ?</p>
              <p>Gotta personalise your CV, from the font to the paper. Get those nicely coloured papers. Customise your CV to suit the company you are applying to. Imagine your CV have thier company logo in the background.</p>
              <p>Who cares what you have ? What they care is what u can do for them. That means indepth research of the particular company you are applying to.</p>
              <p> 6/7 ppl got the job.</p>
              <p>1 failed because she was not prepared for the interview itself. So just make sure you are also as prepared as you are in your CV. lol</p>
