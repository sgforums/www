              <p>If your teacher really used the word 'choice', he/she deserves to be sacked for teaching the wrong things to students.</p>
              <p>skythewood is right. There's no potential difference. A current only flows between 2 points if there's a potential difference between those 2 points. No potential difference means no current will flow between them.</p>

              <p>Firstly, thermal energy is loss whether or not the temperature is high or low. Thermal energy is loss because of the heating action of the current. Since current flows, wire is heated and heat is lost.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the environment temp being low actually means that there is more efficient heat loss.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, efficiency has to do with per unit time. Thus power loss is more.</p>

              <p>Firstly, thermal energy is loss whether or not the temperature is high or low. Thermal energy is loss because of the heating action of the current. Since current flows, wire is heated and heat is lost.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the environment temp being low actually means that there is more efficient heat loss.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, efficiency has to do with per unit time. Thus power loss is more.</p>

              <p>it will be alot windy, but the temperature doesn't change that much.</p>
              <p>another reason why build so high is because it has less chance of being earthed. it is both dangerous and wasteful if that happens, and probably will knock out the power supply too.</p>
