            <div class='col-md body'><p>i suggest you take a moment to think about if you want to go to poly. just consider it.<br><br>since you're only asking about JCs, i think it would help if everyone gave input about their experience in the JCs that you mentioned.<br>you seem like the kind of girl who is suited for the JC path, being academically-inclined, like to study all.<br><br>I was from TJC, and as much as the curriculum was rigorous and stressful, something about the school kept me calm. That heartwarming feeling you felt, I can say that it's quite characteristic of the school. If you've seen the campus, it's really very old school. There's a 1980s feel to the buildings, and there's a lot of greenery. and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. to me, this was a good thing, it really added to the atmosphere of the school. it's really a place that felt like my second home, being cosy and everything.<br><br>this was how i felt. many of my friends weren't for the whole retro thing, complaining about bugs, how other schools have nicer buildings and better things.<br><br>though i have to say, TJC looks super old, but it has some pretty cool facilities lah. the whole 2 years i was there, i never heard of LT blackout, or aircon breakdown. more than I can say for some other top JCs (which are generally old too).<br><br>TJC has a fair share of very passionate teachers who care far too much about the students. not only their grades, but they take the time to make lessons interesting, and to inspire their students. or at least they try lah. even if we become inspired, still no skills, cmi one (talking about myself here). but you seem like a smart girl, so not only do you have the ability to learn, you'll be inspired to learn too.<br><br>In my opinion, TJC is definitely not best in terms of academic results. But, if you're already good in a subject, I find it gets amplified in TJC, and by that, I mean your teachers will engage you, and will help you to do your best. It shows in your results during the 'A' levels. You will gain interest in that subject and want to do your best. not sure about what programme you're talking about though.<br><br>The culture in the school too really helps. It's said that TJCians are the ones who work the hardest. It's true, but not because we're all muggers. When it comes to the crunch, you'll definitely see students camping out to mug in the library, at the canteen, at the benches scattered all over school and in classrooms.<br><br>Even when it's nowhere near exam time, you'll see people mugging. This is mostly because everyone in TJ has other (big) responsibilites, and they need to squeeze in studying into every moment available. In TJ, you get stretched to your limit. I don't know if my class was a rare case, but seriously everyone was busy with something huge at some point. If you don't have a leadership post, you're planning huge events, or practising for a large-scale performance, training for competition, for academic competitions, etc.<br>It's a challenge. Personally, in my first year, I was class chairman, part of 2 performing arts groups (each with a performance to put up for the year) and PW group leader. It's hectic, but it really shows you what you're capable of.<br><br>I was also part of Talenttime. TJ has random fun things too, like Mardi Gras, Talenttime, House events (they had events where they give out free sushi and ice cream when I was there), Megahouse function (basically a party mid-year). I can't really think of anymore, but definitely there's work to be done throughout the whole year. I only ever see everyone settling down in September or so.<br><br>TJC has a very vibrant yet heartwarming feel to me. The fact that I'm here to rah-rah for them says something. That was my personal experience, and I did feel like I took away a lot.<br><br><br></p></div>

              <p>okay i have heard new news!<br>apparently my old school not as hip already. they're banning quite a few events that made it fun. =/ and the rules upgrade until abit sian also. they don't give you the freedom other JCs have anymore. like shoes must be black/white, socks cannot be ankle socks. petty things lah.</p>

              <p>Fcukpap: LOL LOL LOL.</p>
              <p>Snugglybug:Thank you very much for the info.I will keep it as a mental note.I have decided that I will focus more on how many A1s that I can produce rather than going where after Os so yeah.I have this idea that if I go TJC with very (as in very very )good results,I would be able to hold the tutors's attention more so that they can stretch my potential further. On the other hand, if I were to enter top schools like VJC,RJC or HCJC, the students there would be of the same standard as me or higher. I would not stand out that much. Teachers may give an all-same treatment there.Students would be expected to be more independent and stuff? I dont know lah. But there is a saying that says "it is either you be a small fish in a big ocean or you be a big fish in small pond"...haiyah..</p>
