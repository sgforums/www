              <p>Wait for your results to come out first then finalise. </p>

              <p>Pursue your dreams, not your dad's dreams. But make sure your interest is not just san fen zhong re du. Go around and see how it's like. </p>
              <p>Your dad wants you to study engineering, but you have no interest in engineering. Maybe you have, but you do not know if you do. Go to the open house or surf the web now to find out the diff forms of engineering (Chemical, electrical, aerospace...)</p>
              <p>There are many people i see, who learn engineering just for the sake of it. This type of qn, this formula. Engineering is not about formulas, laws and theories and mathematics. (It mostly comprises of it though).</p>
              <p>I went into engineering cause since young i have always been interested in how things work and i do open up alot of watches to see how it works (and spoil it).</p>
              <p>Here's what i did recently. Replaced a spoilt headset and bought a cheapo $5 earphone, strip it from it's 3.5 base and then resolder it to a LG headset.  Works. </p>
              <p>This is an application of engineering.</p>

              <p>Depending on your specialty. For a common engineering such as electronic, your pay would generally not be that high - Unless you have electrical license - you can operate for example 66kv - so you can do switch boards - an electrical license is hard to get though. </p>
              <p>Also if you specialise in a field such as Clean Energy or Bioengineering </p>

              <p>This is mostly pointed towards what is termed by some to be the lower-end engineering courses such as computer engineering and triple E.</p>
              <p>They are not as bad as they sound, but many people give them such a labelling as they have a low cut-off as well as large intake.</p>
              <p>The reason why it is harder to find job for such degree courses is because of the high competition from foreign engineers in the related areas. Thus, if you do not have a first class, or at least a 2nd upper, it can be very challenging to get a job.</p>
              <p>To be honest, there is no such thing as an easy degree to get a job nowadays, unless you are talking about degrees such as teaching, nursing, medicine....etc., where you sign a bond first before you even start your studies. However, there are degree where it is significantly harder, such as the two mentioned above.</p>

Some industries Engineers do command pay in the region of high 4-digits (7k above) or even 5 digits (though the pay is even higher overseas), but like I said it depends on the industry, if not you will just end up as some highly qualified technician. </span></p>
