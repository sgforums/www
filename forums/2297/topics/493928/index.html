              <p>Maths just have to practise. Keep doing TYS and other schools' paper, but remember to learn from your mistakes. It would be good if you have a copy of the answer key.</p>
              <p>I took O levels last year, so I got the new E-Maths syllabus. I think N level syllabus also affected. The new syllabus got some questions need to describe about what's misleading about the bar graph or something, so pay attention to those types of question also. Brush up on your definition of numbers also e.g what are real/rational/irrational numbers, integers etc. All of them should be in your textbook, if not can find online.</p>
              <p>Try not to find a tutor. E-Maths is relatively straightforward, don't need waste money on external expenses. Besides, by finding out the mistakes by yourself, you will start to hone your independent learning skills, which I believe will serve you very well after your N levels.</p>

              <p>I tell u ah....10 years ago hor, i only sec 2. <br>I also keep fail my sec 2 maths, 38-40 marks overall. <br>My school don't allow me to take A maths in sec 3.</p>
              <p>Last time i also duno how study maths, I take the txtbk read one day before the exam then go exam. Come out fail i also duno why.</p>
              <p>Teacher keep write careless, see me after school, redo, attend remedial class.</p>
              <p>Teachers have to teach 40 students, cannot cater to one student during class, they have to try very hard to explain over the chit chatting, and hopefully all of the 40 students understand what they are talking about, and hopefully all students can follow.</p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>One way to start is to read about the syllabus here: <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/content/syllabus/nlevel/2017Syllabus/4045_2017.pdf">http://www.seab.gov.sg/content/syllabus/nlevel/2017Syllabus/4045_2017.pdf </a></p>
              <p>Eg. Page 4, the paper write certain part have been underlined and will only be tested on Section B of paper 2.</p>
              <p>From the document, know the focus of the topics that are going to be tested</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Studying is like flirting with girls, doing only one type of question is like flirting with the girl sitting next to you in class. <br>Doing simple questions from textbook is like flirting with the girl in another class who is very dao. <br>Doing TYS is like trying to flirt with girls from different class with different personalities, while their boyfriend around them. Thus you need to know what the girl(question) actually wants, be careful of the boyfriend (tricks in questions), and what the girl mean when she say something (question asking in different manner).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The more girl you flirt with, the better you are with girls. <br>The more maths question you do, the better you are with maths.</p>
              <p>Yes, can practise by doing the Ten Years Series. <br>When practising TYS, try to do topic by topic, focus on one topic at a time.</p>
              <p>1. Revise the topic you want to attack first.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Revise means know the objective and concepts of each topic. </li>
              <li>Eg. Trigonometry: Know how to calculate all the angles, lengths<br>TOA = Tangent of angle = Opposite length of angle divide by Adjacent length of Angle, Area of Triangle = 1/2 AB sin C. Draw out the triangle and label it.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. Try out simple examples from textbook/worksheet.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Look at past worksheets/homework that you did and the mistakes you made (hopefully you filed them properly and did the correction)</li>
              <li>Eg. Find length of the hypothenuse using pythagoras theorem<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>3. Try out some harder questions</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Look at past test that you did, hopefully u did corrections and filed them properly</li>
              <li>Eg. A librarian placed his ladder 0.5 meters away from the book shelf. The ladder is slanted in a way that it makes an angle of 45 degrees with the floor and rest on the book shelf. Given the length of the ladder is 150 cm, find the height of the wall that meets the ladder.</li>
              <li>Realise 0.5 meters and 150cm, should you convert them to either cm or meter? Can you draw out the scenario and translate them into a right angle triangle? Should you use TOA, CAH or SOH? If i want to use TOA, CAH, SOH, what angles do i need? What if now i give another angle?<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>4. Try out some TYS questions on the topic you revised</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Compare the different questions and see what the fundamental concept that they are testing. Concept is important, concept will help you remember the formulae. And help you to apply in different questions.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>5. Write a summary on the topic you revised</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Staple your revision notes with the questions you did with the revision. <br></li>
              <li>Keep it safe in a file at home. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>6. Photocopy a set of your revision notes and keep the original safe at home in a file. Put fire extinguisher in your room if needed.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sometimes teachers not happy you studying during their class, will confiscate your notes and throw away. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Teachers assume you reading nonsense and throw away your notes</span></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Some teachers think they got bachelor degree and masters degree very big.<br></span></span></li>
              <li>Friends see you study not happy, steal your notes and ownself get A.<br></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">One way to deal with teachers is through their ricebowl/livelihood<br></span></span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>By doing so, your brain will automatically see how the topic evolve from simple concept into simple example, and finally how they twist the question into a more complex form. After which, the TYS will show how they twist the complex form in many ways.</p>

              <p>keep doing maths questions, until you really know how to do the maths questions without referring to the textbook.</p>
                  <p>As to how many questions, my advise is to do all questions.</p>
                  <p>First few questions can refer to the textbook. Once you get the hang of it, do the other questions on your own.</p>
                  <p>Make as many mistakes as you can, and learn from the mistakes.</p>
                  <p>What matters is that you learn how to do the questions during the exam.</p>

              <p>Ok, now that you have revised, you should really try to sit down and do the TYS.</p>
              <p>The best way is to do it without looking at the solution first.</p>
              <p>You know what you know or don't know when faced with a blank piece of paper and pen. This is a scary and depression situation, thus it is better to do this long way before the exam so you can learn.</p>
              <p>See if you can link the concepts and come up with the maths equation on your own, to model the problem in the question.</p>
              <p>If you can, try it with other questions, different scenarios.</p>

              <p><span class="echo-streamserver-controls-stream-item-text">My experience 
                      was that math was pretty much taught in a vacuum--there was no use made 
                      of it outside of that chapter. I once was trying to show a teenaged 
                      clerk how to figure sales tax on a special order, and when I said the 
                      tax in our area was 7%, he said, "Oh, is that what you use percentage 
                      for! Our third-grade math teacher only gave us batting averages as a use
                       for it, and since I don't like baseball, I figured I'd never need it 
                      outside of class." My own honors algebra teacher could only tell us 
                      parabolas were used for things like aligning headlights, and since the

              <p>My experience was that math was pretty much
              taught in a vacuum--there was no use made of it outside of that
              chapter. I once was trying to show a teenaged clerk how to figure
              sales tax on a special order, and when I said the tax in our area
              was 7%, he said, "Oh, is that what you use percentage for! Our
              third-grade <a href="http://yourhomeworkhelp.org/do-my-math-homework/">math</a> teacher only gave us batting averages as a use for
              it, and since I don't like baseball, I figured I'd never need it
              outside of class." My own honors algebra teacher could only tell us
              parabolas were used for things like aligning headlights, and since
              the school would not permit us to take a shop course if we wanted
              to because we were in college prep "and won't have to do menial
              work," most off us figured if that's all it was good for we didn't
              need it. When I took a GRE exam, I realized I had seen all the
              concepts in high school math but had never used most of them since
              then. And there were parts of third-grade math we never used after
