              <p>FYI, you're not allowed to register as a school candidate and a private candidate simultaneously in the same year (is that what you were planning?).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only chance you have of taking 'O' level Biology in the same year as your other school subjects, is if you convince your HOD and principal to let you take the examination in school, while you study privately on your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HODs and principals are usually unwilling to do this, as it means it will risk lowering their school ranking if you do badly in the exams.</p>

              <p>I mean last year when i was sec 3, I was able to take up bio. I managed
                  to convinced the HOD to let me try out.  this year however, The HOD did not allow me to continue to take Pure biology as school candidates
                  due to cetain requirements the teacher had set. so i dun think i'm a school
                  candidate, therefore i would like to finish the bio syllabus as a
                  private candidate, is that possible??</p>

              <p>What if I'm taking other subjects as a school candidate but not bio? Does that mean I will be both a school and private candidate? For example, I'm taking the subject English as a school candidate and taking Biology as a private candidate. Is that possible? and if I take Biology privately, will it affect the school's ranking?</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter what subjects you're taking. In one year, you can be EITHER a school candidate OR a private candidate, not both.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So as far as MOE/SEAB/Cambridge is concerned, there's no such thing as taking one subject privately and other subjects in school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your only hope is to (get your parents to) convince your HOD and principal to let you register for your Bio papers together with your other subjects (ie. you take Bio in your own school exam hall), and you study the subject yourself for the rest of the year (since the school won't let you attend their Bio classes).</p>

              <p>u cannot be a school candidate and a private candidate in one year</p>
              <p>if u are still schooling u are considered as school candidate.</p>
              <p>so if ur HOD dont allow u to take pure bio, u cant take it as a private candidate if u are taking the rest of the subjects as a school candidate.</p>
