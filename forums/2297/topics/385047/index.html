              <p>My Opinion on the Problems of the Singapore Education System<br><br>Written by:<br>Eric Chen (http://eric.rainbowhuman.com)<br><br>Minor inputs, refinements, and editing by:<br>Christopher Bok (chrisbok -at- pacific -dot- net -dot- sg)<br><br>Version 2.2.2<br>Created: 7 August 2002<br>Last Altered: 15 September 2002<br>Contents<br><br>1. Introduction<br><br>2. The Situation Now<br>3. Why do I write this?<br><br>4. Defining True Learning<br>5. Learning in the education system<br><br>6. An analysis of the mindset of the system<br>• Mindset: We are the best<br>• Mindset: System Oriented<br>• Mindset: The Elders or High-ranking people know better<br>• Mindset: Only professionals can have the say<br>• Mindset: Scarcity and Elitism<br>• Mindset: Syndrome-oriented<br>• Mindset: Kiasu-ism<br>• Mindset: The less disclosure the better<br>• Mindset: Grade Inflation little concern<br>• Mindset: Confusing school and work<br><br>7. What the System can do <br>8. What we can do<br><br>9. Conclusion<br>Introduction<br><br>I would like to express my personal opinion about the education system in Singapore.<br><br>The education system has failed to achieve its Desired Outcomes [http://www1.moe.edu.sg/desired.htm]. Despite what the system publicly declares, it actually desires to maintain a mindset of scarcity [such as with the concept of elitism] and to continue with its old traditions, policies and mindset.<br><br>Faced with the intense incongruence of what it really wants to achieve and what it publicly thinks it should achieve, it blunders with its implementation, erring on the side of tradition. Engaged in a state of denial, it vocalizes the desired outcomes more to give others a good impression of itself rather than actually believing and committing with them.<br><br>What do I mean by “personal”?<br>I understand that I have different ways of thinking and different mindsets compared with most people. My comments only show my perspective, not an absolute authoritative assessment of the situation. I admit to have a certain level of subjectivity due to my previous involvement in the system and my limited set of experiences.<br><br>After graduating from it, I currently do not have direct interests in the education system in Singapore. Unless invited, I do not wish to have any direct involvement in the political affairs of the education system except providing advice like this one. I have no desire to dedicate my life to this area.<br>The Situation Now<br><br>Schools Today <br>What do we see when we go to school?<br><br>Teacher-originated Initiative<br>We see arrays of classrooms organized neatly, with a table in front for the teacher, a chalkboard or whiteboard, and some other accessories. When the class starts, the students sit in the rows of tables and chairs and the teacher stands in front of the class pointing at the whiteboard. Like a boss instructing his subordinates, the teacher instructs the class on how to learn.<br><br>Student initiative, unless expressly approved by the teacher, appears at best as a distraction (such as putting up hands to ask too many questions or reading other books during lesson) that the teacher should squash. At worst, the school would consider it disruptive behavior (such as skipping classes, doing other activities in class) and wants it stopped immediately. As a student, if you just do what your boss the teacher wants you to do, and you would not get into trouble.<br><br>The meta-lesson: You, the student, does not matter.<br><br>System-originated Timetables<br>We see timetables organized in a schedule of discrete, uniform chunks of time and (for higher institutes of learning) class schedules arrayed in terms of semester.<br><br>No matter how mundane or important a subject, it has to fit into the chucks of time called lessons allocated to it. You would only have an hour to explore chapter 3 of Macbeth, or another hour to explore ethics and morality, and then yet another hour to cover up the introductory chapter of algebra.<br><br>You might want more or less, or a different subject, but the school imposes its will. No matter if your cat died, if your favorite soccer team won the World Cup, you won a cruise to the Amazon, or you just feel like studying art, if the lesson plan writes “Introduction to Fluid Dynamics”, then you will have this lesson no matter you like it or not.<br><br>The meta-lesson: You, the student, does not matter.<br><br>Same pace studying<br>We see everyone studying the same subjects, at the same speed, in the same way as the rest of their age group in the same stream. You have little choice, and if you dare to speak up that, you have your rights to learn as an individual, you would in effect rebel against your school.<br><br>You the genius might finish everything in a week, but that would only make the teacher unhappy. You might not like to, or do not do well studying geometry, art, or Chinese, but “for your own good” you must study these (the way the teacher wants you to). No matter smart of stupid, hardworking, or lazy, scoring straight A’s or E’s, you have some kind of equality knowing that you will study at the same pace as your classmates.<br><br>Not only these, you also have to study these in the prescribe manner (for most of the time). Deviate from rote memorization of the notes, procedures or steps at your own risk.<br><br>The meta-lesson: You, the student, does not matter.</p>

              <p>do u realise that making the best of a system and a system that rewards only high flyers in a biased and unfounded grade system are 2 different things?</p>
              <p>Obviously a system cannot be made use of in a best way if its biased</p>

              <p>just wannt add more opinion.</p>
              <p>   Singapore education system is not built solely for the citizens own benefit. It is also built for the other areas like economy, society. I also think that singapore education policy is not very correct.</p>
              <p>   Many parents and students do not know how to handle the nature singapore education, therefore they become quite not very happy. If you are smart, you can sail through the education system easily and happily, absorb the good stuff and also dun be trapped by those common behavior like too focused on marks.</p>
              <p>   Education must always be an enjoyable process. Alas, govt is not good at doing that... therefore... ya i agree... many country education system.. all sucks... haha...</p>
