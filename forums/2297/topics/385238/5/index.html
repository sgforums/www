              <div>Knowing the number of students the course takes in will give you an idea of the competition for places. For example, TP's Informatics &amp; IT School is offering a new Mobile and Network 
              Services diploma and it's offering 60 places, so there will be competition for the places! Suggestion is if you are keen on the course, you should make it your first choice.</div>

              <p>Im interested in the Retail and Hospitality Design. However Im not really sure how much this course differs from the Interior Design. Personally feel that the scope is smaller yet more specialised. Anyone can offer advice? Thanks and appreciated:D</p>

They include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Process optimization &amp; improvement</li>
              <li>Process management and innovation</li>

              <li>Educational visits to other countries like Japan and Australia</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Do you still need to study engineering subjects?</strong><br>Yes, to allow the flexibility for those who intend to pursue Engineering in iniversity, we have included these subjects in year 1:</p>

              <p><br>honestly, even studying to be a veterinarian would require a bit of the research and testing aspect. because this is what helps to further discover different kinds of diseases that you help other animals in the future. in TP, the vet tech course doesn't really cover on the research and testing part. that i can vouch for. 'A' level route is definitely better of cos but the workload would be much more. if you're smart enough, go to JC! (:</p>

              <p>Hi gladstar</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Interior Archi and Design is broad-based design for interiors in general while Retail &amp; Hospitality Design is more focused towards the specific design needs of hospitality and retail developments such as spas, retail shops, shopping malls, hotels, resorts and so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The scope of RHD is not narrower than IAD but rather, just different. The RHD course came up to fill a niche in this design area. As lifestyles become more affluent and more sophisticated, there will be a greater need for designers who are specifically trained in this area. With the coming of the IRs, a constant revamp and reinvention of our shopping malls eg 313 Somerset etc, and new malls springing up eg Ion Orchard, N'EX at Serangoon etc, there is huge scope for those with background training in retail and hospitality design.</p>
