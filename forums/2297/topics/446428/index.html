            <div class='col-md body'><p>My son is currently preparing for his O' Levels this year. He did not do well during his secondary 2 streaming year and thus he is taking combine science and POA now. I know that because of these subjects, he has limited JCs to go to and has many disadvantages such as not being able to take H2 math in JC. As a result of this, he is very discouraged and I am very worried as a parent. He wants to go to a good JC as this would more or less mean that he can enter a local university but I understand that with only H1 math he has very few choices. Please give some advice for my son as well as a worried parent here.</p></div>

              <p>Dear Greenhorn,</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to focus on doing well in the O Levels.  It is difficult, but not impossible to do H2 maths without additional maths -- it takes discipline, and a head start would be very useful.  The arts subjects in JC are also very interesting -- history, literature, etc.  Do give it some consideration.</p>

              <p>You (as the parent) could speak to the HOD or principal, to request that your son be allowed to take the 'O' level A Math paper, even if the school does not allow him to attend A Math classes in school (tell the HOD or principal your son has private tuition for A Math).</p>
              <p>If this fails, in the worst case scenario, he can register as a private candidate, and take A Math (and Pure Chem or Physics, which will allow him to take H2 Chem or Physics in the JC, which is requried for many Science courses in the Uni; he can still take H2 Chem or Physics in the JC if his combined science gets an A1, but one problem with combined science is that one science performed badly can pull down the other science).</p>
              <p>He can't register as a private candidate in the same year as he is a school candidate, which means he may have to retake as a private candidate the year after he leaves the school. He can apply for one year deferrment from NS, which even if the deferrment is not granted, he can retake as a private candidate within NS, or in the year he ORDs (completes NS).</p>
              <p>Millenia Institute may not be a prestigious JC, but one good point about MI, is that it has more flexibility and more merciful criteria (in terms of O level subject background or scores) for students to take A Math and H2 Chem or Physics. And what's more important about being in a prestigious vs neighbourhood JC, is your son's own hard work and perseverance. </p>
              <p>If your son wants to do Science in the Uni, it's still more important to do H2 Math and H2 Chem or Physics, either in a neighbourhood JC or MI or even as a private candidate, than to be in top JC in Singapore but not have these prerequisite subjects that the University courses require.</p>
              <p>My point being : when there's a will, there's a way. That's the single most important lesson you need to teach your son.</p>

              <p>Can I just add that even the neighbourhood with very lousy COP has many students entering a local university...?</p>
              <p>Based on personal experience, many "not so good" JCs allow those who get really good grades in 'O' Levels to take H2 Math, even though they did not take Add. Math in secondary school. In turn, these schools would give bridging lessons to aid these people. I have an acquaintance who topped his secondary school for 'O' Levels, taking combined science, emath and FNN. He then proceeded on to a reputable JC in the East to take up 2H2 Sciences and H2 Math. Thus, why not advise your son to focus on getting good grades in 'O' Levels as for now?</p>
              <p>Also, even if he does not get good results for 'O' Levels (not cursing you or anything..), has to end up in a "not so good" JC, and to top it all off, is unable to take H2 Math at the very least, then there are such cases when one goes on to take the subjects he can take in JC1, and then appeal to retain JC1 in order to take other subjects. This is wasting a year, I know, but if you're willing to do anything, why not just give a shot? My JC classmate wanted to take H2 Sciences and H2 Math very much, but is unable to take them in his first year. He then proceeded to consult with his civics tutor and the principal, and then worked hard in JC1 to show that he is able to take the subjects that he wants. From taking H2 Lit Econs Geog H1 Math in his first year of JC1, he then proceeded to successfully retain in order to take H2 Physics Econs Math H1 Geog.</p>
              <p>Also, have your son ever thought of what he wants to do in life, and the courses in university that he wants to take? Because that is essential to choosing your subjects. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best of luck!!!</p>
