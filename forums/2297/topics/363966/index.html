              <p><em>Thursday, June 11, 2009</em><br><br>We've all sat through one of those 
              presentations where the animated slides are more interesting than the speaker. 
              Bold and brassy titles slide into view, tasty slices of pie chart fill the 
              screen one by one, and a hail of arrows spikes the points the lecturer hopes to 
              highlight. <br><br>But, are these custom animations and slide fades and 
              dissolves actually adding anything to the lecture, or do they have a dark side 
              that detracts from the message and impacts negatively on the message being 
              presented? <br><br>Microsoft PowerPoint has, over the last couple of decades, 
              become the tool of choice for creating instructional slideshows. Long gone for 
              most are the overhead projector with its fickle fan and its high-temperature and 
              temperamental bulb, the smudgy marker pen, and the transparent plastic sheet. 
              <br><br>Instead, lecturers, speakers and anyone else with a visual message to 
              present with their talk uses PowerPoint and its ilk to present their digital 
              slides. According to the authors of a study in the International Journal of 
              Innovation and Learning published this month, many instructors use these options 
              regularly with the impression that such effects enhance student learning by 
              allowing concepts to be introduced incrementally. <br><br>Stephen Mahar of the 
              University of North Carolina Wilmington and colleagues have explored the impact 
              of custom animation in PowerPoint lectures and examined the idea that custom 
              animation may, in fact, negatively impact student learning. <br><br>To test 
              their hypothesis, the team recorded two versions of a PowerPoint lecture. The 
              presentations differed only in the presence of animation to incrementally 
              present information. They then showed students either the animated or 
              non-animated lecture and then tested the students recall and comprehension of 
              the lecture. <br><br>The team found a marked difference in average student 
              performance, with those seeing the non-animated lecture performing much better 
              in the tests than those who watched the animated lecture. Students were able to 
              recall details of the static graphics much better. Animated slides meant to 
              present information incrementally actually require greater concentration, which 
              makes it harder to remember content as well as reducing overall exposure time to 
              the "complete" slide, the researchers found. <br><br>Although students appear to 
              like the use of animations in lectures delivered using PowerPoint, there is now 
              strong evidence that animation is nothing more than an entertaining distraction. 
              <br><br>The team points out that their study was applied only to the teaching of 
              new concepts. It is possible that teaching a technique might work more 
              effectively with animated, rather than static, slides. Follow-up work will 
              investigate that possibility. <br><br>### <br><br>Inderscience Publishers</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>that's assuming that in both cases, the students are actually listening to the teachers. if you were presenting to an unruly class, i think the animated slides will be much better. =P</p></div>
