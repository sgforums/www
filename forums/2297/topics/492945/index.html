              <p>As expected, the paper 1 is a pretty conceptual paper. The trend has been there for quite some time but a number of prelim papers are not putting their focus on testing of conceptual understanding, but more on "killer" questions. (Same for H2 Physics)</p>
              <p>Sharing my judgment</p>
              <p>Paper 1</p>
              <p>Q1: Partial Fractions, Inequalities<br>Q2: Applications of differentiation (tangent normal)<br>Q3: Transformations<br>Q4: APGP<br>Q5: Vectors (basics)<br>Q6: MI<br>Q7: Complex Num (no loci)<br>Q8: Maclaurin Series<br>Q9: Differential equations<br>Q10: Functions<br>Q11: Vectors (Line and Plane)</p>
              <p>Paper 2, expected for Pure Maths</p>
              <p>1. Complex Num (Loci)<br>2. Graphing Techniques, Curves (Hyperbolas, etc)<br>3. Integration and its applications (watch out for similar questions to 2015 P1 Q3)<br>4. Applications of differentiation (maximum minimum)<br>5. System of Linear Equations</p>

              <p>Generally, it was a conceptual paper. Its not hard in terms of the prelim level standard hard. But because most schools prepared their students only for the "prelim hard" standard, students cannot solve conceptual questions. </p>
              <p>If you all have not realised by now, the key to acing a levels is to study all the learning outcomes given in the syllabus one by one, a level examiners most usually set questions by learning outcomes for fairness (because they dont know what everyone else is teaching extra), so for chem math if you studied the outcomes and applied properly it should be manageable. </p>
              <p>All in all, most of the questions were familiar (differential equations), its just how careful you are. There weren't any tricks actually in this paper, its just slightly more novel especially as some of you mentioned Q3. Q3 is actually interpretating the question " what does it mean when you transform one graph to something?"-some people thought (a,b) was (0,0) lol. </p>
              <p>Besides Q3, the last vector question was probably tricky, but you could have either used what you learnt (dot product of normal to algebra the 12 perpendicular distance) or you could have found distance of plane p to origin and solved for the equations. Also depends if you are careful enough in converting equation to cartesian form. </p>
              <p>but dont worry, A depends on many factors, including your luck, so work hard for the easier stats paper and try to score a 100.</p>

              <p>Hey, I was wondering, wasn't system of linear equations tested in the last vectors question? </p>

              <p>I don't think there's ECF for Math?</p>
              <p>I found it pretty manageable. Surprised they tested every bit of vectors in this paper and there was a lot more focus on sequence and series than I expected. (I found Q6iii cool.) The only question I wasn't too sure about was Q4. Couldn't fully derive the formula accurately and ended up somewhat working backwards. Hopefully the examiner doesn't notice huehue. Also, after checking the solutions, I realized I stupidly screwed up inequalities HAHAHA of all question types LOL.</p>
              <p>However, most of my friends found it difficult, especially question 3 (Transformation) and 8 (Maclaurin's). I felt that this paper had a lot of application and manipulation. Prelim questions are definitely harder... The toughness for prelim questions comes from finding the entrance to solving the question- then it's pretty much a straight route with some occassional twists and turns. This paper was more of a straight route to the entrance before being lost in a ladybrinth.</p>

              <p>@ThyWaffles System of linear equations refers to those questions that requires you to deal with a set of (usually, as in As) 3 or more equations with 3 or more unknowns. If we're given such a question, thank the heavens (or not, if you're hoping for a hard paper)- it's free marks.</p>
              <p>Goodluck for Paper 2! :)</p>

              <p>Hello guys, just a question when doing hypothesis testing, do you consider falling on the critical value as reject or not reject?</p>

I found P1 to be a very concept heavy paper but paper 2 was more or less standard questions ( excpet correlation ). Generally messed up paper 1 and smashed paper 2. So im hoping for a B but not sure what range it would lie within cus i know the standard deviation for B quite high but C also quite high sooooo... yeah idk</p></div>
