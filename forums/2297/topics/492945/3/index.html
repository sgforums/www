              mistakes in P2 i cry T_T). that's inclusive of some method marks
              (the obvious ones). Q_Q i hope it turns out fine. i swear i'll rage
              quit life if i don't get A. grrr, carelessness kills. literally (jk

              <p>ok i'm just raging at myself rn but hopefully 80 is enough?
              people have been telling me it's like really high 70s this year
              because P2 was easy (?? evidently not for me) and i'm worried.</p>

              <p>It's not about how many mistakes you make. No one is perfect; everyone makes mistakes. It's about how fast you bounce back from mistakes.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Compared to P1, P2 was more manageable and its difficulty level is comparable to that of 2015.</p>
              <p>  National average of A grade is around 50% and national average of A/B grades is around 80%. So there is no need to worry about the bell.</p>
              <p>  Eagle said it well -- focus on the remaining papers and excel in them!</p>

              <p>H2 Maths trends to watch out for:</p>
              <p>- Lengthy questions requiring comprehension skills.</p>
              <p>- Questions with new phrases.</p>
              <p>- Problems involving arbitrary constants.</p>
              <p>- Problems requiring substantial algebra working.</p>
              <p>- Nature of answers found may be unique or several. </p>
              <p>- Convergent and divergent critical thinking skills needed.</p>

              <p>hello, i just took my h2 math paper 2 yesterday and i was extremely broken and devastated after totalling up my marks for both papers and realising it fits around 58-60m range and i was wondering if there is a chance that i might be able to get a B?</p>
              <p>I heard that the B range is pretty wide and I was wondering from your years of experince in teaching, what were the actual grades for students who estimated their marks to be around my range?</p>
              <p>Sorry this is a very convoluted babbling but I am very shaken and distraught b/c of math. I only have 2 more papers to go which take place next week so i think i'll take a day off today to lament about mathematics in general. Thanks :-( </p>

              <p>hi please dont be distraught. life is like a sin x curve. Up and down. </p>
              <p>people do make mistakes at every point of their life, some during more important events, some less. But ultimately you still gotta stand up and fight on regardless of the outcome. </p>
              <p>B is probably from 60-75. </p>

              <p>Yeah, my mark range is the same as yours. Feeling dissapointed, because i made many careless mistakes. But at the end of the day, we should focus on other papers and try our best for it since we cannot already change what has happened! Cheer up and all the best for remaining papers! </p>

              <p>How many knots you tie? The chances of papers falling off is low if at least 2-3 knots. Anyway, as long as you write your name on the paper, they can find your script and tie it back haha</p>

              <p>How many knots you tie? The chances of papers falling off is low
              if at least 2-3 knots. Anyway, as long as you write your name on
              the paper, they can find your script and tie it back haha</p>

              <p>next time tie 5 knots. I always tie 10. Keep tying until the invigilator walks over to collect your script. </p>
