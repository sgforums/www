              First and foremost, I have flunk my JC 1 and the school is only going me two options: dropout  and go to poly or appeal to retain. 
              
              Option 1:
              I feel that poly is a better choice for me because its more down to earth and things taught are relevant to the working world. I have researched and concluded that I am quite interested in either business administration (BA) or international business(IB). Of course these are not definite choices and I am still considering. My optimistic goal is to do well in poly and go to a local university if possible. 
              
              Question 1: If I were to choose this route, what should I do about NS? I'm unclear if I can defer NS if I start poly in 2014.
              
              Question 2: What is the difference between IB and BA?
              
              Question 3: What is poly life like and how to do well in poly?
              
              Option 2:
              Retaining in JC is something I do not really want at this point in time as I do not see any purpose of studying things I will never apply in real life. I know some say that JC "trains your brain" and it is the shortest way to a uni. It also has a better chance of landing you in uni. The downside is if you screw up your A's, there goes your bright future. Then again, my perception about things may be wrong. Hence I'm seeking insightful opinions on this.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png">Fellow J1 here,with your current L1R4,can you apply for the business courses? If so,go with your choice. My ex-sec sch mate left the jc after a week in the same jc which I attended due to the academic rigour.<span style="color: #ff6600;">To "survive" in jc,you need to be assiduous in your studies,with consistency,equivalent to poly. </span>However,you are required to be more consistent in poly. <span style="color: #ff9900;">My poly friends in first year are trying to score as many points as possible to keep their GPA high(&gt;3.8),lest it gets more tedious the next 2 years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Perhaps you are a hands on learner?Maybe sitting down,read/write and lectures are mundane? </span><span style="color: #000000;">Consider </span>the business course~ I have to give you a thumbs up if you want to go to poly for business courses.Why is that so? In business,it is more hands-on.<span style="color: #99cc00;">This is seen that you must develop soft skills "leadership,teamwork and communication" through project work.It is super relevant with the working world,be it you enter uni or not.</span>It will be more difficult to enter uni,but be rest assured,you will outshine the jc students ^_^(fyi,I am not pursuing business)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">1:It is possible to defer NS.Just have to apply again for 1 more year next year or call up Mindef.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">2:sorry,that it above my scope</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">3:I am a non-poly student but I shall write on a third party perspective from my friends.My response may be backed up by my ex-sec sch,where 90% went to poly/ITE.Poly life&gt;&gt;<span style="color: #339966;">Better variation of food,can wear your own clothes unlike jc.Free flow learning&gt;think out of the box and not forced learning. Information is generally attained by the individual instead of the lecturer.Lecturers serve to guide but to further yourself,you have to do research. More emphasis on teamwork skills.</span>To do wellyou must be <span style="color: #33cccc;">open-minded and willing to communicate with your teammates in the most stressful situations.</span> Extremely consistent&gt;As soon as you enter poly,make friends with the ''academic'' crowd in the library and you will do fine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">CCA&gt;&gt;Many flexible CCAs (from dragon-boating(4 days training a week) to event-based science club activities.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="color: #99cc00;">Do not be in a hurry to choose a CCA if you enter poly</span>.One of my friends,is not in a CCA due to the rigorous time commitment in poly work.He chose to do away with a CCA and now has a decent 3.5 in 1st year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Last but not least,if it was due to time commitments in PW,MT or laziness,I suggest retaining.<span style="color: #808000;">According to my J2 seniors,average retainees fared average to above average in their next year</span>.However,it is up to your perception and choice to believe me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Last word of advice:<span style="color: #008000;">All is not lost and you still have time to pick up from your past.From a positive perspective,you have learnt with you knowledge of coping in Jc for the first year</span>,perhaps you can adapt some learning techniques in jc in poly such as theory-based? Anyway,jia you<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> !! May everything goes smoothly for you</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks alot for the insight! I'm now considering retaining less and less because BA and IB just excites me with all the projects and stuff. However, you did mention you suggested retaining if I was lazy or due to time commitments. For me, I guess you can say I was lazy but I honestly think its because I have no interest in the subjects there except PW and GP. I mean, who needs to know whether alkanes react with something else unless you are going to be someone like a chem engineer? This thought probably demotivates me from studying and thus gives rise to my laziness. Again, I'm not 100% sure but I will consider your suggestion :)</div>

              <p>To tell the truth <br>If i were to do everything again , i probably would choose IB instead of A levels or Poly.</p>
              <p>Depends on each individual needs, if one wants to study in a local university than both choices are fine.</p>
              <p>If one wants to study overseas, than A levels and IB are more suitable are they are widely accepted ,Unis in the US and canada ,would accept IB.</p>
              <p>Canadian universities accept A levels i reckon.</p>

              <p><br>It's like only 1 additional year from the usual 24. PW and GP are all free-flow subjects,this means that  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">i<span style="font-size: x-small;">t is the only subject you will ever do that allows you to read about, think about, talk about, and write about anything on Earth (and beyond) that interests, excites or fascinates you. I guess you are creative and want to venture out. Poly suits you then.This subject embodies the very joy of learning because it is about learning without boundaries, learning unconfined, which is the way that learning should be.You are more of a learner than a hardworker,I think that the environment in poly will be comfortable for creative learners.</span></span></strong></p>
