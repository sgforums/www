              <p>A levels is approaching,prelims fall on this week.</p>
              <p>Life is bitter,re-memorising concepts of humanities to sciences.Practising Vectors and Complex Numbers.</p>
              <p>Mathematics was a tough cookie to crack,I struggled through Sigma notation,then overcame it.Then,it was applications of integration.Permutations and combinations.All of which I have resolved,except PnC,which my teacher advised me to devote more time on other aspects to score.Now,it is Vectors and Complex numbers.</p>
              <p>Physics was a roller coaster.I scored As for my first few tests,followed by Bs and eventually Es in the promotional exams.Then,it climbed up to C and now B.My teacher wasted 30minutes of each lesson(3 lessons per week) talking about personal motivation.Prior to the end of the syllabus(Term 3),I stopped paying attention in class and did my own revision,with little supervision from my teachers.This problem was also resolved when I employed the aid of a tutor</p>
              <p>Chemistry was the pet subject of mine.Despite scoring B for my first test(below average),I consistently scored this grade until my 2nd common test.Life wasn't easy,despite chem being my strongest subject.I will pay specific attention and highlight the details in my notes and tutorials.I will practise beyond what is given at times.</p>
              <p>History is my adversary and pal.Having not came from a history background,it was a struggle at times,to keep up to the class.I fell below average in my promotional exams.(30th percentile) I was wondering to myself,what if I scored C? This thought invigorated in me the spirit to excel in this subject.I started writing essays each week,submitting to teachers.My history result shot up three grades,but I wasn't satisfied and I keep on perservering in the humanities.</p>
              <p>Gp is the subject of unfulfilled expectations.At times,I do well.The next time,I hope to do well, I fare poorly.However,I am slowly getting the hang of it as I focus beyond merely reading newspapers,books to understanding the writing skills and the applications behind this subject.It is undoubtedly the most daunting subject for those in the Sciences,but you need to take one step back and analyse your mistakes.In that case,progress will follow suit.</p>
              <p> Admist the hardcore period and the consistent reminders from family,friends to take a break,I turned to sports such as badminton and squash.Who says that you can't swing your racket during exam periods?It's a fun-filled experience and takes me away from the rigours of academia.</p>
              <p> My advice for those taking A levels,O levels,or the preceding year:</p>
              <p>1.Motivate yourself as much as possible through talks and career workshops.Friends of mine who lack motivation,are attempting to pick up their pace right now,only to find themselves too late.</p>
              <p>2.Don't procrastinate.If procrastination boosts your creativity and gives you pressure,it is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">SHORT-TERM.</span> Especially for the A levels,it does not work effectively.</p>
              <p>3.Find out your learning style.&gt;&gt;&gt;School/home? quiet/noisy? relaxed/stress-based?Group/individual? Morning/Afternoon/night? This can go a long way in your revision</p>
              <p>4.Seek help from friends,teachers,families if you have social,emotional problems,as well as academic assistance from your teachers or friends</p>
              <p>5.Knowing is not enough,you must do.Take time to practise your Tys and prelim papers.(tys is not enough unfortunately.)</p>
              <p>6.Have fun!The students who are the most stressed in exams,tend to fare worse than those with the most confidence.How to feel less stressed? Simple.Turn to your nearby gym to work out or take a short nap to feel energised.</p>
              <p>7.Last but not least,set a realistic action plan and targets. You can't accomplish the whole of your  chemistry text book in one day.Study smart,break down large tasks into simple ones. For me,H2 chemistry should be broken down to 3 days of review,Physical,Organic,Inorganic+planning. No more and no less. </p>
              <p>Hopefully,this helps you in your exams ,all the best!</p>

              You'll need to speak to your teacher, HOD and principal, immediately, to beg, persuade and convince them to allow you to retake JC2 in your JC next year. They'll probably still insist you take your A levels in 2 months time regardless, and there's really no reason why you shouldn't anyway (NUS/NTU isn't gonna look at your 2014 A level results, if you submit your 2015 A level results when applying into Uni). If you fail to convince your teacher, HOD and principal, then you've no choice but to serve NS first, then retake your A levels as a private candidate after you ORD, ie. in 2017.
