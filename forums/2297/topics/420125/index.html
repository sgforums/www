              <p>Dear xfantasyrulezx,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) When I was young, my mum used to reward me with money. Actually it a mother-son kinda deal, which if I scored well in a test, I received monetary rewards (so that I can buy stuff that I like). My mum wanted me to do well, and I wanted to buy stuffs for myself... so it's mutual.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's a bad idea... but in the long run, it is definitely unhealthy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Betting/Investing on grades is a long term investments, and the rewards (as in the example) may not seems to justify the amount of effort put in to attain the said grades. However, constant monetary rewards may seems as a milestones which can be obtain easily.. as compared to a huge goal of improving grades from C to A.</p>
              <p>3) Competition is good, monetary rewards is just part of the unsustainable recognition. Teachers in the US have come up with the idea of issuing certificates if the student attain Mastery for a topic. This recognition is better as the certificate is a prove and evidence of achievement.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Implementing this would incurre huge expenses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I place more in recognition than rewards.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Money is more important to you when it comes out from your own pocket. So when students put in their own money, i guess they would work hard for themselves and find a motivation to study. This may be short term maybe for a semester or so but once you get the momentum in achieving a very high grade i believe you would not want to fall below that. Especially, when it comes to cumulative GPA, it is very difficult to pull it up once it drops.</p>
              <p>I've experienced that kind of regret. Therefore, I would like to implement this idea to suit it. Singaporeans are realistic. Good education=good career=more money. So why not?</p>
              <p>P.s I'm a student.</p>

              <p>If the rewards  may not seems to justify the amount of effort put in to attain the said grades, why not just take it as a bonus point for your great effort. As long as you study very hard i'm sure you would roughly know where you stand.</p>
              <p>Maybe issue certificates to them when they have improved.Would that be a recognition?</p>
              <p>I plan on doing it in poly's and uni's. It would be a focus to improve on every sem's GPA in order to attain a high cumulative GPA.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmms, interesting topic.. Private organisations and our own government are implementing the system of work for reward, reward for work.. In my opinion, different forms of scholarships, awards and even merit bursaries are offered to students who are academically-inclined as well as to motivate them using monetary awards.. To those students who are having financial difficulties, monetary awards will be seen as an added incentive, so I'm pretty much convinced that local students are likely to do well if we are rewarded with money.. Of course, this is just my view and money is essential in everyday's life.. However, we should also put the money that we gained to good use ^^</p></div>

              <p>The amount would be less than a $100. I don't think it is too much to give a great impression than he should only work for the money. Satisfiction in achievement would be my main motive too.</p>
              <p>Why do people drag themselves to work even though most of them hate their job and dread going to work. At the end of the day it is still about the money. If there isn't money would people work like mad? Would workers think about how their company can improve and talk to their boss about it? In the work force it is so realistic that people just do their job, get paid and go back to a good home.</p>

              <p>It's not really that realistic.. Ermms, i think most adults are slogging their guts out at work for the sake of the future and happiness of their family, maybe money take up a portion of the happiness as it could give them a quality life.. but dont people work for their own success and achievement as well?</p>
              <p>Students work hard in school as they would gain a strong foothold in society and be successful in life (Eg Wealth, Fame).. However, i think it is important to note that a successful person may not be rich.. His life could be as fulfilling and enriching although he is poor, meaning that he's rich in other aspects (bringing joy to ppl).</p>
              <p>So, at the end of the day, we should just take pride in whatever we do even if there's nothing to gain from it. ^^</p>

              <p>One problem you have to be aware of, if the prize money is going to come from a student-pooled betting amount, is that because it's a zero sum game, and the winner will take from the losers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which means while the winners are encouraged, the losers are discouraged (because they lose money), which means the winners rejoice at the expense of the losers' agony. This may result in the plan backfiring, and do more harm (to the dejected losers) than good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In contrast, with a scholarship, the winning money comes from a sponsor (eg. the foundation or organization offering the scholarship), so there are no student losers in that sense, and no risk of the plan backfiring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This plan would be more feasible and less risky if you're a *teacher* with deep pockets (and are willing to sponsor scholarships for your own classes out of your own wallet), or can find willing financial sponsors.</p>

              <p>This is not entirely true. There are many other criteria as well.</p>
              <p>Basically, a scholarship is mostly a contract to work for the company. They are "reserving" your time after graduation earlier.</p>
              <p>There are many who scores well, but fails in scholarship interviews to those who don't score as well.</p>
              <p>So, a scholarship is in no way given because a particular candidate scores very very well. It is given because a particular candidate appears to be a good pick as an employee in the future.</p>
              <p>There's a price to pay for accepting the scholarship.</p>
