Dictionary.com had defined mass media as a means of communication that reach a large audience, and indeed they knit different parts of the world today.<span>  </span>Many of these forms of media are present in our daily normal lives, such as television and newspaper. Their presence had sometimes brought degradation to moral values in our society, such as stereotypes and media violence. Stereotypes could bring about devastating results, such as when Adolf Hitler dominated the media in mid 1930s to stereotype the Jews through newspapers which will eventually be responsible for the horrifyingly catastrophic deaths of 6 million Jews. Or even violent behaviour among people which is believed by researchers to be caused by constant exposure to media violence. On the other hand, while it is true that media do bring about negative impacts in our society, their positive impacts should indeed not to be neglected as they often show overt actions to our society. Media help us to disseminate information swiftly or even having a cheap access to the entertainment world. Hence, due to the benefits that they bring, i always believe that the positive aspects of mass media always outweigh its negative influence.</span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Violence in today’s world is unavoidable and partly is due to constant exposure to media violence which is common today and violence caused many problems to social life. Media violence,often in the form of violent television programmes and video games had influenced many youths aparts from adults. In the US, survey had shown that 80% of the television programmes are violence and exposure to television account approximately half of the homicide committed in the US. Youths growing up in the midst of violence will show worse effects than adults as they may fail to distinguish between real and fantasy world, and may see the world as an unfriendly place to live. <span> </span>As they grew up, their hostile feelings become more complex and difficult to change and this could be seen in different aspects of person’s personality, such as increase in feelings of aggressions and hostility. In April 1999, 2 Columbine High school students killed 12 of their peers and themselves, CNN had reported that these youths had played violent video game‘Doom’ and listened to Marylin Manson’s songs. However, reactions to media violence vary to different individuals as different people may show different reactions towards violence, and good parenthood as well as informal education system may teach good moral values toward these youths. Furthermore the serious violence committed due to media violence are only committed by a small percentage of the population. However, there are still so many types of violence that is committed on a small scale in which we have yet take account into which happened almost everyday, such as insults that many people learned from the media such as television. Hence, the influence of media do indeed bring harmful effects to our society.</span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mass media were often blamed for brainwashing people and used as a medium for stereotypes and insults that often happened in our society. Advertisements in television often attract consumers to buy products that they do not really need, such as the latest handphone model or even the attractive advertisements that we<span>  </span>see in the television to promote products such as cigarattes or beer to be a cool product to be consumed. Excessive stereotypes and insults are often see in the media, especially in various internet blogs and other sites where we often see people making insults or stereotype each other. Recently, in the year 2005 2 chinese men were being arrested by the police for stereotyping the malays through their blogs. These may cause resentment and anger among people, and may eventually cause racial disharmony that may cause the society to fall apart. However, nowadays blogs were being protected by the laws and the advancement of technology may let the authority to punish the offenders who violated the terms of use. Nevertheless, many of these hurtful comments were being ignored as they were too many of them, and personal attacks such as in Youtube and Facebook are not able to be judged by the laws.<span>  </span>Nowadays, the ease of access to media often caused many people to post nasty comments which may cause hurt and anger among many people’s feelings.</span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Yet, however benefits obtained from media should not be ignored as the media are able to provide cheap access to the entertainment world. The availability of television, radio and other appliances had led people to have cheap access to the entertainment world. In a hectic country such as Singapore, where people worked for long hours, the availability of television programmes or internet are the easiest way for them to relax themselves. And they were charged at much lower rate compared to other forms of entertainment, such as watching movies in the cinema or even fine dining. Helping people to relax is a great way to increase the productivity of the workers as human mind work best when they were in a relaxed state. However, there had been controversies where these media can be used as an easy medium to have access to pornography or violence that may bring other social problems later on. Nevertheless, the benefits obtained from the cheap access of entertainment surely outweigh the disadvantages as generally the working class people and youths are able to make the best use of this media for themselves.</span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Besides that, media can be used as a tool to swiftly disseminate information to the people all around the world. With the advancement of technology, the programme called ‘breaking news’ came about and we are able to view live coverage all around the world. Unlike the past, before newspaper and other printed media came about, news travelled very slowly as it is being passed from mouth to mouth. Recently the government of various countries are able to raise sums of money to help the unfortunate in the year 2004 when tsunami hits various countries in Asia. Or the cheap and speedy dissemination of news that happen in various countries to the people so that they can show greater awareness and learn to adapt better to their surroundings, such as economic recession that happenned recently in 2008 or war in Iraq, which caused price fluctuations in oil price. However, the people may received false information especially when the media is strongly under the influence of Government’s propaganda. Various medium such as magazine and amateur blogs are often based on personal feelings and opinion, and hence they may show biasedness in their news. However, nevertheless most newspapers, be it online or printed edition around the world often display the factual news and hence, media is a useful tool in disseminating the information swiftly.</span></span></p>
              <p class="NoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 150%; "><span lang="IN"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">The media had evolved with the advancement of technology, and it can be used as a double edged sword as it can spread both negative and positive influence to our society. Under the tight laws by the government, the media had indeed bring much benefits to our world society. </span></span></p>

              <p>Hi, I'm not a GP expert, typically scoring Cs in JC (but by some stroke of luck got an A2 in the end), so these are just my personal opinions, based on only the first paragraph.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span><span style="color: #000000;"> Mass Media is <span style="color: #ff0000;">undoubtly </span>ubiqituous in today’s society, and the

                                      violence. Dictionary.com <span style="color: #ff0000;">had defined</span> mass media as a means of
                                      communication that <span style="color: #ff0000;">reach </span>a large audience, and indeed they <span style="color: #0000ff;">knit </span>different parts of the world today.<span> </span> Many of these forms of media are present in our daily normal lives,
                                      such as television and <span style="color: #ff0000;">newspaper</span>. Their presence <span style="color: #ff0000;">had sometimes

                                      stereotypes and media violence.</span> Stereotypes <span style="color: #ff0000;">could </span>bring about
                                      devastating results, such as when Adolf Hitler dominated the media
                                      in mid 1930s to stereotype the Jews through newspapers which <span style="color: #ff0000;">will </span>eventually be responsible for the <span style="color: #0000ff;">horrifyingly</span> catastrophic deaths
                                      of 6 million Jews. Or even violent behaviour among people which is

                                      violence. On the other hand, while it is true that media do bring
                                      about negative impacts in our society, their positive impacts
                                      should <span style="color: #0000ff;">indeed </span>not to be neglected as they often show <span style="color: #0000ff;">overt </span>actions

                                      to the benefits that they bring, i <span style="color: #008000;">always </span>believe that the positive
                                      aspects of mass media <span style="color: #008000;">always </span>outweigh its negative
                                      influence.</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, to begin with, there are a few grammar/spelling errors, such as inconsistency/wrong tenses as marked in <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span>. You need to be careful to avoid the past perfect tense, because 9/10 times they are used wrongly. What you really wanted was the present perfect tense actually. The only time you need past perfect is when you have another reference point in the past and you're talking about something that happened before that past reference point. Hence, unless you're dead sure, avoid past perfect and stick to simple past or present perfect.</p>
              <p>As your English is of a rather high standard, you need to avoid the trap of using bombastic words and complex language structure, especially if you're not very sure if that's the correct usage since you're not native after all. Language is for communication, not showing off, and GP is to demonstrate that you can discuss a topic effectively in English, not to show that you can write a flowery poem, so if the reader can't understand the point you are trying to put across, all is wasted. Personally, I find your introduction difficult to read and digest, and I end up dreading to read the rest of the essay. I've marked some of these parts in <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span>. Why do you say 'often be' when you can say 'is often'? Even though it's not wrong grammatically, it makes it difficult to read and digest. When I saw the 'knit', I was expecting a 'together' to follow, but it didn't appear. I would prefer to see 'horrific' instead of 'horrifyingly' here. The 'indeed' is uncalled-for, and your sentence will read much better without it. I have a vague idea what 'overt' means, but I don't think it fits here, and I do not want to have to check the dictionary to confirm if you are using it correctly or not.</p>
              <p>For those in <span style="color: #008000;">green</span>, it's more straightforward - unnecessary repetition.</p>
              <p>My concluding word of advice - write as simply as you can. Show the examiner that you have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contents</span> you want to discuss, not language you want to show off. Try this in your next GP essay and see how your GP tutor grades it. Write something that people want to read, and don't try to write literature (personally I hate reading literature). Good luck!</p>

              <p>Hmm, I think your content is good! You should pay attention to your tenses though, because the mistakes can distract examiners from the content.</p>
              <p>For example, these two sentences both contain mistakes, which I have highlighted above.</p>
              <p>If there are spelling or grammar mistakes in every line, it is difficult to score a high mark!</p>
              <p>As markers read through the essay, they will mark out mistakes they see in sentence structure, spelling and grammar. If every sentence has a mistake, chances are very high you'll score a C grade or below!</p>
              <p>Its great that you are able to use a wide range of vocabulary. Grammar is the key issue that is pulling down your GP grade, and I recommend that you work hard on it!</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can try rewriting your essay (or intro para at least) for us to comment again, to see if you're going in the right direction. As mdfjami said, you do have content, it's just the language and presentation you need to work on, so rewriting the same topic is a more suitable practice for you than writing on new topics.</p>

                      stereotypes and insults that often happened in our society.
                      Advertisements in television often attract consumers to buy

                      anger among people, and may eventually cause racial disharmony that
                      may cause the society to fall apart. However, nowadays blogs were
                      being protected by the laws and the advancement of technology may
                      let the authority to punish the offenders who violated the terms of

                      benefits obtained from media should not be ignored as the media are
                      able to provide cheap access to the entertainment world. The
                      availability of television, radio and other appliances had led
                      people to have cheap access to the entertainment world. In a hectic
                      country such as Singapore, where people worked for long hours, the
                      availability of television programmes or internet are the easiest
                      way for them to relax themselves. And they were charged at much
                      lower rate compared to other forms of entertainment, such as
                      watching movies in the cinema or even fine dining. Helping people
                      to relax is a great way to increase the productivity of the workers
                      as human mind work best when they were in a relaxed state. However,
                      there had been controversies where these media can be used as an
                      easy medium to have access to pornography or violence that may
                      bring other social problems later on. Nevertheless, the benefits
                      obtained from the cheap access of entertainment surely outweigh the
                      disadvantages as generally the working class people and youths are
                      able to make the best use of this media for

                      can be used as a tool to swiftly disseminate information to the
                      people all around the world. With the advancement of technology,
                      the programme called ‘breaking news’ came about and we are able to
                      view live coverage all around the world. Unlike the past, before
                      newspaper and other printed media came about, news travelled very
                      slowly as it is being passed from mouth to mouth. Recently the
                      government of various countries are able to raise sums of money to
                      help the unfortunate in the year 2004 when tsunami hits various
                      countries in Asia. Or the cheap and speedy dissemination of news
                      that happen in various countries to the people so that they can
                      show greater awareness and learn to adapt better to their
                      surroundings, such as economic recession that happenned recently in
                      2008 or war in Iraq, which caused price fluctuations in oil price.
                      However, the people may received false information especially when
                      the media is strongly under the influence of Government’s
                      propaganda. Various medium such as magazine and amateur blogs are
                      often based on personal feelings and opinion, and hence they may
                      show biasedness in their news. However, nevertheless most
                      newspapers, be it online or printed edition around the world often
                      display the factual news and hence, media is a useful tool in

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 150%;">EDIT: Oh yes, a GP essay is feasibly 500-800 words long. Any longer will put the marker off and bad grades will follow. Try to stick to 100 words per paragraph. The structure is as follows:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Introduction - A general overview of what your essay is about. A summary of your points and YOUR STAND will suffice.</li>
              <li>Body - 3 paragraphs. 2 supporting your stand, 1 against your stand. For the against paragraphs, try to formulate a counter-counter argument where you try to reduce the impact of the last paragraph in demolishing your stand.</li>
              <li>Conclusion - Just paraphrase your Introduction.</li>
              </ul>
              That's it. It's so simple. Mastery will be tough, though. Good luck!<br>
