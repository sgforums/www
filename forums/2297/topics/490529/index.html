              <p>Hi everyone! So basically I'm in my final year in ITE, I'm studying higher nitec and can't seem to decide what to study when I go poly. My GPA is quite good and I have a good cca record but I just don't really know what course to choose from. I'm currently studying a business and IT related. I'm very interested in persueing programming courses (I like developing softwares) I was actually thinking of studying BIT in Singapore Poly but when I look at the at the courses that I can go in university for NUS it just wasn't what I'm interested in. I've also thought about studying computer engineering as I was interested in programming robots etc. Honestly, even though I thought of choosing computer engineering, I realize that I might face some problem since engineering require math and I haven't been studying math for like 4 years (nitec and higher nitec). I was also quite good in math during my secondary school years but the math in computer engineering is probably way difficult then N level math. What do you think I should do? I chose NUS and SP as I have a mum that wishes I go to the best school sicne relative say the best school can go to university easier..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wanna study something programming related with business(if possible) in university. But BIT in singapore poly can't really study any computer and business related beside business analysis... if you have any sugestion for other courses in other poly/uni that I probably can persue pelase post, thx.</p>

              <p>it is best to work in a profession that you like. but that line of work has to be able to to feed you and have enough time for you to start a family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if that line of work has too much travelling or too much overtime then you might end up single for the rest of your life, no kidding. in that case you should do what you like as a hobby and find a job that is not so stressful to feed yourself and your future family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to find out more about what you will be doing in the future, you have to look at the job that you plan to do in the future and talk to professionals in that field and listen to what other professional in other field talk about those professional in that field. </p>

              <p>It is good that you look forward to a university education.</p>
              <p>Assuming that your "last stop" in education for now(not saying u should stop at degree level, just for discussion here) is a degree, <strong>i will advice you to choose your poly course based on what you would like to do in university.</strong></p>
              <p>Since you have computer programming in mind, your course in university could most probably be "Degree in Computer Science" or even a "double degree", such as double degree in computer science and business :</p>
              <p>http://sce.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/CurrentStudents/Undergraduate/Pages/nbsdd.aspx</p>
              <p>My opinion is to <strong>go for a "full" technical diploma instead of a "hybrid" course.</strong> I believe choosing a full technical diploma helps you to prepare for university better than a hybrid one, especially for demanding course like "computer science or computer engineering"</p>
              <p>As <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for your interest in business, i will recommend that you do business modules as a minor degree or do a double degree in computer science and business</span>. However it is going to be very difficult, but if you are really interested, i will recommend that you do it at a degree level.</p>
              <p>The reason why i recommend this is because i strongly believe the programming/computer science contents taught in the degree level is very much heavier than that taught in the diploma level, and having a strong foundation in poly will help you.</p>
              <p>Thus, i will recommend you to go for a full diploma like diploma in computer science or engineering, instead of IT with business.</p>
              <p>Now for the maths part, don't worry, engineering maths in poly level is managable, and with your strong foundation in secondary maths(E &amp; A maths), i am sure you will do well.</p>
              <p>The problem comes in when you start uni, the engineering maths in uni is a lot more difficult than those in poly. The engineering maths i learnt in uni is harder than the "higher engineering maths" i took in poly.</p>
              <p>Uni engineering maths will need a lot on your basics such as E&amp;A maths in secondary school, the concepts are not difficult, the difficult are the tricks and manipulations that are built upon those learnt in secondary school. You must know your E&amp;A maths very well, they will become a tool used everyday</p>
              <p>Hope it helps, i went from Diploma EEE in SP to NTU EEE, still an undergraduate. Please do well in poly, come to nus/ntu/better unis, hope that you will get a degree smoothly</p>

              <p>im having ur interest at heart when i say this, im not being naggy. you need to ask many real life professional about their job and ask what professional from other fields think about those professionals. you do not want to end up doing something you will hate or doing something others will hate you for.</p>
