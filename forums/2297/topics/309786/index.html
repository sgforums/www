              <h1 class="clr">Tharman says balance is important when defining KPIs in education</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Academic excellence is not the only key performance
              indicator (KPI) for schools, Minister for Education Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam said in Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Responding to MPs’ calls on tracking schools’ performances and
              keeping sight of broader outcomes in education, he said his ministry is
              mindful of keeping a balance when defining its KPIs in education.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Tharman said some of the most important things highlighted by the MPs,
              such as character building and racial integration, are values that
              cannot be measured; and so is the balance between encouraging and
              challenging students to do better.</p>
              <p>He was responding to a
              question over an incident at the start of the school year when the
              principal of a girls’ school told a group of Secondary 5 students they
              should go to an Institute of Technical Education as they were unlikely
              to do well in the O—Levels at year’s end.</p>
              <p>Public feedback to this
              incident was divided as to whether such straight—talking would
              demoralise the students and affect their confidence or spur them to do
              better.</p>
              <p>He explained how he sees the issue: "Different schools
              have different methods, different principals have different methods.
              The ministry tries not to scrutinise everything they say, everything
              they do as long as they haven’t committed a heinous offence. Let them
              do their own thing and let parents judge the character of their school."</p>
              <p>"Over
              time they (parents) will know which school’s methods, which principal’s
              methods work better than others. And individual principals too will
              learn over time. Tweak here and there, improve here and there because
              no one is perfect," he added.</p>
              <p>The issue then is to find a balance
              between affirming children and challenging them, which Mr Tharman said
              is always a key craft of the school and its teachers.</p>
              <p>The
              minister also cited how recent studies in the US found not only does
              the child’s confidence matters, but also the teacher’s effectiveness,
              his/her teaching, and the child’s willingness to put in some hard work,
              all contribute to the education outcome.</p>
              <p>In fact, a Brooklyn
              Institution study of the results of an International Maths and Science
              Test showed the least confident Singapore student ended up doing better
              than the most confident American student.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman’s point was
              that while it is important to motivate the student, the ministry should
              leave schools to find their own balance on how they want to affirm or
              challenge the student.</p>
              <p>The ministry will not intrude on the
              schools’ approaches unless something goes completely wrong. And such
              autonomy, he said, is what will help schools differentiate themselves
              qualitatively over time. — CNA/ac</p>
