              Hi I would like to ask something about Senior Chem Olympiad (for JC1) and whether I should take it
              <p>
              So recently, i somehow got selected by my school for SChO training, altho im like not very good, just a decent chem student and the ppl who got selected are all quite beast in their studies, like half of them are china scholars.
              </p><p>
              So i went for my first session and apparently for the olympiad, the whole syllabus for A level chem needs to be covered as well as some other university chem modules, which is pretty scary given that the trainer only has now until end of Nov to finish it. And my school also not very good at chem olympiads, for last years olympiad 3 silver, 3 bronze, 1 merit
              </p><p>
              So right now im not very sure if i should continue as i need to dedicate 2h per week for training and perhaps even more to complete the homework/readings that the external trainer gives. And im not very sure if it helps with my A levels Chem or is it too far fetched. Im afraid it would affect my time for studies and other stuff as in JC i find myself always havng v little time.
              </p><p>
              So any advice on whether to go for it would be appreciated!</p>

                  Don't bother going for formal Olympiad Chem training or H3 Chem lessons in school, it just takes up valuable time you yourself said you can not afford. Olympiad and H3 are only for students who are already scoring all As in all their H2 subjects, are confident they have the time to do so, and wish to apply for Medicine and/or scholarships.<p>If you like, read up and self-learn on Olympiad or H3 stuff yourself, for giving yourself the extra edge in H2 Chem. Or if you (ie. anyone reading this) join my BedokFunland JC tuition in the future, I'll teach you only the Olympiad and H3 concepts and strategies that will help you to get A grade in your H2 Chem.</p>
