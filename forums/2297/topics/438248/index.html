              <p>in 1992, Rutherford shot a beam of positively charged alpha partiles into a sheet of gold. some deflected greatly while other were slightly deflected only.</p>
              <p>d) if rutherford were design the experiment using lithium instead of gold, would he have made the same discovery? explain your answer</p>
              <p>if he changes it to lithium, wouldnt there be no change as the nucleus would just be more "squeezed" together since in a metallic bond there would just be a sea of electron? so the deflection would be the same? This question seems to be of a higher level question, it seems like there are many theories to the answer for this question which makes this question extremely complicated for a sec 3 student</p>
              <p>My sister thinks there is no difference too:<br>"I originally thought with lithium, there would be more particles going 
              through, due to the larger atomic radius/space between each nucleus. 
              However, my tuition teacher says there would be greater deflection for 
              gold, due to the greater number of protons in each nucleus (and 
              therefore greater charge and greater repulsion between the protons and 
              alpha particles). While I can accept that the angle of deflection when 
              using gold may be greater because the nucleus of gold has a greater 
              charge, wouldn't the ratio of deflected particles to particles that go 
              through be the same since that is merely dependent on the ratio of 
              "space taken up by the nucleus" versus "empty space"? So even though the
               nucleus of gold is bigger, at the same time the spaces in between are 
              also greater, so overall there would be the same amount of deflection vs
               particles going through for both?"</p>
              <p>Firstly, in atomic structure we only learnt about electrons, protons and neutrons, not to mention nucleon. but that does not prepare us for this complicated question at all! so im quite worried that these types of questions will be tested for my EOYs or O levels in the upcoming levels. i asked my tutor and it seemed like it was extremely complicated even for him. so if its possible could any of u guys help me check if this is O level standard cos this seems to be of a "higher level" thanks so much for the help</p>
              <p>BTW, if its an O level standard question pls explain the reasons behind the answer so that ill be able to understand this well. thanks so much for the help given. Also if a question like this were to come out in a test or exam pls state on how to tackle it thanks.  :)</p>
