              SINGAPORE - The results of the 2015 GCE O-Level results will be out next Monday (Jan 11).
              
              Lee Min Kok
              
              School candidates may collect their results from their respective schools at 2pm, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in a press release.
              
              Private candidates will be notified of their results by post. They can also obtain their results online using their SingPass account on the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board's website from 2pm on Jan 11.
              
              Students who wish to apply for Junior Colleges, Millenia Institute, polytechnics or the Institute of Technical Education can do so via the Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE).
              
              The JAE will open from 3pm on Jan 11 and run till 4pm on Jan 15.
              
              Posting results have been tentatively scheduled for release on Jan 28, either through the JAE website or an SMS that will be sent to the applicant's mobile phone.
              
              For more details on the JAE, applicants can visit the JAE website or call the MOE Customer Service Centre on 6872-2220 during the hotline's operating hours.
              
              In addition, students can also participate in the Joint Polytechnic Special Admissions Exercise (JPSAE).
              
              The JPSAE complements the JAE by allowing polytechnics to consider applicants based on a broader measure of merit beyond academic performance in the GCE O-Level exams, MOE said.
              
              Students may apply to both JPSAE and JAE, which run concurrently, but can only accept one if they receive offers from both.
              
              The posting results for JPSAE have been tentatively scheduled for release on Jan 29.

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">  Poly education is now increasingly popular as a post secondary education route. However there are many students who still have doubts and misconception of poly education which I will soon address some</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">  Firstly, one of the reasons that deterred students from considering poly education is the fear that it is hard to score well in Poly, which in turn reduces their chances to enter local universities(NUS/ NTU). As a student of Temasek Poly Aerospace engineering(gpa 3.87) , I can safely say that this is a misconception. In fact it is actually easy to score in Poly (gpa &gt;3.7). If one put in the hard work, you will almost certainly (99%) score well. In fact in my class(30 students), many scored around a gpa of 3.7-3.8 and around 7 students scored a perfect gpa score of 4.0. This means that many are eligible for courses such as aerospace engineering/chemical engineering etc.(http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html) <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Only 1 or 2 students scored badly as they the lazy type or slackers who skip lectures and tutorials. As a widely known fact, the number of Poly students entering local universities (especially NUS, NTU). My friends and seniors who chose Poly education are also doing quite well. In fact some of them even do well enough to get scholarships.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">  'In university education, JC students will own Poly students in Science and Math'. This is also a common misconception. If you take a look at Poly syllabus, at least for engineering( for example http://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/eng/aerospace-engineering-t51#tab6), our syllabus is almost similar to JC syllabus( h2 physics, h2 math), or maybe even more in depth. For example in thermal physics(H2 physics), it covers specifically the different methods of heat transfer, specific heat capacity, latent heat, ideal gas law and 1st law of thermodynamics. In poly, with addition to the mentioned topics, we also learn how to apply the 2nd law of thermodynamics and the equations of conduction, convection and radiation. For Engineering Math in poly, we learn more about calculus (more ways to differentiate and integrate, applying it to engineering problems in our society). Thus it is incorrect to say that JC students will be better academically than Poly students in U<span style="line-height: 1.231;">niversity.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">  Another reason some students prefer JC to Poly is because they believe that Poly is more project based learning and they dislike this style of learning/ they felt that they are weaker in such learning style. Well, fear not. There are courses, in fact many courses, that are more theory based (such as accounting, chemical engineering, aerospace engineering etc). There are only a small amount of project work which mainly focuses on presentation and public speaking so as too groom you to become a confident leader who has the language skills and the ability to lead. (In fact JC also have H1 project work lol). At least for engineering courses, you muggers can mug all you want in your exams and tests to clinch your As. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">  In conclusion, Poly is an excellent post secondary education to consider about. With the increasing quality of education in Polytechnics, more students are considering Poly education. Thus Polytechnics not only focus on producing quality workers and leaders to the workforce , but also producing students who are well equipped with the knowledge required for further education.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> Ps: Not trying to start a poly vs jc debate here. Just trying to point out the advantages of Poly education so that students can compare between different post secondary education routes.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 9.848px;">Excellent post. </span>Poly education has always been good since my time. </p>
              <p>Just to highlight two important stuff:</p>
              <p>"If one put in the hard work, you will almost certainly (99%) score well."<br>--&gt; Applies for everything.<br>One would fail at JC too if one did not put in the hard work.</p>
              <p>Regarding TP's aerospace engineering, the L1R4 requirement is 12 points and below. <br>It would be fair to say that all the candidates in this engineering requirement has the capability to enter JC and do just as well for A Level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall, poly does give more than JC in terms of education, and that has been the way since years ago. It requires the student to make a decision immediately after O Level on what he/she wants to work as upon graduation, unlike for students going to JC who only need to make the most critical decision after A level. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My only gripe for poly education going to university comes in two points, and it has absolutely nothing do do with the quality of education at all. Posted it before, but essential that I post again.</p>
              <p>1) Poly education covers first year university stuff, which means poly students get to skip the first year uni modules and do it in 3 years instead of 4 (for engineering at least). For guys, the disadvantage comes due to NS. Immediately after NS, poly guys enter into uni engineering 2nd year, and have to compete with 2nd year students. Essentially, guys will be competing with their poly knowledge they get from at least 2+ years ago against students who just learned it less than a year ago. Be it Physics or Maths. </p>
              <p>It's still possible, but the amount of extra work needed just to compete is likely tremendous for most. </p>
              <p>2) It may seem like an advantage to do only 3 years of university, but it will be tougher in the final year of uni for poly students than JC students. I say only for engineering as that's where my experience lie.</p>
              <p>Going from JC to uni, it means I have to take a 4 years engineering course. What this means that during my first two years, I could cram the maximum number of modules, and take on an Industrial Attachment and a Student Exchange Program in my 3rd year, and still have lesser modules in my final year though I chose not to.</p>
              <p>For poly students, the first year university modules that are exempted does not include all first year university modules taken by JC students. In the 3 years of university, you may have to cram more modules each semester than the average JC-to-uni student path, and likely have more modules in the final year of uni. The final year is important because this is where you have your final year project and you will really want to score for it. </p>
              <p>And it is tougher for poly-to-uni students to have sufficient university time to explore the different student programs without extending their university stay -&gt; that means spending an extra year in school? Even for JC-to-uni students, certain student programs already require them to extend a semester or two to complete. </p>

              <p>What makes you think they are working on sunday?The results are delivered not only personally to the school(usually early morning on day of release)but also via soft copy(day before release usually) to all HODs from MOE,which will be disseminated to respective subject teachers,so one will know the score of each of their students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence,this is nothing related to working on Sundays.If you dont know anything about how o level results is actually being disseminated please dont just shoot off your mouth like that.</p>
