              <p>Dear taytahrek,</p>
              <p>Many school recommends student to opt for Chemistry and Physics. Chemistry is a subject all if not most student must take. Biology and Physics is actually the option. Physics is more favourite by most teacher because I do not know the reason why. Perhaps most of them attended JC. Never play so much of your life in your seniors words. It best to go with what you feel is the best for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Biology is learning about how our own body. We learn about plants and how they interact with the environment. Basically, half is about plants~ and another half is about humans. If I were to ask you, Do you know how a sandwich provides energy for daily activities, you will learn about digestions~ You will learn basic components of blood, and organs, and a little molecular genetics.</p>
              <p>Physics is more about every day life. Gravitational force, and other sort of forces that governs the world. How things works and the energies involved. I am not the position to provide more examples of physics because I do not take physics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you want to know how our mysterious body work? or Do you want to understand the applications of energy to daily life?</p>

              <p>My sch compulsory sia..all double sci students take chem &amp; physics. Physics is more of a common sense thing. Some ppl thought that if they wanna be a doctor, then they must take bio, but it's wrong. This combination ( chem + physics) to me is  a more safer route though.</p>

              <p>Compared to Physics, I agree that Biology is a lot more about memory work. The more popular combination of combined science will actually be Physics and Chemistry. <span style="font-size: 15.6px;">For some people, memory work is a killer, but for some people, they actually find Biology better than Physics. </span></p>
              <p>The first thing you should ask yourself is if you are more interested in Physics or Biology. You are unlikely to do well in what you do not like.</p>
              <p>Next, do you have the confidence to do well with this combination? If you think you will fare better with Physics, then feel free to go ahead and appeal.</p>
              <p>Third, ask yourself if you can cope. If you are taking history as well and you think you cannot do that much memory work, then appealing for another combination will be a wise choice.</p>

              <p>i believe that the reason why most schools offer only Chem/Physics for double sciences option is that if you were to pursue the JC track in the future and would wish to get a Uni placing, O level Physics is quite important for H2 Physics at A levels which is important for Engineering-related courses (which is rumoured to be easier for Uni entry). perhaps that's why Chem/Bio is seen as the 'killer combi' (not in my opinion though).</p>
              <p>however, if you are ultra sure that you are not Physics-inclined from your lower secondary experience (I believe you can actually look at your Science Chapter Tests' results, see if you fared better for 'Physics chapters' or 'Bio chapters'), perhaps you should give Bio a try.</p>
              <p>from my own experience, certain Physics concepts and formulae that you'll encounter in Sec 3/4 are actually better explained if they are presented using Calculus; but they're not done so as Calculus is only introduced later in A Maths. as a result, the concepts and formulae do not make as much sense to many Physics students and they tend to struggle in the subject.</p>
              <p>there is less concern regarding this in Biology; so as long as you can understand what the concept is about, you should be safer. Nevertheless, i agree that memory work seemed to be important in Biology as you are required to describe many processes that occur inside the organism in question, for e.g. homeostasis, photosynthesis, comparing dialysis and kidney's function. <br><br>having said thus far, the decision still lies in your hand and as long as you have made up your mind, keep yourself focused and strive towards your target. Good Luck!</p>
