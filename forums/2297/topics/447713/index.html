            <div class='col-md body'><p> Hi guys, as you know, i was able to get into Higher Nitec in Accounting and i have the motivation to do well in this course but my parents are asking me to retake my maths as i got D7 for it, Should i consider retaking? i really have no mood to study maths and i want to move on and concentrate my studies so that hopefully i do well enough to get into poly. and Second question, hopefully if i do well in this course, when i apply to poly, do they look at my g.p.a or my o level results? :/ im scared that they might look at my O level results instead. I hope you guys give me your sincere opinions and advice. Thanks</p></div>

              <p>Mr, Firstly, did you even read the first sentence? I stated that i was <strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ABLE</em></span></span></strong> get into the course. Did you even pass your english? if you did, your marker is blind(not saying that my English is good either). Secondly, I got an A2 for POA and that is why i applied for this course as i was interested in it and have some knowledge on it. Thirdly, from your first sentence, " Accounting is all about maths. ", i knew that you dont know anything about this particular subject when you wrote this, yes indeed maths plays an important role in accounting, but it just a Numerical factor in the subject, just like the Balance sheet,Ledger accounts,Trading,profit and loss accounts. These are one of the few main topics in accounting but they don't require any high level maths to do it, Just theory and some accounting concepts and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>simple calculations</em></strong></span></span> are used.Lastly, i asked for sincere opinions and advices, not CRITISISM.</p>

              <p>There's calculus containing stuff like implicit differentiation and integration, and also statistics which can be a pain in the ass sometimes. Then there is also economics which is brain wrecking if you can't grasp the concepts... I don't want to criticise, but POA is only a small part of accounting.... </p>
              <p>As for the ITE to poly thing... from what i know, they would not really look at your O lvl  results as the higher NITEC qualification is 'higher' than O lvls. So they will look at the more advance one. Just to confirm, you can call the poly admissions centre, quite helpful when I wanted to transfer there but didnt.</p>
