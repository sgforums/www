              <p>Hey people.</p>
              <p>I'm an O' Level Music student, and I'm taking Music as my 9th subject for my O' Level examinations this year, in addition to double pure sciences, double mathematics, double languages and double humanities, though I am not part of any Music Elective Programme. (my school doesn't offer it).</p>
              <p>I have already finished ABRSM Grade 8 Music theory and Piano.</p>
              <p>My components would include going for a Major in music performing, and a Minor in music writing, and the main paper.</p>
              <p>The main paper should be manageable with a lot of studying.</p>
              <p>The minor in music writing is simply coursework, and should be no problem for me.</p>
              <p>The major in music performing requires me to be adept at one instrument and voice, or two instruments.</p>
              <p>I plan to perform two contrasting pieces on the piano, namely Fantasie Impromptu, and a Sonata composed by Scarletti,  and sing one piece (as my third piece).</p>
              <p>I really need help on selecting, or even singing the third piece of my choice. <br>The criteria states, singing purely with voice and accompaniment of an instrument, one song from any style/genre.</p>
              <p>What? I am confused. Nobody else in my school's history has taken voice as their 2nd instrument. And all 3 music teachers in my school were strongly against me taking voice as a 2nd instrument, even though I am in my school's choir, have a very good vocal range and have good vocal technique. They simply advised against it, not because I was not up to it, but because it simply wasn't a good idea for ANYONE to do such a thing.</p>
              <p>But what's done is done. And now I need advice on it. <br>Does anyone know any songs to recommend? It has to be at least of Grade 4 ABRSM singing standard, and can be from any style/genre. The few people I know who have sung a song as their third piece with voice had no advice for me.</p>
              <p>I also need advice on the main paper and the piano performing segment. <br>Do they judge harshly? Worse than ABRSM standard? General Advice?</p>
              <p>I know some schools only require a student to have Grade 4 ABRSM music qualifications before taking O' Level Music as a subject, while my school required Grade 6 ABRSM music qualifications..</p>
              <p>Has anyone here taken O' Level Music before? Regardless of whatever instrument, qualifications or grades you obtained, or if you even liked the subject or not, please share your experience and advice.</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Maybe you can get your music teacher's help to ask him/her to clarify for you from the board. This is his/her duty to do so to ensure the student fully understand and comprehend what is required.</p>
              <p>From there, then you music teacher can provide you with advice and guidance. Also try to contact people who have also made the same choice. You can ask your teacher's help on this also, or contact directly friends/students from other schools that have made the same choice. Then approach their teacher. They may refer you to a music centre, there teachers could train with you on your selected piece.</p>

              <p>I went to google to try and find some help.</p>
              <p>Completely zero on someone else doing voice, though I did get some tips on the other sections of the paper.</p>
              <p>My teacher simply recommended me to ask for outside help (i.e. this forum) as she isn't sure as well.</p>
