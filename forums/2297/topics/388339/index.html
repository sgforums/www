              <p>Hmm..maybe it applies to some teenagers that they knew the existing problem just that they do not take it seriously. I agree that teenagers are not aware about this problem, perhaps most of the teenagers. I have friends who are like that, keep telling me they are fat. But actually they are not. If their mind continues in this way and keeps having the fear of being fat, it might result them being anorexia nervosa.</p>
              <p>I think that sometimes the teenager began this behaviour is to try to fix other problems.They began self-starvation, binge eating, purging as they felt terribly out of control either in their personal life or outside environment example having family problems, stress from schoolwork, social problems like being teased about their appearance.</p>

              <p>There are two types of eating disorders among teenagers nowadays.</p>
              <p>One is anorexia nervosa, the other one is bulimia. They want to eat less and keep thin even though they are already very thin. But they are under nourished, so there will be a noticeable change in them. They will become skeletally thin, drift apart from friends, a change in their behaviour and much more... The person will change so much that even your best friend seems to be a stranger anymore...</p>
              <p>Bulimia is also as harmful as anorexia nervosa. The teenagers eat and eat and eat, until they are about to explode. Then they eat laxatives and vomit everything out. This will have a harmful effect on their bodies. Cos I learnt in Biology lesson that when a person keep forcing themselves to vomit, their vomitting reflex will stop working and they can't vomit anymore. So, they may eat until they are bloated... then mati...</p>
