              <p>Now we have A1/A2/A3/A4 and B1/B2/B3/B4 and KNOW which side is heavier/lighter.</p>
              <p>Remove A1/A2 and B1 PLUS add a geniune C coin to A3/A4 AND switch A4 and B4 around (TRACK A4/B4)...</p>

              <p>A3/B4/C against B2/B3/A4</p>
              <p><strong>If BALANCED then counterfeit is in A1/A2(LHS)/B1(RHS)</strong></p>
              <p>Remove A2. Move B1 to LHS and place 2 geniune on RHS.</p>
              <p>If balanced, then it is A2. Recall tilt in try No.2</p>
              <p>If unbalanced and tilt same way, then it is A1. Recall tilt in try No.2</p>
              <p>If unbalanced and tilt changed, then it is B1. Use your common sense to know lighter/heavier.</p>
              <p><strong>If unbalanced and tilt unchanged, THEN it is either A3/B2/B3</strong></p>
              <p>Repeat above concept.</p>
              <p><strong>If unbalanced BUT tilt changed, THEN it is A4/B4</strong></p>
              <p>Replace A4 with geniune to weight against B4.</p>
              <p>If balanced, B4 is geniune. Recall tilt from 2nd try to know A4 is heavier/lighter.</p>
              <p>If unbalanced, B4 is counterfeit. See to know lighter/heavier.</p>

              <p>im sorry, but actually i dont quite get this bit. so if lets say C4 is not the counterfeit, are you gonna remove anything from the scale first before your next step?</p>
              <p>you remove C2, and you put either C1 or C2 on the LHS am i right? and on the other side you have 2 coins. but its already not balanced when its a 1v2 right?</p>
              <p>actually 1 more question i have to ask is whether removing of coins counts as a try.</p>

              <p>In my 1st try, I eliminated group A and B.</p>
              <p>Before my 2nd try I know the counterfeit is in group C.</p>
              <p>Either C1, C2, C3 or C4.</p>
              <p>C4 is removed BEFORE try no.2.</p>
              <p>Try No.2 consist of C1, C2, C3 AND 1 GENUINE coin from the 8 genuine coins I discovered in try No.1</p>
              <p>I put C1+C3 on the left hand side AND C2 WITH the genuine coin on the RHS.</p>
              <p>If C1+C3 balanced with C2+genuine coin, then C4 is the counterfeit.</p>
              <p>Now if they don't balance, the counterfeit is either C1,C2 or C3.</p>
              <p>PRETEND C1+C3 was heavier than C2+genuine on the 2ND TRY.</p>
              <p>Now I remove C3 from the weighting and move C2 to the LHS. Put 2 geniune coins on the RHS.</p>
              <p>NOW I have C1+C2 on the LHS and 2 geniune coins on the RHS.</p>
              <p>PRETEND C1+C2 is lighter than the 2 genuine coins. THIS MEAN LHS was heavier on the 2nd try BUT lighter on the 3rd try. Since the scale tilt, IT MUST BE because the counterfeit SWITCHED sides.</p>
              <p>Since C2 switched sides, C2 is the counterfeit.</p>
              <p>Since C1(geniune)+C2(counterfeit) is lighter than 2 genuine coins, thus counterfeit is lighter.</p>
              <p>I illustrated 1 situation to you. You can test the other situations.</p>
