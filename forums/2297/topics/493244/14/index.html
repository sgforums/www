              Well, that's coz I consider "students be informed of where to assemble,
              what to expect and things to bring for the O" as a part of 'Orientation activities'. And as for the withdrawals, appeals and transfers, it makes more sense for these to take place during the 'Orientation activities' period, rather than when actual tutorials &amp; lectures begin, which differs across JCs, since MOE leaves details like this to the principals to decide.

              <p>Hello, I need some advice/opinions on JAE Appeal. During the JAE application period, I was very overwhelmed by all the information and I decided to go for a course of my interest(engineering) at that point of time. While waiting for the results, I realised that I really want to pursue Food Science and Technology(SP) after much thoughts and I'm gonna appeal in. As I put that as one of my last few choices for JAE, it is unlikely I will get into the course.<span style="font-size: 16px;"> How high would the success rate be if I appeal to go to the course? Is there anyone who appealed successfully to their choices? </span></p>
              <p>This is my results</p>
              <p>Chinese: A1</p>
              <p>Geography: A2</p>
              <p>English, Emath, Amath, Physics, Chemistry, Comb Humans: B3</p>
              <p>My raw ELR2B2 is 12 and my net is 10.</p>
              <p>I'm kinda worried right now ._.</p>

              <p>Your ELR2B2 is good, so you can give an appeal a try.</p>
              <p>The appeal is based on computer selection and also human intervention. So if there are not too many appeal cases wanting to get into your desired course and there are more people opting out of the course, you stand a high chance.</p>
              <p>Nobody actually knows your chances in this forum as it is based on the popularity of the courses (SP courses are quite popular) and whether the poly's allocated number of vacancies for students of that course has been met. Only the course administrators of the poly course have first hand knowledge.</p>
              <p>You meet the cop, but my concern is that the number of places for the course is limited.</p>
              <p>Do you know the career prospects of this course? Do speak to SP course counselors.</p>

              <p>School administrative department announced themselves on the day after the end of jae course selection during assembly,so everyone in the school knows.</p>
              <p>For science department,I dont know much about physics(since i take H2 Bio+H2 Chem),but i can say that H2 Chem notes are really comparable and have little/slight difference to top JCs notes,with exception to tutorial questions which I believe the better JCs provide more difficult questions which will benefit students learning.</p>
              <p>As for H2 Bio,its on the other end of the spectrum.In my honest opinion,my school bio notes are pretty messy and inconsistent in terms of being concise and straight to the point in terms of content for every chapter.So when worse come to worse,I just refer to other school JC notes(Eg. RJC) as an alternative to supplement my reading.So if anyone who ended up getting posted to PJC Science today has the interest to take H2 Bio,be prepared to make a shit ton of notes to consolidate your understanding and also spend a bit of money to source out other school bio notes too as from my experience,last minute reading of bio notes can tilt one over a lot and make one fail,as opposed to h2 chem where last minute reading the day before exam can still get A.</p>

              <p>Nope,I'm currently a J2 this year,so will prob know my A lvl chinese results only at end Feb(Its prob bad oh well),and PW results at end march-early april.</p>
              <p>I think my cohort agreed that our school bio notes was somewhat messy and not straight to the point,from the first banded class all the way to the last class.Eventually the teachers heard about it and my class somewhat got scolded about it,and were told that they shouldn't be doing the job that students should do,which is making notes.</p>
              <p>I didn't really last minute study H2 Bio,in fact I revised for like 1 month before that all the way but chem like 2-3 days before exam,in the end promos B(my school promo cohort only had 2% A,and 15%B for bio),h2 chem instead had 24%A,25.25%B.But these stats are said to be way better than last year according to teachers.</p>
              <p>Its not really misleading,given the syallabus change this year onwards for H2 Bio,a lot of questions in the paper are now rather inferential and context based,like the 20 marks essay question in p2 which requires application of some content to something else one hasn't learnt before and also in p3 whereby the new scientific paper question is based on good reading skills of the preamble to craft your answers.Even for my school promos,some of the questions were really tough,due to the fact that you have never seen them before.</p>
              <p>Anyways,after taking my first bio and chem test in j2,the chem paper standard has legit risen to a new level comparable to difficulty of doing h2 bio also according to my frens,which I can't really feel the difference.</p>

                                          <p>Nope,I'm currently a J2 this year,so will prob know my A lvl
                                          chinese results only at end Feb(Its prob bad oh well),and PW
                                          results at end march-early april.</p>
                                          <p>I think my cohort agreed that our school bio notes was somewhat
                                          messy and not straight to the point,from the first banded class all
                                          the way to the last class.Eventually the teachers heard about it
                                          and my class somewhat got scolded about it,and were told that they
                                          shouldn't be doing the job that students should do,which is making
                                          notes.</p>
                                          <p>I didn't really last minute study H2 Bio,in fact I revised for
                                          like 1 month before that all the way but chem like 2-3 days before
                                          exam,in the end promos B(my school promo cohort only had 2% A,and
                                          15%B for bio),h2 chem instead had 24%A,25.25%B.But these stats are
                                          said to be way better than last year according to teachers.</p>
                                          <p>Its not really misleading,given the syallabus change this year
                                          onwards for H2 Bio,a lot of questions in the paper are now rather
                                          inferential and context based,like the 20 marks essay question in
                                          p2 which requires application of some content to something else one
                                          hasn't learnt before and also in p3 whereby the new scientific
                                          paper question is based on good reading skills of the preamble to
                                          craft your answers.Even for my school promos,some of the questions
                                          were really tough,due to the fact that you have never seen them
                                          before.</p>
                                          <p>Anyways,after taking my first bio and chem test in j2,the chem
                                          paper standard has legit risen to a new level comparable to
                                          difficulty of doing h2 bio also according to my frens,which I can't
                                          really feel the difference.</p>

                                          Fair enough.<p>But by MOE-Cambridge design of the A level system, all H2 subjects (with the *only* exception of H2 Math versus H2 Further Math) must compulsorily be of equal difficulty.</p><p>Hence, even after (or especially after) considering the new syllabus tweaks, H2 Physics, H2 Chemistry and H2 Biology, will certainly be of the same difficulty, at least in the eyes of Cambridge.</p><p>Though one curious peculiarity of H2 Biology (and this is at least in part, due to the nature of the subject) has always been : Singapore JC exam papers and mark schemes tend to be written at a significantly more demanding (oftentimes unreasonably so) level than the actual A level papers (in a different and disadvantageous manner for students, when compared to H2 Physics and H2 Chemistry, for which the Prelim papers are at least educationally and usefully tougher; not quite the case for H2 Biology), and this is reflected in the anomalous results (both Prelims and actual A levels) vis-Ã -vis the other H2 Sciences.</p>

              <p>Hi Ultimaonline,</p>
              <p>How are you? Hope you are doing fine. 2 students have told me that H2 Bio is more difficult than H2 chem for them personally because it is applications based and the questions are more novel in the new syllabus.  The students have found it hard to score in bio papers in JC.</p>
              <p>But I am unsure about the difference in standards of JC Bio exam papers and actual Cambridge papers.</p>
              <p> So maybe you are right in your posts. But H2 Bio is no longer just memory work in the new syllabus.</p>
              <p>Cheers and regards.</p>

                  Hi Chemguide7, thanks for asking.<p>In the past syllabus, H2 Bio was significantly less application based than either H2 Chem or H2 Phys. So the revision for the new Bio syllabus is really just playing catch up with Chem &amp; Phys, in terms of emphasizing application over regurgitation.</p><p>For the A level papers, Cambridge has much higher quality control across the subjects, compared to Singapore JCs.</p><p>So if the new H2 Bio syllabus A level papers are going to be tougher, than Cambridge will make sure the new H2 Chem and H2 Physics syllabus A level papers will also be equally tougher.

              <p>Hi Iamsofab1,</p>
              <p> Maybe you can try ITE or retake your O levels or go to a private institute (expensive) for a private diploma or La Salle or NAFA.</p>
              <p> If you want to retake O levels, it is best to approach your secondary school and speak to a HOD. Or you can try appealing to nursing course in certain polys by emailing them or make a trip to the poly or MOE.</p>
              <p> Or you can retake O levels with a private institute eg. BMC (quality not assured; expensive), City college at http://www.citycollege.edu.sg/slp/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best and regards.</p>
