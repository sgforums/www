              Getting more sleep should be your priority, not the JC, which doesn't matter as much as your own determination and perseverance.<p>Also, don't be complacent : you won't be the only big fish in that small pond. Many other students will also have the same idea as you, and many 10+ pointers will also enter into YJC and the other neighbourhood JCs to be big fishes in small ponds (although to say 6 pointers are rushing to enter MI for this purpose is a bit too much of an exaggeration).</p><p>So don't think it'll be a piece of cake to be the top 5% in YJC or any neighbourhood JC, just because your L1R5 is a few points lower than the JC's cut off point.</p>

              If you say you "dunno where to go", means you're not suited for Poly. But since your L1R5 CMI to JC, you have to either retake O levels (eg. private candidate if your school won't let you retain), or apply to MI.<p>But I advise you to carefully study all the Poly courses available based on your L1R4, to see if any appeals to you, in terms of a future career. If don't have, then either retake your O levels, or go MI.</p>

              No idea about the L1R2B2 (during my time many decades ago got no such thing).<p>Then retake your O levels lor. Not only for the purpose of getting into JC, but also for the purpose of increasing your options in Poly.

              <p>Well, DEEE (Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering) is the most popular course in SP Engineering. Since you are un-decided, you could consider this course as this course has streaming in second year, where you would be streamed into a certain specialisation (eg. Power Engineering) (refer to the course description website for more information).</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you could consider the Common Engineering Programme, where at second year, you would be channeled to a diploma course (and continue from there). This course got less demand, but otherwise it's about the same as DEEE. Similarly, for more information, please refer to the course description page for Common Engineering Programme.</p>

              Compared to the other JCs you can get in with 14 points, no significant difference (in terms of academic ability), since YJC's cut-off is 16 points for Science (used to be 20 points by deliberate policy decades ago).<p>So yes, definitely go YJC, because distance (ie. getting more sleep) is the most prudent factor to consider. And your 14 points is just nice to safely satisfy YJC's 16 points. So your choice is clear. YJC is the best JC for you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Can anyone tell me more about the Business Studies and Tourism &amp; Resort Management in NP as well as Business Administration and Tourism &amp; Resort Management in SP?  (I've heard a bit when I went for their open house but I'd like to know more from other people's perspectives) It'll be good if you can talk more about the prospects of it in the future. Would it be better if I go from DTRM to studying business in Uni since it's more diverse? Thanks in advanced.</p></div>

              If you don't meet the JC's cut off point, you've no chance of getting in. But no harm still putting it as your 1st few choices, if you want to.<p>Go ahead and put NP and SP's accounting and finance courses as your 1st few choices.</p><p>If you can't get into these top poly courses, then try out JC. In other words, don't put a easier-to-get-into poly course into your choices, if you're not committed to these courses and future careers. Only put the poly courses which you really want, ie. accounting and finance, and if you don't get into these, then go the JC route.</p>

              <p>Start your O level revision early (preferrably at least 4-5 months before O levels) to avoid last-minute cramping. Also, practice your TYS books religiously as past year questions tend to repeat for future year O level papers and you will also be more familiar with the type of questions asked at the O levels. Do find your teachers for consultation and clear your doubts asap! All the best!</p>

              <p>Help! I'm in a dilemma on weather I should put PJC or TPJC Arts
              stream as my first choice. I scored 13 points nett for my L1R5
              which is the COP for the Arts stream for both JCs. Distance-wise,
              both JCs take about the same travelling time for me of about 50
              minutes, (I live in the central), so I guess distance is not much
              of an issue. But in terms of academic reputatation and school
              culture, which of the 2 JCs is a better choice? Which of the 2 JCs
              is more competitive to enter than the other? Which JC should I put
              as my first choice? TIA for any adivce.</p>
