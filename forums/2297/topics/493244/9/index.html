              <p><br> Getting more sleep should be your priority, not the JC, which
                  doesn't matter as much as your own determination and
                  perseverance.</p>
              <p>Also, don't be complacent : you won't be the only big fish in
                  that small pond. Many other students will also have the same idea
                  as you, and many 10+ pointers will also enter into YJC and the
                  other neighbourhood JCs to be big fishes in small ponds (although
                  to say 6 pointers are rushing to enter MI for this purpose is a bit
                  too much of an exaggeration).</p>
              <p>So don't think it'll be a piece of cake to be the top 5% in YJC
                  or any neighbourhood JC, just because your L1R5 is a few points
                  lower than the JC's cut off point.</p>

              <p>Thank you for the sound advice, I'll keep that in mind especially the not to be complacent part! The thing is, I know that I'm not very self-driven and may not be determined enough (since I still don't know what I'm aiming for at uni) and am afraid that I'll be affected by the people surrounding me... Should I still go for shortest distance (and hopefully find people who are as motivated to study as me?? and find ways to motivate myself)  or other school where there may be a larger number of more motivated people so in a way they influence me and make me more motivated??

By far.<p>Regardless of which JC you get into (from RJC to MI), for your H2 subjects, find <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=bedokfunland+jc">a good tuition</a>. Not only will your fellow tuition students be highly motivated (hence making your learning more conducive compared to at school), but with good guidance from <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=bedokfunland+jc">a good tutor</a>, you'll excel in your H2 subjects, and you'll get to enjoy being the biggest fish in your small pond.</p>

              <p>Help please! I'm interested in CJC currently cause of its CCA and also curriculum. Anyone from CJC maybe can let me know if i don't meet the requirements of taking F maths, can i still take? I'm a combined science student and i score all A1s in both math and science ( physics chem ). However, the requirements for F maths other than distinctions in math, but also at least C6 in physics. </p>
              <p>Now, I have the choice of either going with that which is a low possibility or go with H2 econs math physics and H1 chem. Do you think it's a wise choice to take H2 econs and also H1 chem? any students that took H2 econs can let me know how it feels like? I'm scared i'm not interested in econs and as econs requires a lot of writing, my english isn't that good and i'm scared i cannot make it. I read through the syllabus and found it uninteresting though. Any opinions? </p>

                  Yes, plus personal experience (as both a student and an ex-MOE teacher). Medical science has shown that humans need at least 8 hours of sleep every day. Almost all JC students only get 5-6 hours of sleep per day.<p>Sleep Deprivation --&gt; Brain Damage ---&gt; Lower IQ ---&gt; Worse A level results.</p><p>No prob, if in future got suitable opportunity to join my tuition, feel free to PM me :)</p>

                              <p>Help please! I'm interested in CJC currently cause of its CCA
              and also curriculum. Anyone from CJC maybe can let me know if i
              don't meet the requirements of taking F maths, can i still take?
              I'm a combined science student and i score all A1s in both math and
              science ( physics chem ). However, the requirements for F maths
              other than distinctions in math, but also at least C6 in
              physics. </p>
              <p>Now, I have the choice of either going with that which is a low
              possibility or go with H2 econs math physics and H1 chem. Do you
              think it's a wise choice to take H2 econs and also H1 chem? any
              students that took H2 econs can let me know how it feels like? I'm
              scared i'm not interested in econs and as econs requires a lot of
              writing, my english isn't that good and i'm scared i cannot make
              it. I read through the syllabus and found it uninteresting though.
              Any opinions? </p>

              You don't need Econs at A levels to take Econs in Uni. You need H2 Chem at A levels to take Science courses in Uni. H1 Chem is utterly useless. Take H2 Chem and H1 Econs. For the sake of your future in Uni.

                  Go for a good Econs tuition, no prob liao.<p>What about the grading system you don't get? Not very different from O levels.</p><p>If you're referring to the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/docs/NUS%20IGP%202016.pdf">NUS / NTU / SMU / etc Indicative Grade Profiles</a>, the X X X / Y refers to your H2 H2 H2 / H1 grades, assuming you score at least a C grade for GP and PW. Note that some courses, eg. Law, requires an A grade in GP.</p>

              Science stream opens a lot more doors in Uni compared to Arts / Humans (just honestly saying). H2 Phys for all Engineering courses, H2 Chem for all other Science courses. Best is to take both, if you can.<p>Put MJC as your 1st choice, CJC as your 2nd choice. Distance (ie. more sleep) is the most important factor, and you stay in Pasir Ris. CJC as a 2nd choice is a safety net since you've affiliation bonus points. You've no chance for SAJC and TJC, because cut-off points have to be strictly enforced, non-DSA appeals are useless.</p>

              In other words, don't put a easier-to-get-into poly course into
              your choices, if you're not committed to these courses and future
              careers. Only put the poly courses which you really want, ie.
              accounting and finance, and if you don't get into these, then go

Cause the required grades for GP and PW are not stated. So, if i score the minimum grade and C for both GP and PW, is there a high chance I can get in? </p>
