              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> Mass comm in Ngee Ann poly is very popular. You can try appealing but competition is stiff. Just hope that some applicants withdraw from the course and you can get in.</p>
              <p> If you just met the cutoff point then chances are not too great as standards of cop maybe raised this year for this course.</p>
              <p> All the best. You can try other mass comm courses at other polys. Ultimately, it is the students' hard work and students can excel in any of the polys if they work hard.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> I heard that H2 Math is tough even for those who have taken A Math in O levels. Maybe I can suggest H2 Geog and H1 Math. However, H2 Geog also has raised in standards of its assessment as it is a new revised syllabus. I have no ready solutions for you as your SS is also quite weak at O levels. Can someone else confirm that H2 Math is tough?</p>

              <p>Heyy i totally suggest you should go higher nitec, maintain gpa of 3.5 and above for the 2 yrs and pick any course of your liking when you go poly. Btw, you need to maintain almost 3.8-4.0 gpa for the 2 yrs you are in ite in order to gurantee you are able to jump to yr 2 of poly. if not, you will still have to take 5 yrs to get a diploma!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> I can only answer part of your question: Kaplan offers a faster way to get a diploma. However, you need to do very well in the diploma as some companies do not fully recognise a Kaplan diploma. With a Kaplan diploma, you can finish your university (maybe Kaplan again) much faster than if you go ITE. However, it is costly.</p>

              <p>Hm, what do you mean by hybrid combination streams? And another

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> You can refer to SRJC website here : <a href="http://srjc.moe.edu.sg/joining-our-sr-family/our-curriculum">subjects</a></p>
              <p>I had a student who took H1 Math, H2 Econs, H2 Geog and H2 Chem. It is considered  hybrid combination as it consists of even mix of subjects from the math and science departments and the arts department. You can refer to more subject combinations in the above website.</p>
              <p> Yes, another popular combination is H1 Econs, H2 Math, H2 Physics, H2 Chemistry. You have a point there.</p>

If I am appealing to SRJC but I did not indicate SR as one my 12 choices in the JAE form does that mean I will stand a lower chance of the appeal being successful? I didn't indicate SR as my choices because I thought there would be no way I would get in as my nett L1R5 is too far from the previous COP of 11 but only found out that I am eligible after I checked their webiste. as their COP increased from 11 to 13 for arts which is also my nett L1R5. I was posted to TPJC and I find that it is too far from my home (abt 1+ hour of travelling time) while SRJC is like half the travelling time of that of TPJC.</p></div>

              <p>School administrative department announced themselves on the day
              after the end of jae course selection during assembly,so everyone
              in the school knows.</p>
              <p>For science department,I dont know much about physics(since i
              take H2 Bio+H2 Chem),but i can say that H2 Chem notes are really
              comparable and have little/slight difference to top JCs notes,with
              exception to tutorial questions which I believe the better JCs
              provide more difficult questions which will benefit students
              learning.</p>
              <p>As for H2 Bio,its on the other end of the spectrum.In my honest
              opinion,my school bio notes are pretty messy and inconsistent in
              terms of being concise and straight to the point in terms of
              content for every chapter.So when worse come to worse,I just refer
              to other school JC notes(Eg. RJC) as an alternative to
              supplement my reading.So if anyone who ended up getting posted to
              PJC Science today has the interest to take H2 Bio,be prepared to
              make a shit ton of notes to consolidate your understanding and also
              spend a bit of money to source out other school bio notes too as
              from my experience,last minute reading of bio notes can tilt one
              over a lot and make one fail,as opposed to h2 chem where last
              minute reading the day before exam can still get A.</p>

              <p>however, if u are considering applying for scholarship, then CCA with good track record (holding key position or participated and won competitions, not just attendance) will be a bonus as they will look at not just academic excellence but also if u have leadership qualities and such.........</p>

              <p>im new here. I need some help between choosing yishun jc ad sp eee(electrical and electronic engineering diploma)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> i scored an O level L1R5 of 16(raw) and 15(with bonus point)</p>
              <p>Engish - B3</p>
              <p>Emath - B3</p>
              <p>Comb Sci(phy, chem) - A1</p>
              <p>Humanities - B3</p>
              <p>POA - B3</p>
              <p>D&amp;T - B3</p>
              <p>i got posted to sp electrical and electronic engineering after the jae</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but im really passionate about jc and i am really interested in taking science stream(h2 mathematics phy chem and h1 econs)  and since i meet the cop for yj... thought of appealing to yj science stream even though i dont meet the pre requisite to take h2 mathematics at yj... i am still thinking of appealing as i think i stand a good chance. i dont fancy the poly life cuz i dont like practical stuff more used to theoretical science.</p>
              <p>my main aim is electrical and electronic engineering at ntu or electrical engineering and nus.im also willing to work very hard in jc or poly but i cant decide between yj and sp eee diploma </p>
              <p>if yj appeal is successful i am afraid that i can't get good A level grades and make it to the uni degree i want as yj is quite lacking when compared to all those top jcs...like...after being in a neighbourhood school i am really scared to go to yj... but poly also is quite scary, there are very few uni seats for poly graduates and gpa has to be above 3.9 to get direct entry into second year of uni degree so as to not lag by 1 year</p>
              <p>someone please advice me on what to do...this is URGENT!!!! becoz if i need to appeal to yj... must appeal by monday 6 feb</p>
              <p>pls give me an insight on how easy it is to make it to to eee at ntu from YJC and SP EEE diploma. all this assuming I work very hard</p>
              <p>thanks for the urgent!!!! help<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Nope,I'm currently a J2 this year,so will prob know my A lvl
              chinese results only at end Feb(Its prob bad oh well),and PW
              results at end march-early april.</p>
              <p>I think my cohort agreed that our school bio notes was somewhat
              messy and not straight to the point,from the first banded class all
              the way to the last class.Eventually the teachers heard about it
              and my class somewhat got scolded about it,and were told that they
              shouldn't be doing the job that students should do,which is making
              notes.</p>
              <p>I didn't really last minute study H2 Bio,in fact I revised for
              like 1 month before that all the way but chem like 2-3 days before
              exam,in the end promos B(my school promo cohort only had 2% A,and
              15%B for bio),h2 chem instead had 24%A,25.25%B.But these stats are
              said to be way better than last year according to teachers.</p>
              <p>Its not really misleading,given the syallabus change this year
              onwards for H2 Bio,a lot of questions in the paper are now rather
              inferential and context based,like the 20 marks essay question in
              p2 which requires application of some content to something else one
              hasn't learnt before and also in p3 whereby the new scientific
              paper question is based on good reading skills of the preamble to
              craft your answers.Even for my school promos,some of the questions
              were really tough,due to the fact that you have never seen them
              before.</p>
              <p>Anyways,after taking my first bio and chem test in j2,the chem
              paper standard has legit risen to a new level comparable to
              difficulty of doing h2 bio also according to my frens,which I can't
              really feel the difference.</p>

              <p>PJ science is fine tbh,is just PJ biology notes that are a bit sub-par in comparison to all other subjects.The notes may seem super detailed,thick etc but trust me,when you copy the exact same points from a particular part of a chapter to a question related to it,the tutorial answers are largely different from the notes.</p>
              <p>However,as long as you understand the subject can do decently well one,memorising may not help much in aceing Bio.</p>
              <p>If you are intending to have more time to study for your subjects,esp Bio,come join eco club as a CCA(I'm in there),once a week only so you have more time to study+cca activities more related to environment+bio.But if you don't like a CCA like eco club that is sedentary then just join more purposeful ones like sports CCA or even aesthetics.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can message me privately and ask me more about stuff you really want to know about PJ,would be free to entertain your questions.</p>

              <p>Hi there, sorry for disturbing but is it possible to explain a
              little about the grading system during A levels? I'm not quite sure
              cause like they said S grade for GP is a pass but is it still a
              pass? And what are the relevant scores for each grade kinda
              thing? </p>

              <p>Hello</p>
              <p>S-grade is considered a sub-pass for either a particular h1/h2 subject but in technicality means you have failed the subject,hence implying the name sub-pass,which to me means 'borderline fail' in a sense.</p>
              <p>A particular grade for a particular subject gives you a certain number of points which you can use for your University Admission Score,with each H2 subject giving a max score of 20 points and H1 subject giving a max score of 10 points should you get an A for them.Any subsequent consecutive grades from B to E is 2.5 and 1.25points less than that of the previous grade respectively.An S grade gives you half the points an E grade will give you and a U grade gives you 0 points.</p>
