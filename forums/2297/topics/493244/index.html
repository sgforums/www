              <p>Honestly, the best person to ask is your own parents. They have probably been to JC before, or Poly or ITE.</p>
              <p>Anyway, congratulations on competing secondary education.</p>
              <p>Let your results determine where to go next.</p>
              <p>Do not worry about whether or not the course "got future", because all got future.</p>
              <p>The Poly and ITE courses are created because they need people to do the job.</p>
              <p>The JC courses (subject combinations) are created because the JC principal and teachers know which subject combinations can guarantee a place in our local university.</p>
              <p>As much as possible, follow your interest.</p>
              <p>But if the marks cannot make it, never mind. Just choose the courses that you can qualify.</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p>I really hoped for A1 or A2 in POA, turns out I got B3.</p>
              <p>Failing combined humanities doesn't matter as the course I'm after doesn't need the subject.</p>
              <p>I got F9s for Science and Humanities in Prelims and the whole of Sec 3, so C6 and D7 respectively for these two subjects is fine.</p>

              <p>Hi AidenChan, the admission criteria for JC is L1R5 less than 21 points. To qualify for Poly, the L1R4 has to be less than 30 points.</p>
              <p>CCA get A1 or A2 can deduct 2 points.</p>
              <p>If you already have a Poly course in mind, Poly Foundation would be suitable, if you can qualify (using N level results).</p>

                              <p>Want to consider a business diploma in Polytechnic?</p> <p>Because from the looks of it, your Maths very good, but your memory not good. I do not recommend Engineering, or Biology-Chemistry, because science-related courses need to memorise a lot of things.</p>

              <p>Your Humanities very good. English also. Can try PJC arts stream.</p>
              <p>Avoid MI, even if you can qualify for their science stream. Because ultimately, you are competing with people from the JCs. MI science stream passing rate at A level also not high.</p>

              <p>Guys i really need help in the choice of school im gg to apply for. Here are my result :</p>

              <p>L1R2B2 (ABCD) : all 11-1 = 10</p>
              <p>yes ik my english suck and i cant do anyth about it ... really want to go JC because i think im the type of person who likes to study theory rather than practical . But everyone in  the whole world is like encouraging me to go POLY because i suck at english . Im not trying to say that poly is bad , its just i like the feeling of seating in a classroom hearing lessons instead of going lab and doing stuffs .. and im aiming for a medcine course in NUS which i think i its u achievable already because its supper hard to go in and i heard that people getiing all As in A Level might not be accepted into medcine (thats sad) . But i just need some advice about JC/POLY please help !! I have a few things to clarify and hope u all can help </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I dont know if i should risk my LIFE trying JC Bceause i can imagine how hard it will be for me to study GP . Im willing to try and work hard for it BUT im also worried that all my effort will be gone to waste ( i swear inworled damn hard for english , i went to seek help from my school teachers and read model essay everyday and find lots of good vocab and note it down in my vocab book and also attend tuition ) but still i didnvery bad for english . So its like no matter how hard i worked im still stuck at this result , im rlly scared if i really worked hard for Gp in JC and i fail again ??? And i probably wont have enough time for other subjects ..  failing GP is equivalent to failing A level right and thats way worser than having a Diploma .. but it would be pity for other subjects that i truely LOVE studying theory like CHEM and BIO and both MATHS .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I dont like POLY life too other than the learning style and also the fact that im not v sure about the pathway i want to go in future .  I dont like the social life poly students gotta face because everyone is so judgemental there . Plus im actually wuite a introvert and dont make friends easily HAHA lol and i dont rlly like it because school will be so tough and awkward for me when i dont have friends in poly because theres alot of project work and group work (whereas in JC project work is only for 1 yr ) </p>
              <p>3. I really feel i should try JC because when i was sec 2 , my result is beliw avaerage before i took the streaming exams and everyone told me not to do pure science coz im not very good at my studies . But i studied hard and got into a double sci class and continue top the class for the nxt two years . So after this experirence , i feel that maybe i can do and manage subjects well when i work v hard vecause pure science werent as hard as how they describe actually , but now they are telling me  that JC is damn hard , isit i should take their advice not so seriously because i thought i couldnt cope w pure sci but end up aceing it ..so maybe i can manage jc well too ?? But i really heard ppl saying A lvl is x10 of O lvl so im very confused now .. please give me some advice . Im actually int in gg AJC and SRJC (both sci --8 and 11respevtively)</p>
              <p> also , can some one tell me with the percentage of going to local uni for every jc?</p>
              <p>also , can someone tell me more about H2 CHEM H2 BIO H2 Math H2 chinese lit H1 econs Project work and GP and is geog really hard in JC ?? </p>

                  way worser than having a Diploma .. but it would be pity for other
                  subjects that i truely LOVE studying theory like CHEM and BIO and
                  both MATHS .</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>2. I dont like POLY life too other than the learning style and
                  also the fact that im not v sure about the pathway i want to go in
                  future .  I dont like the social life poly students gotta face
                  because everyone is so judgemental there . Plus im actually wuite a
                  introvert and dont make friends easily HAHA lol and i dont rlly
                  like it because school will be so tough and awkward for me when i
                  dont have friends in poly because theres alot of project work and
                  group work (whereas in JC project work is only for 1 yr ) </p>
                  <p>3. I really feel i should try JC because when i was sec 2 , my
                  result is beliw avaerage before i took the streaming exams and
                  everyone told me not to do pure science coz im not very good at my
                  studies . But i studied hard and got into a double sci class and
                  continue top the class for the nxt two years . So after this
                  experirence , i feel that maybe i can do and manage subjects well
                  when i work v hard vecause pure science werent as hard as how they
                  describe actually , but now they are telling me  that JC is
                  damn hard , isit i should take their advice not so seriously
                  because i thought i couldnt cope w pure sci but end up aceing it
                  ..so maybe i can manage jc well too ?? But i really heard ppl
                  saying A lvl is x10 of O lvl so im very confused now .. please give
                  me some advice . Im actually int in gg AJC and SRJC (both sci --8
                  and 11respevtively)</p>
                  <p> also , can some one tell me with the percentage of going
                  to local uni for every jc?</p>
                  <p>also , can someone tell me more about H2 CHEM H2 BIO H2 Math H2
                  chinese lit H1 econs Project work and GP and is geog really hard in
                  JC ?? </p>
                  <p>thank you so much for reading</p>
                  <p> </p>

                  Obviously you should go JC.<p>You should only choose Poly if you're certain you've a passion for a particular industry, and are certain you will be working in that industry.</p><p>Everyone else should go JC to keep their options open.</p><p>Don't worry about the % of students going to Uni for each JC, because it's yourself which determines your success, not your JC. The only reason why there appears to be a correlation, is simply because best JCs (eg. RJC) get the most academically able students in the first place, with their most demanding L1R5 cut off points. Otherwise, the different JCs' teachers and environments don't make that big a difference at all.</p><p>Retake your O levels as a private candidate (since your secondary school won't allow you to retake, correct?) in order to pass your English to be eligible for JC. But in the meantime, don't waste time, but <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/index.htm#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">start self-studying H2 Chemistry</a> and other H2 subjects on your own.</p><p>In the very worst case scenario, though it shouldn't have to come to that, you can always take A levels as a private candidate if you still can't pass your English at O levels and no JC will accept you (note that if you're a Singaporean guy with National Service obligations, you'll have to finish your NS before taking your A levels as a private candidate).</p><p>General Paper isn't English. You can still do well for GP even if you failed your O level English. Many China students get A grade for GP every year. And there are many good GP tuition centers out there, that can help with your GP.</p>

              <p>I want go JC cuz</p>
              <p>1)i very interested in ECons</p>
              <p>2)I much more of theory person than practical person</p>
              <p>3)i feel that at this stage I choose poly course I don't like I will let myself down </p>
              <p>4)more convenient to land a place in local uni i.e (NTU,NUS)than poly although poly has 40% of uni places now I  don't want to  risk it</p>
              <p>5)I have to compete with single pointers more in poly especially the smart china kids that Super Hao lian get near perfect GPA,that path really die liao.Jc more like everyone roughly the same gauge so less competitive cuz more smartasse going poly</p>
