              <address>i picked up some interest in dentistry after doing
              research about orthodontics....what path should i take to pursue
              dentistry if i choose to go jc.(yjc) if i go to jc my ideal subject
              combi is h2 math chem phy and h1 geog. is that suitable? If i
              choose to go poly instead(tp), would biomedical science be a good
              course for this particular interest? since tp does not have any

              Yes, good thinking. "H2 Chem Math Phy and H1 Geog" is the ideal subject combination.<p>Yes, Biomedical Science is the most relevant Poly course for Dentistry.</p>

              <p>Still kinda unsure why my L1R5 is 11 oops 4 years still don't really know how it's calculated.</p>
              <p>Also am unsure about which stream I should go for but for now I'm leaning towards Science since the results for my sciences look better than my humans. Found out that H2 Geog has 2 3h papers... Pure Geog was pretty fun for me but I didn't work as hard in terms of getting my content all memorised well so that explains the B3.. Not sure if I want more Geog in my life again because of the content load but it's definitely more interesting than pure sciences. Don't mind sciences!</p>
              <p>Currently am thinking about AJC, CJC, SJC, SAJC and I can't really make up my mind! I live in Yishun and school environment does matter but not that much, I'm more concerned about the overall vibes of the students and the teaching/ lessons standards?? Which one of those JCs are more known for being a mugger JC?? Kinda afraid since being around people who don't really want to study can affect my morale, happened to me in Sec Sch :-/</p>
              <p>Also cmi for AJC's science stream, heard the appeal process is stricter, should i try appealing? Missed the COP by 1 point</p>
              <p>TL;DR Kind souls please help hahah <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              That statement can't be right. Nothing can be more interesting than the Sciences (especially Chemistry). Physical Geography is interesting, because it's a Science (mostly Chemistry based).

              Personal preference, but the fact remains that you don't need Econs at either H1 or H2, to study Econs in the Uni. In contrast, you definitely need H2 Chem and H2 Phys to study Science courses in the Uni (note that Pharmacy requires H2 Bio + H2 Chem).

                  No comment about YJC (tbh, still much better than MI in this regard). But in this regard, a <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=BedokFunland+JC">good Tuition class</a> can make a positive difference (after all, you wouldn't attend tuition in the first place if you weren't motivated, so you can be sure your fellow students at tuition classes are generally more motivated than classes in most JCs, comparable to the elite JCs).

              Good that you chose H2 Chem over Bio, as (quite frankly) Chem is more important than Bio, even for Medicine (prerequisite : H2 Chem + H2 Bio or H2 Phys).<p>You should have no problems coping with your subject combination (as long as your JC allows it).

              As I wrote in a previous post on this thread : <p>Combined Science Chem and Pure Chem at O levels, are both equally laughably easy compared to H2 Chem, which means Combined Science students aren't really disadvantaged compared to Pure Science students. So no worries! *evil grin*.</p><p>Just be sure you take H2 Chem. For Engineering courses, H2 Phys is the most impt. For all other Science course, H2 Chem is the most impt. H2 Bio is only required for Pharmacy (ie. H2 Bio not required for Medicine). So be sure take H2 Chem to keep your options open in Uni.</p>

              What you can do (since you're still undecided) : try going JC 1st. If after 1 year you find you can't cope, then drop out and go Poly. This is more feasible than the other way round, ie. it's easier to drop out from JC to go Poly, and harder to drop out from Poly and go JC, in terms of admission process.

              No worries about SPA, now replaced by Practical Paper. SPA or Practical Paper = just obey instructions of the practical procedure, and record observations correctly and make intelligent deductions and conclusions. Your school will give you sufficient help and preparation to prepare for the Practical Paper.<p>Of course, especially with Project Work, the type of classmates you get will affect you. But the type of classmates you get, aren't so simplistically determined by which JC you go. While RJC might have a greater % of more siao-on muggers, and MI might have a greater % of more lepak-lepaks, but in terms of Project Work, it's more about trustworthy, reliable and ethical classmates, and on these characteristics, all kinds of students are found in every JC. So which JC you go won't directly affect this. Besides, which JC you go isn't really up to you : you can only apply for the best JCs your L1R5 can get you into, as well as the JCs nearest to your home. So it's not really much of a choice, so don't stress over stuff you can't control.</p><p>On a related note, for both points above : (your worry about coping with H2 Chem, and about whether your peers are motivated or not), going to a <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=BedokFunland+JC">good Tuition class</a> will make a positive difference on both points. Only motivated students will go for tuition in the first place, which will help make the learning environment more conducive, than might be the case for neighbourbood JCs or MI.

                                                          <p>help, please. i'm  currently still undecided on whether i
                                          should go poly or jc. the thought of having to keep mugging really
                                          puts me off. i'm also not sure whether i'll be able to cope with
                                          the stress in jc sigh. i kinda wanna go poly but i don't really
                                          have much interest in any particular course. i've been looking up
                                          some courses and courses like International Logistics And Supply
                                          Chain Management, Food Science and Technology as well as Early
                                          Childhood Education have caught my eye. Can anyone tell me if these
                                          courses are any good and perhaps share more about these courses? If
                                          i were to go a jc, it would probably be either cjc, pjc, nyjc or
                                          ajc. i'm also interested in finding out more about these jcs, so
                                          please do share with me whatever you may know about them. Thank you
                                          in advance! </p>

                                  <p>Forget about Supply Chain Logistic Management; it's just counting goods in a factory... probably with probability and lots of counting.</p>
                              <p>Forget about Early Childhood Education. It's just a short-term phenomenon; after a while, there won't be so much demand for childhood educators.</p>

                              <p>Another thing is, I've got A1 in chinese for Os but if i take
              Basic Chinese in first year of JC, would i be at a disadvantage if
              i'm pursuing for a Math degree in uni? </p>
              <p>What's the difference in taking basic chinese and normal H1

              No disadvantage, as Chinese isn't a prerequisite for Math. Just make sure you get A grades for all your Maths (ie. H2 Math, H2 Further Math, H3 Math, etc).
