              <p>4)more convenient to land a place in local uni i.e (NTU,NUS)than

              <p>5)I have to compete with single pointers more in poly especially
              the smart china kids that Super Hao lian get near perfect
              GPA,that path really die liao.Jc more like everyone roughly the

              <p>every year i have to remind all that the raw scores are

              <p>Wrong. Net scores first.  So Student A with a raw score of 7 but zero for CCA ends up with a net score of 7.  Student B with raw score of 8 but 2 pts for CCA ends up with a net score of 6 (8-2).  Student B will get the place before Student A, even though Student A's raw score is lower.</p>
              <p>When both net scores are tied e.g. Students A &amp; B both have a net score of 6 and only one vacancy left.  Then Singapore citizens get priority.</p>
              <p>If both net scores and citizenship are tied, then raw score is considered and Student A gets in first.</p>
              <p>If it is still tied e.g. Both students A and B are Singapore citizens, same raw and net scores, then it will be by a computerised ballot.</p>
              <p>The student who did not get in by ballot will be posted to any JC with vacancies if he had put JC as his first choice and if he matches that JC's lowest ranked score. If he had put Poly as his first choice, he will be posted to any Poly with vacancies subject to him meeting the entry requirements.</p>

              <p>Net score of 16 is borderline getting into YJC but no harm trying.</p>
              <p>You scored a distinction for combined science (P/C), so you can take H2 pure science subjects.</p>
              <p>One combi you can try is:</p>
              <p>H2 Econs</p>
              <p>H2 Physics</p>
              <p>H2 Chem and</p>
              <p>H1 Math (you will score well in H1 Math, but hard for H2 Math as you had B3 for both Math at O levels)</p>
              <p>But if you want to do engineering at NTU or NUS then you need to take H2 Math. </p>
              <p>If you want to do econs or biz at NTU or NUS, then H1 Math is sufficient.</p>
              <p>Look at the courses that you wish to pursue at the Universities and their entry requirements.  Then decide what subjects you want to take at A levels.</p>

              <p>Although cut off for Innova is 20 pts for 2016, I personally find Innova quite ok. You may (or may not) likely be a bigger fish in a smaller pond, so must be able to handle that. </p>
              <p>Personal opinion also, I don't really like YJ, from how I observe my students. But that's me. <span style="color: #ffffff;">The school probably thinks they are doing a lot of value add.</span></p>
              <p>PJ is okok, has been improving. CJ has improved tremendously since my times. </p>
              <p>Could also consider SR. Like CJ, they have improved tremendously as well. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My take is you should travel and visit the JCs to find which one feels better for you in terms of the criteria you have set, as well as any other criteria which you may not think of now. </p>

                      To be realistic and brutally honest, your only real chance of getting into Medicine is going JC and taking H2 Chem + H2 Bio / H2 Phys at A levels, and getting all A grades for all subjects (bear in mind A levels is 10x tougher than O levels).<p>But not only your O level Bio kena D7 grade, but worse, you don't even have Chem at O levels (you don't even combined science Chem, let alone Pure Chem, which is required to take H2 Chem at A levels, which is compulsorily required for applying into Medicine at Uni level). So no JC will allow you to take Chem at H2 level, even if you could get into a JC (since your L1R5 &gt; 20, only Millennia Institute will accept you).</p><p>So to answer your question in an honest brutal way (don't mean to discourage you, but wouldn't you rather have the honest truth than fake consolation?), you have zero chance of getting into Medicine (NUS or NTU), if you go Poly, even if you put Nursing as your first choice in Poly.</p><p>Your only hope of getting into Medicine, is if your family is rich enough to send you to overseas Medical school, but to practice Medicine in Singapore, you'll need to check the Singapore Medical Council for the list of Universities they recognize for Medicine.</p><p>Alternatively (but this route is also rather unfeasible, based on your current O level results which indicate you're not the academic type, and Medicine is the toughest academic course in the world, even tougher than Law, even though lawyers on average make more $$$ than doctors), if you really wanna try to get into local Medical school, retake your O levels as a private candidate and get all A grades, and/or take A levels as a private candidate (once you meet the age requirement, and have fulfilled your National Service obligations) and get all A grades, making sure you include Pure Chemistry (O levels) and/or H2 Chemistry (A levels), to have a chance to enter a local JC, and eventually apply for local (NUS or NTU) Medical school.

              <p>To those enquring on Poly courses,</p>
                  
                  <p>Humanities and Sciences indicate how good your memory is. If you get C5 or worse, I do not advise you to take Engineering, Biology, Chemistry or Medicine, as these subjects require a lot of memorising. B3-B4 still okay, but it would be challenging. Of course, those with A1-A2 will find it easy.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Maths... is more for business courses, not Engineering (cuz got formula sheet)(business don't have formula sheet). So, if your Maths get C5 or worse, avoid taking business courses. Still can consider Engineering or Biology/Chemistry courses, if your Sciences and/or Humanities get B4 or better.</p>
                              
                              <p>If Humanities, Sciences and Maths all get C5 or worse, it's better to consider Media, Design, Arts and Sports.</p>
                              
                              <p>Nonetheless, if your English get B4 or better, can consider taking language courses (Communications and Social "Science").</p>

              For those going the A level route, be aware of the A level subject prerequisites you need for the various NUS courses :<p>
