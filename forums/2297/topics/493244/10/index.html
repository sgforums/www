              <p>I heard A is 20, B is 17.5 , C is 15 and so on. If I want to get
              into that uni course, other than the grades, would the points be

              is there a high chance I can get in? </p>

              UAS (Uni Admission Score) is to allow you to enter into a Uni's faculty or school. Once you've successfully done so, then you can take any course within that particular school. The points are what's relevant, in admission.<p>There's a good chance, yes. That's why it's called IGP (Indicative Grade Profile). But bear in mind that like the JCs' cut-off score, even if you score the same grades and UAS as the stated IGP, you may not get in. So it's important to score *better* than the stated IGP. In addition, as with JCs' cut-off scores, the IGPs given are for the previous year, and with greater demand (including competition from foreigner students) comes more demanding IGPs or cut-off scores.</p><p>As for your question about MT, read this :<br><a href="http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/UndergraduateAdmissions/Pages/ALevel.aspx">http://admissions.ntu.edu.sg/UndergraduateAdmissions/Pages/ALevel.aspx</a></p>

                      English isn't GP, no worries. And you can always get help from a good tuition, in GP and in any H2 subject.<p>Go ahead and apply for both your desired Poly courses, as well as SRJC and CJC (prioritize whichever is nearer to your home). Then, while waiting for acceptance, think over carefully which route you really want, in the event you're accepted by both (for JC route, add in a couple of JCs whose cut-off is a couple of points worse than your L1R5, as a safety net).</p><p>For Poly route, it's important to only apply for courses that you would seriously consider accepting, and not apply for some easy to get into course for the sake of applying (or you may regret it if you really get it).</p>

              I've already replied you on this, so perhaps you're hoping for someone else to reply.<p>Nonetheless, for the sake of other students reading this thread, here's my reply again :</p><p>
              Take H2 Bio. Because H2 Sciences are more valuable than H2 Arts / Humanities subjects, in terms of courses that you can apply for in the Uni.</p><p>You don't even need Econs at A levels (whether H1 or H2) to study Econs in the Uni. But you do need H2 Chem for all Science courses and H2 Physics for all Engineering courses. H2 Bio is necessary for Pharmacy.</p><p>For Medicine (NUS &amp; NTU), you'll need H2 Chem + H2 Bio, or H2 Chem + H2 Physics.

              Depends on whether you're confident you can retake O levels + study Poly simultaneously, as each will distract you from the other.<p>If you're not confident, better focus on doing well on your O levels retake alone.</p>

              If it's indeed this year's COP, it means you got no chance at all (because even if you zhun zhun on the COP, you only got 50% chance of getting in). But no real harm putting in, just that you waste that 1st (or 1st few) slot(s). So if you want to hope this year's COP is 1 point worse than last year's, go ahead and try.

              For Medicine and Law, it's very difficult to get in even after scoring AAA/A, because  2000+ JC students get AAA/A every year, and there are only 200+ places for Medicine (NUS &amp; NTU) and 200+ places for Law (NUS &amp; SMU). So that's only 20% chance of getting in, even after you score AAA/A.

              Wise choice of H2 subjects. There's a good reason why H2 PCM is the most popular subject combination across all JCs, because it opens the most paths in Uni.<p>As for H1 Geog vs H1 Econs, depends on personal interest (<a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/pages/nationalExaminations/GAL/School_Candidates/2018_GCE_A.asp">check out the detailed H1 syllabi for both subjects on SEAB's website</a>) and which is more useful for your intended future Uni studies and career. If both irrelevant to future Uni studies and career, then see which you've more interest in, because your interest will determine how well you perform (applies to academia as well *heh*).</p>

              <p>  I am in the same shoes as you last year ,D7 for english,unable to go the course that i desired .Private candidate for Os and polytechnic course simultaneously seems really hard but in actual fact ,it can be manageable if you have the willpower and could resist the temptations present in polytechnic.Otherwise,you should try to retake O level for english to meet the criteria of your desired course .Good luck and jiayou for getting the course you want next year!</p>

              Different JCs end at different times, and J2s end later than J1s. Some students in some JCs will have more after school activities, eg. CCA. On average, school ends at 5pm for most students, some CCA days can end at 9pm.<p>CCA is a bonus, and can contribute to your CV, and hence is more relevant and important for elite Uni courses, ie. Medicine &amp; Law, and less relevant and important for normal Uni courses.</p><p>
              No need for bridging programme for combined science students lah. Combined science, pure science, both equally super easy, compared to H2 Science.</p><p>
              PW is done both in school and outside school.</p><p>
              For your student A student B question, once you fulfil your subject prerequisites, then it's about the UAS. If student A has a better UAS than student B, then he'll still have a better chance of getting in. Unless it's an elite course, ie. Medicine &amp; Law, then grades for specific relevant subjects will be considered in addition to UAS. But if it's an elite course, ie. Medicine &amp; Law, then ALL your subjects need to be A grade anyway, just to stand a 20% chance of getting in. </p>

              pharmacy science and then take Medicine in NUS / NTU, what are the
              chances of getting in? I've checked the gpa for medicine in nus,
              it's 3.92 for the 10th percentile. And what would happen if i do
              too badly for As if i choose to go JC? Like can i still enter
              Poly?</span></p>

              Yes, it's easier to drop out of JC to go Poly, much harder to drop out of Poly to go JC.<p>Chance of entering Medicine from Poly course (even BioMed or Pharmacy) is very low (1%). Highest chance (20%) is still by getting AAA/A grades in JC.</p><p>The only other possible pathway to Medicine in Singapore (but chance is still very low, because Medicine is always many times oversubscribed, especially in Singapore), is post-grad Duke-NUS Medical school, ie. get a good degree from a good Uni first, then apply to Duke-NUS after you graduate.</p>

                                              <p>Singapore Polytechnic accepts students who scored D7 for English.</p>
                                              <p>Nanyang Polytechnic also.</p>
                                              <p>Temasek Polytechnic also.</p>
                                              <p>Republic Polytechnic also.</p>

                                              <p>Anyway, why you want to go Ngee Ann? I know Ngee Ann very fun la, but it's damn hell inaccessible. Everyday have to squeeze bus with people from SIM, and walk long distances.</p>
                                              <p>Come Singapore Polytechnic.</p>
