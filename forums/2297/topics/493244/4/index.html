              <p>Hi there, I just got back my results and kinda in a dilemma. </p>
              <p>Here's my results : </p>
              <p>English &amp; Combined Humanities : B3 </p>
              <p>Emath, Amath. Combined science, Chinese : A1 </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm currently having a raw score of 10 for L1R5 which is a nett score of 8. </p>
              <p>I'm not really sure if i should go JC or Poly cause i'm currently taking combined science and i want to continue doing amath and science in the science stream in JC. However, I'm quite worried i might dropout due to the fact that I'm currently taking combined science instead of pure sciences and I'm worried I might not make that much friends cause i'm kinda an introvert and also scared that CCA might affect my studies and gives me more stress. I've always aimed for going to SAJC because it's near my house but now, I feel like mostly pure sciences students would be going there and the competition would be very strong. Most of my combined science friends are going JC but arts stream. I'm really worried i would retain and cannot keep up. Moreover, I don't think I want to do MT anymore but JC requires it for A lvls. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, I don't mind the Poly stream as well. I've been considering International Business or Biomedical Science, but I'm not sure if i would do well in biomedical science as i took PhyChem for Science and have no bio background. I was thinking maybe diploma would be better than A lvls, because i might be able to go uni with a diploma or work if i don't want to go uni. But for A lvls, there's no choice but to continue with uni and i'm afraid i might lose interest. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My initial interest is actually to be a Math Teacher in secondary schools and i'm not sure which route i should go. Are there any courses in poly to go if i want to be a math teacher? I don't mind going the biomed route and becoming a doctor.. But i'm not sure. Is it possible if i seek some of your opinions? Because i'm kind of in a dilemma now. </p>

                              <p>I know of one chemistry teacher. Graduate from Poly, then went to NIE, become chemistry teacher at my secondary school. DnT teacher also.</p>
                              <p>The Poly courses are on engineering, and biology/chemistry.</p>
                              <p>For more information, check NIE website.</p>

                      <p>By the way, thanks for the encouragement. I'm a third-year Poly student, studying engineering. May consider teaching next time - if I cannot be LEW (Licensed Electrical Worker).</p>

              <p>Hello. I'm in a dilemma because I'm not sure whether I should head for the JC or Polytechnic route to get to NUS/NTU.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I got a net score of L1R5 - 13 and L1R4 - 10. Honestly if I'm going JC, I'll be probably be applying for PJC since it's nearer + I heard it's not too bad, the teachers are caring enough. However the problem is I want to apply for Science stream which requires the COP of 12 and I got 13 so my chances are really small. I've asked during Open house, if I want to appeal, I can but the chances are slim + I should be putting it as my first choice which comes to my next problem. (Btw please tell me more about PJC if you're an ex student hehe)</p>
              <p>If I'm heading for Polytechnic route, I'm actually considering Business Studies or Tourism &amp; Resort Management, both with a COP of 10 (I just met the minimum). The planned intake are 280 and 80 respectively so the competition is really big + they're very popular courses so I think that deciding my first choice is very important since it actually also shows how much I want to get in? If I put PJC as my first choice and I still can't get in after appealing then wouldn't it be a waste to put it as my first choice?</p>

              <p>Firstly, I got a net score of L1R5 - 13 and L1R4 - 10. Honestly
              if I'm going JC, I'll be probably be applying for PJC since it's
              nearer + I heard it's not too bad, the teachers are caring enough.
              However the problem is I want to apply for Science stream which
              requires the COP of 12 and I got 13 so my chances are really small.
              I've asked during Open house, if I want to appeal, I can but the
              chances are slim + I should be putting it as my first choice which
              comes to my next problem. (Btw please tell me more about PJC if
              you're an ex student hehe)</p>
              <p>If I'm heading for Polytechnic route, I'm actually considering
              Business Studies or Tourism &amp; Resort Management, both with a
              COP of 10 (I just met the minimum). The planned intake are 280 and
              80 respectively so the competition is really big + they're very
              popular courses so I think that deciding my first choice is very
              important since it actually also shows how much I want to get in?
              If I put PJC as my first choice and I still can't get in after
              appealing then wouldn't it be a waste to put it as my first
              choice?</p>

              <p>Your mind is probably is in a mess because you didn't start considering this earlier. It is perfectly normal, no worries.</p>
              <p>My post is primarily regarding the JC route.</p>
              <p>You mentioned "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px;">but if I screw up A levels"<br>My take is that if you put in the hard work, you reap the rewards. I will have to prep you first that JC is many times tougher than O Level. You will likely not do very well at the start, and all these are normal, but it can lead to a lot of stresses. </span></p>
              <p>There will also be many curveballs thrown at you.</p>
              <p>Things probably only start to pick up nearer to mid of J2... only if you plough on consistently and conscientiously. Discpline, determination, resilience, are what you need.</p>

              <p>It will be best for you to decide which university course you would want to pursue, before deciding on a JC subject path.</p>
              <p>If you choose your subject combi to be H2 Maths, H2 Chem, H2 Econs, H1 Geog/Lit, it seems like an arts course. Might be better off switching H1 Geog and H2 Chem to H2 Geog and H1 Chem. Better to check with the school though.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>  I am currently studying in an engineering course in Singapore Polytechnic and have also took my O level as private candidate.It was quite shocking for my results last year,i have gotten a D7 for english which gives me limited choices.However,i retook my o level while studying in Singapore Polytechnic.It was an emotional year for me last year as i was one pf the better ones in my secondary class.Surprisingly,i have gotten the grades that i want for O level and the gpa for polytechnic this year .I managed to get a gpa of 3.7 and an L1R5 of 14 raw ,12 nett for Os.(from 19 raw to 14 raw) after retaking english,e math and chinese(D7 to B4,A2 ,B3 to A1) .I hope that anyone who is considering to be a private candidate could be inspired by my story and not allowing yourself to wallow in pity or do anything rash after O level results.I can guarentee you that it is not over yet,try again .English is paramount to succeed in Singapore so do love it and in return,it may reciprocate .</p>
              <p>P.S. Do message me if you need any assistance and support from a fellow private candidate.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Should I choose poly or jc? As i didnt go for the physics exam
              in o levels, i can only take h2 math chem and econs and h1 geog or
              lit in jc. Does this subject combi allows me to study most courses
              in uni?</p>
              <p>For poly, im thinking of taking accountancy and  finance.
              Tp, nyp, and np offers it. Which school is the best? Or are all
              schools the same? (I live in bedok btw)</p>

              Be sure you take H2 Chem!<p>Science subjects at H2 are always worth a lot more than Arts / Humanitities subjects at H2. For instance, you don't even need to take Econs at H1 (let alone H2), to study Econs in the Uni.</p><p>But without H2 Chem (and since you already don't have Bio or Phys), you won't be able to study any Science course in the Uni at all! With H2 Chem (and without Bio or Phys) and H2 Math, you can still keep your options open to study Science courses such as *surprise surprise* Chemistry (in both NUS and NTU).</p><p>Keep more options open for your Uni studies, by taking H2 Chem. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.</p>

I scored 13 points nett for my L1R5 which is the COP for the Arts stream for both JCs. Distance-wise, both JCs take about the same travelling time for me of about 50 minutes, (I live in the central), so I guess distance is not much of an issue. But in terms of academic reputatation and school culture, which of the 2 JCs is a better choice? Which of the 2 JCs is more competitive to enter than the other? Which JC should I put as my first choice? TIA for any adivce.</p></div>

              Yeah if you like Math so much, and you've already decided to be a Math teacher, go JC and take H2 Math + H2 Further Math + H3 Math. If you can get A grade for all 3 Math subjects, your Math competence, Uni admission and Math teaching career is smooth sailing liao (unless your HOD, Principal and/or NIE supervisor just don't like you and fail your teaching practicum).<p>

                  You want to be a Vet doctor yourself (not just assistant), you need a degree, which only Unis in Aus or UK or US offer (your family needs to be rich enough to send you to these Unis, as studying aboard is expensive, especially for Medicine courses).<p>If you're not very sure what you want to do as a career, and want to keep your options open, JC is a safer choice than Poly.</p><p>With your A1 grade for Phys/Chem, I strongly recommend you take both H2 Phys and H2 Chem if possible (check to see if YJC allows it), together with H2 Math, to keep more options open to you at Uni level. Science subjects at H2 are worth many times more Arts / Humanities subjects at H2. You can do Arts / Humanities course in Uni without taking them at H2, but you *need* H2 Science to do Science at Uni.</p><p>With H2 Phys + H2 Chem + H2 Math, *ALL* science courses (including Medicine) in the Uni are available to you, except for Pharmacy.
                  </p><p>Regarding YJC, obviously the most important factor in choosing a JC is distance. Go to the JC nearest to your home. Because JC students are always sleep deprived, and sleep deprivation causes brain damage, lowers your IQ, and lowers your A level results.</p>

              <p>Yes.  Business diplomas from the 5 polytechnics are accepted.  Indicative grade profiles as follows:</p>
              <p>NUS : http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html</p>
              <p>NTU : http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/NTU_IGP.pdf</p>
              <p>SMU : https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions/indicative-grade-profiles-igp</p>
              <p>There are special requirements as well.  Some like Nanyang Business School requires poly graduates to have at least a C5 or better for A Math.  But no worries, if you did not score well in A Math, you can take a Math Elective in the first year.  </p>
              <p>Do note that the weightage for admission to NTU/NUS for all poly graduates is:</p>
              <p>Poly results: 80%</p>
              <p>O level results: 20%.</p>
              <p>Some business courses are extremely competitive in NUS e.g. Business Admin(Accountancy).  You need straight As to get in i.e. A's in all your H2 and H1 subjects. Similar to Law and Medicine. Similarly if you are a poly graduate, you need a GPA of 3.89 which is also almost As and distinctions in all your subjects.</p>

              <p><br> Be sure you take H2 Chem!</p>
              <p>Science subjects at H2 are always worth a lot more than Arts /
              Humanitities subjects at H2. For instance, you don't even need to
              take Econs at H1 (let alone H2), to study Econs in the Uni.</p>
              <p>But without H2 Chem (and since you already don't have Bio or
              Phys), you won't be able to study any Science course in the Uni at
              all! With H2 Chem (and without Bio or Phys) and H2 Math, you can
              still keep your options open to study Science courses such as
              *surprise surprise* Chemistry (in both NUS and NTU).</p>
              <p>Keep more options open for your Uni studies, by taking H2 Chem.
              Trust me, you'll be glad you did.</p>

              <p>Although I mentioned H1 Chem, I concur with Ultimaonline, that if you still want to pursue a science course at university, H2 Chem is better.</p>

              <p>Hi. I am actually an o level graduate and I am considering a place for Science (education) in NIE.</p>
              <p>My o level results are as follows:</p>
              <p>English - B3 (improved by three grades since prelim exam)</p>
              <p>E Math - C5 (i guess i didn't study enough) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>Phy spa - B3</p>
              <p>Chem spa - A2</p>
              <p>combined humanities - B3</p>
              <p>Food and nutrition - A2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of the courses in NIE (or even university) requires A levels from JC or MI. However, I don't have A maths anymore because I dropped the subject in sec 4. I don't know whether a polytechnic diploma is enough to get to a place in NIE.</p>
              <p>I have checked the NIE website, but they are not specific about which kind of polytechnic diplomas is needed to go to NIE. I think for science education, they require H2 passes (especially H2 maths, phy and chem. I'm not sure about any polytechnic courses. I'm not into engineering or business, just teaching science in secondary school (or primary :/) </p>
              <p>I cannot consider H2 maths without A maths. Maths is also my weakest subject. My parents fear that I have to go through the ordeal again for A levels since I put a huge strain on myself during O levels.</p>
              <p>Are there any polytechnic courses that can lead to science courses in NIE? If not, I have to consider JC or MI then. :( (i'm not really keen into A levels, really, but I'm despserate to find a route to NIE, whether being a graduate program or a post-graduate program).</p>
              <p>Thanks!!</p>
              <p> </p>
