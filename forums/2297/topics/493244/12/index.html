              <p>I'm also considering between CJC and SRJC. Just see which one is
              nearer to your house and also consider the subject combinations as
              well. The CCAs too! Based on results, I've heard SRJC is quite hard
              also. But for CJC there are many retainees per year but my friend
              told me that the teachers are easily approachable and also if you
              study hard, can make it :D Let me know if u decide on CJC! Hope to
              see u there :O </p>

              <p>Honestly CJC is like 20mins nearer for me compared to SR but I prefer the atmosphere at SR. both schools offer the combo I like and CCA doesn't matter much to me,</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>Just asking will It be okay to take MI? A lot of people say MI not good waste three years and cannot go anywhere. I put like my favourite poly course Cyber security and forensic (12point) and two other course with 12 and 13 point respectively before MI. I don't think that I can get into them so I want to ask if MI environment and teacher and everything okay or not. Will the teacher be worse than those of JCs?</p>

                  You can always drop out of MI anytime if you find it unhelpful for you, and/or retake your O levels in 2017 to have better options (both JC and Poly) in 2018.<p>Appeals have a slight chance *only* if your L1R5 is exactly the same as the cut-off point. So appeals will be useless for you (at least on the JC side, no idea on Poly side).

                  <p>Just asking will It be okay to take MI? A lot of people say MI
                  not good waste three years and cannot go anywhere. I put like my
                  favourite poly course Cyber security and forensic (12point) and two
                  other course with 12 and 13 point respectively before MI. I don't
                  think that I can get into them so I want to ask if MI environment
                  and teacher and everything okay or not. Will the teacher be worse
                  than those of JCs?</p>

                                  <p>MI is only good in Business, as it's the only government institution to offer A level Accounting and Management of Business. Its only competitor is the private institutions (eg. MDIS); for these subjects, all the grades is for themselves.</p>

                          <p>Hi. Thanks for the advice. However, it would be good if you could stop telling students to repeat O levels, if they can qualify for Poly. Wasting one year (or more) is not worth it, unless the student really desperately wants to pursue a course (eg. Health Science) where a certain subject of his (eg. Science) did not meet the mark, and cannot have conditional admission to the course. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sorry if my last post offend anyone, only asking after the registration period yesterday because I've already made amendments the other day my relatives persuaded me to go MI. Not trying be be a joker, actually my original 12 choice in my opinion would be logical ranging from 14 to 21 but honestly I don't think I will enjoy the courses because not really what I want so I was change my choices to try to go into them. Of course I know that most probably this year the cop will be even lowered or at most the same and I would not be able to get in. I just want to see what I can do before I made up my mind to retake my o levels. I'm not like trying to troll my life away but it's just that what I normally can do well is not doing so and my point is totally off what I expected and I could not go to my favourite course that I wanted for a long time. And not even like I'm eligible for JC were I can try to make amendments in my life as I put myself on the same platform as other students again for one more time. I'm like abit desperate now seeing that I have no where to go so perhaps my last post is like too Hao Lian or too idealistic or you can't see my seriousness for my future and for my o levels. I know my place actually, just hoping for the slim chance that did anyone succeeded? If there is a first case, is there any chance for me to go in the course I wanted. Before o level my plan is like I'm going the poly I like, if they don't want me I go Jc. But now it seems like I don't even meet the entry requirements for my plan B and my messed up score most likely will not bring me anywhere near my favourite courses. All this unrealistic choice that I've put is like my last hopes before I choose to spend one more year to retake and perhaps even invest in tuitions if they are useful. And to gekpohboy that say that I should be happy that I am not labeled as special needs, I'm actually jealous that the extra time you guys have because I always cannot finish my papers since primary school and I have problems that can allow me to ask for access arrangements just that my parents don't let. The label is just a label but the grade you earn is more solid.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>for Jc very important whether you choose arts or science stream, choose what you think you will excel at (can use scores for o levels as a guide, did you do better for sciences/ humanities?) thats a good gauge. If you're still undecided, some JCs offer hybrid combi which is a mix of both. Interested in econs just take H2 econs, dont need follow the crowd since a lot of people do H1 econs. take note that not all jcs are this flexible with their subject combis though!</p></div>

              <h3>ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER</h3>
              <h4>FOR STUDENTS POSTED TO JC/MI</h4>
              <p>Students who are offered a course in a JC/MI must
              report to the JC/MI on the next working day following the release
              of the posting results. Any student who does not report to the
              JC/MI on this date will be deemed to have forfeited his/her place.
              This place will be made available to other eligible applicants
              appealing for a place in the course.</p>
              <h4>What do they mean by 'report' to the JC on the next working day? Does it mean that lessons start on that day? What's the dress code for that? Since we would only receive our posting results one day prior to the day,we won't have time to buy the uniforms of our respective JCs.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So do we wear our Secondary school uniform? </p>
              <p>Head there to 'report' and immediately go home?</p>
              <p>Someone please elaborate.</p>
