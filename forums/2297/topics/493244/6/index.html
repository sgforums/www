                                              GPA?</p>
                                              <p>Tbh I'm not like 100% confirm I know what I want but I'm
                                              probably going like business-related courses or maybe a bit of
                                              science courses (Pharmaceutical Science/Applied Chemistry) since
                                              I'm pretty sure my interests doesn't lie within
                                              Engineering/Design/Art/MassCom... courses) if I were to go poly and
                                              in uni it would be like what I've said, the possible ones are
                                              Business/Law/Medicine/Pharmacy.</p>
                                                            </div>

                                              <p>As compared to Poly, JC has less projects and assessments; just two major exams and one project work.</p>
                                          <p>Other than that, it is equally hard to score in Poly as in JC.
                                              </p><p>To get a GPA of 3.85 in Poly, you need to get around 75-100% (B+ to Distinction) for every assessment, consistently over three years.</p>
                                      <p>To get AAA/A for A level, you need to get around 70-100% (A) during the two exams and one project work, over two years.</p>
                              <p>Nonetheless, if you already know what you want, having a diploma would give you an added advantage when you go out to work, as you would have a University degree and a diploma at the same time.</p>

              <p>Languages ain't my forte unfortunately. Well I'm aware of that
              but I'm considering Medicine and Pharmacy too. If I go Art stream,
              my options are lesser. I think poly and JC both are similar in
              terms of duration after uni cause sometimes if you go poly you
              study in uni for 2 years only. So to me, the duration nvm unless I
              fail. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, sometimes, people's hardwork and efforts aren't paid
              off so to be safe, I'm thinking more rather than just '' work hard
              '' That's why I really need some useful advice. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The duration is not really true, unless you are studying the exact same thing both in uni and in poly, and did well enough in poly. There are also other considerations which I don't think I want to touch now as the post would be too long. Tbh, I was in engineering, and I did not see a poly grad receiving first class honours in my year.</p>
              <p>I'm sure there are such students around, just that I didn't see it. Personal encounters with poly students going NUS; they are really good. But my take is there are other challenges and difficulties (e.g. the reduction of 1 year, which isn't an advantage at all) that makes it very very tough to experience the entire degree journey. My two cents.</p>
              <p>But no matter where you are, in Poly or JC, the same thing, hardwork and efforts aren't always paid off. Why? I always tell my students: "Efforts does not equal results"</p>
              <p>Why really matters, is learning and studying techniques on top of efforts. The best techniques without efforts means nothing. Hard work with effort on an ineffective technique also yields nothing. You need a combination of both. It is the same for Poly, JC or even university. It's how I got my top scores for JC and Uni.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only went through the JC route, but personally, after considering different options, I think JC route to uni is easier. Reason? If and when you need the help, it is way easier and way cheaper to find help, compared to finding help for Poly courses, which are much more niche, not to mention the Poly-NUS route costs more than the JC (even with tuition support) - NUS route. <br><br></p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Hi guys,I kindly seek your advice regarding my route to JC.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">My Raw L1R5 is 17</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After Bonus Points:15</span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Planning to take this subject combination-&gt; H2 Math,H2 Physics,H2 Economics and H1 chem</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">So from earlier posts,I've seen people emphasizing the importance of taking H2 Chem in order to to gain admission to the faculty of science in NUS.But is that really the case? From the website:</p>
              <ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
              <li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 21px;">For admission to the Faculty of Science, you must have a pass in any two of these subjects at H2 level or equivalent: Biology, Chemistry, Computing, Mathematics and Physics.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">^Does it have a great career prospect?</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 19.9639px; line-height: 22.3715px;">I don't really know what kind of career do I want to pursue yet so I don't want to limit my options.</span></span></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">I heard that H2 Chem is ALOT more difficult than H2 Physics,is that true?(As you have to memorise alot of things)</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">Since I don't take pure sciences(O levels),I started to learn the 'new' pure science content after my O levels and I should say it is quite manageable.(+practice).Also started to self-study the subjects I'm planning to take.</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">I plan to take Economics as it is quite relevant in today's society.</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">JC: Should I go JJC(COP 15,1 hr travel time) or YJC(COP 16,30 min)?</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">I heard that YJC students don't really study and it can affect you negatively.(Really?)</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">Is JJC that much better than YJC that it is worth to compensate 1 hour for it?(Travelling to and fro).Any personal experience?</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">And can I even get into these JCs? I'm just depending on my Bonus points...</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">Sorry for the long post and the ridiculous amount of questions I have.</div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;"><br></div>
              <div style="line-height: 19.696px;">I really hope for a reply.</div>

              Hey guys, looking for advice on which JC to go to.
                          
              My L1R5 raw is 9 points, nett 7, and am looking to enter the Science stream with BCME since I'm looking to enter Medicine in uni.
                      
              English - A1
              Chinese - A1
              Chemistry - A1
              Physics - A2
              Biology - A2
              EMaths - A2
              AMaths - A2
              Combined Humanities - A2
                      
              Currently, I'm torn between Anderson JC as well as Meridian JC. (I've attended both open houses and liked the vibes of both)
                      
              So these are the relative distances to the respective JCs.
              AJC: approx. 50mins
              MJC: approx. 35mins
                      
              I've heard that both JCs offer caring lecturers and a mugging environment which I'm personally looking forward to.
                      
              However, thing is, I can't exactly find a CCA I would be interested in MJC unless its the SC, unlike the situation in AJC, whereby I've a few choices of CCAs I'm actually into. Sooooo, a little help here?
                          
              P.S. I heard AJC is known for its Science Research Programmes, which might help in my testimonial if I get into it.

              <p>The duration is not really true, unless you are studying the
              exact same thing both in uni and in poly, and did well enough in
              poly. There are also other considerations which I don't think I
              want to touch now as the post would be too long. Tbh, I was in
              engineering, and I did not see a poly grad receiving first class
              honours in my year.</p>
              <p>I'm sure there are such students around, just that I didn't see
              it. Personal encounters with poly students going NUS; they are
              really good. But my take is there are other challenges and
              difficulties (e.g. the reduction of 1 year, which isn't an
              advantage at all) that makes it very very tough to experience the
              entire degree journey. My two cents.</p>
              <p>But no matter where you are, in Poly or JC, the same thing,
              hardwork and efforts aren't always paid off. Why? I always tell my
              students: "Efforts does not equal results"</p>
              <p>Why really matters, is learning and studying techniques on top
              of efforts. The best techniques without efforts means nothing. Hard
              work with effort on an ineffective technique also yields nothing.
              You need a combination of both. It is the same for Poly, JC or even
              university. It's how I got my top scores for JC and Uni.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I only went through the JC route, but personally, after
              considering different options, I think JC route to uni is easier.
              Reason? If and when you need the help, it is way easier and way
              cheaper to find help, compared to finding help for Poly courses,
              which are much more niche, not to mention the Poly-NUS route costs
              more than the JC (even with tuition support) - NUS
              route. <br></p>

              <p>Hmm thanks a lot. Btw I'm considering to apply for scholarship if possible and I heard it's easier to apply for scholarship in Polytechnic compared to JC? </p>
              <p>If I do choose the polytechnic route, would Business studies or Tourism &amp; resort management be a better option? The planned intake for DTRM is 80 and BS is 280 and both are popular courses. I heard BS is too general and common so it's probably more competitive when applying for NUS/NTU? </p>

              <p>I'm not too sure what scholarships are available if I enter BS or DTRM but probably the NP/SP scholarships? :l</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, I'm repeating this again: I'm 1 point away from meeting PJC's science stream COP which is 12 so my chances of getting in are pretty slim and wouldn't it be a waste if I put it as my first choice and not being able to get in since sometimes polys look for those '' passionate '' ones about the course and those who thus put them as their first choice? Based on the trend for PJC's COP for science stream it's either the same or lowering plus this year's batch did better too so I think my chances are really small?</p>

              <p>To be honest,it is terrible for me as i hardly got any help until i mustered my courage to approach my secondary school teachers.Therefore,I really hope that every private candidates can have the support that they need.It may be heart wrenching to see your previous results and tough to get over the failure.It is through pure hardwork and consistency that will bring to reach the goals .For example,my engineering course has very tough modules,but i aced all modules except the practical aspect of it.Studying for O level has taken much of my poly holidays,doing tys,other school papers and books.Due to O level,i actually neglected one of my modules and have gotten a D+ for a two credit units module.In highsight,i believe that i could have gotten better poly results,yet it is indeed a painful experience for me.Therefore,no matter how horrible your result is ,dont give up and keep trying.</p>

              Carychidestar, eh take H2 Chem lah. Seriously, you know every year how many JC students regret dropping to H1 Chem (totally useless as a prerequisite subject) when they apply for Uni courses? Hundreds (at least), don't be one of them.<p>Either take all H2s (as long as you do well in them, your teachers won't force you to drop one of the subjects to H1, and taking all H2s will give you an advantage when calculating Uni Admission Score, becoz you can use your lousiest subject as your H1), or take H2 Chem and H1 Econs. You don't even need Econs at H1 level to take Econs in the Uni, but you *do* need H2 Chem for most Science courses in the Uni. Keep your options open, or you'll regret it in the future.</p><p>
                                      Edited to add : Your L1R5 doesn't seem good enough for your JC to allow you to take 4H2s. And because yours is combined science (even though you got your A1), check with the JC you're applying into, to confirm they'll allow you to take both Phys and Chem at H2 level. Hopefully they do, because if they don't, you'll have to think very carefully which one you'll want to keep at H2. Ideally, take both Phys and Chem at H2, and drop Econs to H1. Ideally. For the sake of your future in Uni.</p><p>
                                      
                      Edited again to add : Officially all subjects at H2 level are of the same difficulty. Only H3 is tougher. Comparing the sciences Chem, Phys and Bio, which you'll find easier which you'll find tougher, totally depends on the individual. And Combined Science Chem and Pure Chem at O levels, are both equally laughably easy compared to H2 Chem, which means Combined Science students aren't really disadvantaged compared to Pure Science students. So no worries! *evil grin*.
                      </p><p>
                  Edited yet again to add : Eh obviously go to the nearer JC lah! (besides, YJC has better flexibility of subject combination, and *may* be more willing to let you take both Chem and Phys at H2 level). JC students are always sleep deprived. Sleep deprivation causes brain damage. Brain damage lowers your IQ. Lowered IQ = lousier A level results. (<i>Quod Erat Demonstrandum</i>)

If i choose to go poly instead(tp), would biomedical science be a good course for this particular interest? since tp does not have any other dental-related courses</address>
