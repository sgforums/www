              <p>But are there many combined science students going into JC to do

              <p>As what others said, you did well in combined science, so why worry?</p>
              <p>MOE requires those who want to take pure sciences at A levels to have either A1 or A2 for combined sciences at O levels. They already know those who can or cannot cope with the syllabus. You meet MOE's criteria.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you still have to study very hard to do well in A levels, regardless of how well you did or how badly you did in O levels.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>  I am currently studying in an engineering course in
              Singapore Polytechnic and have also took my O level as private
              candidate.It was quite shocking for my results last year,i have
              gotten a D7 for english which gives me limited choices.However,i
              retook my o level while studying in Singapore Polytechnic.It was an
              emotional year for me last year as i was one pf the better ones in
              my secondary class.Surprisingly,i have gotten the grades that i
              want for O level and the gpa for polytechnic this year .I managed
              to get a gpa of 3.7 and an L1R5 of 14 raw ,12 nett for Os.(from 19
              raw to 14 raw) after retaking english,e math and chinese(D7 to
              B4,A2 ,B3 to A1) .I hope that anyone who is considering to be a
              private candidate could be inspired by my story and not allowing
              yourself to wallow in pity or do anything rash after O level
              results.I can guarentee you that it is not over yet,try again
              .English is paramount to succeed in Singapore so do love it and in
              return,it may reciprocate .</p>
              <p>P.S. Do message me if you need any assistance and support from a

              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">She was also her school's student council president and National Police Cadet Corps squad leader. She even found time to volunteer.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px;">Zakirah said: "I have been through a lot of challenges, and I know what it feels like to need help. This made me want to help others so they have a reason to smile."</p>

              <p>If i'm going to poly, i can graduate with a diploma in biomedical science but i'm not really sure if i want to do medicine. Is it possible if I enter NIE with a diploma in biomed science? I checked their webpage but it was rather vague, didn't specify which diploma they were looking for. May I know if this diploma can be considered? </p>
              <p> However, if i'm going to the JC route, i'm scared that i would dropout of even if i make it to A lvls, I'm scared i might lose interest in studying and don't want to move on to uni as it would be a waste of money if i'm not interested at all. then, i won't have any career options. </p>

              <p>Seriously, I am quite surprised why your school allowed such a
              subject combination. Secondary schools offer subject combinations
              that will best ensure that their students are able to enter JC/Poly
              and qualify for most if not all of the courses.  Therefore, as
              a minimum, all students take at least one combined Science subject
              (P/C/B). In your case, you would have been better off with Combined
              Science (C/B) instead of pure bio.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that is water under the bridge.</p>
              <p>If you die die want to do medicine, then another path is to go
              Poly.  Do extremely well.  Take a science or engineering
              course in Uni.  Make sure you graduate with 1st class honours.
               Then apply to Duke-NUS graduate medical school after some
              work experience related to research.</p>
              <p> But be warned.  Medicine is a tough life.</p>

              <p>Your mind is probably is in a mess because you didn't start

              I will have to prep you first that JC is many times tougher than O
              Level. You will likely not do very well at the start, and all these
              are normal, but it can lead to a lot of stresses. </span></p>

              <p>Things probably only start to pick up nearer to mid of J2...
              only if you plough on consistently and conscientiously. Discpline,

              <p>hi, I did start to consider this earlier but I'm still in a dilemma. Like what I've said, if I go to NUS/NTU, I'll probably pursue Law/Business/Medicine/Pharmacy which 3 of them requires AAA/A and plus there's a big competition from top notched schools too. Yes I might be able to cope with A levels but I'm not sure of getting AAA/A that's why I'm afraid. Right now for the first 3 choices, I'm not sure how to arrange them, PJC, Business Studies and Tourism &amp; Resort Management. Besides, like I've said I didn't meet the COP for science stream in PJC so I think there's a really slim chance of my entering it....</p>

              <p>Can you please elaborate further in what ways JC is easier than poly? In getting AAA/A compared to getting at least 3.85 for GPA?</p>
              <p>Tbh I'm not like 100% confirm I know what I want but I'm probably going like business-related courses or maybe a bit of science courses (Pharmaceutical Science/Applied Chemistry) since I'm pretty sure my interests doesn't lie within Engineering/Design/Art/MassCom... courses) if I were to go poly and in uni it would be like what I've said, the possible ones are Business/Law/Medicine/Pharmacy.</p>
