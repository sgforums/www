              <p>You should first ask yourself if your future requires A Maths or not. If yes, I strongly recommend you to keep this subject. If no, and if you are VERY sure that you will NOT change interest, then go ahead and drop it.</p>
              <p>12 marks out of 100 is really CMI (actually I got that grade from Sec 3 all the way to Sec 4 Mid-year). I eventually got A2 for Prelims, and then A2 for O level A maths. A Maths is basically an extra foundation built on related concepts in E Maths, and it is very easy to score once you master the techniques (much easier to score than E Maths) because the marks allocated for A Maths questions is usually very generous, and the questions in A Maths are usually conceptual (means whether you know it or don't know it), unlike in E maths where 'tricky' questions are quite frequent.</p>
              <p>Since you won't be using it for N level aggregate, it's best for you to decide on your own. Business and Sciences will have a lot on maths from A level (in poly courses, in which A maths is the foundation) and from O level A/E Maths (in ITE courses).</p>
              <p>But in Business, you will focus on Statistics (from E maths) and Calculus (from A Maths). Note that the statistics you learn in business diplomas are based on A level statistics. Note that a pass in O level A maths (or a pass in A level Maths at either H1 or H2 level) is the minimum requirement for Business degrees. Not sure if A maths is required to do the University Business maths modules.</p>

              <p>A1 to E8 are shown on the cert. F9 grades won't be shown in the cert but it will be shown in the result slip. This applies to all subjects.</p>
              <p>You can enter Poly provided that you pass the 3 most important subjects (English, Maths, Science) and if your L1R4 is below 26, so don't worry. Even if you are in that 0.1% of the cohort for Mother Tongue (those who fail MT), you can enter poly as long as your L1R4 allows it. Just make sure you do very well for your core subjects and you are fine.</p>
              <p>National Average for MT passes is 99.9% (at least for last year's O level). So don't worry much about it.</p>

              <p>Don't ever get D7 or lower for English, please try to get at least a C6 for English. Because Polys who allow people with D7 for English into a course will usually require the student to pass English in the first year of study or he/she will be kicked out of the course.</p>
              <p>You just need a pass in one subject to get a certificate, as mentioned in SEAB website.</p>

              <p>You don't have to pass Chinese or even need Chinese to meet ELR2B2 requirements. I don't have MT at all and still got into Poly. If you get D7 it will be shown on cert, applies to any subject. F9 is shown on result slip but not cert. Only A1 to E8 is shown on the cert.</p>
              <p>From how you've been performing, it's just MT that will drag your score down, but your other subjects seem okay (You only have 5 subjects!!!). Just do your best on MidYear O level MT and you are fine. You seem to have a stable foundation for others so just put in more effort for them and try to score at least B3 (highly possible).</p>

                  barely promoted, and now stress is kicking in real hard. i am sec4
                  this year taking 8 subs because i am from a good school lol. i know
                  amath is important in the future but i have not understood a thing
                  since sec3, hesiitant to combined science because my chem sucks,
                  and double humanities will always fail no matter how much i
                  study.</p>
                  <p>here are my sec3 results. pls advice which subs to drop. i
                  failed my common tests badly and i promise to work harder from now

                  Can you afford to go for tuition for your Chem and A Math? If yes, don't drop these, as these are important subjects if you want to go the JC path (Science). If no, then you'll have no choice but to drop these, and go the JC path (Arts) or the Poly path (non-Chem courses).<p>Btw, you can post your Chem qns here if you need help with them.</p>

              I agree with ultimaonline.
              
              If u want to go jc (science stream in particular), Amath and Chem is a must. If u can afford, go for tuition. Personally i got a tutor (Amath and Emath) who help me improve from 20++ to 70+ and 80+ in 4 months. His way of teaching simplifies the subject, however i still had to grind f or a period of time.
              
              I guess it depends on how determine u are to catch up with ur grades and how much you can understand from the tutor.

              <p>thanks for all of your suggestions.</p>
              <p>after much consideration, i decided to take only 6 subjects, reduced from 8, by dropping combined humans and dropping double pure to combined science. i dont intend to go JC, only poly, so i dont really need pure science, and i find combined science overall relatively easier to do, so i just need to brush up my chem to pull up my science grade.</p>
              <p>i also dont intend to use amaths in my l1r4 but everyone has been saying that amaths can be useful in most poly courses so i wont drop amaths. its gonna be hard to make a big improvement from 10 marks in sec3 though lol but i will continue trying.</p>
              <p>i decided to drop combined humans cos this memory subject is becoming a burdensome chore to do and i have been doing worse in this subject. moreover i got lit as a humans sub so i dont need combined humans.</p>
