              <p>for Jc very important whether you choose arts or science stream,
              choose what you think you will excel at (can use scores for o
              levels as a guide, did you do better for sciences/ humanities?)
              thats a good gauge. If you're still undecided, some JCs offer
              hybrid combi which is a mix of both. Interested in econs just take
              H2 econs, dont need follow the crowd since a lot of people do H1
              econs. take note that not all jcs are this flexible with their
              subject combis though!</p>

              <p>Well I think I excel in humanities and I'm choosing to enter Arts Stream in JC but on the downside, Arts stream opens doors to much less courses at the university as compared to Science stream, so I guess practicality is somewhat as important as interests in that sense.</p>

                  <p>Actually, there's another option for you, since you desperately want to pursue nursing: ITE.</p>
                  <p>3 years of ITE, then 2 years of Poly, and subsequently University.</p>
                  <p>but considering you were from Nan Hua, you probably would not want this.</p>
                  <p>that's why I support the idea of you repeating O lvl science.</p>
                  <p>but now it seems that you want to repeat almost everything...</p>
                  <p>sorry, I don't know how to help...</p>
                  <p>the private courses cost up to 10k, not inclusive of the exam fees.</p>
                  <p>next best alternative is the O level preparatory courses at ITE.</p>
                  <p>otherwise, stalford learning centre, at various shopping centres and HDB blocks.</p>

              For Bio, since you took Bio SPA all the way to O levels, you can reuse your Bio SPA results (but only if your Bio SPA results is from 2016, ie. SPA results can only be carried over within 12 months only).<p>For Chem, since you dropped out of O levels at last min, your SPA results are considered invalid. Hence for 2017 O levels as a private candidate, you'll have to register for the version of Pure Chem that comes with Practical Paper, instead of SPA. And because you *did* do Chem SPA in Sec 3 &amp; 4, you can honestly declare you have had practical experience with Chem, and hence you do not need to register yourself with a private O level school that offers practical lab sessions.</p><p>So in summary, you can save yourself the money here : you do *not* need to register with a private school, because for Bio you can use your 2016 SPA results, for Chem you can just self-take a Practical Paper.</p><p>As long as you achieve a near-perfect score for your Theory Papers, you only need to pass your Practical Paper (quite easily done just by following the simple instructions given in the question paper), and you can still score an A grade overall. I prove this year after year, by anyhow doing the Practical Paper (coz I can't be bothered with Practical *hehe*), but scoring almost full marks for my Theory Papers, and I still get A grade every year.

              <p>Not from RP environmental science, but I attended a AEM course at RP before on something similar to environmental science.</p>
              <p>Most of the lessons are conducted at the laboratories.</p>

              <p>hi.... created an account because i am going <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crazy</span>.</p>
              <p>So in short, I am facing a <strong>very very very different
              situation</strong> than most people here.</p>
              <p>I did not take my O levels in 2016, in fact it is during the
              previous year, 2015. So yeah I am currently 17 turning 18.
              Currently a TP year 1 student now.</p>
              <p>I am seriously considering to go to JC but I aint sure, if i can
              attain AAA/A LOL.</p>
              <p>My 2015 result was this:</p>
              <p>Eng - B3</p>
              <p>E Math, Combined Sci(Phy/Chem), DnT - A2</p>
              <p>Combined Humans (Hist) - A1</p>
              <p>POA - B3</p>
              <p>Chi - B4 (i really suck at chinese.)</p>
              <p>L1R4 - 10-2 </p>
              <p>L1R5 - 13-2</p>
              <p>As u can see, the problem is </p>
              <p>1. I did not take A maths </p>
              <p>2. Ive been away from sec sch for 1 year</p>
              <p>3. I want to go to science stream because i still want to open
              my choice to Medicine.</p>
              <p>4. I thought my current course was what i wanted but.... IDK LOL
              my gpa was 3.64.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YJC is the only jc i can try because of my lack of A maths. And
              i happen to get distinctions for EMath &amp; Combined Science (H2
              Math pre-requisite)</p>
              <p>HONESTLY HONESTLY I am going crazy. Its either I try to transfer
              from poly to YJC which is probably super tough and idk how to do
              so </p>
              <p>or I transfer to accountancy/biomed course </p>
              <p>or i suck it up in my current course and aim for Biz degree in
              uni.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how. otteoke. RIP i need advice T.T my new year resolution is to
              not have any more regrets</p>
              </div>

              <p>Man wished I had seen this sooner, I'm exactly in the same situation, even exact same O's results! Currently a Yr1 SP biz student transferring to YJC. Had a decent 3.7 gpa but rectifying past mistakes by going to JC.</p>
              <p>Anyways (I assume you've transferred alr), you'll still have 2 more weeks before the posting results will be released to think about making the switch to JC. Your GPA is actually not bad liao, if the point of you transferring is just because of GPA, maybe you'll need to rethink your options because JC is super hard to score too(according to my friends and seniors). Didn't take A Math previously too, and from what I've gathered from my JC friends, H2 math would be HELL because of the lack of basic foundation the A Math provides (that's why I'm not taking it).</p>
              <p>Hey, but if you still plan to go to YJC, see you there man! :)</p>

              first choice. Should I consider entering MI Science stream since it
              is the only institution that allows me to take H2 Math and Science
              without Add math or pure science? Any advice would be great,

              <p>Being a current J2 in PJ and with the recent publicity PJ has gotten last year,I am pretty sure the admin in the school is trying to lower the COP this year to about 12 for arts(13 if no change),and 11 for science.</p>

              <p>Being a current J2 in PJ and with the recent publicity PJ has
              gotten last year,I am pretty sure the admin in the school is trying
              to lower the COP this year to about 12 for arts(13 if no
              change),and 11 for science.</p>

              <p>Where did you get the stats from? If what you saying is true does that mean post-secondary institutions are already aware of the number of applicants even b4 posting results out or are you confusing with last year's jae?</p>
