              <p><span style="font-size: 15.2px;">but im really passionate about jc and i am really
              interested in taking science stream(h2 mathematics phy chem and h1
              econs)  and since i meet the cop for yj... thought of
              appealing to yj science stream even though i dont meet the pre
              requisite to take h2 mathematics at yj... i am still thinking of
              appealing as i think i stand a good chance. i dont fancy the poly
              life cuz i dont like practical stuff more used to theoretical
              science.</span></p>
              <p>my main aim is electrical and electronic engineering at ntu or
              electrical engineering and nus.im also willing to work very hard in
              jc or poly but i cant decide between yj and sp eee
              diploma </p>
              <p>if yj appeal is successful i am afraid that i can't get good A
              level grades and make it to the uni degree i want as yj is quite
              lacking when compared to all those top jcs...like...after being in
              a neighbourhood school i am really scared to go to yj... but poly
              also is quite scary, there are very few uni seats for poly
              graduates and gpa has to be above 3.9 to get direct entry into
              second year of uni degree so as to not lag by 1 year</p>
              <p>someone please advice me on what to do...this is
              URGENT!!!! becoz if i need to appeal to yj... must appeal by
              monday 6 feb</p>
              <p>pls give me an insight on how easy it is to make it to to eee at
              ntu from YJC and SP EEE diploma. all this assuming I work very
              hard</p>
              <p>thanks for the urgent!!!! help<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Hmm if you don't prefer practical stuff they do in poly there's may be a chance you won't be as interested??(?) But if you're really really interested in the course then that shouldn't be a super big problem ;0</p>
              <p>I think YJ is quite okay though, tuition teacher is a uni grad from YJ and says that there is quite a number of YJ grads from his batch who made it into uni too :-) Friend's cousin also graduated from YJ and made it into uni! I was from a neighbourhood school too heh and a large number of peeps from my cohort and seniors went to jcs (some went to the top-tier ones but I have classmates in YJ !)</p>
              <p>If you have great self-discipline (doing your tutorials on time and studying, not getting influenced by others etc) then you should be ok in YJ, if you feel that the content YJ teachers provide is lacking then you can always buy notes from other schools/ buy those workbook thingies at Popular/ get tuition :-D</p>
              <p>Tbh gotta work hard for both jc and poly but I think going the jc route ensures a higher chance of getting into uni </p>
              <p>Goodluckkk </p>

              <p>To be honest,as long as you love o level pure geography as a subject+have the skills to smoke your way through by substantiating randomly made up examples which are rather convincing,A2 shouldn't be difficult.</p>
              <p>Tbh,i think if you screwed up only section A,it cant be that bad bah.I screwed up my paper 2 a lot because I dont read the human geog textbook much,and thus ended up with only A2.</p>
              <p>To do well in SS is actually to ace your SBQ instead of essay,because most people can memorise the essays for every chapter easily and score rather high marks,and thus SBQ is the component where aceing it can have an edge over other people.But of course,both components are also equally important in determining your overall grade</p>

              <p>To be honest,as long as you love o level pure geography as
              a subject+have the skills to smoke your way through by
              substantiating randomly made up examples which are rather
              convincing,A2 shouldn't be difficult.</p>
              <p>Tbh,i think if you screwed up only section A,it cant be that bad
              bah.I screwed up my paper 2 a lot because I dont read the human
              geog textbook much,and thus ended up with only A2.</p>
              <p>To do well in SS is actually to ace your SBQ instead of
              essay,because most people can memorise the essays for every chapter
              easily and score rather high marks,and thus SBQ is the component
              where aceing it can have an edge over other people.But of
              course,both components are also equally important in determining
              your overall grade</p>

              <p>I see. Thanks for your advice. I usually smoke my way through for geog examples since I can't recall some during the exams.</p>
              <p>As for SS, my SBQ is around 21-22/35 so that should be fine unless I couldn't understand the source and spent lots of time on it, which was what happen. </p>
              <p>I retake it with these tips in mind. Thank you so much :)</p>

                  <p>Honestly, you may want to appeal to change course, to business instead. Because honestly, engineering needs a lot of memory work. And it's obvious from your science and humanities that your memory is not good. Considering your Maths get A2 and POA get B3, why don't want consider business? Anyway, good luck to you. Not that it is impossible, but it will be very difficult. Enjoy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, out with it, most of the participants are just actors, right? Because, when I took the o lvl myself few years ago, I never thought of sgforums, or any other forum. Most students probably dun refer to forums to advise them which course to apply, as they have other sources of help, like their secondary school teacher, friends and parents, and also the JC / Poly lecturers... anyway, I was only speaking from experience, as someone from the engineering field. I also took business before. Yes, I agree business need language skills. Not so much about humanities (compare, contrast and memory skill)... but really, looking at his grades, I can tell that he may have a hard time coping with the rigour of the engineering course. (Engineering has a bit of chemistry component, by the way. There's electrolysis; protons and electrons, and other things - which I shall not divulge, as it may reveal the course I'm studying.)</div>
