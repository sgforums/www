              <p>hi...</p>
              <p>I need help.. my brother had receive his 'o'level result recently and this is what he got:</p>
              <p>Engish - B4</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities - C5</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">E maths - D7</span></p>
              <p>Science (Phy/Chem) - C5</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Principles of Accounts - E8</span></p>
              <p>Mother tongue - B3</p>
              <p>so when we look at his form A there were a few poly courses that he could apply so we took  the opportunity to select all the 12 courses from poly in form A that he had interest in. My mistake was i didnt help him check the cut off point which i truely regret not doing. so on the day of the jae result we really had a shock cos he wasnt offered any courses at all.i ve call MOE and the lady told me the best way for him was to apply for poly appeal which we did... but because of the latest cut off point he was only given one course to choose... anyway we try appealing and he wasnt successful..*sobsob*</p>
              <p>so wat i want to know is</p>
              <p>1) Is it he wasn't offered the poly course because  the course capacity was full or because he fail maths?</p>
              <p>2) What is the next step we shld proceed with? shld he apply dae or jus go ahead apply for higher nitec?</p>
              <p>3) How many subjects does we need to pass to enter poly?</p>
              <p>4) is it true that if we get D7 for maths and if we were to be admitted to poly we need to retake to pass the subject?</p>
              <p>thanks i really appreciate if anyone could reply...</p>

              <p>Dear Afyzaazure,</p>
              <p>Based on the information you provided, I am able to calculate that the  L1R2B2 = 24.</p>
              <p>English + Sci + Math + (two other best) = 24.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The list of courses in form A merely just stated that he has met the minimum requirement for applying the course (but that doesn't mean he will be able to get the course). Each course has limited spaces, and is offered to students based on merit. I.e. Priority given to students with good results.</p>
              <p>Each course has its own Cut Off Point (COP) E.g. The COP for Biomedical Science from RP is 19. Meaning the last student entering the course will have scored 19 points for O Level.</p>
              <p>Because your brother failed his mathematics, that could be one of the ultimate reason why he wasn't offered any course. Spaces is limited in the course, and is only offered to students who met the COP. It is very meritocracy... but it's true..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's probably the important part that you may want to take note...</p>
              <p>1) You may want to apply DAE in SP's Electronic and Electrical Engineering, or RP's Sports and Exercise Science... These two are the more "available" courses in Polytechnics. Usually DAE students are posted to the remains seats in these two courses.</p>
              <p>2) Please keep your options open. You may wish to discuss with your brother to ask him consider taking up Higher Nitec. There are wide range of courses to choose from and these course are really very useful in real-life. If he finds something he likes, try applying it during the next intake registration period.</p>
              <p>3) As long as you can meet the minimum requirement for the courses that you intend to pursue, you can go to poly! :-D Actually, to simply say.. you need to pass English, Science, Maths. These three are the very important ones that almost all course require it to pass.</p>
              <p>4) Yes. It's called conditional addmission. It's like a mutual deal. The school offers the student a course under a condition that he/she must pass the subject that he failed. Not every course will allow conditional addmission.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you still have any enquires about your brother's education pathway, please reply in this forum or send me a PM, I would be most glad to assist you.</p>

              <p>For NS deferment, he will need to get a letter from where ever he is studying at and sent to CMPB, or ask his school to fax for him.</p>
              <p>He better not waste anytime - if he is not studying for an entire year, and he got called up for NS, I don't think he can run away from it. </p>
