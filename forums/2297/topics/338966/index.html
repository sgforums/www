              <p>This is an important thread (over 10 pages and 200+ posts long) with many thoughtful posts (and often with multiple opposing viewpoints), regarding the Singapore Education System, that everyone, especially secondary school 'O' level students, would be well advised to read.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a id="thread_title_50339" href="http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/more_top_o_50339.html"><span style="color: #89c65d;">More top O-Level scorers choosing polytechnic route</span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There really is no easy solution, no right nor wrong. MOE themselves, are constantly struggling to balance students' wants with the needs of society. (Sure they could just have popular courses like medicine, law, banking, and make them available to every student who wants it; then the entire country would be overrun by only doctors, lawyers and bankers, and no one else left to do everything else that needs to be done and society would collapse.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think you have some brilliant suggestions (on this issue) for MOE to take into consideration in planning the future of the Singapore Education System, do your part as a Singaporean and share your thoughts (on the original thread, on this thread, on the Straits Times Forum, email to MOE, etc).</p>

              <p>My friends who went JC didn't choose to go to polytechnic not because they aren't interested in it but because of the fact that they have to spend 3 years and polytechic is still (sadly) viewed upon as <em>inferior</em>. Oh and not to mention the difficulty of entering a local university.</p>
              <p>I guess these sort of sterotyping is here to stay whether we like it or not (similar to racism).</p>
              <p>Also, when I occasionally ask my friends on why they chose the polytechnic
                  route, the answer is often that they are tired of the daily routine of
                  the "normal" school life, ie. wearing a <em>school uniform</em>, stringent
                  timetables and having lessons in classrooms (I can never understand the last point, aren't tutorials in classrooms too??).</p>

              <p>if that is the result of her research, than should be true. if this is just her reasoning, ask her to go find out. If i am not wrong, A level is easier than diploma to get into a university.</p>

              <p>Its not the case all the time. Australian Universities often give credit exemptions to poly students for their prior learning and often takes from a semester to about 2 years off their course syllabus depending on the relavance to the degree from the diploma they did.</p>
              <p>I would agree that it would be a better choice to enter poly to get a diploma first as its qualification will be recognised by the local universities as well? And if they dun accept you, you can always get into either overseas universities with credit exemptions or do courses in PSB and MDIS offering overseas degree where you may graduate faster with exemptions than compared to the local universities.</p>
              <p>I think poly route now-a-days are the win win situation with nothing to lose.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, if i choose jc, the indepth study of chem and phy wld allow a better analysis of my strengths and perhaps interest in aspects of the subject.</p>

              <p>I am thinking of the same route as your sister too. But vet med is very exp. So i am trying to get scholarship. Then again, i think i may be going jc because i don't want to limit myself to one route, which may not succeed. I've also been advised by some vet students to go jc instead, though i am really interested in the diplomas in temasek poly. The % of poly students being accepted in vet uni seems low.</p>

              <p>Health Technicians --   these same techcos can progress to be doctors should they wish to one day when the bridging courses and training become available. Not difficult at all. All it needs is for the educationists to work and think outside the box. The several tiers that can provide for a health technician to progress from looking after the hygiene of say a clinic to a technician for servcing and repairing health equipment (medical engineering stuff), to nursing, management of a hospital etc. are pathwaus that have not been clearly stated.</p>
              <p>Likewise Engineers technicians can become paper degree holders too. Strangely enough these engineers who come from the ground-shop floor are usually better engineers than the fresh uni graduate. The pathways are a blur and many who have come up this way has been by sheer hard work after poly.</p>
              <p>So wake up educationist and help tye young aspirants. Come down from your ivory tower and show the way. Create levels of expertise and training avalability to progress from O to U.</p>

              <p>Its not the case all the time. Australian Universities often
              give credit exemptions to poly students for their prior learning
              and often takes from a semester to about 2 years off their course
              syllabus depending on the relavance to the degree from the diploma
              they did.</p>
              <p>I would agree that it would be a better choice to enter poly to
              get a diploma first as its qualification will be recognised by the
              local universities as well? And if they dun accept you, you can
              always get into either overseas universities with credit exemptions
              or do courses in PSB and MDIS offering overseas degree where you
              may graduate faster with exemptions than compared to the local
              universities.</p>
              <p>I think poly route now-a-days are the win win situation with
              nothing to lose.</p>

              <p>are you discussing about credit exemption?</p>
              <p>I thought we were discussing about A levels and poly, which one is easier to get into uni.</p>
              <p>From what you said, yes, they give credit exemption. credit exemption not equal to easier to enter the uni.</p>

              <p>I am thinking of the same route as your sister too. But vet med is very exp. So i am trying to get scholarship. Then again, i think i may be going jc because i don't want to limit myself to one route, which may not succeed. I've also been advised by some vet students to go jc instead, though i am really interested in the diplomas in temasek poly. The % of poly students being accepted in vet uni seems low.</p>
