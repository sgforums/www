              <p>I urge all Tamil parents who have children in Secondary Schools to write in to the Forum Page if you have a similar experience like us.</p>

Simply laze around without any supervision. <br> <br>We parents find this an utter waste of time and resources. <br>Not to mention the additional stress of having to travel to and fro.<br> <br>Despite all the progress and improvements to our country as well as our education system, <br>during the last 40 years, one thing still remains the same.<br>Tamil students are expected to excel over their peers, but where is the support from the ministry?<br> <br>There is no shortage of Tamil teachers in Singapore, given that the ministry now has, not only a talent pool <br>of local graduate teachers, but also many foreign teachers from India, of whom many have already been awarded PR status.<br> <br>We parents also believe that there's no lack of Tamil students to form a cohort.<br> <br>Parents like us feel that Tamil, being one of the four official languages in Singapore is being discriminated.<br>After 40 years of nation building, where is the progress for Tamil students?<br> <br>Are our schools so poorly funded or equipped that we cannot even arrange classes for Tamil students in their own school. <br>Who is responsible for these arrangements? The school or the Ministry?<br><br></span></p>
