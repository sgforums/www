              <p><br>True, some parts of the pure chem syllabus (eg. addition and condensation polymers? proteins? are these in combined science?) are taken out in the combined science chem syllabus. I personally specialize in A level Chem, so I'm not too sure about  the O level syllabus, I usually just teach my O level students A level stuff coz it's more thrilling. Most of my O level students flee in terror and never come back, which is why I hardly have any O level students.*shrugs*)</p>
              <p>You should check with the SEAB website for the detailed syllabuses for O level Pure Chem vs Combined Science Chem : <a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/">http://www.seab.gov.sg/</a></p>
              <p>But other than a few subtopics here and there that the combined science student can skip, the *<em><strong>slightly</strong></em>* increased difficulty level of the pure chem TYS makes for suitable practice for combined science Chem students.</p>

              <p>The chapter on experimental chemistry for pure chemistry, there is an additional section on the paper chromatography to calculate the rf values.</p>

              <p>The chapter on chemical bonding. In pure chemistry syllabus, there is an additional section on 'metallic bond'. It is not found in the sci(chem) syllabus. This section aims to help students better understand the bondings in metal.</p>
              <p>The chapter on mole calculation has an additional section of yield % and purity % in the pure chemistry syllabus.</p>
              <p>The chapter on electrolysis as mentioned by ultimaonline, it is not included in the sci(chem) syllabus. It will be a good read for further understand the process of metal extractions.</p>
              <p>The chapter on Chemical reaction, more emphasis is place on the calculation and understanding of enthalpy changes for pure chemistry. sci(chem) requires only basic understanding of enthalpy change in the reaction.</p>
              <p>The chapter on air, Pure chemistry syllabus includes a environmental protection section to further educate student about air pollutants and the importance of ozone.</p>
              <p>Organic compounds such as alkans, alkenes, alcohols, and carboxylic acids will be tested in sci (chem/bio). The marcomolecule section of organic chemistry has been removed from the syllabus as of last 2010.</p>

              <p>That have to depend on the person. The syllabus is slightly different but a combine science student can easily absorb the knowledge if he/she invest some time into learning pure science stuffs. Afterall, understanding the knowledge is vital because if he/she couldn't understand, that person will not be able to impart and explain the concept of knowledge correctly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>I remembered once when I took a cab to a meeting. The cab driver told me educators are more likely to be banish to 19th level hell instead of the 18th level hell. The reason being if you impart the wrong knowledge to your student. One day if your student becomes a teacher, he will pass down the wrong knowledge, and thus create a greater sin.</em></p>
