              <p>     Isnt E(45%-49%)considered a pass too even though is somewhat a borderline pass?</p>
              <p>I personally feel you didn't do that badly bah,my school almost 40-50% of the h2 econs cohort got U for MYE,including those who took o level econs and got A1 for it.Either people in my school taking h2 econs are mostly weak in their content or the teachers were more strict i guess.</p>

              <p>Another reason: Teachers don't usually test things that are taught in class. It would be like giving you the questions beforehand.</p>
              <p>They like testing things that are not taught in class. There are good and bad. The good is it sieves out students who truly understand the concepts. The bad, students who do not 100% understand (or have no time to revise a lot due to heavy CCA committments) suffer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why econs tuition may help</p>
              <p>Apart from giving you extra feedback on your essays, you recieve materials that are different from the school. Imagine econs essays by your peers, all writing the same stuff. Your teacher read also sian... So give less marks. So when you have something different from what the teacher taught, he/she will sit up and read because it is not different from the rest of the cohort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How you can replicate that yourself</p>
              <p>Although I'm a full time tutor, I must emphasize that tuition is never necessary. It is merely a vehicle that reduces your time for revision, and helps you revise faster (just an effective use of $$ to buy more time so students can rest more). Many things still have to depend on yourself. In the scenario of econs tuition, I would say relevant materials collection have be done and summarized for you, and taught to you how to summarize and write differently, making your essay stand out.</p>
              <p>You could do it yourself too, i.e. collect your own materials and spend the effort to think how to appy these new materials to your newly learned concepts, and how to then apply it to essays. Then collect good essays and spend the effort to analyse why the essays are good, and what you can take and use from the essays into your own.</p>
              <p>I did the above when I was in JC. I didn't really know about the availability of econs tuition at that time (it was a pretty rare subject then). I spent countless time in the library, over straits times, and over the internet (using dial up modem). My econs grade went from an E to a B and finally to an A doing that. </p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">I tot generally for tertiary studies it's like that?</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">That's why alot of ppl have a drop in grades after secondary school. what TS need to realised is that the teachers will not spoonfeed everything anymore.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;">This is where research/revision comes in. Alot of time spent will be either in study groups sharing different pointers or solo in libraries, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reading =&gt; understanding =&gt; </span></strong><strong style="font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 18.7112px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">summarizing </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">=&gt; applying</span></strong>.</p>
