              Hi guys, I'm a sec 3 student studying in singapore. My ambition is to study in NUS Law. I heard that in order to get into Law, your grades must be excellent plus you must have outstanding Cca records and character, this it is a very competitive and hard faculty to get in.
              However, as I watch the past three years of my secondary school life dwindle by, I realised that I haven't achieved anything, while I see my other classmates who are excelling in their studies and holding various leadership positions like class chairman, president of a Cca, Vice President, treasurer, secretary, being a councilor etc. I feel so unaccomplished and I feel like a failure!:( 
              
              At least they could have these leadership positions to back them up, while I have nothing. I can't understand how to get a leadership position, in my school, there are quite a lot of leadership positions that u can fulfill, but I'm not fulfilling anyone of them:(
              
              I really love English and the humanities, especially literature and history, therefore my interest in law.
              
              What should I do now?

            <div class='col-md body'>You know something....let me tell you this. There are many students who do very well in their academic studies and they seems to be very outstanding students. However, after their graduation from higher studies and they started to work..............many of them don't do very well like they did in the past in schools, when they come out into the real world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You don't have to hold that leadership position to proof to yourself that you are worthy. Just get active in E.C.A. like in sports, air-rifle club, judo club, uniform groups etc, be proactive about it and do your best. When you show enthusiasm in what you do.....other people in your school will know you and recognize you. Recognition and Acknowledgement from the others about you will come automatically when you show your best in what you do. You will be famous in your school when that happens. These attitude and principle will help you in your real life later.</div>
