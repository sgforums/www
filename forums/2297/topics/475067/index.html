Just finished my promotional exams. Think I'm able to pass and promote but not at all satisfied with my Year 1 performance. Haven't gotta an A or a B for any subjects. I aim to finish at least 80% of the A Level syllabus in the Nov/Dec holidays as well as redo all tutorials. I also wanna work on my fitness to at least get a NAFTA Silver next year (I am quite weak) so that I don't have to book in early for NS. </span><br style="color: #606060; font-family: arial, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;"><span style="color: #606060; font-family: arial, geneva, lucida, 'lucida grande', arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;">But it's hard to maintain productivity and efficiency during the long break; holiday plans have never worked so far for me. But I think next year will be very crucial to deciding my future. So any tips on how to pace yourself in the holidays to prepare yourself for next year?</span></p></div>

              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">Hi,I am a fellow J1 with PCMH combination<br></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I agree with you.Better to cover concepts of past chapters than to move on to new chapters. The furthest you should study ahead is the chapters covered by the post-promo lectures.</span>If you didn't obtain a B so far(especially for maths,I suggest you re-do most of the tutorials and spend more time especially on Integration and Applications of Differentiation,which can be quite tedious.)</p>
              <p>Pro tip:don't attempt chapter 1 and chapter 2 unless you are not very confident with the two.(saves time)</p>
              <p>Chem/Physics:try TYS mcq and structured if you know the tutorial concepts at your fingertips.You can also look for additional assessment books.</p>
              <p>With the timespan before the next exam *not test*(mine is on next year start of march),expect to cover 60% of the concepts in detail.</p>
              <p>"It is not how much you finish,it is how much you learn."A three H2 A friend of mine,is focusing on leisure learning this holiday.That is,to study without any time constraints and pressure.When you feel like resting or playing,just let loose.</p>
              <p>I suggest running as leisure.It is one sport that has multiple benefits.Not just Napfa,it also serves to destress you.While it is strenuous to go out to run,but you can be motivated with a running buddy.<span style="color: #ff6600;">After the run,it helps in studies(maths),emotional release,physical development.</span></p>
              <p>Peak at the right moment(Next year and not holidays<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png">)and jot down specific concepts you do not understand while studying during the holidays to clarify your doubts with teachers. Specific subjects like General Paper will require long-term development to progress.Reading helps but applying what you have read is 5x better.</p>
              <p>"be optimistic and patient,success is at your doorstep."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@mugger. Thanks a lot bro. For the past exams, I usually finish all my tutorials &amp; revise the concepts before exams. But I have always been getting just pass grades (E,D and C), any tips on why is this so? Do I lack practice or it is a problem with studying methods? Is external resources necessary to reach top grades in school?</p></div>

              <p>I scored D for my physics but will be moderated to a C. I did the necessary practices too. The concepts are application-based.This means that rote learning(memory-based) will only get you at most C if you are lucky. This also goes to show that completing tutorials is not the key to good grades. Understanding is more important than completing.Spending more time on a concept is important. There are two factors that tend to determine your exam results:Exam and study skills.</p>
              <p>Exam skills:Time management,Data analysis,ability to keep calm in times of difficulty</p>
              <p>Study skills:Intensive studying(without distraction)beats divided attention when studying. 1hr of complete focus beats 2.5hr of divided attention.Consistency&gt;cramming.1hr for 365 days is better than 365hrs for 1 month</p>
              <p>You may want to look into TYS and step-by-step egs assessment books.</p>
              <p>If  you want top grades(A),I suggest you achieve a B first.A to B is 10marks gap while B to C is 5 marks gap.It will be more difficult for B to A,even tougher for C to A.Don't give yourself undue pressure because of your targets.</p>
              <p>I suggest tuition if 1:you want to be constantly ahead of lectures. 2.your tutor in class fails to explain tutorial concepts well enough, sadly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif">it happens sometimes.3.Need more time practise and papers to do.(if your reason to attend tuition fits 3 the most,attend the tuition only 2 months before a major exam,it really helps.)</p>
              <p>Jia you and all the Best!</p>
