              <p>I reproduce a post I made on another local forum, about "single-sex schools vs co-ed schools".</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Even in the military, eg. SAF, there are at least some female regulars (not just the older chief clerks, but younger NSF-age girls as well). Even then, the military is already psychologically unhealthy in the sense of a severely unbalanced sex ratio.<br><br>What more in single-sex schools. Sexuality (as a psychology, not necessarily the physical act) is a natural component of the human psyche. Single-sex schools, eg. convent schools, are extremely unhealthy to the teen psyche, and exist only out of dogmatic, fear-based parents who erroneously think sexuality is 'sinful' and that they must control their child's feelings/thinkings/behaviours, for his/her own good, by eliminating contact with the opposite sex and 'focus on studies'.<br><br>Single-sex schools, invariably, inevitably and naturally result in increased incidence and tendencies towards homosexuality (including lesbianism). Now, I have nothing personal against LBGTs (especially since at a spiritual level, I recognize all souls are simultaneously male and female, and every human on the planet, everyone reading this thread, has many past lives as both man and woman; hence, LBGT behaviour can be understandable, as long as it is not unethical and does not involve coercion, exploitative manipulation, rape or worse). <br><br>My issue, is with the enforced, involuntary and cruelty associated when you force a teen to enter a single-sex school against his/her own will, thinking it's for his/her own good (when it's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> for his/her own good, whether he/she is heterosexual or homosexual). Although it's only for a few years (since all ITEs, JCs, Polys and Unis are of course, co-ed) in the primary and secondary schools, it is those precious few years in primary or secondary school that are the relevant years in nuturing the healthy growth of a teenager's psyche (in all aspects, including sexuality).<br><br>In a single-sex school, the child will experience a lack of opportunities for interaction with members of the opposite sex of the same age (which is the cruel intention of the misguided parents), which will not only lead to stunted sexuality development, but the child may also fall victim to other aggressive schoolmates with homosexual or bisexual tendencies, which may either traumatize the child, and/or leave a permanent mark or undue influence on his/her psyche at a tender young age.<br><br>We cannot blame the aggressive classmates with LBGT tendencies, because they too, are (while partly the perpetrators, are also) the victims of a cruel, severely imbalanced and destructive (to the psychological growth of a child) unnatural institution of a single-sex schools. The heterosexual students feel frustrated (at lack of interaction with the opposite sex) and may either feel tempted to try out alternative sexual orientations, or have aggressive schoolmates force themselves (not necessarily physically, but socially) unto the child.<br><br>Again, I'm not blaming the LBGT community (I have sympathy and empathy for them, especially as they themselves often feel persecuted by societial and religious dogma, as all of them (the LBGTs, society and religious folks) are mostly without the deeper understanding of sexuality in the deeper spiritual context of the soul, past lives, and reincarnation), I'm blaming the unnatural, unenlightened, severely imbalanced and destructive institution of single-sex schools (or by extension, any single-sex organizations or institutions, including religious ones).<br><br>Epilogue :<br>In case anyone is wondering, very thankfully my own primary, secondary and JC schools were all co-ed. A natural, balanced interaction with the opposite sex, most definitely helped my studies a lot, both in terms personal motivation in personal BGR relationships, as well as having a healthy sense of natural balance in one's learning environment, and being delighted to go to school everyday. <img class="inlineimg" title="Heart" src="http://cdn.forums.sgclub.com/images/smilies/largesmiles/heart.GIF" border="0" alt=""></p>

              <p><br>My list of recommended books for Singapore A levels H1 / H2 Chemistry is here :<br><a href="http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry</a></p>
              <p>For difficult questions (ie. questions more difficult than the ones found in standard A level textbooks or exams), you'll have to source out for yourself such questions from Uni textbooks (such as the ones I recommend in the link above; choose from these Uni books, the questions that you deem still relevant for your students' A level syllabus), as well as from the various countries' Chemistry Olympiad papers (link for UK Olympiad papers given on my webpage).</p>
              <p>You can also check out the list of recommended books for A levels Chemistry by Ex-MOE Teacher Mr Chong (ChemGuide aka SimpleMinded) :<br><a href="http://alevelchemistrysg.blogspot.sg/search/label/Z%29Recommended%20Textbooks">http://alevelchemistrysg.blogspot.sg/search/label/Z%29Recommended%20Textbooks</a></p>
