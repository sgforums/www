              <p>Hi, there is a 23  year old in my school who is still studying in middle school(grade 4-5). Judging from his work, he is about 12 years behind his work. What is sad is that he is quite hardworking, but still unable to cope? luckily the school allows him to study at his own pace, i do not mean to push him, but i would like to see him make an improvement.  </p>
              <p>How can i encourage him? i believe he must be disheartened by his studies.</p>
              <p>How should i start? i try to spend about an hour a day to help him understand his work, but thats hardly enough time for him to do much.</p>
              <p>How can i get him to remember the spellings of words? phonics, breaking up the syllables.etc?</p>
              <p>Really appreciate your help. Thanks </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Your wish to help is most noble!</p>
              <p>  Do not feel sad for him, because he is not making progress quickly enough. This boy is unique and traditional methods may not work. Just continue what you are doing and he'll improve because he knows that he is loved. Incorporate fun and games in your lessons with him. Make him laugh and learning will become easier for him.</p>

              <p>Yeah, dont feel sad.</p>
              <p>You are great to spend an hour teaching him.</p>
              <p>Go slow with him.</p>
              <p>Buy some picture cards and let him learn.</p>
              <p>Though he cannot spell correctly, but at least he can recoginse the words.</p>
              <p>Bring him along with you to places where you can teach him and that will make things more interesting.</p>
              <p>Eg) Bring him to airport, show him who is security guards, counter staffs, runway, planes, boardings...I am sure he will be able to learn fast.</p>
              <p>Dont give up on him.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p>Ello bl1995cy, </p>
              <p>Will you happen to be his schoolmate? It is good that you are trying to push him to improve, but I believe what is more important is that he has done everything within his capabilities to improve his studies.</p>
              <p>Certainly, an hour is not enough. Thus, you can try getting the educators and/or student-helpers in the school to pitch in some time to help him out during their free time, if they are willing to do so that is. It is not impossible, but it will be very difficult for you to help him out by yourself alone.</p>
              <p>As for learning of spelling and such for a student with learning disabilities, it will be better for you to seek professional help on that, as they will be more knowledgeable as to what are the possible methods and strategies which you could implement.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">That is certainly most kind of you. As mentioned previously, I will encourage you to seek the help of a few like-minded pals who are willing to spare their time to help your classmate. 2 days will translate into 2 hours, and if 5 students are willing to help out, there will be a total of ten hours. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">This may not seem a lot, but it will definitely be great help to your classmate, given that he is a diligent student as you have mentioned, and thus will put in all he has during these "extra periods".</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Do consult the special-needs teacher too, and ask for his professional opinion and advices. What he has to say will likely be of great use when you apply it in your tutoring of your classmate.</p>

              <p>i believe it is better to help him individually as i will know is weaker points, but if i were to rotate with others, they might not know where he is weak in. But the problem is there is only an average of 4 hours in school and expect to do 2-3 hours of homework at home, what i fear is outside of school, he may need help to understand the questions which i' m trying to schedule a plan where i can help him without  affecting my own work.</p>
              <p>im thinking of tutoring him 3 times a week for a 1 hr during school hours, and perhaps another 1 1/2 hrs after school with would be about 5 hours a week. </p>
              <p>I will try consulting the special needs teacher, but it's mainly the time which is the problem.</p>
