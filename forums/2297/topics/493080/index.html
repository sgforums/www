              <div class="field-items" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <div class="odd field-item" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Back in the 1990s, when I was a secondary school student, only a few of my friends had access to private tuition. Today, however, it is not uncommon for the majority of one's classmates to have this. Some may even have tuition in several subjects.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">In 2011, 71.3 per cent of secondary school students received some form of tuition - defined as receiving out-of-school extra lessons, whether paid for or otherwise. By contrast, only 33.9 per cent received tuition in 1995.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Three questions arise:</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• 1. Why are tuition rates so high and increasing in Singapore?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• 2. Who are the children that attend tuition?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• 3. Do these children perform better than their peers who don't?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">To answer the first point, tuition rates tend to be high in countries where high-stakes exams prevail because parents see a need to prepare their children adequately for these assessments.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Because performance in exams such as the Primary School Leaving Examination, O and A levels plays an important role in determining admissions to selective schools and universities, it is not surprising that parents in Singapore focus a lot of attention on programmes they perceive will ensure their children's academic success.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">So the growing prevalence of tuition has largely been demand-driven, but part of the increase is likely also due to peer pressure. When parents see others enrolling their children for tuition, they worry that their child might be at a disadvantage if they do not act likewise. Consequently, some may enrol their children even when they are doing well academically.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">To answer questions 2 and 3, I analysed data from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa). This is a large-scale international survey (see separate commentary on Page A30) involving 15-year-old students.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">A comparison between children who received tuition and children who did not reveals that the former are more likely to be from affluent families. For instance, those who received tuition were more likely to be from families who owned at least one car and are English-speaking.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">This finding is consistent with the fact that richer families are able to afford more educational resources for their children.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">A more pertinent question is whether children who choose to receive tuition actually perform better than their peers who choose not to.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Surprisingly, a simple comparison indicates that this is not the case. In fact, children who received tuition actually scored about 0.256 standard deviations lower on their tests than those who did not (standard deviation is a measure of how spread out test scores are from the average).</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Even after adjusting for differences in students' age, gender, home language, family structure, native-born status, material possessions, grade-level and schools, as well as parents' education levels and employment status, those who received tuition were found to perform 0.133 standard deviations worse.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">The same findings emerge even when comparisons are made within-students (when test scores were compared across subjects for the same students, if they had tuition in one subject but no tuition in another). Although these results pertain to mathematics achievement, similar results are found for science and English. These findings are consistent with those found earlier by professors Euston Quah and Roland Cheo in a 2005 Singapore-based study.</p>
              <div class="field-name-body-linked field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-top: 3px double #bfbfbf; padding-top: 1.6rem; position: relative;">
              <div class="field-items" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <div class="odd field-item" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <h4 style='box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Curator, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.1; color: #039ac8; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; text-transform: uppercase;'>SO WHY THE SURPRISE RESULT?</h4>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">There several explanations for the negative association between tuition and performance. The first is that students who receive tuition choose to receive it precisely because they are not doing well in school. In other words, weak performance may be what is driving students to enrol for tuition.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">An alternative explanation is that tuition is counterproductive. How can this be? Well, students might end up disliking the subject if they are forced to attend extra classes. This might be especially true if they are subject to long hours of tuition every week. Indeed, the benefits of an additional hour of tuition might fall, and even become negative at some point as the number of hours spent on it increases.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Another possibility is that the mere access to a tutor may alter the learning attitudes of students. They might reason: "I don't have to pay much attention in school since I always have my tutor to depend on." Thus, there may be a tendency to slack off on regular classes, to their detriment.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">While it is unclear which of the explanations is correct, the negative association is clearly large and highly statistically significant.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Do the results imply that all parents should now stop sending their children for tuition?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Not really. As mentioned, the results show only that a relationship between tuition and performance exists. However, this relationship may not necessarily be causal (tuition may not cause weaker performance).</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Secondly, even if the results were causal, they reflect only the average effect of tuition across all 15-year-olds. The precise effect of tuition for any one child could still be positive, depending on factors specific to the child, such as the quality of his tutor and how the child responds to tuition.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">In making decisions, parents should consider questions such as:</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• Does the tutor have the relevant skills to guide my child well?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• Does the tutor possess a proven record?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• Will tuition help to clarify my child's misconceptions?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">• Or will it simply cause him to become confused and lose interest in the subject? Answering these questions will help focus a parent's decision on the question of tuition.</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I think the question boils down to your purpose of hiring a private tutor. </p>
              <p>There are always two sides to a coin hence a good tutor will be able to motivate and push your child to fulfill his or her hidden potential. It is in every child to perform, with the help of a specialist who has a nurturing heart for the next generation.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Last month, National University of Singapore economics lecturer Kelvin Seah analysed survey data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) in 2012 and made a surprising finding: Students who had tuition fared worse than those who did not.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Dr Seah, 34, said he came to two conclusions: "Either these students were receiving tuition because they were weaker in the first place or they did worse because of tuition. That means tuition and having too many lessons might be counter-productive."</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Education experts said it is difficult to establish how much of a role tuition has in academic success or if it has contributed to Singapore's stellar showing in Pisa, a global benchmarking test which 15-year-olds here topped last year.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>But what is beyond dispute is the growth of the shadow education industry. Tuition is worth more than a billion dollars annually here, almost double the $650 million spent on it in 2004.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; font-size: 19px;'>Some parents spend several hundreds or thousands of dollars on tuition each month, despite knowing that having tuition may not raise their children's grades significantly.</p>
              <div class="field-name-body-linked field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden" style='box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 19px; border-top: 3px double #bfbfbf; padding-top: 1.6rem; position: relative; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; color: #333333;'>
              <div class="field-items" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <div class="odd field-item" style="box-sizing: border-box;">
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">This stems from a strong commitment to education in Singaporean families - doing well at national examinations is a priority for many parents and students.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Dr Yeap Ban Har, 48, principal of Marshall Cavendish Institute, which conducts professional development courses for teachers, reckoned tutoring helps in mastering the basics, but does not contribute significantly to performing well in novel, challenging problems.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">"If a student is weak in basics, tuition might help with basic skills questions as it tends to be about practice and more practice," he said. "But it may not help with challenging, novel ones, like those found in the Pisa exercise."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">National Institute of Education don Jason Tan said the efficacy of tuition varies from student to student. "I don't think you can say tuition does not work for anyone."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Experts said tuition will exist as long as there are high-stakes national examinations.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Dr Seah said tuition should not be lightly dismissed. "For students whose families can afford better-quality tuition and enrichment, it could be a big part of why they continue to do well."</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 50px;">Dr Yeap said the skills of a teacher make more of a difference in a student's learning process. "It is not a case of tuition or no tuition... If a teacher can create opportunities (for students) to explore, to collaborate, to think structurally, to reflect, to communicate, to be independent, to make meaning, to be confident… It does not matter whether he is a teacher in a school, or a tutor."</p>
