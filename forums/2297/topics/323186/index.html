              <p><strong>Hmmm... a business rival eh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>I'm a full time tutor (ex-MOE teacher) myself. I give tuition in 'A' level Chemistry, 'A' level Biology, 'O' level Chemistry, 'O' level Biology.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Singapore, being the No.1 paperchase-kiasu country in the world, naturally has one of the most competitive education industry (both public and private, all levels up to tertiary) in the world as well... approximately on par with Japan, Korea, HongKong, etc.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Being in the education industry (specifically tuition services) therefore, has its pros (lots of customer demand) and ironically consequently, its cons (lots of tutors!).</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>You may have read the recent Straits Times articles on the "Super-Tutors", which I read with a mix of amusement and mock horror - "Aww shucks! now that the secret is out, all the current MOE teachers (drawing 3k+) will quit to become super tutors (20k?!?!)! More rivals for me! hmmmph!!! (just kidding)"</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>But of course, it's not quite as simple as that. It all boils down to what you really want to do with yourself, with your life, what you will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled with. Though if you're considering a career as a teacher with MOE, I'd say go for it - even if you decide to resign from MOE, at least you'd have tuition services as an option - you will NEVER starve to death in Singapore (unlike if you tried other professions and industries instead... economy is hard, unemployment is high).</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Being an MOE teacher is an iron rice bowl for this reason - you can always give tuition later, after you resign or retire from MOE. Not every tutor will earn 20k, of course. But be grateful that you can put food on your table when many Singaporeans don't even have enough money to pay their electricity bills, water bills, phone bills, medical bills, etc.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sad, the ever widening rich-poor income gap. There are 77 thousand millionaries in Singapore as of 2008, and yet (at least) 77% of Singaporeans are suffering from poverty. Singapore has one of the worst Gini coefficients in the world.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>So... Mr Business Rival... go get ur own! Hmmph! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hehe, just kididng lah... I'm such a nice person so here's a tip for you and all tutors : visit Bras Basah complex (between Bugis MRT and City Hall MRT) and obtain the latest Prelim Papers of all the JCs for your relevant subject(s). Then make photocopied booklets of these for your students to use.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>

              <p>Yes tutoring is full of potential. I am currently teaching sec maths every sunday at a particular tuition centre. There are about 5-10 students in my class. I am paid $50 an hour so its $75 for 1.5hr of work.</p>
              <p>I have seen "part-time" tutors who take about 3 assignments on sunday which means $75 x 3 = $225 a day. They get paid even more if they are teaching JC or A* classes. And they will also get more assignments during the weekdays!</p>
              <p>Being an ex-MOE teacher will help because it gives you more credentials and more tuition centres will want to employ you on a "part time" basis. Unfortuntately i am not one.</p>
              <p>Super tutors at 20k a month is definitely possible. I have also "heard" of private home tutors who earned 10k a month just because they took 50 students a month each. (each student paying at least $200 a month)</p>

              <p>Yes, this is one of the unique advantages of being in the educational business in Singapore - there is high demand (although there is also high competition) for education and paper qualifications.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding pay, of course there are other ways to earn 20k a month. Adam Khoo , for instance, is earning several millions *per month*. His books offer many money making ideas, and are worth a read for any businessman and/or entrepreneur.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding teaching and/or tutoring as a profession, again, as FirePig has stated above, it's certainly a viable career or profession, with significant advantages over most other professions with comparable pay, *especially* if being your own boss and personal freedom is important to you. So students, study hard and study smart now, and with good qualifications, you can always have teaching or tutoring as a professional career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But ultimately, it's what YOU as a unique individual, want to do with your own life. You are the Captain of Your Destiny, the Master of Your Own Soul, Live Your Life, and Live It Well.</p>

              <p>hmm.. UltimaOnline and FirePig, I only worked as tutor for some rice haha.</p>
              <p>Afterall, I charged only $35/hr for all my H2 chem, kinda cheap cos i dun have enough knowledge to make them score 100 but at least got a 80 if they work real hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, there maybe more tutors, but there is a real need to differentiate yourself from others. For me, all my students got my personal notes for free (self-made one) but it is only meant for last min review.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, thanks UltimaOnline, I am only one of those who offer 1-1 tutoring only. Anyway, my latest tuition deal is a RJC student &gt;.&lt; lol.... hell time!</p>

              <p><br>At least two different shops sell the papers. Both are on the same level (3rd level I think), you can't miss them because they display rows upon rows of exam papers prominently outside their shops. One of the shops is called Rainbow bookstore, and the other one ont he same level a few meters away.</p>
