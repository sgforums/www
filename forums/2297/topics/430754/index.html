              <p>Hi, im sec 3 this year and so far these are the topics i have covered: kinetic particle theory, element, mixture and compounds, atomic structure, The Periodic Table, ionic bonding, covalent bonding and metallic bonding.</p>
              <p>In my spare time in order to get a better foundation of the chemistry topics that i will face in the future, i read up on The Mole chapter. i found it okay to understand but when questions arise, i'm unable to do it. so i was wondering if there is any other chemistry topics that is based more on calculation or more of the topics that i've done so far which is more of understand the concepts and writing in (Unlike maths or add maths).</p>
              <p>If possilbe can u awesome guys tell me which chapters have calculations in the sec 3 and 4 syllabus (The whole textbook) thanks guys!</p>

              <p>Chemistry calculations, while commonly appearing as a topic unto itself "mole concept" or "stoichiometry" or "chemical calculations" etc, is really an aspect of Chemistry that can be applied to virtually any 'O' level and 'A' level topic : eg. organic chemistry, acid and bases, speed of reactions (kinetics), gases, energetics (enthalpy changes), qualitative analysis, sulfur and nitrogen, experimental techniques / SPA / planning, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want to self-learn, buy a couple of good 'O' level books with detailed worked solutions, including of course, the topic on mole / chemistry calculations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you still have difficulty after attempting to self-learn, consider going for private tuition (eg. Darkness Hacker specializes in 'O' level Chem tuition).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And of course, you can always feel free to post your queries (eg. if you don't understand a particular worked solution in a practice book) here on this forum, or on any of the thousands of student-based and/or chemistry based forums on the internet.</p>

              <p><br>Hi <a href="/users/277390">SgStudentStressed</a>,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chemistry is the Central Science, and both Physicists and Biologists need to work with it to some extent, which is why I'm keen to promote students' interest and deeper understanding of Chemistry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is never too late to start cheonging Chem. Specifically, you have to ask yourself what future profession of interest, and accordingly, your University course of interest is. If you're looking into a Science-based career and University course, then you should definitely cheong Chem, together with *either* Physics or Biology. (Due to the contrasting subject requirement in the new H2/H1 JC system, it is difficult to study Triple Science these days).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If engineering is your interest, Physics is the other important subject you need to focus on. If biological sciences is your interest, Biology is the other important subject you need to focus on. Either way, ensure your Chemistry is strong, so as to keep more doors open, University as well as profession wise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for chemistry calculations, you may be asked to do them in *any* topic of chemistry, which is why your calculations foundation need to be strong, or you will suffer across topics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can check out my list of questions in my two threads (url below). The questions I've indicated as applicable to both "A-level and O-level", are almost always chemistry calculations questions. In fact, the most common Challenging Qns that can be asked at O levels, are the chemistry calculations qns which are considered easy or standard difficulty 'A' level chemistry calculation questions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thread 1<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/320107">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/320107</a></p>
              <p>Thread 2<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/392932">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/392932</a></p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>If you really want to cheong and master chemistry calculations, you can consider buying an 'A' level Chem practice book (eg. CS Toh's 'A' level Practice Qns) and practice all the chemistry calculations / stoichiometry questions in the book. Of course, if even the basic 'O' level chem calculation qns are a problem for you, then do not buy 'A' level chem books, they may do more harm (discouragement) than good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you find yourself with a keen interest in Chemistry (or any particular subject), do consider becoming an MOE teacher in future, and share your appreciation, deeper understanding and love of the subject.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of my chemistry students went on to become MOE chemistry teachers, following in my footsteps. Share the joy forwards.</p>
