              <p>Actually you don't have to worry much.</p>
              <p>In my school, there are quite a number of people who took H2
              maths without A.Maths background. By the way, JCs do provide
              additional A.Maths lesson for those who are new to it. So, as long
              as you work hard, you should be able to handle H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>However, if you're still worried on your ability to cope, i
              recommand that you apply for the arts stream, which offer H1 maths,
              instead of the science stream as H2 maths is a complusary subject
              there.</p>

              <p>I think without Add maths, it would be too difficult for you to cope unless you are someone who easily score A1 for emath.</p>
              <p>JC maths nowsaday are very intense i think. They have tests every 2 weeks and tutorial assignments every now and then. And some students still fail maths despite working very hard.</p>
              <p>Same for other subjects like physics and General paper. They have tests, compos every 1-2 weeks. You will get so overwhelmed sometimes that you cant do your own revision as you have to study for &lt;blah blah&gt; physics and maths test on monday, a chinese test on wed, chemistry test on thursday, english compre test on friday.</p>

              <p>If one really have the will, nothing is too hard for him. What the TS need now is at least a B in H2 Maths, since he needs 3 H2 with at least Bs and 1 contrast H1 with at least a C.</p>
              <p>If he works hard and perserve, it shouldn't be too hard for him to get this result. Cut down on the time going out, and lock the PSP/XBOX up somewhere, and the results would be sure to show themselves.</p>
              <p>A lot of students complain to me that they do not have enough time, but I find that it is more of them not using their time wisely.</p>
              <p>Also, in a JC, one must not be shy, and must learn to socialise and study together with others - the more the amount of ideas spreaded around, the faster the solution will present itself.</p>

              <p>Both your 2nd and 3rd comments are wrong.</p>
              <p>Some girls are born...not so nice to look at, and require some facial surgery. No matter how hard they exercise, eat healthy food, they will still scare the daylights out of others. Just remember that facial surgeries are not cheap.</p>
              <p>As for students, just as any good teacher will say, there is no such thing as stupid students, but there are slower learners and students who have mental blockages. Some tutors and parents/guardians I have seen have nastily and cruelly labelled these students as idiots or useless, and do you know what is the biggest wrong they could accuse them of? Being lazy. These students are not lazy, but they are not well motivated, as they are surrounded by a lot of negative factors. In this cases, the tutors and teachers have to work VERY hard to show the students that they have hope, and allow them to give themselves the chance.</p>
              <p>I have such a student myself, and I sometimes find myself committing the mistake or forcing him to work even harder, even though I know he has a mental blockage problem. His guardian and relatives often call him stupid or lazy, but I know better myself. </p>
              <p>Trust me, if you are not an experienced or dedicated tutor/teacher, you won't be able to differentiate these students from those who are truly lazy.</p>

              <p>You can take H1 MAths, another 2H2 science subjects, but your contrast subject will also need to be H2.</p>
              <p>If you are good in English, take H2 lit, good in Arts, take H2 Arts, or you could simply take H2 econs.</p>
              <p>But just as a fore-warning, each school have different combinations, and some combinations cannot be found in certain JCs. The only exception is of course YJC, where you can take all sorts of interesting ( and weird ) combinations.</p>

              <p>Nope, not really. But just as eagle mentioned, you can't tackle Maths with Brute Force - you need to be flexible and be able to manipulate algebraic equations.</p>
              <p>That can be done with lots of practice and experience though, so you need not worry too much about it. Anyway, why don't you try other JC besides JJC? YJC is a good place if you think you need lots of help from the lecturors and teachers, the tutors there are sort of like the polar opposite of those at RJC ( No Offence, eagle ). You will also be able to get a more flexible combination there, if you think you will want another set of combination.</p>

              <p>I hv a student from YJC, and I have to agree the practices given to
              them for maths are a lot! It's much better than most JCs which I have
              seen so far, including RJC.</p>
              <p>Not only that, I find JJC's physics notes better than other JCs (including RJC) as well :D</p>

              <p>If your Maths is weak, the only thing you have to avoid is going to those "Top" JCs, as the lecturors and tutors there are mostly unwilling to help out students who keep pestering them with questions. Their most famous quote is, "Why don't you go think about it yourself?"</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter where else you go, I recommended YJC because I truly find the teachers there to be truly caring for their students, and are often willing to stay till very late hours like 8pm+ ( which is VERY rare, even in many sec schools )</p>
              <p>This is in stark contrast with most other JCs where they expect you to do as much as possible by yourself, regardless of your individual standard. The downside to YJC is that you will not find it extremely competitive, especially if you are a A1 student. This is due to the fact that the students have a L1R5 ranging anywhere from 6 to 20, so you find all standards of students there.</p>
              <p>Instead of worrying about the JC to choose because of Maths, maybe you will like to get a private tutor instead. There is an 'instant' one here on this forum already - eagle. Just ask him nicely and he will help you ( but not for free XD ).</p>

              <p>Hello ! I actually consulted my teacher on this topic today,
              some of his main points was that  Note:'' My choice would be

              <p>he says, jjc can accept u, but perhaps ur maths need to be A
              standard in O levels , as JCs maths , the schools expect alot, in
              other words, Chiong. therefore, i can try, but...and that for JJC ,
              one has only 2 months for a bridging course for those w/o a math,
              and that one has to take a test at the 3rd month, and he says it
              very rush/ diff.</p>
              <p>Side note: can any JJC pupils/ related ppl shine some light on
              this? is this what the JJC bridging program is like ? ?</p>
              <p>Erm, do i have to die die take H2 maths if i were to study sci
              stream? because now my sci standard easily get A ( nt sure if that
              can be compared to jc sci )</p>

              <p>JJC's bridging program is a weekly lesson on saturday taught by ex-JJCians. Besides that, JJC also has a complusary self-revision program held weekly for the weaker students. The latter program is being supervised by teachers. Each of the programs last around 2hrs.</p>
              <p>H2 Maths is a complusary subject for majority of the science combinations. Its quite rare to find a science combination offering H1 maths. However, I heard that YJC allow its students to "custom make" their subject combi.</p>

              <p>Of course possible. Its just confusing.</p>
              <p>Refering to your previous question, if your maths is weak, try going to JCs which have a cut-off point of 10 and above. Those JCs are generally slower at their teaching pace. You would be able to benefit more from it.</p>
              <p>Besides, stop worrying about this first. Concentrate on your O-levels and secure your marks first. You can work on your maths during the break after your Os.</p>
