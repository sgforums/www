              <p>Hi ! . yes i have read about YJC custom make sub combi. but the
              reprecussions is that if i were to take H1 maths, i would lose out/
              not good at certain concepts of my h2 science, as im sure only
              certain concepts taught in phy/chem is only in h2 maths : D. so i
              was thinking if it is possible to pia h2 maths w/o foundation in
              sci because i really really like phy / chem.....</p>

              <p>For H2 maths, there's a lot of algebraic manipulations.</p>
              <p>For H2 physics, there's also quite a bit of algebraic manipulations in chapters like gravitation or work energy power, or electromagnetism, etc etc</p>
              <p>So at least between maths and physics, there's a lot of links.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Concentrate on your Os and aim to score A1 for your E maths first. If you need help for H2 maths after that, you could probably look for a good tutor in the west to guide you through some basics during the jan-feb period. You will need to focus especially on calculus, because it is taught in A maths and carried on further in H2 Maths. The main difference in H2 maths is that you have to be very flexible and versatile in answering questions, something which is not as prominent in A maths.</p>
              <p>Or if you want, you can look for Mr Wee (although it is all the way at Hougang, which might be too far for you) for his H2 maths introduction headstart lessons before jc classes begin, in which he teaches and guides students in the basics and concepts and relations between O levels maths and H2 maths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, you have to work damn damn damn hard. But at the end of the journey, you will look back and not regret the sacrifices you have put in. This is from personal experience, someone who has looked back early and regretted a little, then pushed on forward to achieve more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>If your Maths is weak, the only thing you have to avoid is going
              to those "Top" JCs, as the lecturors and tutors there are mostly
              unwilling to help out students who keep pestering them with
              questions. Their most famous quote is, "Why don't you go think
              about it yourself?"</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter where else you go, I recommended YJC because<strong> I
              truly find the teachers there to be truly caring for their
              students, and are often willing to stay till very late hours like
              8pm+ ( which is VERY rare, even in many sec schools )</strong></p>
              <p>This is in stark contrast with most other JCs where they expect
              you to do as much as possible by yourself, regardless of your
              individual standard. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The downside to YJC is that you will not find
              it extremely competitive, especially if you are a A1 student.</span> This
              is due to the fact that the students have a L1R5 ranging anywhere
              from 6 to 20, so you find all standards of students there.</p>
              <p>Instead of worrying about the JC to choose because of Maths,
              maybe you will like to get a private tutor instead. There is an
              'instant' one here on this forum already - eagle. Just ask him
              nicely and he will help you ( but not for free XD ).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I was from YJC! And yes, the part in bold is extremely true. It's just a pity that I didn't utilize them much.</p>
              <p>The part in red, not entirely true. Depends on which classes you go to, but generally speaking my class is quite competition free.. but Most of us still did pretty decently.</p>
              <p>Regarding H1 or H2 maths, H1 maths isn't really much easier then H2. It's just like H2, but they cover lesser.</p>
              <p>I didn't have a very strong Maths background either, I have failed every test in amaths before taking my O's, and scoring B3 for my A maths in my O levels. I choose to take up H2 maths and I failed all the way since the start of J1, passing only 1 class test and my promos, before failing all the way again, including my prelims. I got 20++ for my prelims overall. [Prelims was disasterous, I only passed Econs!]</p>
              <p>Whacked hard and still did decently for A's. Then again if you can't handle stress.. JC is not really a viable option.. I have friends who can't take the stress, quit school and went to poly, some repeated year 1, some repeated year 2, some repeated year 2 and still didn't do decently, some opted for private studies..</p>
              <p>Regarding this..</p>
              <p>"i were to take H1 maths, i would lose out/
                                      not good at certain concepts of my h2 science, as im sure only
                                      certain concepts taught in phy/chem is only in h2 maths : D"</p>
              <p>I took h2 physics h1 chem and h2 maths.. hardly anything you learn in h2 maths will be used in either of them, the worst i've encountered so far its just like quadratic equations. Then again maybe its just my school or just me. Some one I know off didn't take maths and still took h1 chem.. the only part she struggled was the calculations for chem because she didn't have a calculator lol.</p>

              <p>It is still alright. With 12 points JJC and YJC will take you in. It is not like you are aiming for RJC or ACJC.</p>
              <p>Most important things for you now is to just maintain at least a pass for humanities and keep your E. maths constant at A1. Of course, your other core subjects should also score as high as possible.</p>

              <p>Rather than just wishing you good luck, I will remind you here to get a good chinese dictionary for your composition.</p>
              <p>If you are getting A2 or B3 for E. Maths, it is time you work harder on it. As I told you before, you would not want to take the poly route to enter NIE;NTU, as it is considerably tougher. You would not want to be drag down all because of Maths, would you?</p>
