              <p>You might want to take BA(Ed) instead of Bsc(Ed) in this case.</p>
              <p>Actually BA(Ed) is not as bad as you think it is.</p>

              <p>I have friends who choose to do a chemistry degree in NTU followed by a Post grad dip in education (PGDE) with NIE so that they have a proper degree and still can teach. This is better than a direct BSc(Edu) or BA(Edu) since that only allows you to go into teaching but a BSc (Chemistry) allows you to work in chemical industries in future if you feel teaching is not for you.</p>
              <p>I have a number of classmates who are MOE scholarship holders who are doing a chemistry degree and taking the PGDE after they finish the degree so its also an option rather than direct NIE.</p>
              <p>There is still some maths even in a chemistry degree course though its alot less than those in engineering etc i would say. NTU chem degree still requires you to clear 2 calculus modules in year 1.</p>

              <p>I don't really promote YJC, but it is really different from other JCs I have seen thus far.</p>
              <p>For Yihao's case, I recommended him to go there because this is the only JC where you can mix and match and combinations you want, something which is not available even in MI.</p>
              <p>And did I mention it is also the ONLY JC which allows you to pick up a subject which you did not take in Sec school provided you got the attitude and aptitude to work hard?</p>
              <p>Hence, this is really an ideal JC for those who wants to have "weird" combinations, including maths-less combinations.</p>
