              <p>JC u can apply NIE i believe but they may require you to take a degree course 1st and later go back to do a post grad dip in education to become a teacher.

              <p>Requirements academic wise i think is not too high. More important is your passion etc for it and you will have to go through interviews etc. Most people i know fails the interview and not get rejected due to their academic results.</p>

              <p>The foundation programme is the dip/degree programme for NIE. If i didn't remember wrongly, the 4 yrs course is 2 yrs dip, 2 yrs degree.</p>
              <p>MOE has mentioned that they want all their teachers to be degree holders by 2015. Due to this, i am unsure whether they consider the BSc Education as that degree since i assume all teachers have to go through it or does it mean you need an external degree.</p>
              <p>The current system as the website does say is that any A's/poly dip holder can go apply for a teaching position if they want so you should still be able to apply</p>

              <p>  I have taught trainees who have just graduated from A-levels, so you may wish to apply if you are keen. It will be good for you to send an email to NIE if you are unclear about certain details.</p>

              <p>H1 Math is somewhat like EMath. Questions are on statistics, gives you situations and you work out your answers. If you're generally a B3 above scorer for Emath you should be fine in H1 Math.However do remember, it's the mindset that really matters. Secondary schools grades are not accurate in determining your performance in JCs.</p>
              <p>As for your other three required subjects, you can take all arts or all science subjects or combine.</p>
              <p>If you want to be a teacher, there is a MOE Teaching Degree in the Bachelor of Arts or Science (Education) program and it is sort of like a MOE scholarship. Basic requiremens are 2H2 &amp; 2H1 passes. But the thing is, if i'm not wrong, i read from a brochure or the moe website that by taking this path, you can only teach up to Secondary school. To teach in a JC you must have a specialised degree. If you cannot get this, you can still enter straight and they'll send you to NIE for training. But the salary difference is very big. the brochure shows that  pass degree has starting of around $2400 while just a A lvl or Poly graduate will be about $1500. This is quoted from their promotional brochure, im not revealing exact salaries.</p>

              <p>H1 maths or A maths is rather different from E maths, although the basics is the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a student who didn't take A maths, but went to MI so as to take H2 maths because JCs don't allow him to do so. He's doing very well because he's hardworking and willing to learn, and I expect an A from him in next year's A levels.</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter if you get a B3 or B4 for E.Maths, all that it means is that you will have to work harder than others for your H1 Maths.</p>
              <p>As for becoming a teacher,here are the basic requirements. You can scroll all the way down and take a look at it.</p>
              <p>http://www.nie.edu.sg/nieweb/programmes/loading.do?id=Foundation&amp;cid=13467650&amp;ppid=27164675</p>
              <p>In short, the absolute minimum is four Cs, nothing less. Of course there are people who manage to get in even with a couple of Ds, but remember, they usually have quite a bit of teaching experience or transcripts to back them up, and they made up only 10% of the cohort.</p>
              <p>You probably wouldn't want to 'fight' with them as part of the 10% of the cohort, odds are you will lose out to them due to lack of experience, even if your results are slightly better than theirs.</p>
              <p>As for whether you can enter NIE through JC/Poly, the answer is YES. There is currently a three year diploma programme for those out of Sec School and a four year degree programme for those out of JC/Poly. What the government mean is that the three year diploma programme will be scraped soon, but the four year degree programme will still go on as normal. </p>
              <p>As for the 1 year PGDE programme, it is a diploma for those with other degrees from other universities, and they just need to take this 1 year programme to straight away become a teacher. They can only take up Primary school students though, if I am not wrong. </p>
              <p>The degree is a four years programme, two years in NIE, and the next two years in NTU. You will be paid during your 1st two years in NIE, and the next two years you will have to survive on your own. If you do VERY well in your 1st two years, they will give you a 'reward' of SG$5k for the 3rd year in NTU, and the same for the 4th year if you also do well in your 3rd year.</p>
              <p>As for the pay, 'A' level holders start out at $SG1.45k, which will be increase if you serve NS and/or get distinctions for GP and Chinese. Diploma holders have a higher start out of $SG1.9k, whereas degree holders who somehow opt to jump in for this degree will have a startout of SG$2.3k for non-related degrees, SG$2.6k for related degrees.</p>
              <p>An important thing to note is that you will have to serve a 4 years bond upon completion of the degree, and if you break the bond anytime....good luck to you.</p>

              Ds, but remember, they usually have <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">quite a bit of teaching
              experience or transcripts</span></span> to back them up, and they made up only
              10% of the cohort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for whether you can enter NIE through JC/Poly, the answer is
              YES. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">There is currently a three year diploma programme for those
              out of Sec School and a four year degree programme for those out of
              JC/Poly.</span> </span>What the government mean is that the three year diploma
              programme will be scraped soon, but the four year degree programme
              will still go on as normal. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As for the pay, 'A' level holders start out at $SG1.45k, which
              will be increase if you serve NS and/or get distinctions for GP and
              Chinese. Diploma holders have a higher start out of $SG1.9k,
              whereas degree holders who somehow opt to jump in for this degree
              will have a startout of SG$2.3k for non-related degrees, SG$2.6k

              <p>As far as I know, last year MOE came up with a revamped direction they wished to pursue in the future namely, they will be requiring all or most new (?) teachers to have at least a degree to teach even for primary school level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only in certain subjects like arts and music will they take in diploma and below. (they might require graduates also for these subjects in the future, who knows?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But majority of teachers will likely have a degree and above in the future.</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter what course you take in poly, the previous link I gave you also included the GPA required, and trust me, a JC route will be easier to enter NIE.</p>
              <p>The 3 years Diploma programme is like taking up a diploma in a poly, just that you will be taking one up in NIE. It is the course that is going to disappear soon, due to the revamp in the system which only allows Uni graduates to teach students. If you get really outstanding results, I heard you could jump straight away to Bsc after you finish this diploma, but considering that the former bonds you for 3 years, and the latter 4 years, you will be bonded for a total of 7 years.</p>
              <p>The one highlighted in blue is not really a pay, it is more like an allowance for the period of time you study in NIE. In case you are interested, those who take up the diploma from Sec school will be given an 'allowance' of SG$800+ per month.</p>
              <p>And yes, by "A-level" cert holder, I mean that you enter Bsc or BA with an "A-level" cert, and so on. There are people who enter Bsc/BA even though they have another degree for other courses ( e.g. Bachelor degree in Business ), as the PGDE only allows you to take Pri School students.</p>
              <p>A transcript is something like a testimonial, like you teach at a tuition center and the "boss" there talks about how excellent or outstanding your performance is.</p>
              <p>Rather than just talking about the ways to fail in NIE, I will tell you about the ways in which you could get expelled, such as:</p>
              <p>1) Getting a criminal record, fighting, drug abuse, so on.</p>
              <p>2) Having attitude problems in the institute, such as challenging the Deans, lecturors, causing problems for the others.</p>
              <p>3) Being bankrupt or having other financial problems which resulted from gambling/ stock-marketing.</p>
              <p>4) Getting a GPA of less than 2.0 out of 5.0 for a few times in a row. The first time you would be on academic warning, 2nd time on academic probation, and from the 3rd time on you could be expelled at anytime.</p>
              <p>5) Attending insufficient lessons, I can't remember how at least many days out of how many days you need to attend lessons already.</p>

              <p>A lot of people like you are being misguided, when they mean degree holders, they do not mean you will have to get a degree outside of NIE before you are allowed in NIE. For "A-level" cert holders and Diploma holders, they will just have to take up the Bsc or BA and finish it. These 2 are considered degrees in case you don't know about it, they are sort of like a combined degree between NIE and NTU.</p>

              that i have to take H1 maths, but if my emath roughly a B standard,
              what are my chances at h1 maths...?</p>

              <p>Actually you don't have to worry much.</p>
              <p>In my school, there are quite a number of people who took H2 maths without A.Maths background. By the way, JCs do provide additional A.Maths lesson for those who are new to it. So, as long as you work hard, you should be able to handle H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>However, if you're still worried on your ability to cope, i recommand that you apply for the arts stream, which offer H1 maths, instead of the science stream as H2 maths is a complusary subject there.</p>
