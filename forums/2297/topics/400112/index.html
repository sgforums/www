              <p>My two cents...</p>
              <p>I feel that pure subjects are better. you need the foundations for both pure and combine anyway. And you need to know them well to score.</p>
              <p>1 pure bio + 1 pure chemistry = 2 o level result.. if one is A1, another one is C6 = use A1 for L1R5.</p>
              <p>combine bio + chemistry = 1 o level. If one A1, one C6 = B3/ B4?</p>
              <p>JC is much harder.. O level science is like a foundation for JC..</p>

              <p>Yup from my experience JCs would pick students with pure science over those with combi science.</p>
              <p>But if you cannot cope with the workload and stress of handling the 2 pure sciences, then it'll be better to drop to combined science. This would help you score better in your O levels and not pull your L1R5 down.</p>
              <p>Choose wisely.</p>
              <p>PS: As long as you do well in JC (or even poly) this should not have too much of an effect on your uni admission etc etc.</p>

              <p>I recommend you keep your Pure Chemistry and Pure Physics. It is true that it is much harder to score an A1 for pure science, compared to combined science, due not so much to the difficulty level difference, but rather the steeper bell-curve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, it is still wiser to keep your Pure Chemistry and Pure Physics, if you intend to take Science in the JC, and subsequently Science in the University.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you screw up your combined science and get an A2 or B3 instead of A1, most JCs won't allow you to take H2 Chem and H2 Physics, which means you can't take Science in the University at all. (H1 Science is utterly useless as far as University is concerned).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you feel you must drop one of the Pure Sciences totally (instead of downgrading to combined science), be very careful which science you drop. Chemistry and Physics are about equally important to have as a background, depending on what you're interested to study in the University.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With H2 Chemistry and H2 Physics, you can take 90% of all Science courses in the University.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With H2 Chemistry but no H2 Physics, you can take only 45% of all Science courses in the University.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With H2 Physics but no H2 Chemistry, you can take only 45% of all Science courses in the University.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, H2 Mathematics is an absolute must as well, which means be sure you take your Additional Maths at 'O' levels too. </p>

              <p>it is like doing a triathlon. You swim, cycle, and run. But you realized that you sucks at cycling because you simply cannot balance well on the bike. So why not do a biathlon instead, at least you may be able to achieve top 10, instead of last 10 in triathlon. </p>
              <p>if you cannot not cope with the current subjects, just reduce the load, you will be less stressful. After all, you are supposed to enjoy your childhood and not get vexed. </p>
              <p>And of course you can always work hard now instead of playing around. There are "no stupid people only lazy people."</p>

              <p>Hey, never ever give up on yourself :) It is really about your studying methods and the amount of efforts you are willing to put in plus it is just SA1 which is insufficient to prove that you are not the cut for pure sciences.</p>
              <p>Never ever doubt yourself! Keep trying :D. </p>
              <p>Tell you something funny, i got D7 for my combined phy/chem and a B3 for my biology during prelims. During the actual O level, i got A1 for phy/chem and C6 for bio. LOL! :X . So things are really hard to say you know! You never know how far you can go unless you try :)</p>
              <p>and I supposed you need pure sciences to have a better understanding of the subjects when you take them for A level. And are you really sure that you want to study business? If you are not 100% confirmed about it, i think it is better to take pure sciences cos most of the engineering courses in uni requires H2 Phy (which probably requires you to take pure physics in order to be eligible for it).</p>
              <p>The decision lies in your hands lah :) Jiayou :)</p>

              <p>Well, I have recently graduated from JC so let me try to answer some of your doubts. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a couple of friends who steer cleared of sciences after graduating from sec school because they thought that they wanted to do business. However, after getting back their results, they realised that they had very few options and could only choose from very little courses because they do not meet the prerequisites of some courses. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would personally recommend, if you really have to drop one of the sciences, drop physics. Because you can always do bridging for physics for engineering courses but not bridging for chemistry (correct me if I am wrong). Also, if you do happen to be interested in medicine (you never know- I changed my interest more than 3 times a year), Chemistry is a must. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, because I never quite knew where exactly my interest lies, I chose a subject combination which will allow me to choose almost all the uni courses available in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel that it is really up to you whether you want to drop to combined sci or not. If you think that if you work doubly hard from now on and you will be able to pull up your grades, then don't drop. I actually feel that o level science has got nothing much to do with a level science- everything looked so new to me and it felt as if my foundation/o level science knowledge had got nothing to do with a level science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best!</p>
