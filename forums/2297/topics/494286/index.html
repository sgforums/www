              <p>Anyone has any information regarding this degree course in NUS?Have a certain degree of interest in probably uptaking this course so am somewhat curious to know more as there is little detail of this other than the NUS website.</p>
              <p>I only heard rumours like high dropout rates....crazy bell curve on a cohort of 50....insanely difficult(i can manage it)...etc</p>

              <p>Had a friend from this programme. It's basically a master's programme coated in an undergraduate degree. If you search online,computational biology is so specialised that it is often considered as a master's degree programme.</p>
              <p>You have to start the academic year,overloading modules(6-7) instead of the regular one.(5) And you are also meant to be a jack-of-all-trades,learn programming,biology,maths,etc. It is definitely not so simple as it sounds. And yep,the high dropout rates sucks big time. If I am not wrong,NUS chemistry is also pretty harsh on it's curriculum.(got to do organic/physical/inorganic) The thing is that,most people tend to be either more qualitative(organic/inorganic) or quantitative.(physical) At the end of first yr,about 100+ students switched major from chemistry to bio or physics,some switch to other fields from an initial cohort of around 250++. </p>
              <p>That is not to say that,computational biology has an even tougher curriculum. I am mainly speculating that the high drop out rates has a lot to do with getting what one bargains for rather than the intensive rigour. Think about this,if you could get better GPA in bio(closest to comp. bio major) vs better degree scope(comp. bio is better than bio),most will pick the former because at the end of the day,the performance in one's degree programme stands out more. In order words,it's a red flag if you can't perform exceptionally well in your degree.</p>
              <p>And the lack of detail on the website is killer. Many signed up for something they are not prepared for and end up regretting it. Better to err on the safe side of things and don't bite off more than you can chew.</p>

              <p>Haha i just feel interested to try out something difficult to challenge myself.</p>
              <p>From what you said about NUS chemistry,those main branches of chemistry mentioned are areas of chemistry that I'm relatively strong in and like a lot so i might consider NUS chemistry instead if i choose not to take comp. bio,doubt i will go for bio even though i like bio as a generic degree as prospects for life science graduates in Singapore seems to be dimming over the years.</p>
              <p>Also consindering Computing(Information Systems) in NUS,given my Mid Year and Common Test Rank Points this year and comparing it to 2016 UAS(81.25),I'm well within the range so might consider that instead.</p>

              <p>I read the rumour post on Reddit,and the HOD for comp. bio actually responded through Reddit with all the details about it,such as having excellent career prospects,admitting the course is very difficult and they are trying their best to modify it every year to make it less difficult and etc.He also posted all his credentials and contacts also,which are in line with the NUS website and contactable,so should be legit.</p>
