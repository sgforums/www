              <p>Hi anpanman,</p>
              <p>For the first question, you can take ( 1 + x + x^2 )^10 to be ( 1 + ( x + x^2 ) )^10, which you can expand out to get</p>
              <p>1 + 10C1( x + x^2 ) + 10C2( x + x^2 )^2 + 10C3( x + x^2 )^3 +...</p>
              <p>which is simplified to 1 + 10x + 55x^2 + 210x^3 +...</p>
              <p>Notice that if you sub x = 0.01 into ( 1 + x + x^2 )^10, you will get ( 1.0101 )^10.</p>
              <p>Hence to find ( 1.0101 )^10, you can sub x = 0.01 into 1 + 10x + 55x^2 + 210x^3, and you will get 1.10571, which should be cut down to 1.106</p>
              <p>For the second question, if you were to sub in values directly, you will not get any marks at all. I hope you will not be upset by me for saying this, but it is likely that your graph is not well drawn enough. You can sub in values on a piece of rough paper to check the accuracy of your answer and your graph though.</p>
              <p>For the third question, we can first change the equation to a form which is easier for us, which will be ( x - 2 )^2 + ( y - 4 )^2 = 17</p>
              <p>Hence, the midpoint is (2,4) and the radius is sqrt(17)</p>
              <p>Note that when any point is reflected across a vertical line, its y-coordinate will not change, whereas the vertical line will act as a midpoint for the original x-coordinate and the new x-coordinate.</p>
              <p>In this case, the new midpoint after reflection across x = -1 will be (-4,4)</p>
              <p>Hence, the new equation will be ( x + 4 )^2 + ( y - 4 )^2 = 17</p>
              <p>As for your graph questions, perhaps you will like to scan and upload your graph to share with the dear forummers of the homework forum. Please do not be offended, but I believe that something is wrong with your graph.</p>
              <p>Here are the essential steps for this particular question:</p>
              <p>1) Find the values of y / x^(0.5) and x^(0.5) using the x and y values given</p>
              <p>2) Plot the graph y/ x^(0.5) = hx^(0.5) + k using the values you have found from step 1; this should be a straight line.</p>
              <p>3) y = 5x^(0.5) is the same as y/ x^(0.5) = 5, so you will just need to infer from the line graph which you have drawn previously.</p>
              <p>4) y = -4x^(0.5) + 9x is the same as y/ x^(0.5) = 9x^(0.5) - 4, so you will just need to draw this as a straight line to find the required values via the intersection point.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br> Regarding the first graph, i mean i sub in a value before using the
              graph to determine the value of x. Is it ok to do these 2 steps? Or
              do you have any way of solving this?</p>
              <p>I will scan the graphs later on when i'm free. (gotta continue
              with my revision now) ^_^</p>

              <p>also, they never ask you look from graph or estimate, so even if u go sub in and calculate eveything out, i dun think they can fault u</p>
