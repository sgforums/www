              <p>Q1. You're correct regarding sulfur. For Mg, explain that the energectic feasibility of ionic compound formation is a balance between ionization energies and lattice energies. Mg+ wouldn't generate sufficient lattice energy. Mg3+ would require too much ionization energy. Hence, only the formation of MgF2 is energetically feasible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. Na+ H- sodium hydride is an ionic compound.</p>
              <p>The simplest and most straightforward oxygen fluoride compound would be, naturally, oxygen difluoride, or OF<sub>2</sub>, in which the valencies of O and F are 2 and 1 respectively.</p>
              <p>The only other common oxygen fluoride compound would be dioxygen difluoride, O<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>., which is even less stable than OF<sub>2</sub>.</p>
              <p>The interesting aspect is the rarity of positive oxidation states of oxygen, as seen in these compounds.</p>

              <p>Thank you UltimaOnline.</p>
              <p>I have another question.</p>
              <p>1. Nitrogen andphosphurs are elements of group V in the Periodic Table. Nitrogen exists naturally as gaseous diatomic N - - - N (supposed to be 3 lines stacked on top of each other in indicate triple bond) whereas P is a solid and exists as P4 molecules comprising P-P single bonds</p>
              <p>Suggest why P does not occur naturally as triple P-P bonds</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Explain why it is not possible for Nitrogen to form an oxoanion with formula of NO4 3- (different question)</p>

              <p>Q1. Unlike the N atom with 2 electron shells, the P atom has 3 electron shells and hence the internuclear distance between P atoms is too large for pi bonds to be formed (ie. due to the greater internuclear distance and minimum bond length (remember pi bonds are by their nature shorter than sigma bonds) between P atoms compared to N atoms, there is a decreased ease of overlap of the p orbitals of phosphorus to form pi-bonds, compared to nitrogen; hence hybridization of s and p orbitals in phosphorus allow for the formation of 3 sp3-sp3 sigma bonds instead, in the P4 molecule). Hence only sigma bonds are formed in the tetrahedral P4 molecule of the white phosphorus allotrope.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. For such a trinegative oxoanion, the N atom needs to expand its octet (ie. the N atom would have 5 bond pairs : 3 singly bonded O atoms with a -ve charge, and a doubly bonded O atom with no charge). Since N is in period 2, it means the N atom has no energetically accessible vacant orbitals to utilize to expand its octet, and hence cannot form the NO4 3- ion.</p>
