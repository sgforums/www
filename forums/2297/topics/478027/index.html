              <p>I am a student of Millennia Institute. I joined the school last year but was retained last year. This year, I am a Year 1 retainee, waiting to start studying again in mid-February (Year 1 orientation ends by 15 February this year).</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I went back to Millennia Institute for the first time, as instructed by the school, to attend the “HOPE programme” - conducted by the school for retainees, which started yesterday.</p>
              <p>During yesterday’s session, there was a segment called the “My goals &amp; Millennia Institute – is MI the place for me (exploring alternatives)” where I was given this set of booklet titled “Courses for ‘O’ level holders*/Courses in Private Institutions (Updated October 2013)” which listed a few institutions. At the back of the booklet, there is a section titled “Additional Resources for Target Setting By Student. 2011 Indicative Grade Profile (Uniscore in Descending Order)”.</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Among the Academic Courses listed in the booklet, I am attracted to this institution by the name “Management Development Institute of Singapore”.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">According to the teacher who conducted the session, she said that at that institution, students study A level for 1 year then proceed to pursue their university course at their institution, although the school fees is very much more expensive there. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">She said that considering the fact that at Millennia Institute, only around 30% of students go to local universities, I (she was speaking to the audience of retainees who were present at the segment and I was one of them) should consider applying into the “Management Development Institute of Singapore”.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">She told us to think about it (applying to other intuitions) now as soon, the next round of JAE will start and it would be the window-period for intuitions to enroll students.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>I have not gone on to explore the Management Development Institute of Singapore yet but I remember I have heard of this institution before.</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Back then, in 2012, during my O level year, my secondary school invited their ex-student to come back and give us sec 4 students a talk on tertiary education. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This ex-student introduced himself as someone who went to Junior College but failed terribly in his A level. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">He said he eventually went on to a private school and was then pursuing his university degree. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I could not remember what the name of the private school he mentioned is but I believe it is either the Management Development Institute of Singapore or a similar school.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Right now, even before I start to explore other alternatives, I already know of 2 Cons. of applying into the private schools:</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Firstly, I am a boy and I have already deferred National Service for the A level course I am currently at in Millennia Institute. If I change school (even to Polytechnic), it would mean that I have to join the army and serve NS this year, since I am 18 this year.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Secondly, I heard that private schools charge high school fees. According to the “Courses for ‘O’ level holders*/Courses in Private Institutions (Updated October 2013)” booklet that I was given, it states that the Preparatory course at Management Development Institute of Singapore is S$6200 for 5 subjects, which is 3 times more than Polytechnic school fees and around half the amount my parents spend on me in one year. With regards to the high school fees, I am thinking of going to NS and earn the monthly salaries at NS, to subside the costs.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Well, I am only after the Certification (is that not the reason why people study tertiary education?). I do not care about whether or not there is prescribed uniform, whether or not it is a college environment or a workplace environment, whether or not can have flexible study time or whether or not need to waste 1 or 2 years.</p>
              <p>I could stay on in Millennia Institute but it seems to me that there is bad academic perspective here, since only 30% of the cohort can go to local university. I am not sure if it is worthwhile to spend another 3 years at Millennia Institute, which may be extended to 4 years if I repeat again in Year 2.</p>
              <p>I have not told my parents about this yet, as I know this is a rather sensitive topic and they may not be accepting to this topic, especially since the school fees at private school is very expensive.</p>
              <p>Please advise me on how I should move on from here. Should I stay on at Millennia Institute, apply to private school or apply to Polytechnic?</p>

              <p>I graduated from Jurong Institute, which was then renamed Millennia Institute..</p>
              <p>Getting a degree is the goal of many young learners, or their parents'.</p>
              <p>Having been through life for quite awhile, there are things that you find yourself happier/better doing. Unless you are absolutely sure a 3 years' A-Level course is paramount to achieve something that you are passionate about, skill-based certifications from Polytechnics and/or ITEs can be equally good preparing one for the challenges ahead.</p>
              <p>O-Level is the most important certificate as it opens doors to further your academic pursue later on, if you so wish.</p>
              <p>Move in the direction where your strength lies, it is easier to excel on that ground. And if you like to be double-sure, doing a few career profiling tests may enlighten you further.</p>
              <p>All the best ^^o</p>
