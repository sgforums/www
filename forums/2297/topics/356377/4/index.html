              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  If you are asked to find the foot of perpendicular from a point to the line or plane (topic: vectors), do you have the intuitive feeling that you may be asked next about</p>
              <p>  1. shortest distance,</p>
              <p>  2. image of a point?</p>
              <p>  If you are asked to show a certain probability (section: statistics), do you think it will be applied in another part of the same question?</p>
              <p>  If a question suggests that you consider a certain approach, say, x_{n + 1} - x_n (topic: recurrences), do you have any idea what it should lead you to, say, increasing or decreasing sequence?</p>
              <p>  It is, therefore, important that one has an inkling of what concepts and ideas exam questions could possibly assess. This knowledge can only come about after one's reflection upon tons of past questions that he/she has solved.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  I am leaving this forum for good. It would be useful to have the notes on Maths, that I have written in the past, kept for future students' reference.</p>
              <p>  I also welcome other Maths educators to keep the Maths content alive with new articles.</p>
              <p>  Thanks and take good care.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  A common application of a binomial expansion is approximation.</p>
              <p>  Consider the expansion of sqrt(1 + 3x) in ascending powers of x up to x^3, i.e.,</p>
              <p>  1 + (3/2)x - (9/8)x^2 + (27/16)x^3.</p>
              <p>  By a suitable value of x (where |x| &lt; 1/3), one can find an estimate of the square root of some number:</p>
              <p>  x = 1/6, 3/sqrt(6) = 157/128 =&gt; sqrt(6) = 384/157 approximately.</p>
              <p>  It is often difficult for us to arrive at a suitable value of x to obtain the square root of some value one is looking for. The use of an abitrary value for x may be a practical approach to solve this difficulty.</p>
              <p>  Since |x| &lt; 1/3, we consider a substitution for x having the form 1/a, where a is some positive integer and a &gt; 3.</p>
              <p>  When x = 1/a, sqrt(1 + 3x) becomes sqrt(a + 3) / sqrt(a).</p>
              <p>  Consider two cases.</p>
              <p>  For case 1, we have the value a taking some perfect square while the value of sqrt(a + 3) is to be estimated:</p>
              <p>  a = 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, ...</p>
              <p>  and correspondingly,</p>
              <p>  sqrt(a + 3) / sqrt(a) = sqrt(7)/2, sqrt(12)/3, sqrt(19)/4, sqrt(28)/5, sqrt(39)/6, ...,</p>
              <p>  from which the estimates sqrt(7), sqrt(19), sqrt(28), sqrt(39), ... can be obtained using the expansion.</p>
              <p>  For case 2, we have the value (a + 3) taking some perfect square while the value of sqrt(a) is to be estimated:</p>
              <p>  a + 3 = 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, ...</p>
              <p>  and correspondingly,</p>
              <p>  sqrt(a + 3) / sqrt(a) = 3/sqrt(6), 4/sqrt(13), 5/sqrt(22), 6/sqrt(33), 7/sqrt(46), ...,</p>
              <p>  from which the estimates sqrt(6), sqrt(13), sqrt(22), sqrt(33), sqrt(46), ... can be obatined using the expansion.</p>
              <p>  With this simple investigation, it becomes easy for us to come up systematically with suitable substitution values in future when we wish to estimate some given values.</p>
              <p>  Is there another substitution for x that will allow one to find sqrt(6)? Yes, let x = -1/9. I would encourage the interested student to continue with further research into x taking a substitution of the form -1/a, using the same approach we have discussed above.</p>
              <p>  Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  How could one find sqrt(15) using a suitable value of x? One may explore the possibility of letting x = a/b, where a and b are positive integers and a/b &lt; 1/3. It is not difficult, using the same type of investigative work mentioned previously, to arrive at x = 2/9 to obtain an estimate of sqrt(15). Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Students are often confused with various quantities for sampling and hypothesis testing. They include:</p>
              <p>  1. μ: refers to the population mean;</p>
              <p>  2. σ^2: refers to the population variance;</p>
              <p>  3. x-bar: refers to the sample mean, it is also the unbiased estimate of population mean;</p>
              <p>  4. s^2: refers to the unbiased estimate of population variance, it is sometimes found via the relationship s^2 = { n / (n - 1) } x sample variance;</p>
              <p>  5. sample variance: self-explanatory, it is sometimes used to find s^2.</p>
              <p>  Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>Dear students,</p>
              <p>  School exam questions are typically set based on past Cambridge question trends. I will quote specific examples from the most recent YJC Prelim 2011 paper 1:</p>
              <p>  Q1 Behaviour of a recurrence relation<br>  This question has been set in the same flavour as N07/P1/Q9.</p>
              <p>  Q4 Method of differences<br>  The use of partial fractions has appeared in N09/P1/Q3 and N10/P2/Q2(ii).</p>
              <p>  Q6(a) Sequence of transformations<br>  This question is similar to N07/P1/Q5.</p>
              <p>  Q8(b) Tangent to a curve defined implicitly<br>  This question assesses the same concepts and skills as N98/P1/Q16.</p>
              <p>  Q10 Vector involving planes<br>  Part (ii) resembles N08/P1/Q11(ii). Finding the image of a point in the plane in (iii) has been asked in N10/P1/Q10(iii).</p>
              <p>  It is important that you know the Cambridge type of questions as you prepare to sit for your school exams. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Here is a detailed analysis of another prelim paper 1 from ACJC:</p>
              <p>  - The last part of Q5 looks like N08/P2/Q1(iv).<br><br>  - Q6 (nth roots and factorisation) is similar to N07/P1/Q7.<br><br>  - Q9 about a self-inverse function f bears some resemblance to N09/P2/Q3.<br><br>  - Q11 (formulation of DE via Newton's cooling model) has been set,
               since N10/P1/Q7 appeared last year.<br><br>  - Q12(ii) about the graph of y = f ' (x) has been set, since N10/P2/Q3(iii) appeared last year.<br><br>  - Q13(b) about compound interest looks like N08/P1/Q10.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It is not easy, in my view, to use the Casio GC to investigate the behaviour of a sequence as there is a need to go to different screens to enter the expression and to set the table parameters. I have written a set of clear, simple steps to help students overcome this difficulty:</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Consider the problem of finding the line of intersection between two planes.</p>
              <p>  Two common methods are:</p>
              <p>  1. Use a GC.</p>
              <p>  2. Find a point by substituting a convenient value for one variable. Then consider the vector product of the normals of the two planes.</p>
              <p>  It is possible for one to apply another approach, without the need to use a GC and to carry out a vector product. We will look at this example:</p>
              <p>  Find the line of intersection between the planes whose equations are</p>
              <p>  x - 5y + 3z = 1 and -x + y + 2z = 11.</p>
              <p>  Let z = 0, we get the equations</p>
              <p>  x - 5y = 1 and -x + y = 11.</p>
              <p>  Adding the equations, we obtain y = -3 and x = -14, giving us a point (-14, -3, 0).</p>
              <p>  Let y = 0, we have the equations</p>
              <p>  x + 3z = 1 and -x + 2z = 11.</p>
              <p>  Adding the equations, we obtain z = 12/5 and x = -31/5, giving us another point (39/5, 3, 12/5).</p>
              <p>  With these two points, we are able to obtain the equation of the line containing them.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p><span>  Usually, when we are given the graph of y = f(x) and asked to 
                  sketch the graph of y = f(-|x|), we would have the following 
                  transformations:<br><br>  1. Reflection about the y-axis (or we could see it as x = 0).<br>  2. Keep the graph for x &gt;= 0 and then carry out reflection about the y-axis.<br><br>  Suppose we are given the graph of y = f(2x - 1) and asked to 
                  sketch the graph of y = f(-|2x -1|), which NYJC set in its prelim exam this year. The sequence of transformations 
                  would then be:<br><br>  1. Reflection about
                   the line 2x - 1 = 0 or x = 1/2.<br>  2. Keep the graph for 2x - 1 &gt;= 0 or x &gt;= 1/2 and then carry out reflection about the line x = 1/2.</span></p>
              <p>  Now it is not difficult to sketch the graph of y = f(-|ax + b|) from the graph of y = f(ax + b).</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Dear students,</p>
              <p>  Do pay attention to these comments from the examiners, so that you do not risk losing precious points unwittingly:</p>
              <p>1. Candidates lacked precision in their solutions.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Read the question carefully to understand its requirement on the answer.<br><br>2. Some of the algebraic manipulation was poor.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Strengthen this skill, perhaps by recalling knowledge from secondary algebra, say, factorisation, results like x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y), etc.<br><br>3. Evidence of an over-reliance on the use of graphic calculators.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> GC is a checking tool. One must still know, say, properties of basic curves.</p>
              <p>4. Full and precise working is needed in questions in which an answer to be proven is given.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Show all details of working in any case.<br><br>5. Some time was wasted by not using the clue in the question.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Always identify, at the start, what information is given in the question and how it could be used.<br><br>6. Majority of candidates did not understand the notation.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Always fall back on what you already know or have seen before.<br><br>7. A lack of appreciation as to the relevance of earlier parts of the question.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Remember that a question with parts (i), (ii), (iii), etc. may be related.<br><br>8. Candidates lost track of what they were doing.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> See advice 1 and stay mentally alert during the examination.<br><br>9. Candidates quoted and used wrong formulas.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Check your working and ask whether your answers make sense.<br><br>10. Difficulty arriving at the correct variance.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Recall that Var(aX) = a^2 Var(X) and Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y).<br><br>11. Main error being to ignore the continuity correction, or to use the wrong value.</p>
              <p><strong>Personal advice:</strong> Recall that continuity correction is necessary when B(n, p) and Po(lambda) becomes normal in the approximation process. As for the value, consider the method of rounding up or rounding down, e.g., P(X &lt; 7) = P(X &lt;= 6) which becomes P(X &lt; 6.5) via correction as a result of rounding any value less than 6.5 down to 6.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Questions with no guidance may be asked in which students are expected to be familiar with the problem-solving approach.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 1:</strong> N2010/P1/Q9(i)</p>
              <p>  In this minimisation problem, a student has to form a condition connecting relevant variables, set up the expression of the external surface area and apply differentiation to determine the stationary value and its nature.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 2:</strong> N2010/P2/Q2(ii)(a)</p>
              <p>  In this method of differences problem, a student has to consider the use of partial fractions to obtain a difference of two similar expressions before systematic cancellation of terms can be made possible.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Comments to specific questions in paper 1 assessed today.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Q1</strong> Students should notice that the numerator is always positive. This could be checked by completing the square.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Q6(ii) </strong>Looking at <strong>(i)</strong>, students should realise that it is a question on method of differences.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Q7(i)</strong> Students will handle vector algebra for this question, this is a type of question from the distant past.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Q9(ii)</strong> Students should realise that the theoretical maximum refers to the sum to infinity in the context of the question.</p>
              <p>  It seems that the examiners are really out to test students' level of <em>mathematical maturity</em> and <em>sensitivity to given information</em>. The flavour of the paper seems to be the same as that of N2010. Here are two examples.</p>
              <p>  In N2010, the question on the method of differences did not prompt students to find partial fractions. In 2011, the question did not mention about the method of differences.</p>
              <p>  In 2010, the question on vectors involving p referred to length and there was a part on the dot product result. In 2011, the question involving p referred to a unit vector and there was a part on the vector product to find the area.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

                          further in this posting.</p>
              <p>  Specific skills to increase one's level of mathematical maturity:</p>
              <p>  1. show an appreciation of the motivation behind or (better still) derive basic mathematical results;</p>
              <p>  2. show an appreciation of the interconnections between mathematical topics;</p>
              <p> 
                           3. show an appreciation of the interconnectedness between algebraic, 
                          graphical and geometrical approaches to mathematical problem-solving;</p>
              <p>  4. possess the ability to work with both concrete (numerical-based problems) and abstract (problems with arbitrary constants or variables) mathematics;</p>
              <p>  5. possess a broad knowledge of mathematical problem-solving strategies
                           (acquired from the primary level up through to college level) and have a
                           good intuition of applying them;</p>
              <p>  6. show an appreciation of the application of mathematical theories in real-life contexts;</p>
              <p>  7. possess the ability to evaluate correctness of mathematical solutions.</p>
              <p>  Specific skills to increase one's sensitivity to given information:</p>
              <p>  1. possess a good understanding of mathematical definitions and terms;</p>
              <p> 
                           2. possess the ability to translate information into mathematical 
                          expressions, conditions, equations which will then facilitate 
                          mathematical problem-solving;</p>
              <p>  3. show an appreciation of the rationale behind these given information.</p>

Find the probability that the cubes at each end are the same colour.<br><br>  This probability is<br><br>  the number of ways of arranging the cubes such that the cubes at the ends have the same colour<br><br>  divided by<br><br>  the number of ways of arranging the cubes without any restriction.<br><br>  It is easy to begin by finding the denominator, that is,<br><br>  13! / (3! 4! 6!) = 60060,<br><br>  since we have 13 items of which 3 are identically red, 4 are identically blue and 6 are identically yellow.<br><br>  To find the numerator, we first list 3 possibilities:<br><br>  1) Red cubes at the ends<br>  Number of ways = 11! / (1! 4! 6!) = 2310, <br><br>  since we fix 2 red cubes at the ends and have the remaining 11 items to arrange, with 4 items that are identically blue and 6 items that are identically yellow.<br><br>  2) Blue cubes at the ends<br>  Number of ways = 11! / (3! 2! 6!) = 4620,<br><br>  by a similar reasoning as above.<br><br>  3) Yellow cubes at the ends<br>  Number of ways = 11! / (3! 4! 4!) = 11550.<br><br>  The numerator is the sum of the ways (i.e., 18480), by the addition principle.<br><br>  The final answer can then be arrived at (i.e., 4/13).</p>
              <p>  As practice, you may try this question:</p>
              <p>  Find the probability that the cubes at each end are of a different colour.</p>
              <p>  Thanks and Merry Christmas in advance!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  This discussion has been motivated by N2011/P1/Q4(ii)(b) about using a Maclaurin series with a given substitution to find an approximate value.</p>
              <p>  For a Maclaurin series to be used to achieve a good
                                          approximation, we can characterise two situations:</p>
              <p>  1. If we have a few terms in the series, we will need |x|
                                          to be as small as possible (i.e., close to zero).</p>
              <p>  2. If |x| is rather close to 1, we will need to have more terms in the series.</p>
              <p>  Let's consider a trivial example where we take the Maclaurin series of 1/(1 - x) which is our familiar infinite geometric series 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^n + ... .</p>
              <p>  To illustrate situation 1, suppose we substitute x = 1/9 and simply consider 4 terms of the series, we obtain</p>
              <p>  1 / {1 - (1/9)} is approximately equal to 1 + (1/9) + (1/9)^2 + (1/9)^3</p>
              <p>  =&gt; 9/8 is approximately equal to 820/729</p>
              <p>  =&gt; 9 is approximately equal to 6560/729 (or 8.9986).</p>
              <p>  Before we illustrate situation 2, we recall the sum of n terms of a GP with first term 1 and common ratio x, i.e., (1 - x^n) / (1 - x).</p>
              <p>  Suppose we substitute x = 8/9 and consider n terms of the series, we obtain</p>
              <p>  1 / {1 - (8/9)} is approximately equal to {1 - (8/9)^n} / {1 - (8/9)}</p>
              <p>  =&gt; 9 is approximately equal to 9 {1 - (8/9)^n}.</p>
              <p>  If we want the approximation in situation 2 to be as good as that of situation 1 (i.e., 8.9986), one could use GC and find that n must at least be 75:</p>
              <p>  n = 74, 9 {1 - (8/9)^n} = 8.9985</p>
              <p>  n = 75, 9 {1 - (8/9)^n} = 8.9987.</p>
              <p>  To conclude, one should pay particular attention to the substitution value as well as the number of terms of the series in order to arrive at a good approximation.</p>
              <p>  Thanks for reading.</p>
