              <p>For those going to take A levels this year, I have compiled a list of topics you can use to help yourself prepare for your prelims or A levels.</p>
              <p>J1s can use it as well. Just blocked off those not taught in your first year.</p>
              <p>And to JC Maths or Physics tutors, feel free to download to use as well.</p>
              <p>Anyone wants to help contribute for O levels or other subject for A levels can email me the checklist as well.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Now that you have a comprehensive checklist to know what to focus on when you revise, it is also important to know something about effective problem-solving.</p>
              <p>  I will describe Polya's problem-solving approach and illustrate its application with an example. The approach consists of four steps with some further points under each step.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 1: Understand the problem</strong><br><br>  What am I given?<br>  What do I need to solve?</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 2: Devise or make a plan</strong></p>
              <p>  What approaches are available for me to solve?<br>  Have I solved similar problems before?<br>  Are there smaller problems for me to solve?</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 3: Carry out the plan</strong></p>
              <p>  I will write out the steps of my solution.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 4: Look back at the completed solution</strong></p>
              <p>  Is my final answer a reasonable one?<br>  Are my steps clear, logical and error-proof?<br>  Can I check the answer with calculator?<br>  Can I substitute back?<br>  Can I obtain the same answer via another approach?</p>
              <p>  Now let's look at an example involving differential equations:</p>
              <p>  The curve C satisfies the equation y '' = sin^3 x. It is given that C cuts the y-axis at -1 and passes through the point (4/pi, 2/9). Find y in terms of x.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 1: Understand the problem<br><br></strong>  <em>What am I given?</em></p>
              <p>  1. y '' = sin^3 x<br><br>  2. Points (0, -1) and (4/pi, 2/9) lie on C. </p>
              <p>  <em>What do I need to solve?</em></p>
              <p>  1. Find the particular solution, because I am given particular points.<br><br>  2. Express y in terms of x, because it is required by the question.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 2: Devise or make a plan</strong></p>
              <p>  <em>What approaches are available for me to solve?</em><br><br>  They are direct integration, variable separable, substitution which I have been exposed to.<br><br>  <em>Have I solved similar problems before?<br></em><br>  Perhaps, I may have seen it before in lectures, tutorials, tests, exams, etc. <br><br>  <em>Are there smaller problems for me to solve?</em></p>
              <p>  1. Yes, I need to find dy/dx before I can find y in terms of x.<br><br>  2. The expression sin^3 x may need to be simplified by applying a suitable trigonometric identity before I can integrate it.<br><br>  3. Since I am given two points that lie on C, I will need to find constants in the particular solution.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 3: Carry out the plan</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong> <em>I will write out the steps of the solution as follow.</em></p>
              <p>  y '' = sin^3 x <br>       = (sin x)(sin^2 x), by Pythagorean identity <br>       = (sin x)(1 - cos^2 x)<br>       = sin x - (sin x)(cos^2 x)</p>
              <p>  I recognise that -(sin x)(cos^2 x) looks like f '(x) . {f(x)}^n, so I can integrate the expression directly.</p>
              <p>  Integrating both sides wrt x,<br>  y ' = -cos x + 1/3 cos^3 x + c, so I have solved a smaller problem.</p>
              <p>  y ' = -cos x + 1/3 (cos x)(1 - sin^2 x) + c, following the same approach earlier.<br>       = -cos x + 1/3 cos x - 1/3 (cos x)(sin^2 x) + c<br>       = -2/3 cos x - 1/3 (cos x)(sin^2 x) + c</p>
              <p>  Integrating both sides wrt x again,<br>  y = -2/3 sin x - 1/3 (1/3 sin^3 x) + cx + d<br>     = -2/3 sin x - 1/9 sin^3 x + cx + d, so I have obtained a general solution and another smaller problem has been tackled.</p>
              <p>  Since (0, -1) lies on C, d = -1.</p>
              <p>  Now y = -2/3 sin x - 1/9 sin^3 x + cx - 1.</p>
              <p>  Since (4/pi, 2/9) lies on C, -2/3 - 1/9 + (4/pi) c - 1 = 2/9<br>  =&gt; c = pi/2</p>
              <p>  Finally, the particular solution is y = -2/3 sin x - 1/9 sin^3 x + (pi/2) x - 1.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Step 4: Look back at the completed solution</strong></p>
              <p>  <em>Is my final answer a reasonable one?</em><br><br>  It is, because the expression is trigonometric given that the original expression is trigonometric.</p>
              <p>  <em>Are my steps clear, logical and error-proof?<br></em><br>  Yes, though I must be careful with minus signs.<br><br>  <em>Can I substitute back?<br></em><br>  Yes, I can check using the two points that lie on C.<br><br>  <em>Can I obtain the same answer via another approach?</em><br><br>  No, but I can differentiate y twice and see if I could obtain the expression</p>
              <p>  y '' = sin^3 x,</p>
              <p>  though it may be time-consuming in the exam. I may do it if it is a tutorial question or a question that I'm doing during my revision.</p>
              <p>  I hope this example convinces students that the Polya's method is effective, especially in its steps 1 &amp; 2. By carrying out the first two steps rigorously, it will bring about the solution naturally. </p>
              <p>  Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Wee,</p>
              <p>I have seen your 2009 E.Maths and Add.Maths TYS by Dyna in Big bookshop but not yet available in Popular Bookshop.</p>
              <p>I have not seen your 2009 H1 and H2 Maths TYS by Dyna in both bookshops yet.</p>
              <p>I like your revision notes for H2 Maths as discussed in homework forum. Will the essential notes and formula guide be published at the same time ? This useful guide will fill the void that the other H2 Maths guides have not covered. It will be a very handy and useful guide for H2 Maths students.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Thanks for your support!</p>
              <p>  Dyna is still rushing the 2009 H1 Maths TYS. H2 Maths TYS is ready, if you wish to purchase directly from Dyna.</p>
              <p>  The checklist and formula guide are made freely available on my website at this moment to reach out to students directly. Publishing and making students purchase them may not be advisable in this difficult time, I feel.</p>
              <p>  Thanks again.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Wee,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>Your H2 maths revision notes are excellent.</p>
              <p>H2 Maths students who do not visit homework forum or your website will be unable to benefit from your excellent notes.</p>
              <p>May I suggest that you incorporate these notes into your H1 and H2 Maths TYS ie revision notes and examples for each topic before the past years examination questions ?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Thanks for your encouragement! You are probably the first person to commend my work :D</p>
              <p>  FYI, I have included my website in my TYS and Solutions books as the first weblink, so that students will be able to visit my website and benefit from the learning resources.</p>
              <p>  I will take your suggestion to incorporate the notes next time if the publisher is agreeable, because it will make the books become more expensive and schools will complain even louder than before :P</p>
              <p>  Thanks again!</p>
              <p>P.S. Dyna Publisher already sets TYS books at extremely reasonable prices to discourage illegal photocopying by students who want to avoid buying. Take the 2007 edition of H2 Maths TYS for instance, each page costs less than 4 cents.</p>

              <p>  Thanks! If you are referring to N98/I/5, there is a typographical error in which I missed out the square root signs :P</p>
