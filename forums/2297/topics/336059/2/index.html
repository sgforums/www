              <p>chem today is surprisingly easy, as compared to te other subject papers.</p>
              <p>so i think monday's paper 2 would be a killer instead.</p>
              <p>and apparently RJC seems to have "spot" correctly the emphasis in p3 this yr.</p>
              <p>4/5 qsns are organic chem. was thinking that RJ must be crazy to mfocus so much on organic chem in their prelims. (also 4/5 qsns organic chem.)</p>

              <p>I think because last yr got so many pple getting not bad results and were rejected from local university. And parents will write to MOE and Straits Times to complain their son/daughter blabla got A B C, or B  B B but got rejected by NUS, NTU, SMU.</p>
              <p>Probably the authorities wanted to ensure this doesnt happen again and thats why they are making the papers extremely tough, so only the creme de la cream gets to uni with their well-deserved scores.<br><br>Seriously many people gonna get screwed.</p>

              <p>The alternate trend is just a myth, i think.<br><br>I heard of this ever since my PSLE days and i doubt its true. 07's A Level papers are easier to manage probably because its the first year this H1,H2,H3 system rolls in.<br><br> It will look better on their part by making it managable rather than making the papers tough on its first year. In a way, people will tend to "accept" this syllabus; only then, for subsequent years they might regulate the difficulty level.</p>
              <p>My humble two cents.</p>

              <p>Aiya one year they say the paper is too easy so they set harder for the next year. And then next year, they heard its hard so they will set easier for the next batch. And the cycle goes on and on and on.</p>

                  photographer wishes to check the time for which the shutter on a camera
                  stays open when a photograph is being taken. To do this, a metal ball
                  is photographed as it falls from rest. It is found that before the
                  shutter opens, the balls falls 2.50 m from rest and, during the time
                  that the shutter remains open, the ball falls a further 0.12 m, as
                  illustrated in the figure on the right. Assuming that air resistance is
                  negligible, calculate<br><br>(i) the speed of the ball after falling 2.50m,<br>(ii) the time to fall the further 0.12m.<br><br>The time for which the shutter stays open is marked on the camera as 1/160 s. Comment on whether the test confirms this time.</p>
