              <p><strong>This post is targeted at students who wish to enrol in private schools.</strong></p>
              <p>Let me tell you about my journey.</p>
              <p>I studied in MDIS for the past 5 years. After O levels, I couldn't get into a local polytechnic/JC, and to be honest, I was really thankful because I never really patronized poly environment. Of course, when I first got my O level results, I was disappointed that it didn't get me into JC, but then I decided a private school would be a better option. I enrolled in the mass comm prog in MDIS. Started from PC till degree.  Initially, I was apprehensive because of the school environment-it was old and pretty rundown, I didn't know how I was going to adjust-but then I had faith in God, and decided to go as planned. My coursemates were all from different walks of life, and I had a lot of fun with them. We became very close,and the lecturers were great. After PC i progressed to diploma,I had the same local lecturers-who were media professionals in the past. The diploma prog was about a year, and I saw a drastic improvement in my results, I achieved mostly As on most of my projects and assignments. A lot of my friends decided to stop at diploma but i progressed further to advanced diploma, where i had a smaller class. It was a six month prog which I thouroughly enjoyed- from PC till advanced diploma I had some really experienced and well-trained multimedia lecturers. After that, I decided to do my Bachelors, I know a lot of people decide to take a break at this point but I wanted to complete my education in a go. So I moved up to the degree prog,this time, my lecturers were from U.S. And they were no different, they had 15-20 years of experience in America and conducted rotational classes for 2 weeks, afterwhich, we had study break and exams. I finally graduated with a Bachelors degree in 2015 last year. N<span style="line-height: 19.696px;">ow that I have spoken quite a lot about my prog, l</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">et me tell you some good things about MDIS;</span></p>
              <p>-When i first enrolled, my main concern was the shabby, sloppy looking building, which really had an inverse effect on the school environment, however to my surprise, overtime they were going through some upgrades and renovations, now the school looks great with new blocks and lecture theatres. </p>
              <p>-You'll meet a lot of international students here, there's great exposure to multi-cultures, and trust me you learn a lot from them.</p>
              <p>-Thank god the Kopitiam got replaced by Foodhaven; it was really expensive and there was no variety in cuisines. </p>
              <p>-There's a new cafe and study corner with facilties such as a pool table where students can relax during their free time.</p>
              <p>-The lecturers are amazing, trust me, at least for the course I took.</p>
              <p>-The timetable is pretty relaxed, classes are usually 3 hours or half a day depending on the module and intensity of workload.</p>
              <p>-You'll have ample time to study for your exams.</p>
              <p>-The membership card is actually quite useful.</p>
              <p>-The library has outstanding printing facility, very convenient.</p>
              <p>-Materials are provided by lecturers, you won't have to go outside to look for them. Example, textbooks and worksheets. </p>
              <p>-There's a hostel right beside campus for international students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some concerns;</p>
              <p>-The admin department is really slow,I never encountered any issues with them, but a lot of people were annoyed due to their inefficiency at times.</p>
              <p>-Cost wise: quite expensive compared to PSB and Kaplan. I checked both out and compared prices, if you're on a money crunch, I recommend PSB/Kaplan because MDIS can get quite expensive. You have to pay for remodules and re-examinations.  Even for trips overseas, the school only helps with paperwork, you have to settle everything else on your own, which is okay, because the school gives you time to sort it out as long as you follow up with your course coordinator.</p>
              <p>-If you don't get a good course cordinator chances are you'll have issues with the admin department. That's just your luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall, I really enjoyed my journey in MDIS. It has somewhat changed my life. Take note that this is not a paid or sponsored post, I am just an alumni, a really happy and satisfied one because I made the right decision for myself. Just a heads up, if you're not doing well in school, don't blame your lecturers or the entire school, excelling is really up to you. </p>

              <p>Almost the same.</p>
              <p>Of course, local unis have a different qualification standard..</p>
              <p>I am not making a comparison with local unis.Just giving my viewpoint on private education. And how it has been useful to me. Also, its clearly stated that I am targetting those who wish to pursue private education. </p>
