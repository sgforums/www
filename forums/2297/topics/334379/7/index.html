              <p>omg is the english exams now so rubbish that you have follow a format to write a argumentative essay?</p>
              <p>It used to be teachers will try to recommend a format but there is nothing wrong with not following it. Now you get deducted marks for not following such and such a format?</p>
              <p>Used to be I never listen to my teachers' suggestions of essay format (letter format of coz must follow lah)... and it is no big deal so long as you show your understanding of the issues, the pros and cons and why you have decided on taking a certain side.</p>
              <p>Now they fail you because you never make your stand clear in the 1st paragraph???</p>
              <p>Is it just rumors you guys repeating or a true "rule" communicated by the exam boards?</p>

              <p>for argumentative essays, it is indeed imperative for one to

              <p>That depends on the style of the writer does it no?</p>
              <p>Some people prefer to intro/illustrate the issue at hand to the reader, followed by a look of the pros and cons. Analysis the situation and then make a stand. Followed by a explanation of why and a conclusion.This is called soft sell and create an impression that you looked carefully at the issue before finally making up your mind. You can often see such styles in the opinion sections of newspapers and respectable magazine. A argumentative essay has the objective of persuading the reader that the writer has a fair and valid point of views tempered by reasoning.</p>
              <p>Whether or not your essay have a clear path to the reader does not depend on the format of the argument, it depends on whether you are able to persuade the reader that your argument is valid and reasoned.</p>

              <p>Most of the points I want to say have been said by deteq.</p>
              <p>Newspapers and magazines are not argumentative essays; they merely give opinions, not persuade. Writing an argumentative essay is akin to a debater being in a debate or a lawyer fighting a court case; your stand is made clear right at the very beginning.</p>
              <p>Argumentative essays are a bit like GP essays in G.P.; a strong thesis statement is extremely important at the very first paragraph, summarizing all the points as short as possible, and giving a clear stand from the points you summarized. You then go on to explain each single point, giving examples to support your points and stand along the way, and finally, tee off with a conclusion on your stand again.</p>

              <p>Bo leh. I wrote my GP essays the way I like to. Intro issue.
                  Explain both sides of the arguments. Make my stand. Explain my
                  stand. Conclusion.</p>

              <p>what you get for GP</p>
              <p>If you get A with the way it is written above, it is usually because your English and general knowledge is damn powerful...</p>
              <p>or perhaps when you introduced the issue, you have already subconsciously given your stand in some way or the other</p>

              <p>ok, it's not a must :D</p>
              <p>anyway for me, it's just personal experience. I got a C when I did it like what you said after 2 years of GP lessons,  and then I retook during army using the way I said (exactly how my GP teacher said it should be) with only 4 private GP lessons and got an A. I believe my command of the English language was still equally bad at that time.</p>

              <p>I think as long as you <strong>persuade</strong> the examiners that your choice will be enjoyed by your classmates, worth the money and that your parents do not have to worry too much about your safety, it should be fine. :)</p>
