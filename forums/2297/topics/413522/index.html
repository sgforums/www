              <p>Hey there.</p>
              <p>I am studying in a local junior college now. I couldn't decide on what to join during my orientation period and ended up considering choir and volleyball as these were the CCAs i took when i was in secondary school. Choir was my final decision since volleyball is a niche in my school and the trainings are pretty tough and hectic, let alone the fact that there were 10 DSAs and it was hard to get into the school team. With the intention of focusing more on studies and less on CCA in jc, i wanted a slack CCA. However, choir is becoming a really hectic CCA because of the SYF next year. As such, i find it difficult to find time to study and work on my weak subjects. JC is all about academics isn't it? So what's the point of getting a good CCA record and end up failing my A levels?</p>
              <p>Coming to the main point, I've decided to quit. Is it a wise decision? I am also in the Class Leaders Committee and it is considered as a student interest group. This means that I will have something to write in my School Graduation Cert (SGC).</p>
              <p>I am not aiming to go for scholarships whatsoever. So by just focusing on academics and ensuring that i will ace my A levels, is it enough to secure me a place in the university? Are CCAs compulsory in JC? I hope MOE doesn't bar me from university just because i chose to quit my CCA at the end of JC1 so that i am allowed more time to improve on my studies.</p>
              <p>Thank you all for your replies/opinions! I have to decide whether to quit by this week :D</p>

              <p>if you are not aiming for a scholarship then yes it isnt really important UNLESS</p>
              <p>1) the course you are aiming for in uni isn't highly sought after</p>
              <p>2) you do well enough to make it comfortably into the course you desire and not getting the sort of grades that puts you on the waiting list (cca will help here)</p>

              <p>From what you have written, I think you have already made the decision. </p>
              <p>You are feeling stress on your CCA on top of your academic. Quit your CCA after year 1 if you feel stress.</p>
              <p> But usually CCA will automatically stop during examination period, and for year 2, sem 2 usually is a "quiet" period. Obviously every1 else also need to prepare for their exam. So how come every1 else is alright but u r so stress?</p>

              <p>Hi Yellowhotdog,</p>
              <p>  There is no need to be concerned about others doing well. Just focus on doing well yourself.</p>
              <p>  CCAs are meant to develop non-academic-related qualities in individuals so they can become well-balanced. Perhaps you may volunteer for some CIP-related activities since you do not have any official CCA now. Do not give your desired universities and future employers the impression that you are only good in studies.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>  Having a CCA should not be for you to look good on paper only. It should help to develop personal qualities. Thanks.</p>
