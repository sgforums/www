              <p>For me I feel that there are 4 parts to study:<br><br>-MCQ<br>-Structured Question<br>-Structured Essay<br>-Practical/SPA<br><br>And each way of studying is different.<br><br><strong>MCQ</strong><br>For
              MCQ, try exposing yourself to the maximum possibilities of questions
              which will come out in exam. Try out different TYS or assignment book.
              Do and do until you understand and get correct for each and every
              question.<br><br>Time management is also very important! One must reach
              a level when he sees the question at first sight, and the next moment
              answer is pop up in the mind. This will save precious time in the exam
              and allow you to double/triple check.<br><br><strong>Structured Question</strong><br>Read
              the question carefully. Try to recall if you have seen any of the
              question in TYS or during your revision. Do they look familiar?
              Seriously speaking, Cambridge have run out of ideas already. Those
              questions you see in your O exam are probably taken from past year.
              Their creativity juice has run out.<br><br>It's best to read and understand the content of your text book and make note for it. Have you heard of the <span style="color: blue;">80/20 Rule</span>?
              It states that out of the whole chunk of information you have, 80% are
              non content words, while the another 20% is the information that you
              really need. If you were to make note, you'll save A LOT of time on
              your later revision.<br><br>Keep doing the Past Year Papers, Prelim
              papers, Mid Year Paper and TYS. Where there is a source of question,
              just do it. Expose yourself to more question, and it will really help
              you in exam.<br><br>Do the easier question first. Then revisit back the question again and ponder for an answer. <img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"><br><br><strong>Structured Essay</strong><br>This
              is the part where you need to memorize a lot of essay. At what I have
              said, Make Key-Point Notes! Key-Point Notes are those notes with just
              the key point of the content. Then in your mind, link these points
              together to show it's relevancy.<br><br>No doubt you'll have to memorize quite a lot for this part. Be glad, There's only a few essay to study per chapter.<br><br>Well,
              it all boils down to your understand. After memorizing, you should be
              able to tell if you can understand the content or not.<br><br><strong>Practical/SPA</strong><br>Probably
              the lab are closed now for preparation. Revise the notes your teacher
              gave you. Also read up your textbook for more information. Remember
              Biology practical is one of the most easier component out of the four.<br><br>You must be able to do tests. Like Food Test which consist of four test. You <span style="color: blue;">MUST follow the instructions</span> . If you missed any steps or do anything wrongly, the overall result
              will be different. Usually this will apply to Plants, where they'll ask
              you to do something to it.<br><br>Drawing. Try practice drawing all the
              fruits LS and TS. You must know where is the line of axis(growth
              direction). You'll be also required to draw things which you'll never
              draw before. Weird stuff can range from ginger to longgag, from chilli
              to mangosteen. Aww.. Drawing will be an unfair advantage to art
              students <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><br><br>Your drawing lines must be clear and concise. No shading! Don't add 3-D effects  <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>Do past year papers. Especialy if it's from midyear or prelims. I did my school past year midyear paper 2005 2006 and 2007 and during my bio exam 2 days ago, 2-3 open ended and one structure essay was similar.</p>
              <p><br>Also, work on answering technique. If for example they ask for "how does a plant support itself." (4marks)</p>
              <p>you will have to cover 2 main reasons why cause it's 4 marks. 2 marks for each point.</p>
              <p>The cell wall(impt words) of the xylem thicken with ligin as they mature, help as structural support, prevent plant from collasping.</p>
              <p>-Turgid cells. This is because there is a higher h2o potential and hence water will enter the cells by osmosis. The plant cells will therefore be turgid and be erect and upright. This helps the plant support itselves, especially in young plants as they need to grow upwards and be upright so as to recieve maximum sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>
              <p>You have to kinda throw all u know inside the essay Q. this is so that the teacher cannot - 0.5 marks so u can get the full 4 marks (:</p>

              <p>get those type of tys with all the answers for its structured qsns. (some they leave out the ans for the hard qsns &amp;^%$)</p>
              <p>if you can't study from textbook, go do the tys by copying directly from the answer sheet. take time to go remember what the markers are looking for for while you are copying. it helps you focus on scoring relevant points.</p>
