              <p>So I am taking my Os this year and I need a lot of help.</p>
              <p>I come from a family background where all my parents and relatives have never made it past secondary education because of poverty and those that do only managed a place in poly and joined the workforce promptly after NS.</p>
              <p>I am totally clueless abt SG's tertiary education system atm because my family don't really know where I should go and I don't know where to get help. So just give me a detailed as explnation as possible. And I would say the "poverty" part applies to myself more or less. I don't want to talk about it, but let's just say my parents monthly income is hovering around the 1k to 1.5k monthly and I took my first holiday job last month to make a quick buck.</p>
              <p>Personal life aside, I have an interest in Bio and Chem mostly and intend to go for Biotech/Biomedical diploma courses in Poly - but I heard people in this line are better off taking JC course and getting phd in uni(I think that's just impossible for me) to find a good job. Otherwise it will be impossible to find a job because people who walk this path can only take a future in research and these jobs are normally not popular in SG. Adding on to what I said earlier, I don't think I can make it to uni because I probably can't afford it.</p>
              <p>Should I continue toward my current poly goal or find another route?</p>

              <p>Since you already know where your interest lies, I suggest that you pursue it, and if $$$ is a bit of an issue, go to JC first and use your 2 years there to plan a path for yourself to pursue.</p>
              <p>Do not underestimate how these 2 years can potentially change or solidify your plans and career options. Do yourself a favour and give yourself time to mull this over and allow the A level cert to also allow you to position yourself for whatever degree that you may wish to take.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you are sure, then go to poly and learn. Concentrate on your 3 years there but do not forget also to plan for what might lie ahead as well.</p>

              <p>There are plenty of jobs for biomed poly grad.</p>
              <p>The most common is hospitals and polyclinics. My friend is drawing blood for patients everyday now. Others include disease diagnosis and etc... Others work in research center/teaching lab as lab officer or lab tech. Some work in school like your bio lab tech.</p>
              <p>Some move on to do degree in life sciences, physology, nursing and more.</p>
              <p>Some do sales, clincial trial, teaching and even banking and HR . </p>
              <p>The COP for poly biomed is quite high. So you should ask if you can get into the course in the first place.</p>

              <p>Hi Zccheng, </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I'm going to sing a different tune here and ask if you need immediate income to help the family.</span></p>
              <p>If you need that and <span style="line-height: 1.231;">you go the JC route, any form of income will probably only come after JC and as part-time tuition. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you go the poly route, you will find yourself working a lot earlier and that means income. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You can decide whether to take a degree later though it will be more expensive and you will have lost somet time. So you need to think if you need to help contribute to the family's finances or will you be able to study in peace for the next 5-6 years if you go the JC route. Poly route is only 3 years to starting work.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I hope this helps though </span>this probably provides more questions than answers.</p>

              <p>Unless you can get to a biomed related course in Uni, Biomed science courses at diploma level will not get you far (any biomed science dip holder can enlighten more?). <br><br>JC can be another route but only if you work very hard. If you ask me, different people have different "inclination"; some people are really study smart and have no problems passing exams, while some people are better at hands on stuff and projects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you are taking your Os this year, you still do have enough time to consider and most importantly, compare your results with your expectations and aspirations: is it realistic and achievable? Do i want this? or do i need to work harder?</p>

              <p>Do plan for the longer term. earning 1k+ a month shouldn't be your goal. A degree does have higher earning potential. And if you work hard at it, you won't fail at J1 lah. </p>
