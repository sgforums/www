              <p>I recommend you go YouTube to search for your resources. YouTube has almost all the information you need, and it's more graphical and will be able to explain complicated concept with the aid of illustrations and models.</p>

              <p>First question, you mentioned: 'i didnt slack i did work hard for promos', so have you been working equally hard throughout the year? If not, this is the major reason. You are no longer doing your Os, several weeks is never sufficient, even for one subject.</p>
              <p>I understand different students have difficult amplitude, but once they did reasonably well in their Os, they have shown their capability. Of course, to attain good results in JC, some students may only need one hour to study for every day while others may need 5 hours per day to secure the same grade (yes, I mean throughout the year, not before the promo exam yourself). If you belong to the latter category but only work 1 hour per day on average, then you will be in serious trouble.</p>

              <p>Hey dude! First of all, dont be too discouraged by your promo results, thats not the end of the world. You definitely have the potential to do well give your olevel results. Judging by your result, i guess you might be in one of the JCs that set notoriously hard papers? But that the shouldnt be an excuse not to do well. Your goal is to do well for Alevels.!</p>
              <p>I dont think its a wise decision to consider retaining based on these factors.</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li>retaining doesnt guarantee you will do well. Some become more complacement when they get retained and their results fall further.</li>
              <li>Seriously dude, spending two years in JC is more than enough for a few lifetime </li>
              </ol>
              <div>I think you should consider your studying strategies like what  <a style="background-color: #dddddd; color: #ff7129; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 17px;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/134754">Darkness_hacker99</a>  suggests. Let me share with you some tips which i found useful. In general right, you should always seek to understand your content well, no point memorising like in Olevels cause Alevel is more advanced than Olevels. Always clarify your doubt with your peers or subject tutor when you dont understand, i find that to be extremely useful. If you must get a study buddy whos around the same standard as you and try to help each other out and get regular + early consultations with teachers. Btw, sometimes its helpful to take the subject syllabus and see whether you can answer the requirements there, it helps you to consolidate what you know or dont know.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>For Econs: It is recommended that you do full essays on your own to practice the rigour you need in answering essay questions. Essays outlines should be 1/2-3/4 of a full essay to practice answering the question(its a practice to make sure you identify the correct points to write about and have a sense of what you are going to explain). For case study, must read questions and annotate both the extracts and questions.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>For chem: Its highly essential to understand the content, because they always repeats the same type of questions in different context(elements/compounds). The answers are quite similiar, but must modify to suit the question requirement. Once you get the hang of bullshitting(my teacher always says that) you can answer most of the questions fairly well. Basic mastery of content like colour of compounds is very important! For organic chemsitry, always understand the mechanism and not the reaction. A smiliar type of reaction with different functional groups that you never encountered may come out and you are required to apply what you have learnt to it.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>For maths: Understanding the significance of each step is key! You must know what you are doing. Read your notes and understand. Practice with understanding and dont blindly do questions like in olevels, it doesnt work this way with Alevels! Observation skills to see similiarity between parts is also important, make sure you stay clam and think!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I dont take bio so i have no advice for this but i think the key is understanding rather than memorising.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thats all i have to say i guess. But dont waste your time repeating! Since you already know that you might be lagging, work hard for the coming year! no time to slack while you try to keep up with year 2 work and catch up with year1 work. The essential thing is to study SMART and i am sure you can make it! Dont be too stressed and All the best!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>P.s hope this helps.</div>

              <p>Thank  you so much people for telling me the strategies really appreciate it</p>

I realise that now especially for organic chem. when elucidation qns came out for finals i just died. if  i had done it this way i probably would have cleared :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only choice i have now is go to poly or retaining cuz i didnt clear promos. but there is a retest but for that cut off is 30rp i am a few points away so im thinking of appealing for the retest and i have asked my friends to help me and have booked consultations im willing to work smarter this time but i dunno if i do get the opportunity for the retest </p>

              <p>Those who do well after getting retained, are usually those who did not put in adequate effort the first time round, or those who changed their combination. </p>
              <p>If you have been slaving all the way, then it is time you consider your tutor's advice of switching your combination, or enter poly instead.</p>
              <p>The latter is not a decision to be taken lightly, but I can tell you of some cases where retained students dropped out and enter local unis through the poly route.</p>

              <p>heyy people I really need your help im really lost and i dont
              know what im going to do right now with my life.</p>
              <p>my dad is worried he thinks maybe i cant cope with JC and i shld
              go to poly.. </p>
              <p>Im 18 this yr so age is also a  problem.. i chose bcme
              combination with h1 econs.. I can definetly say i didnt slack i did
              work hard for promos but my first half of the year i was really
              struggling even though i did class tests reasonably well..</p>
              <p>I really like bio but i cant do well.. my bio tutor thinks i
              shouldnt change subject and just continue on with JC cuz she thinks
              with more time by repeating J1 I will grasp concepts better and i
              will be able to do well for As. but retaning is really a difficult
              option.. I dont know what to do..</p>
              <p>and I dont know if people who retain will do well in As.. but i
              can definetly say i will put in the hard work this time so I just
              need advice from people who retained and are doing A levels or in
              uni now.. please give me your insights which will help me choose
              the right option..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my o level score isnt that bad its 11- 4 bonus so 7.. and if i
              want to continue in JC what should I do?</p>
              <p> please tell me some constructive options. Thanks for
              reading :)</p>

I want ot take life sciences and do forensics or bio medical..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which is why its really hard for me to give up on bio when my dad asked me if I should drop bio and change to arts for next year..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im open to the retaining idea as well. it doesnt hurt me as much bcuz if time is what i need im willing to retain and work smart right from the start cuz eventually A levels is what matters and if retaining lets me get the couse i want in the future then so be it but I want the retest as an opportunity to believe..</p>
              <p>I really want the retest cuz i think this time round I really have the determination and motivation to drive me but the ''what ifs'' constantly nag me what if I dont get the retest? what if I retain and take the same combi and same thing happens again"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the retest cut off is 30 rp and im only 2 points away so I really really want to appeal and try to get the retest bcuz I have now till end of dec to study for it. Im going to finish PW soon and I can really focus on the retest</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the thing is I dont know if and more importantly how i should appeal..</p>
              <p>I know that if i put my mind into it and show my sch that im willing to give it my best they would most likely give me the second chance the thing is how </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please let me know what you think</p>

You are the person for JC<br>3. Continue with your academic efforts previously.<br>4. It's a shorter path (time-wise)<br><br>The issue right now is your self-doubting, which is only too common among people who are considering whether to continue JC or switch to poly instead. <br><br>Truth to be told, it doesnt really matter what you choose, because one ultimate determinant of your success is your belief. I can see you succeeding in JC, and even in Poly. I would suggest JC still, with the above-mentioned benefits.<br><br>The holiday period is the excellent period for bucking up, while the rest of your cohort slacks away. I assure you that whatever revision/work you do will be worth your effort, if you plan the schedule well and you focus.<br><br>With regards to your appeal, I'm sure you school will accept an earnest student. You must learn how to justify yourself - convincing the school will be effortless if you have truly made the promise to yourself to strive for the best in JC. Take the appeal as an administrative proccess. Don't let it be your source of stress in the future too. With your determination, you will do well.<br><br>Plan an extensive and comprehensive revision schedule, covering the past topics the school has taught you. Look at the papers you have done, review them and do them again.<br><br> If you are fast enough, you can even cover future topics in advance. Of course, don't forget to play. I'm sure you know how to balance it well. :)<br><br>All the best! :D<br></p></div>

              <p><br>It's not a significant factor that caused COP to be lowered. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> It's determine by many market and economic forces, popularity of the course, number of applicants, etc.</p>

              <p><br>Your 're-test' is an internal JC matter, which differs from JC to JC, since it's up to each individual JC's teachers to decide on the procedure. You should speak to your subject teacher and ask him/her to instruct you on this matter.</p>
              <p>Unless you're absolutely certain about a particular poly course that suits you, otherwise, stay in JC. Re-take your exams to promote if possible (ie. if your teachers allow you to), otherwise repeat Year 1 and make it count this time.</p>

              <p>Tay, maybe it would be better off that you repeat JC1, Afterall, if your foundation is very weak, and you try to compel yourself to advance to JC2, you might not be able to cope or even pass your 'A' levels.</p>
              <p>Nothing to lose out or be shy about if you were to do it again one more time in the 1st year. Take it as it comes.</p>
