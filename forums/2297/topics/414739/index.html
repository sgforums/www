              <p>Hi all I'm currently a Year 4 secondary student, going into JC next year through IP :)</p>
              <p>But I'm stuck between a decision for PCME or BCME, because my grades for P and B are almost the same, 87% and 84% respectively.</p>
              <p>I have more interest in B, but find it harder to study for B because of the excessive mugging.</p>
              <p>I have less interest in P, have no intention of picking up Engineering in the future, but find it easier to score in P.</p>
              <p>Please tell me how I should go about picking my combi D:</p>

              <p>You really should look deeper into which careers / professions you will most likely want to be going into, to base your decision for subject combination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Biology :</p>
              <p>Medicine students say having Biology over Physics gives them an advantage when applying. A small number of Biology based courses in the University, eg. Pharmacy, does require H2 Biology as a prerequisite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Physics :</p>
              <p>This is Eagle's domain, he'll tell you more about this. But in contrast to Bio, there are many times more Science courses in the Uni require H2 Physics as a prerequisite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in summary :</p>
              <p>Taking Physics is 'safer' than taking Biology, in terms of the number of doors/courses it opens to you in the University. So most students should go for Physics over Biology, as it keeps more of your options open. But if the courses you're most keen to take up in the Uni are Biology based or require H2 Biology, then naturally you should take Biology. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regardless of your choice between Physics and Biology, you can look forward to having a blast with Chemistry! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It'll be good to visit the open houses of JCs to find out what combinations they offer. You may also go through TYS books on Physics and Biology to see what the subjects are like. Thanks.</p>

              <p>wow, a person with a similar grade as my biology, if you have interest , go for bio, but be prepared for mugging stuff</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me show you the diff bet O level and A level</p>
              <p>The following are excerpts from my own notes</p>
              <p>A level</p>

                        the presence of DNA, the mitochondrion can synthesize some proteins and

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Mitochondrion is
                  responsible for cellular respiration. A series of biochemical reaction take
                  place in mitochondrion (glycolysis, citric acid cycle and oxidative
                  phosphorylation), resulting in ATP formation. (In exam – just quoting of
                  oxidative phosphorylation is adequate)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: normal;">Additional Note: In
                  view of evolution, mitochondria is viewed as a prokaryote being ingested by a
                  larger prokaryote but not destroyed by lysosomes and being integrated as an
                  integral member in the common cell in eukaryotes (animals). This is the case of
                  endosymbiosis.</span></p>
              <p>O level</p>
              <p>Mitochondria is a sausage like organelle which contains enzyme for cellular respiration</p>

              <p>So with this glimpse, i hope you can decide more, but bio isn't that hard if you have interest  </p>

              <p>TS, you were in my dilemma before. In the end I chose H2 Bio, despite the fact that I would have found H2 Phy less taxing but more boring. I didn't regret my decision.</p>
              <p>School grades for either subject shouldn't be a selection criteria since the difference between either subjects isn't that huge. (Eg. 60 for Phy, 80 for Bio).</p>
              <p>Other factors for you to consider:</p>
              <p>• Is Bio or Phy your school's forte? Some schools have better Physics dept as compared to Bio dept. For all you know, in the end you may end up liking Physics.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reverse holds true as well.</span></p>
              <p>• Distinction rate for Physics and Bio A Levels (After all, that's quite important isn't it?)</p>
              <p>If you choose to go along with H2 Bio, bear in mind that the content for H2 Bio is no joke. Unless you've photographic memory, you'll have your fair share of hair-pulling moments / late night mugging sessions for Bio.</p>
              <p>However, having said that, in my personal opinion, I find Bio's syllabus more interesting and relevant to recent biological developments. If you like more mathematical/abstract stuff then go for Phy.</p>

              criteria since the difference between either subjects isn't that
              huge. (Eg. 60 for Phy, 80 for Bio).</p>
              <p>Other factors for you to consider:</p>
              <p>• Is Bio or Phy your school's forte? Some schools have better
              Physics dept as compared to Bio dept. For all you know, in the end
              you may end up liking Physics.. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reverse holds true as
              well.</span></p>
              <p>• Distinction rate for Physics and Bio A Levels (After all,
              that's quite important isn't it?)</p>
              <p>If you choose to go along with H2 Bio, bear in mind that the
              content for H2 Bio is no joke. Unless you've photographic memory,
              you'll have your fair share of hair-pulling moments / late night
              mugging sessions for Bio.</p>
              <p>However, having said that, in my personal opinion, I find Bio's
              syllabus more interesting and relevant to recent biological
              developments. If you like more mathematical/abstract stuff then go
              for Phy.</p>

              <p>In H2 Bio you will not be exposed to blood or organs or dissection of animals / whatever.</p>
              <p>And I very much suggest you to reconsider your thoughts in venturing into the medical field into the future. Having a doctor who is fearful of blood and exposed organs is akin to having a teacher who is fearful of students.</p>
              <p>So if you feel that the 'A Level thing sounds quite okay' to you, why aren't you too sure whether you can fully commit to the syllabus? You have to reconcile these inherent contradictions you have first.</p>

              <p>Dear junior,</p>
              <p>If you really want to have a doctor career, then BCME.</p>
              <p>I knew right from the start I wanted to study engineering, and not be a doctor. Being a doctor requires lots and lots of responsibilities. You have to be very very meticulous as well, and possess a super big memory to memorise all the symptoms and drugs. And if you ever make a mistake, you do not necessary just lose your practicing license (after which you won't be able to find much jobs), you might even destroy a life! Not my cup of tea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I love Physics because it is really common sense. But one thing about JC physics... many pple go into JC with the idea that physics is easy, especially in J1. They can do quite a bit of questions, but their foundation might not be as strong. In the end, very jialat. So hard work is a necessity throughout J1 to J2. No time for any procrastination.</p>
