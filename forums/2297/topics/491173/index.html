            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Hi all! I'm currently a secondary 4 student who will be taking my O levels very soon and I'm thinking of going to a JC after O's since there isn't any particular course in Poly that I'm interested in. My current subject combination is EL, E Math, Combined Sci (Phy/Chem), POA, pure History. Combined humans (SS/Geo) &amp; Tamil. I'll most likely choose the Art stream in JC science since it's difficilt to do Science stream without A Maths and Pure Sciences background but the problem is I can't seem to find a JC which offers the subject combi that I'm quite interested in which is H1 Math + H2 History, H2 Chemistry &amp; H2 Economics . I've checked different JC websites and the 3rd H2 subject they offer for Art stream is either H2 Math or H2 Literature or China studies. I obviously don't qualify for H2 Math since I don't take A Maths (and likely won't be able to cope with it even if I did manage to take it) , as for literature I kinda hated it in lower sec and I feel that lit is not really my cup of tea. For China studies, my MT is not even chinese to begin with so don't really see the point in taking it. So is there any JC which offers the subject combi I'm looking for? I know NYJC allows hybrid combinations but looking at its COP I doubt that I can hit its COP as I'm aiming for 8-12 net points for O levels. Thanks in advance for any help.</span></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may have no choice but to enter YJC or MI, in which they'll allow you to take H2 Math as long as you get A for your E Math, and they'll allow you to take H2 Chem as long as you get A for your Science (Phy/Chem). So Sci stream is still possible, for these 2 JCs. Just be sure you get A grades for your E Math and Science (Phy/Chem), and you may be able to negotiate a more favourable subject combination in whichever JC you eventually do get posted to (ie. even if not YJC or MI).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Actually, I'm not sure if I want to try to enter Science stream since my strength is in the humanities than math &amp; sciences. I don't mind going to Art Stream just that I can't find my preferred combination of H2 History, Chemistry, Economics and Math. The reason why I want to take H2 Chemistry over H2 Lit/Math is that I'm quite good in chem ( I got A1 overall for combined science in Sec 3). As for math, since I've no A Maths, I'll probably struggle with H2 so I feel its better that I take H1 even though my choices of courses in universities will be lesser. I haven't really thought of what to study in university but I will most likely avoid engineering related courses. If there isn't any JC that offers the subject combi I'm interested in, I think I'll go for H2 History + H2 Geog instead which AJC and TPJC offer in their Arts combinations.</span></p></div>

              <p>H2 chem is very tough for a hybrid combi student, as phy + chem / bio + chem all at H2 levels are synergistic. Also H2 chem is much tougher than pure chem at O levels and combined science students actually learn quite simplified science. You will struggle a lot esp. for being a hybrid combi students in JC even if you get A1 in combined science.</p>
              <p>So, I advise you not to take H2 chem as it is not easy to score even for pure chem O levels students.</p>
              <p>So, how about taking H1 Math, Geog, History and Economics? You will have a lot of reading, memory work, essays and applications of humanities subjects. The H2 subjects will be a little synergistic.</p>
              <p>Or if you would really like H2 chem, you may appeal for hybrid subject combination at maybe SRJC. But I advise against it as combined science is not a good gauge of how you will perform in H2 chem.</p>
              <p>The arts stream in JCs offer fewer open doors to local unis.</p>
              <p>I am a science tutor, but I am just hopefully being more objective.</p>
              <p>All the best!!</p>

              Not forgetting the new 2016 H2 Chem syllabus is even tougher than the old 2015 H2 Chem syllabus, in many ways.

I'll probably stick to the pure arts subject combinations in JC as suggested and not to mention I'll be able to help save my parents' money spent on tuition since there isn't any for most arts subjects I guess, haha.

              While doing well in O levels Chemistry doesn't guarantee doing well in A levels Chemistry (simply because anything at A levels is a lot tougher than at O levels, that's the definitional difference between "Advanced" and "Ordinary" levels), nobody ever said you definitely won't do well in A levels Chemistry just because you took O levels Combined Science.<br><br>If you personally feel that Chemistry is a lot more interesting and engaging than the alternative subjects available (for your subject combination), then you can and should still go for it. Because passion and interest is the single most important determining factor as to whether you will succeed in your endeavors (because effort follows passion more naturally than mere discipline).<br><br>And even if you don't wish to engage private tuition for Chemistry, you can always post your H2 Chemistry questions here on SgForums, and I'll help you with them.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Go with your interests. You cant just let something difficult to set you back. No doubt that the content of H2 Chemistry is a lot different from the O levels and the fact that you are taking Combined Science is making it worse since you are taking only half the syllabus of Chemistry missing out on topics like Redox reaction etc. So you should try and get good grades for your math and sciences and who knows maybe they might allow you to take H2 Math. </p></div>
