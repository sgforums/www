              <p>Since ThunderFBolt has kindly answered Questions 2, 4 and 5, I will only touch on Questions 1, 3 and 6.</p>
              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>Tank A will be drain in 5 mins, while Tank B will be drain in 8 mins.</p>
              <p>After 2 mins,</p>
              <p>2/5 of Tank A will be drained and 2/8 of Tank B will be drained.</p>
              <p>= &gt; 3/5 of Tank A and 6/8 of Tank B will be left.</p>
              <p>    = &gt; 3/5 of Tank A = 3/4 of Tank B</p>
              <p>Thus, ratio of Tank A's height to Tank B's height = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5 : 4</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Some very basic algebra involved here.</p>
              <p>Let the numbers of boys be x.</p>
              <p>There are 20 girls and they                        collected an average of 30 stamps each.</p>
              <p>Total stamps that girls collected = 20 X 30 = 600 stamps</p>
              <p>Each boy collected an average
                                      of 8 stamps less than each girl.</p>
              <p>= &gt; Each boy collected an average of 22 stamps each</p>
              <p>Total stamps that boys collected = 22x stamps</p>
              <p>= &gt;</p>
              <p>[ ( Stamps boys collected ) + ( Stamps girls collected ) ] / Total children</p>
              <p>= Total average stamps collected per child</p>
              <p>( 22x + 600 ) / ( 20 + x ) = 26</p>
              <p>22x + 600 = 520 + 26x</p>
              <p>4x = 80</p>
              <p>x = 20</p>
              <p>= &gt; number of boys = x = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>20</strong></span> boys</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q6.</p>
              <p>Number of students in class A to B = 4 : 3 = 8 units : 6 units</p>
              <p>Let G be girls and B be boys</p>
              <p>Class A  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">l_G_l_G_l<strong>_B_l_B_</strong>l_B_l_B_l_B_l_B_l</span></p>
              <p>Class B <span style="text-decoration: underline;">l_G_l_G_l_G_l<strong>_G_l_G_</strong>l_B_l</span></p>
              <p>The bolded parts are the students who are reshuffled.</p>
              <p>Hence, 4 units of students are affected.</p>
              <p>= &gt; 4 units = 20 students</p>
              <p>       = &gt; 1 unit = 5 students</p>
              <p>= &gt; Total students in class B = 6 units = 6 X 5 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>30</strong></span> students.</p>
