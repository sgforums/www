              hello! i was wondering if it is possible to transfer out of my IP school at the end of year 4 (sec 4), after eoys. i am secondary 3 (year 3) this year and i am currently studying in a integrated programme school that is one of the three schools (cat high, st nicks &amp; scgs) that are joining up to form the new eunoia junior college. 
                      
              i got into my secondary school through psle results. however i was thinking about whether i should transfer out to another jc or not, after getting my year 4 (sec 4) end of year results, but im not sure if it is even possible to transfer to another jc. im not sure if any other jc will accept my application since i dont have an o level cert and the only qualifications i will have are my school end of year results from yr 3 and 4. as it is not possible to take o levels as a private candidate since the government doesnt allow ip students to take priv os, will any JC accept my application of my sec sch based exam results?
                      
              i am contemplating to transfer to either ACJC or catholic JC, if it is possible. also does anyone know if when u are transferring to another jc and are in IP, must the JC u transfer to be an IP jc as well? according to some people they are saying that u can only transfer to another ip jc but cannot get into any other jc that is not ip based. i am not sure if what they said was true or not though :( 
                  
              if anyone has heard of instances where people studying in ip sec school managed to transfer to another jc without an o level cert / without taking o levels, do let me know :-) thank you so much and i really appreciate the help!
                  
              also, im asking this because ive tried asking my friends / parents but they are all not sure how to do it &amp; whether it is feasible or not. they all said the only way to do it is through taking o levels as private candidate but thats not possible anymore, but  i heard u could do it in the past

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>first, would appreciate if you could use some paragraphs for your question. It's rather hard to decipher what you were writing (it's called a wall of text). This will be good training for your GP essays in JC :)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">second, I would suggest you try contacting the JCs that you are interested in and ask them your questions. Different JCs might have different policies, and might also change every year. You never know.</span></p>

              Ah right. You can take private O levels if you quit your IP programme first. But your plan ideally is to play it safe, remain in IP, and try to covertly take private O levels while still remaining in IP, which MOE won't allow. So if you're sure of getting great results for O levels, then you could quit your IP program first, then sign up as a private candidate (and inform MOE-SEAB that you already quit your IP program liao).

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Here's the thing: I'm a private candidate, so I dont have any 'notes' like other JC students.

Otherwise, I am intending to get notes from a friend who took his As in 2013 or 2014.

              For H2 Chemistry, I strongly recommend you buy CS Toh's books, Chan Kim Seng &amp; Jeanne Tan's books, and George Chong's books. All these authors have updated their books to reflect the changes in the new H2 Chemistry syllabus. So as long as you buy new copies (as opposed to buying 2nd hand copies from Carousell) of their books (eg. from CS Toh's website, and the other books from Popular bookstore), it'll be the new version for the new H2 Chem syllabus.<p>My BedokFunland JC's List of Recommended Books for H2 Chemistry :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/index.htm#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/index.htm#Books_for_H2_Chemistry</a></p>

              <p>Hi Eagle, thank goodness you told me!! For H2 Maths, when did the reduction of topics take place? and what topics has been taken out?</p>
              <p>(Because I just bought the Marshall Cavendish 'a Comprehensive Guide to H2 Mathematics', 2nd Edition for both volume 1 and 2, to be used as my math 'notes'/textbook. It says Second edition 2011, Reprinted 2013 and 2014. Would this be a book that reflects the reduced topics??)</p>

              <p>I noticed that you are taking the exams as a private candidate. If you take the previous syllabus exam (I think you have the option to do it?), then no changes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the changes, off hand as I remember,</p>
              <p>(i) removal of intersection between 3 planes</p>
              <p>(ii) removal of complex numbers loci </p>
              <p>(iii) removal of poisson distribution (shifted to F Maths)</p>
