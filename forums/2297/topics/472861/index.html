              <p>Hi all! I am a sec 3 student and it's currently I've been through more than half the year. That means through ca1, common test 1 and I don't know what else. I don't keep good track of exams. However, though it wasn't my first choice, I was assigned to the best class of sec 3 when I was in sec 2 last year. At first I was elated and was like "Wow! I'm been chosen as one of the best even though I didn't pick the best class!". But now I think I'm in trouble. As I had mentioned earlier, I've done a few exams already and... my results stank. Especially in A maths, Chemistry and Physics. My subject combination is as follows: English, Mother Tongue, E Maths, A Maths, Pure Chem, Pure Physics, Pure Bio, Social Studies and Elective History. My problems are with A Math, Chemistry, Physics and Mother Tongue.</p>
              <p>In A maths, I can't catch up with homework or understand the load of information taught everyday. I do not understand Power Graphs (memory work is not for me) and when I do understand something, I can't solve homework questions because they are mixed with some earlier concepts that I couldn't have have utterly no time to study by myself (not with my extended curriculum hours. And of course I need to rest in the weekends or what? Die from stress?) I even have to give up on homework just to keep from having to sleep at 1:30 am (has happened before).</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Physics. Formulae. Memorise. Memorise the physics formulae. Something I cannot do. My tiny brain has no room for atmospheric pressure and its buddies. I truly have lost all my interest in physics. Back in Primary school, we were told that liquids could not be compressed. Turns out it can. That was it. I've had it. The subject is not for me. For eight years of my life from P1 to Sec 2, with an solid A for science these eight years, I've thought that liquids could be compressed. What other lies and damned assumptions are they going to throw at me? One of the most dissapointing subjects I had ever seen. It is truly for someone with interest. Something in don't have. I don't have dreams to be the next Einstein (I love his work, but knowing he did great things is enough for me).</span></p>
              <p>Chemistry was the first break in my straight A's in science. I have no idea what's so special about ammonium nor do I think I need to know, as I don't intend to be chemist. I have nothing against people who like chemistry, A maths and physics but the work involved centers around a "Solve the questions but according to how we like it." logic. I guess what I intend to say through these paragraphs is that I hate and cannot thrive in the systematic education style. Hence, I have a problem I cannot solve due to being in the best class, where there is no time for family, relaxation or fun and where there is eight hours of school on three out of five school days each week. And now our previously short Fridays have been extended for more physics and chemistry, which I really need a break from.</p>
              <p>My mother tongue has been  an issue since kindergarten, and I made it into the best class without it, so i'm not scared of it.</p>
              <p>I have given up on a math, physics and chemistry for my lack of interest and they are unbearable. Now, the big question. What should be my next course of action for the future? Should I not take these problem subjects too seriously? I plan on going to polytechnic (despite many teachers in the past saying that I've got the standard of a JC student) and since I was a kid, I've had an interest in drawing. I am considering taking a digital art course or 2D animation. 3D modeling is interesting to me as well. So, should I really work hard on the problem subjects? Another important detail to note is that, at the end of the year, my family will be moving to Johor but I will still study at a Singapore school, probably one in woodlands. And another big question: Is this a chance to drop my dreaded subjects in favour of art and combined science (bio and one of the other two preferred)?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading my lengthy query. And also thanks in advance for your replies and answers. I'm really troubled by this. And no offense to math and science lovers, but I truly have no interest.</p>

              <p>As a Physics tutor, I will say that Physics is among the most interesting subject of all sciences. lol</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">How I teach physics: </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.etontuition.com/physics-eton-tuition-centre/">http://www.etontuition.com/physics-eton-tuition-centre/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, Physics is a lot on real life stuff. The theories are mainly about real life stuff. </p>
              <p>Example... how are you able to jump standing broad jump with physics. ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you ever planned on taking engineering courses in University, physics is almost a necessity for most of the popular courses.</p>

              <p>Hmmmm, engineering might be a problem for TS since he is weak in both A maths and Physics... Definately not EEE for him...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice to TS is to judge urself in terms of the 3 pure sci. If you are not confident of getting at least 2 good grade out of 3 pure sci, then combi sci is a better choice. U might not want to get stuck with 3 C6 (assuming u pass). better a A or B instead of 3 C6...</p>

              <p>Yeah, I remembered u did EEE, which is why I suggest that it might not be suitable for him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think TS might faint when he needs to calculate delta curcuit or learn abt antenna polarisation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my suggestion is based on more gain than of loss.</p>
              <p>Of couse, it will be good to keep all the A maths and pure science but it is of no use if TS cannot score. In that scenario, infact, it will drag his overall score down (the time could be better used to focus on other subject).</p>
              <p>The impt thing is that TS must decide where his career path lies. Pure sci wont get you into design courses but better grade will. Where as pure phy and A maths definately benefits engineering, while pure chem and pure bio benefits pharmacy studies.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>So, engineering is not for me. Ah, I miss the days when I could play computer games the night before an exam and still get the highest score in science of the class and an A for math. But that was in Primary school.</p>
              <p>But the important thing I need to know now is whether it is possible to change subject combination when I change school at the end of the year, now that I have an idea of what I should choose.</p>
              <p>Thanks guys for your responses and concern.</p>

              <p>Can, I've seen and heard many cases of ppl dropping subjects becoz they cannot cope.</p>
              <p>Infact, some teacher might suggest you to drop subjects if your result after 1 year is bad.</p>
