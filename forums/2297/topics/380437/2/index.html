              <p>ok thanks!<br> <br> urmm another question...<br> <br> 1. In distillation<br> a) where does the water enter and leave the condenser?<br> b) why do we not let it flow int he opposite direction?<br> <br> 2.</p>
              <p>a)Where is the bulb of the thermometer placed?</p>
              <p>b) what temperature does it show?<br> <br> <br> please see if my answer is correct or wrong... and for 1b) i
              totally dont know.<br> <br> 1a) Water enter from the bottom of the condender and leave from the
              top of the condenser.   (is it right to say bottom and
              top of condender? it feels wierd to say that)<br> <br> 1b) i totally dont know<br> <br> 2a) The bulb of the thermometer is placed above the solution being
              distillated and near the entrance of the condenser.<br> <br> 2b) It shows the temperature of the boiliing point of the substance
              in the mixture which has the lowest boiling point, followed by the
              next higher boiling point and continue to the highest boiling point
              of the substance in the mixture.<br> <br> <br> i feel that all my answers sounds wierd. please give me ur model
              answer, and please elaborate and explain more on 1b). thanks!</p>

              <p>1a) Should be fine to say that</p>
              <p>1b) If you let the water in from the top, it will not fill the condensor fully before the water leaves from the bottom. This will not enable adequate cooling as little water will actually reach the entire middle tube which needs to be cooled for condensation to occur.</p>
              <p>2a) Yes you have to place the bulb of the thermometer near the entrance to the condensor as you are measuing the temperature of the gas entering the condenser.</p>
              <p>b) I would write a simpler answer along the lines of it will show the boiling point temperature of each fraction in the mixture depending on how many marks this question is worth.</p>

              <p>I may be wrong too though.</p>
              <p>5)All metal oxides all basic and not all of them are soluble in water except for the common metals, Sodium and Potassium. However, they all dissolve in acid.</p>
              <p>6)All non-metal oxides are acidic but not all of them are soluble in water too. E.g. Silicon dioxide, sand.</p>

              <p>2) Li2O is a base, LiOH is an alkali, thats the only slight difference as 1 is solid 1 is aq.</p>
              <p>3) All basic oxides form basic hydroxides. However do not that not all metal oxides are basic.</p>
              <p>4) The trend should be similar. However do note that insoluble is a relative term and almost all salts might be soluble to a very very small degree and the series gor eg F to I will vary very slightly in their solubility but nothing too major generally to change the general pattern.</p>
              <p>5,6) Not all metal and non metal oxides are soluble in water but most acidic
              and basic oxides are. Neutral oxides and amphoteric oxides are mostly
              insoluble.</p>
              <p>To qdtimes2: SiO2 is a neutral oxide not acidic.</p>

              the ions?<br> <br> metal ions, H+, OH-   but since it is metal oxide and NOT
              metal hydroxide, the ions O2-    &lt;---- is there
              such thing?<br> <br> or issit that the metal oxide dissolve in water to from metal
              hydroxide and then the ions become H+ metal ions and OH-</p>

              <p>Basic oxides (not all metal oxides) that dissolves in water will all form their respective hydroxides.</p>

              <p>yes i know.. thanks for reminding... just that i am very insecure about the acidic oxide, and basic oxide... i was actually quite confidence until my teacher contradict herself and made me confused...  thanks a lot :)</p>

              <p>OK my mistake for that. Assumed SiO2 is neutral cos it doesn't react under general conditions but a check on it and it does react under more extreme conditions.</p>

              <p>interesting.. one more interesting thing, ice comes in 8 forms.. only one form of ice is less dense than water.. (Ice I)  and is the ice which we normally use.. cool!  and ice can melt at 100 degree celcius..<br><br>water is so mysterious.. kk i go continue study le haha!</p>
