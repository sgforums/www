              <p>Seriously, what's wrong with going to ITE?</p>
              <p>From what I know, some of the best poly students came from ITE. A longer route may well be better for you in the long run.</p>
              <p>Besides, a private diploma may not be as well-recognized as a poly diploma.</p>
              <p>You may also want to consider retaking your O Levels as a private candidate.</p>

              <p>But for ITE if you can't make it to poly with NITEC is just a waste of time though.</p>
              <p>I'd rather go poly with just a nitec cert rather than to waste my time in Hnitec. Furthermore you can't switch courses which means once you are in engineering you can't switch to business. </p>

Once u take private diploma, u may wanna consider their degree course. Some of the degree course also can be completed in a year time. U can check the duration at moe website. I dun tink u shuld waste time on private diploma because u now still have time actually, but still depends on u because the duration is not long and they might not teach u something.

              <p>Many private diplomas have no market value at all ie employers will not pay you a few hundred dollars more compared to "O" level holders, and they will not give you higher position due to your private diploma over the "O" level holders.</p>
              <p>This is especially so when  the diplomas are given by the pte schools themselves ie the diplomas are not awarded by some international organsiations or foreign universities.</p>
              <p>Diplomas that are awarded by international organisations eg LCCI, ACCA (CAT) do indeed get higher pay and recognised by th employers.</p>
              <p>So, you will need to check the private diplomas whether they are really recognised by the employers and you MUST NOT simply believe the pte schools that all their private diplomas are recognised by the employers and that their schools are edu-trusted by the CPE and so all their pte diplomas are recognised by the employers. In fact, many employers in both the private and government sectors DO NOT recognise these private diplomas.</p>

              <p>Let us look at this from another point of view. </p>
              <p>It is a possibility for you to take up a private diploma, but do you have any idea what you want to study? It will become pointless if you take up some random diploma just for the sake of getting a diploma.</p>
              <p>Studying for an extra year or two is never a waste. Unless you have been playing the entire time away, the extra time spent will actually equate to more experience, be it academic or in other areas. There are guys who take a much longer route than others in their studies, and enter local unis only in their mid 20s. However, they have in mind what they want to do in their life, and how they want to get it done.</p>
              <p>What I will advise is for you to think first about what you want to do and where you want to go, rather than entering ITE or taking up a random private diploma just because this seems like the flow everyone is following.</p>

              <p>Face the fact. If you cannot study means that you cannot study. Getting an E8 for your English language means that you cannot even read, write and speak properly. </p>
              <p>Even if you go to poly even, you will fail for your failure in communication for EVERY subject that you take. </p>
              <p>GO ITE blah. And take you time to brush up your English.</p>

              <p>first, know what you can and cannot do.........be realistic and lay before your eyes the various feasible options....whether to take the private diploma....but if your dreams have what ITE has to offer....u should follow.....</p>
              <p>hit straight to what you really want to do for your career and life.....</p>
              <p>academic qualification is not an end-all fate, though essential to how employers and public alike perceive......stay close to your vision and what u really want to do......</p>
              <p>there is still a path to success...... </p>
              <p>there was this guy who failed exams after exams and do nothing but fondle with mechanical stuffs...his friends despised and ridiculed him...his passion persisted and whenever he wanted to improve on some mechanical stuffs which there were no known solutions in the market...he would take that specific course....and innovate till a solution is found.....this was the story of his revolutionary use of piston rings for cars..</p>
              <p>His name is Soichiro Honda.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>i will say, go for a private diploma. no point wasting 2 yrs in ite only to spend another 3 years for a diploma. thats 5 yrs to get a diploma, when you can get a private dip in 1-2 yrs.</p>
              <p>BUT, make sure you do your reseach thoroughly before signing up for any of the courses.</p>
              <p>many of the diploma courses are awarded by local private schools themselves, or by some unheard of school overseas. these certs will definitely not be recognised by anyone.</p>
              <p>look for courses which offers certs from reputable schools, which are valid for application for further studies outside of the private school you got the cert from.</p>
              <p>e.g. MDIS offers diploma courses which only MDIS recognises. you can use the mdis dip to apply for mdis degree course, but no one else outside of mdis recognise the cert.</p>
              <p>another rule of the thumb. if you never heard of the school, that means your future employer would also have not heard of it. therefore, its a useless cert.</p>
              <p>go for courses which awards certs issued by wellknown schools such as RMIT, murdoch, university of glasgow, university of london etc. they carry more weight outside.</p>
