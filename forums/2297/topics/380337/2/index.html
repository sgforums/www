              <p><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70">
              </span></span></span></p><p class="style99">Martin Needler's article on "Politics and 
                  National Character: the Case of Mexico" (1971) is perfectly correct as far as it 
                  goes, but it must be pointed out that the personality traits which he identifies 
                  as Mexican are products of a considerably wider and much older cultural entity. 
                  Mexico is a peripheral and very distinctive example of the Latin American 
                  cultural area which is itself a peripheral and somewhat distinctive example of 
                  the Mediterranean cultural area.</p>
              <p class="style99">Some time ago I identified the whole cultural 
                  area and the personality structure it tended to produce as aspects of "the 
                  Pakistani-Peruvian Axis" (1966:1112-1122, reprinted as 1968:452-463). If I am 
                  correct in this, Needler is parochial in attributing "Mexican national 
                  character" to a combination of "the Indian's fatalism and the proud 
                  self-assertion of the Spaniard" (Needler 1971:757).</p>
              <p class="style99">A broader view of this subject would show that Mexico is a peripheral 
                  example of the "Pakistani-Peruvian cultural area" and that Mexican national 
                  character is merely a local variant of the personality structure of this larger 
                  area. That is why Silverman's picture of south Italian personality is so similar 
                  to Needler's idea of Mexican character (Silverman 1968).</p>
              <p class="style99">This Mediterranean personality type is marked by various traits mentioned 
                  by Needler: low self-esteem, fatalism, defeatism, distrust of all persons 
                  outside a narrow kin group, pessimism, preoccupation with death, self-assertion, 
                  and machismo.</p>
              <p class="style99">These traits, however, should be associated in clusters and 
                  correlated with other cultural manifestations such as: (1) low respect for 
                  manual work, especially for agricultural work; (2) higher esteem for urban 
                  residence than for rural living, associated with neglect of the countryside, 
                  damage to natural vegetation, and much cruelty to animals, especially to 
                  domestic animals; (3) emphasis on honor, both personal and family, as a chief 
                  aim of life; (4) dietary customs which mix protein and vegetables within a nest 
                  or container of starch, on the same plate and in the same mouthful, unlike the 
                  core of Western civilization, which tends to segregate these three kinds of 
                  food, on the same plate or even into separate dishes. </p>
              <p class="style99">The personality traits of 
                  this larger area tend to cluster about two points:</p>
              <p class="style99">(1) The restriction of 
                  personal trust and loyalty within the kinship group (usually the extended or 
                  nuclear family) with a consequent inability to offer loyalty, trust, or personal 
                  identification to residential groups (villages, neighborhoods, parishes), 
                  voluntary associations, religious beliefs, or the secular state, resulting in 
                  large-scale lack of "public spirit," combined with "corruption," and paralysis 
                  of these other kinds of associations.</p>
              <p class="style99">(2) The combination of powerful 
                  patriarchal social tendencies with female inferiority (except as a mechanism for 
                  producing sons) leads to many psychological ambiguities: strong emphasis on 
                  female premarital virginity (both as a symbol of family honor and as an economic 
                  good), segregation of the sexes in social life, fear of women as a threat men's 
                  virility (witches and belief in "the evil eye"), the need to demonstrate male 
                  virility by social "touchiness" and other behavior, including fantasies of 
                  demonstrations of male dominance over bulls, other men, and unattached women.</p>
              <p class="style99">In the last generation or two, we have had numerous local studies of the 
                  culture-and-personality type dealing with portions of this wide area 
                  (Pitt-Rivers and Kenny on Spain; Banfield, Moss, Cancian, Silverman, and others 
                  on Italy; Campbell, Kavadias, Kanelli. and others on Greece; and numerous 
                  studies of the Near East or North Africa). Many of these consider the 
                  personality types they observe as consequences of local conditions of economic, 
                  national, religious, or historic origin.</p>
              <p class="style99">A few have seen the wider range of what 
                  they observe. Thus Balikci (1966:164) wrote, "Behind obvious cultural 
                  differences, many Mediterranean societies share certain basic cultural 
                  patterns... [with] basic cross-cultural similarities in regard to sex behavior, 
                  certain family roles, the position of the family in society, and the dichotomy 
                  of kinsmen and strangers."</p>
              <p class="style99">Opler (1970:866) recognizes both the areal spread and 
                  the deep historical roots of these traits when he writes, "The Southern Italian 
                  family is in great measure understood if one considers it as a peasant society, 
                  as a circum-Mediterranean type, as one influenced by Roman history or even by 
                  the earlier pagan Classic Greek, or later Hellenistic traditions."</p>
              <p class="style99">What I wish to emphasize is that this personality structure is 
                  geographically wider than the Mediterranean, since it extends to Latin America, 
                  and is the consequence of historical experience going back even earlier than the 
                  ancient Greeks. There are works (Peristiany 1966) which see some of the 
                  geographic range, but from both points of view, the most suggestive work is 
                  Raphael Patai's Golden River to Golden Road (1962), whose original title (now 
                  abandoned in a 1971 edition) shows that his attention extends from Rio de Oro to 
                  Samarkand.</p>
              <p class="style99">The Pakistani-Peruvian axis does not now demark the area of a 
                  functioning society or civilization. This is one of the chief keys to its 
                  personality types. It is now largely an area of debris of traits and peoples 
                  surviving from the wreckage of deceased civilizations.</p>
              <p class="style99">The existing traits have 
                  historical origins covering thousands of years.</p>
              <p class="style99">For example, the diet, sexual 
                  symbolism of bull and "eye," architecture, and other traits come from the 
                  archaic cultures before 600 B.C., including Minoan Crete; the urbanism and low 
                  esteem for manual labor derive from Classical Mediterranean society; while the 
                  emphasis on honor, female inferiority, and kinship groups flow from pastoral 
                  invaders, both from the northern grasslands (Indo-European) and the southern 
                  grasslands (Semites).</p>
              <p class="style99">Other traits, such as fatalism, distrust of strangers, cynicism toward the 
                  state or the local community, come from the difficulties of farming in the 
                  Mediterranean environment or from Mediterranean history.</p>
              <p class="style99">Historically the 
                  Mediterranean has passed through three distinct experiences: (1) as a frontier 
                  area of cultural diffusion from Western Asia during the Archaic period (4500-600 
                  B.C.); (2) as the central backbone of Mediterranean civilization in the 
                  Classical period (600 B.C.-A.D. 600), and (3) as a boundary conflict area 
                  between the three post-Classical civilizations (Byzantine, Western, and Islamic) 
                  since A.D. 600.</p>
              <p class="style99">The shift from the second to the third of these was so 
                  disruptive of community life in the area from the Golden River to the Golden 
                  Road that its problems have not been solved since, especially in view of the 
                  social and ethical failures of the two post-Classical religions, Christianity 
                  and Islam, on either side of the line from Tangier to Batum.</p>
              <p class="style99">These failures of 
                  religion, whose consequences were clearly seen by Christ and Mohomet, made it 
                  impossible to create any religious, territorial, or social community, and forced 
                  living patterns back toward the "amoral familism" of the extended family. In 
                  extreme cases this broke down further to amoral nuclear familism or even to 
                  amoral individualism.</p>
              <p class="style99">This basic outlook and personality type was given a 
                  distinctive twist in the Iberian peninsula, from Saracen and anti-lslamic 
                  influences. The export of this distinctive type to America and the changes made 
                  in it by the shattering of American Indian cultures gives us the distinctive 
                  Latin American personality patterns which Needler (1971) sees as "Mexican 
                  national character."</p>
              <p class="style99">These patterns have been modified in various circumstances 
                  by the "culture of poverty ," by modem industrialism and nationalism, by various 
                  nineteenth century ideologies such as Marxism, and by other influences, but the 
                  basic Pakistani-Peruvian outlook is still identifiable. </p>
              <p class="style99">What is distinctly 
                  Mexican, and potentially revolutionary, is the new political ideology which 
                  Needler reports thus: "the cynicism and alienation of Mexican respondents. . . 
                  did not extend to two elements of the political system: the president himself 
                  and the idea of the Mexican Revolution" (1971:760).</p>
              <p class="style99">Any discussion of Mexican 
                  national character should recognize the revolutionary implications of these 
                  exceptions and the remote sources of the other aspects of Mexican personality.</p>
              <p class="style99">Silverman, who has a good appreciation of this Pakistani-Peruvian cultural 
                  area, has also glimpsed the nature of its northern boundary. This boundary, 
                  which roughly follows the lines of the Highland Zone of the Old World, is marked 
                  by the southern limits of the archaic peasant cultures, in which rural life was 
                  valued higher than urbanism, the land was loved (as a female entity), pride in 
                  skillful tillage was evident, fertility was prized over virility, and the cow 
                  was more valuable than the bull (whose usefulness was increased by castration).</p>
              <p class="style99">In this peasant culture the southern concept of honor was non-existent, female 
                  virginity or chastity were considered unnatural, pre-marital sexual relations 
                  were practiced (often condoned by a betrothal ceremony), and marriage often 
                  followed pregnancy, rather than preceding coition as in the south.</p>
              <p class="style99">This peasant 
                  culture accepted a female centered house-hold and tended to revere local, 
                  semi-pagan, female saints (or Mary seen as a Mother rather than as a Virgin) 
                  instead of the rather war-like male saints popular farther south. Above all, in 
                  the north the basic social units were territorial (villages or parishes), not 
                  kinship groups, and functioned as communities.</p>
              <p class="style99">Studies of these distinctions are frustrated today by academic 
                  specialization, both areal and chronological, so that students attribute cause 
                  to whatever social feature strikes them as significant. This includes ethos (Banfield 
                  1958), agricultural organization (Silverman 1968), transhumance pastoralism 
                  (Campbell 1964), Bedouin Arabism (Carmichael 1967), urbanism (Pitkin 
                  1963:123.129), social hopelessness (Cancian 1961), and many others.</p>
              <p class="style99">A comparison 
                  of the similarities of values and personality between a rural pastoral people 
                  like the Saracatsan (Campbell 1964) and a modern, professional, urban Greek 
                  family (Kanelli 1963) will show the need to seek explanation on a wider and 
                  deeper areal and historical foundation.</p>
              <p class="style99">This foundation must be a historical-cultural framework similar to that 
                  used in historical geology, so that local outcroppings of earlier cultural 
                  strata can be identified and coordinated.</p>
              <p class="style99">I gave a brief outline of such a 
                  framework for the Old World in 1961, but other historians have rather scorned 
                  any efforts at establishing a matrix of macro-history.</p>
              <p class="style99">Feeble efforts are now 
                  being made to remedy this lack in other disciplines, including anthropology and 
                  sociology, but these attempts will find almost insurmountable difficulties so 
                  long as historians do not do their part of the task.</p>
