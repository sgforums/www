              <p>Three generations ago the bourgeois wife rarely
              became aware of her frustrations. She was largely confined to her home,
              was kept too busy with children and housework to find much time for
              meditation on her situation or for comparison with other wives or the
              outside world generally. Brought up in a male-dominated family, she was
              prepared to accept a similar situation in her own life. This means that
              her outside contacts and her general picture of the world came to her
              through the screen of her husband's vision of these things.</p>
              <p>     The decrease in the number of children in
              middle-class families and the spread of labor-saving devices, from
              vacuum cleaners to frozen foods, gave the bourgeois wife increasing
              leisure in the 1920's and 1930'5. Enterprising editors like Edwin Bok
              filled that leisure with new slick women's magazines (like the <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>).
              Popular novels and, to a lesser extent, the early movies, dramatic
              matinees, and spreading women's clubs allowed women to build up a
              vision of a fantasy world of romantic love and carefree, middle-class
              housewives with dazzling homes and well-behaved and well-scrubbed
              children. By 1925 the average bourgeois housewife was becoming
              increasingly frustrated because her own life was not that pictured in
              the women's magazines. Her increasing leisure gave her time to think
              about it, and her more frequent contact with other wives encouraged her
              to raise her voice in criticism of her husband whose financial
              inability to provide her with the life she came to regard as her due
              seemed to her to justify her desire to nag him onward to greater effort
              in pursuit of money. To him this became nagging; to her it was only an
              occasional reminder of the expectations under which she had entered
              upon the marriage relationship.</p>
              <p>     While this was going on, the outside world was
              also changing. Women became "emancipated" as a consequence of World War
              I, with considerable urging onward from the women's magazines. Shorter
              skirts and shorter hair became symbols of this process, but even more
              significant was the appearance in the outside world of a great increase
              in the number of jobs that could be done best, or only, by women. As
              part of this process, there took place considerable changes in
              bourgeois morality, the ending of chaperonage, greater freedom between
              the sexes, and the acceptance of divorce as morally possible in
              bourgeois life (a custom that came in from the stage and cinema).</p>
              <p>     As part of this whole process, there occurred a
              dramatic event of great social significance. This was the reversal in
              longevity expectations of men and women in adult life. A century ago
              (to be sure, in a largely rural context), a twenty-year-old man could
              expect to live longer than a twenty-year-old wife. In fact, such a man
              might well bury two or three wives, usually from the mortality
              associated with childbirth or other female problems. Today, a
              twenty-year-old man has little expectation of living as long as a
              twenty-year-old woman. To make matters worse, a twenty-year-old woman a
              century ago married a man considerably older than herself, at least in
              the middle classes, simply because future preference required that a
              man be established economically before he began to raise a family.</p>
              <p>     Today, from a series of causes, such as the
              extension of the female expectation of life faster than the male
              expectation, the increased practice of birth control, coeducation
              (which brings the sexes into contact at the same age), weakening of
              future preference and of the middle-class outlook generally, which
              leads to marriages by couples of about the same age, husbands now
              generally die before their wives. Recognition of this, the increased
              independence of women, adaptation to taxes and other legal nuisances,
              has given rise to joint financial accounts, to property being put in
              the wife's name, and to greatly increased insurance benefits for wives.
              Gradually the wealth of the country became female-owned, even if still
              largely male-controlled.</p>
              <p>     But this had subtle results; it made women more
              independent and more outspoken. Bourgeois men gradually came to live
              under a regime of persistent nagging to become "better providers." To
              many men, work became a refuge and a relief from domestic revelations
              of the inadequacy of their performance as economic achievers. This
              growth of overwork, of constant tension, of frustration of emotional
              life and of leisure began to make more and more men increasingly
              willing to accept death as the only method of achieving rest. Bourgeois
              men literally began to kill themselves, by unconscious psychic suicide,
              from overwork, neurotic overindulgence in alcohol, smoking, work, and
              violent leisure, and the middle class slowly increased its proportion
              of materially endowed widows.</p>
              <p>     One notable change in this whole process was a
              shift, over the past century, from the male-dominated family to a
              female-dominated family. The locality in which the young couple set up
              their home had an increasing tendency to be matrilocal rather than
              patrilocal. In increasing numbers of cases, where the young couple
              married before the groom's educational process was finished, they even
              lived with her family (but very rarely with his family). Increasingly
              part of the burden of housework was shifted to the husband: washing
              dishes, buying groceries, even tending the children. In 1840 a child
              could cry at night and would invariably be tended by its mother, while
              the father slept peacefully on, totally unaware of what was going on.
              By 1960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely as not
              that the mother would hear nothing while the father took over the
              necessary activities. If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's
              retort was pointed: "I take care of baby all day; I don't see why he
              can't take care of it at night!".</p>
              <p>     Closely related to this confusion, or even
              reversal, of the social roles of the sexes was decreasing sexual
              differentiation in child-rearing practices. As recently as the 1920's
              girl babies were reared differently from boys. They were dressed
              differently, treated differently, permitted to do different things, and
              admonished about different dangers. By 1960, children, regardless of
              sex, were all being brought up the same. Indeed, with short cropped
              hair and play-suits on both, it became impossible to be sure which was
              which. This led to a decrease in the personality differences of men and
              women, with males becoming more submissive and females more aggressive.</p>
              <p>     This tendency was accelerated by new techniques of
              education, especially in the first twelve years of life. The
              neurological maturation of girls was faster shall that of boys,
              especially in regard to coordination, such as in feeding oneself,
              talking, dressing oneself, toilet-training, learning to read, and
              general adjustment to school. The shift from home to school in the
              early grades was adjusted to by girls more easily than by boys, partly
              because girls were more self-assured and gregarious. By the age of ten
              or twelve, girls were developed physically, neurologically,
              emotionally, and socially about two years in advance of boys. All this
              tended to make boys less self-assured, indecisive, weak, and dependent.
              The steady increase in the percentage of women teachers in the lower
              grades worked in the same direction, since women teachers favored girls
              and praised those attitudes and techniques that were more natural to
              girls. New methods, such as the whole-word method of teaching reading
              or the use of true-and-false or multiple-choice examinations, were also
              better adapted to female than to masculine talents. Less and less
              emphasis was placed on critical judgment, while more and more was
              placed on intuitive or subjective decisions. In this environment girls
              did better, and boys felt inferior or decided that school was a place
              for girls and not for boys. The growing aggressiveness of girls pushed
              these hesitant boys aside and intensified the problem. As consequences
              of this, boys had twice as many "non-readers" as girls, several times
              as many stutterers, and many times as many teen-age bed-wetters.</p>
              <p>     While the outside world was decreasing its
              differential treatment of children on a sexual basis by treating boys
              and girls more and more alike (and that treatment was better adapted to
              girls than to boys) within the middle-class home, the growing emotional
              frustrations of the mother were leading to an increasing distinction on
              a sexual basis in her emotional treatment of her children.</p>
              <p>     The earliest feeling of sensual reassurance and
              comfort any child experiences is against the body of its mother. To a
              boy baby this is a heterosexual relationship, while to the girl it is a
              relationship with the same sex. In most cases the little girl avoids
              any undesirable persistence of this homosexual tendency by shifting her
              admiration and attention to some available male, usually her father.
              Thus by the age of six or eight, a daughter has become "Daddy's girl,"
              awaiting his return from work to communicate the news of the day,
              getting his slippers and newspaper, and hoping that he will read her a
              story or share her viewing of a favorite television program before she
              must go to bed. By the age of twelve, in a normal girl, this interest
              in male creatures has begun to shift to some boy in her class at
              school. With a boy baby the transference is later and less gradual. The
              undesirable aspects of his love for his mother are avoided by the
              powerful social pressures of the incest taboo, but this merely means
              that the sexual element in his concern for the opposite sex is
              suppressed and is undeveloped. Thus there is a natural, we might almost
              say biological, tendency in our society for the sexual development of
              the boy to be delayed and for the girl to be free from this retarding
              influence.</p>

              <p>  We have said that the culture of a civilization is
              created in its core area originally and moves outward into peripheral
              areas which thus become part of the civilization. This movement of
              cultural elements is called "diffusion" by students of the subject. It
              is noteworthy that material elements of a culture, such as tools,
              weapons, vehicles, and such, diffuse more readily and thus more rapidly
              than do the nonmaterial elements such as ideas, art forms, religious
              outlook, or patterns of social behavior. For this reason the peripheral
              portions of a civilization (such as Assyria in Mesopotamian
              Civilization, Rome or Spain in Classical Civilization, and the United
              States or Australia in Western Civilization) tend to have a somewhat
              cruder and more material culture than the core area of the same
              civilization.</p>
              <p>     Material elements of a culture also diffuse beyond
              the boundaries of a civilization into other societies, and do so much
              more readily than the nonmaterial elements of the culture. For this
              reason the nonmaterial and spiritual elements of a culture are what
              give it its distinctive character rather than its tools and weapons
              which can be so easily exported to entirely different societies. Thus,
              the distinctive character of Western Civilization rests on its
              Christian heritage, its scientific outlook, its humanitarian elements,
              and its distinctive point of view in regard to the rights of the
              individual and respect for women rather than in such material things as
              firearms, tractors, plumbing fixtures, or skyscrapers, all of which are
              exportable commodities.</p>
              <p>     The export of material elements in a culture,
              across its peripheral areas and beyond, to the peoples of totally
              different societies has strange results. As elements of material
              culture move from core to periphery inside a civilization, they tend,
              in the long run, to strengthen the periphery at the expense of the core
              because the core is more hampered in the use of material innovations by
              the strength of past vested interests and because the core devotes a
              much greater part of its wealth and energy to nonmaterial culture.
              Thus, such aspects of the Industrial Revolution as automobiles and
              radios are European rather than American inventions, but have been
              developed and utilized to a far greater extent in America because this
              area was not hampered in their use by surviving elements of feudalism,
              of church domination, of rigid class distinctions (for example, in
              education), or by widespread attention to music, poetry, art, or
              religion such as we find in Europe. A similar contrast can be seen in
              Classical Civilization between Greek and Roman or in Mesopotamian
              Civilization between Sumerian and Assyrian or in Mayan Civilization
              between Mayan and Aztec.</p>
              <p>     The diffusion of culture elements beyond the
              boundaries of one society into the culture of another society presents
              quite a different case. The boundaries between societies present
              relatively little hindrance to the diffusion of material elements, and
              relatively greater hindrance to the diffusion of nonmaterial elements.
              Indeed, it is this fact which determines the boundary of the society,
              for, if the nonmaterial elements also diffused, the new area into which
              they flowed would be a peripheral portion of the old society rather
              than a part of a quite different society.</p>
              <p>     The diffusion of material elements from one
              society to another has a complex effect on the importing society. In
              the short run it is usually benefitted by the importation, but in the
              long run it is frequently disorganized and weakened. When white men
              first came to North America, material elements from Western
              Civilization spread rapidly among the different Indian tribes. The
              Plains Indians, for example, were weak and impoverished before 1543,
              but in that year the horse began to diffuse northward from the
              Spaniards in Mexico. Within a century the Plains Indians were raised to
              a much higher standard of living (because of ability to hunt buffalo
              from horseback) and were immensely strengthened in their ability to
              resist Americans coming westward across the continent. In the meantime,
              the trans-Appalachian Indians who had been very powerful in the
              sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries began to receive firearms,
              steel traps, measles, and eventually whiskey from the French and later
              the English by way of the St. Lawrence. These greatly weakened the
              woods Indians of the trans-Appalachian area and ultimately weakened the
              Plains Indians of the trans-Mississippi area, because measles and
              whiskey were devastating and demoralizing and because the use of traps
              and guns by certain tribes made them dependent on whites for supplies
              at the same time that they allowed them to put great physical pressure
              on the more remote tribes which had not yet received guns or traps. Any
              united front of reds against whites was impossible, and the Indians
              were disrupted, demoralized, and destroyed. In general, importation of
              an element of material culture from one society to another is helpful
              to the importing society in the long run only if it is (<em>a</em>) productive, (<em>b</em>) can be made within the society itself, and (<em>c</em>)
              can be fitted into the nonmaterial culture of the importing society
              without demoralizing it. The destructive impact of Western Civilization
              upon so many other societies rests on its ability to demoralize their
              ideological and spiritual culture as much as its ability to destroy
              them in a material sense with firearms.</p>
              <p>     When one society is destroyed by the impact of
              another society, the people are left in a debris of cultural elements
              derived from their own shattered culture as well as from the invading
              culture. These elements generally provide the instruments for
              fulfilling the material needs of these people, but they cannot be
              organized into a functioning society because of the lack of an ideology
              and spiritual cohesive. Such people either perish or are incorporated
              as individuals and small groups into some other culture, whose ideology
              they adopt for themselves and, above all, for their children. In some
              cases, however, the people left with the debris of a shattered culture
              are able to reintegrate the cultural elements into a new society and a
              new culture. They are able to do this because they obtain a new
              nonmaterial culture and thus a new ideology and morale which serve as a
              cohesive for the scattered elements of past culture they have at hand.
              Such a new ideology may be imported or may be indigenous, but in either
              case it becomes sufficiently integrated with the necessary elements of
              material culture to form a functioning whole and thus a new society. It
              is by some such process as this that all new societies, and thus all
              new civilizations, have been born. In this way, Classical Civilization
              was born from the wreckage of Cretan Civilization in the period 1150
              B.C.ï¿½ B.C., and Western Civilization was born from the wreckage of
              Classical Civilization in the period A.D. 350ï¿½. It is possible that new
              civilizations may be born in the debris from the civilizations wrecked
              by Western Civilization on the fringes of Asia. In this wreckage is
              debris from Islamic, Hindu, Chinese, and Japanese civilizations. lt
              would appear at the present time that new civilizations may be in the
              throes of birth in Japan, possibly in China, less likely in India, and
              dubiously in Turkey or Indonesia. The birth of a powerful civilization
              at any or several of these points would be of primary significance in
              world history, since it would serve as a counterbalance to the
              expansion of Soviet Civilization on the land mass of Eurasia.</p>
              <p>     Turning from a hypothetical future to a historical
              past, we can trace the diffusion of cultural elements within Western
              Civilization from its core area across peripheral areas and outward to
              other societies. Some of these elements are sufficiently important to
              command a more detailed examination.</p>
