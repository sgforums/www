              Hi!
              I'm thinking of running for student council in JC (which starts in a week) and I'd like to ask some stuff about it. Please do note that I'm talking about being a member of it, not the president :)!
              
              1. How is one elected to the student council?
              Is it like election of prefects in secondary school?
              (In my school: nomination by friends-teachers' approval-interview-election)
              I even heard that you simply volunteer to get into the student council in some schools. Is this true?
              
              2. If so, when does it take place? I mean people need time to get to know each other right, so does nomination start around... End of Feb? March?
              
              3. Normally, how many people are elected into the student council each year?
              Is competition tough?
              
              4. Advice?
              
              To provide some bits about myself.. I'm not a very outgoing person, but not seriously timid either, I speak up when the need arises. I'm not popular amongst everyone but I don't make enemies and am friendly to anyone (uh... don't get me wrong!) I have to admit I'm not good in public speaking- I mean literally making a speech in front of people- but I'm not scared of asking question in class or something like that. I just suck at speeches etc.
              So that's basically what I'm like. I was class rep for 3 years in primary school but in secondary school, I've never taken any leadership positions except in CCA.
              
              I like to live a quiet life. But recently I realized that if I go on like this I won't be very successful in life. So I'm now determined to be a more outspoken person that stands out.
              Running for student council is what I think will help me start out.
              
              Since I have no idea what to expect, I'm here asking for some info and advice!
              Thanks for reading and I hope I get some replies :)

              Well your advice should still apply to me but I've never joined sports CCA before.
              I've always joined the orchestra which the school I'm going to doesn't have.
              So I'm planning to join the interact club... Sounds cheem but I think it'll be a good experience.

              I was the secretary!
              I didn't do much as the secretary, but not that the position did require me too.
              But I actively helped out in CCA activities, events etc.

              You have a point, but I've never played any sports before.
              I think it's a bit late to start now. Besides sports is a lot of competition and starting now will surely not let me participate in competitions right? I've seen my friend be in a sports CCA in secondary school for 4 years and not having any achievement cause she wasn't good enough. Of course I will be able to enjoy myself just as it is if I do join a sports CCA, but I think I have to think more pragmatically.. I would rather join a club and gain experience.
              Thanks for the advice though :)!

              <p>Umm Let me advice you..... something out of the topic.</p>
              <p>You are now in a very new environment. You mentioned you want to be successful. The only thing that I can advice is... "<em>Act successful, and you will become successful</em>".. "<em>How?</em>" will come later. People do not know you, and you do not know other people. So you are like a blank piece of paper. <em>How</em> do you want to write your fate on that piece of paper is up to yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not sure which JC you are from, but from what I heard... most elections are based on your profile in Secondary School i.e. leadership positions, personal attributes, characteristics, peer recommendations, teacher recommendations, social contributions, interpersonal skills, testimonials, etc.. so the "factors" is practically everything.</p>
              <p>Some elections ar... is based on power influences. You're still young, you may not know this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I were to ask you to write a 500 word essay on why should I elect you to be the member, can you write it for me?</p>

              <p>Hi Oceantigger</p>
              <p>Students Council like any other CCA, is simply a good field to learn how to manage projects, work in a team and etc. But cos councillors are the ones who usually organise the orientation for newbies, they also tend to 'stand out' more. Why don't you talk to ex council members to find out more about your JC's election process?</p>
              <p>Most importantly, don't take it TOO seriously like a 'mission' and remember that whether you are running for it, or running in it - just have fun la!</p>

              <p><br>I wouldn't have a high chance if it was based on my profile from secondary school life :( but well, there must always be a way if I really want to do something.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah... I'm now in a new environment and it means I'm a (almost) blank sheet of paper. It all depends on how I do things from now on, thanks for reminding me :)</p>
              <p>Hm. You are asking that just to see if I myself have a clear idea why I want to be a student councillor and what I could do as one, or more literally? In the former case, I think so. I might have to squeeze ideas out from my brain but I could.</p>
              <p>I forgot to add something. I'm a foreigner, and I meant 'successful' as.. em. okay I don't know how to explain. I just want to say that some things work a little differently for me.. yeah. (and my English isn't perfect so pardon me for weird expressions or misinterpretation)</p>
              <p>I've lived here long enough, but I still don't know how some things work in Singapore and Singapore's schools. That's why I'm asking for info and advice here :)</p>
              <p>Why I want to be a student councillor is mainly because I want to change myself for the better. But I also do want to contribute to the school I'll be studying in for the next 2 years. Obviously I couldn't mention the first reason as the main one in an interview or an essay to be a student councillor.. but that's the truth. So if I were to write such essay, I'd have to exaggerate things a little. Then again, I believe I won't be the only one to do that.</p>

              <p>Hi Oceantigger</p>
              <p>Students Council like any other CCA, is simply a good field to learn how to manage projects, work in a team and etc. But cos councillors are the ones who usually organise the orientation for newbies, they also tend to 'stand out' more. Why don't you talk to ex council members to find out more about your JC's election process?</p>
              <p>Most importantly, don't take it TOO seriously like a 'mission' and remember that whether you are running for it, or running in it - just have fun la!</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the advice, I'll ask the seniors when school starts.</p>
              <p>Well... it's quite important to me, but you're right.</p>
