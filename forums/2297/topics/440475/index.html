              <p>When 0.10 cm3 of J is added to sodium metal, hydrogen gas is evolved.</p>
              <p>CxHyOH + Na &lt;-----&gt; CxHyO-Na+ + (1/2) H2</p>
              <p>No. of moles of hydrogen gas = 10.9 / 24000 = 4.542 x 10-4 mol</p>
              <p>No. of moles of alcohol J = 2 x no. of moles of hydrogen = 9.084 x 10-4 mol</p>
              <p>When NaOH is added to J, the carbon dioxide gas produced from the combustion is being absorbed.</p>
              <p>No. of moles of CO2 = 10.9 / 24000 = 4.542 x 10-3 mol</p>
              <p>Since all the C in CO2 is produced from combustion of J, we can find the value of x when finding out the ratio of the no. of moles of CO2 produced to that of alcohol J present initially.</p>
              <p>No. of moles of CO2 / No. of moles of J = 4.542 x 10-3 / 9.084 x 10-4 = 5</p>
              <p>Therefore, x = 5</p>
              <p>When J is combusted in an excess of oxygen, the reduction in the volume of gas is due to the consumption of oxygen to produce water. This reduction in volume of gas is the difference between the volume of oxygen gas consumed in combustion and the volume of carbon dioxide gas produced.</p>
              <p>Volume of gas being consumed= 54.4 cm3</p>
              <p>No. of moles of gas being consumed = 54.4 / 24000 = 2.267 x 10-3 mol</p>
              <p>Taking the ratio between the no. of moles of gas consumed and the no. of moles of alcohol J,</p>
              <p>Ratio = 2.267 x 10-3 / 9.084 x 10-4 = 2.5 mol</p>
              <p>Since we have determined x = 5 above, we can simplify the equation to,</p>
              <p>C5HyOH (l) + ((19+y)/4) O2 (g) 5CO2 (g) + ((y+1)/2) H2O (l)</p>
              <p>Hence, difference in no. of moles of gases on combustion = ((19+y)/4) – 5 = 2.5</p>
              <p>y = 11</p>
              <p>Alcohol J : C5H11OH</p>
              <p>Observation : J reacts with acidified K2Cr2O7, J has molecular formula C5H11OH<br>Deduction : J is oxidised [1/2]. J is a primary or secondary alcohol.</p>
              <p>Observation : J dehydrated to form K, K reacts with hot KMnO4 to give equimolar mixture of ethanoic acid and propanone.<br>Observation : Oxidative cleavage<br>K has the structure (CH3)2C= and J has the structure CH(CH3)=<br>K is 2-methylbut-2-ene.<br>J is 3-methylbutan-2-ol.</p>

                                <p><br>S-block metals are generally more reactive with water (with the reactivity increasing down the group) and react in a redox reaction with water (the metal being oxidized and water being reduced).</p>
                                <p>D-block metals are generally unreactive with water, as the effective nuclear charge for the valence electrons are stronger (in turn because additional electrons enter into the d orbitals, which are more diffused than s orbitals and hence provide poorer shielding*), and therefore the oxidation potentials for oxidizing d-block metal atoms into their cationic states, are generally not as positive (ie. not as reactive) as that of s-block metals.</p>
                                <p>* Sometimes you need to say "<em>d-orbitals provide poor shielding</em>", while at other times you need to say "<em>d-orbitals provide effective shielding</em>", much like <em>The Accountant Joke</em>**, depending on the question. For instance, the former statement would be used to explain why the d-block metals generally have a smaller radius than s-block metals (d orbitals provide poorer shielding <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">compared to s and p orbitals of the same shell</span></strong>). The latter statement would be used to explain why the atomic and ionization energies of the d-block metals remain similar (d orbitals provide more effective shielding <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">compared to the s and p orbitals of the next shell</span></strong>). Why do we care about the next shell? Because unlike s-block metals of (say) period 4, for the d-block metals in period 4, together with the additional proton (as you go from left to right of the Periodic Table), the additional electron goes into the 3-d orbital rather than the 4-d orbital (for a period 4 s-block metal, the additional electron goes into the 4s orbital).</p>

                                <p>A businessman was interviewing job applications for the position of manager of a large division. He quickly devised a test for choosing the most suitable candidate. He simply asked each applicant this question, "What is two plus two?"<br>The first interviewee was a journalist. His answer was, "Twenty-two".<br>The second was a social worker. She said, "I don't know the answer but I'm very glad that we had the opportunity to discuss it."<br>The third applicant was an engineer. He pulled out a slide rule and came up with an answer "somewhere between 3.999 and 4.001."<br>Next came an attorney. He stated that "in the case of Jenkins vs. the Department of the Treasury, two plus two was proven to be four."<br>Finally, the businessman interviewed an accountant. When he asked him what two plus two was, the accountant got up from his chair, went over to the door, closed it, came back and sat down. Leaning across the desk, he said in a low voice, "How much do you want it to be, boss?" The accountant got the job.</p>
