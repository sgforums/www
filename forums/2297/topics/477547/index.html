              <p>Good day to the citizens of SgForums! I'm here to ask you peeps to wake up my idea, because i'm still in a maze.</p>
              <p>Firstly before somebody says no head no tail, i'm 20 this year , completed Ns , have a diploma in culinary skills from a private school. Having said that , my highest qualifications by the national standards is only "N level'' from NT.</p>
              <p>To me NT Stream pass or fail sure go nitec , but for N(A)Stream pass can go poly, fail but not too badly can go Higher nitec, this part i buay song. Becoz higher nitec is like free ticket to poly.</p>
              <p>Well..i'm not trying to challenge the system so i will drop this part , so here comes my question &gt;</p>
              <p>I have 3 option &gt; (1) Take private "O"  (2) Go Nitec (3) Stfu and work as a chef</p>
              <p>(1) Shortcut if do well 1 year go poly , people tell me student use 5 years to study for "O Level" (sec1 to 5) , i use 1 year how? Quite true la drop this part.</p>
              <p>(2) and (3) related so i elaborate my thought on this, honestly chef pay is pretty <span>pathetic , i have been there and done that, really f low. Therefore i thought of changing line , hopefully to upgrade my education.</span></p>
              <p>Here is my dilemma, Work as a chef my whole life and draw a pathetic pay between 1k to 2k , or go to ITE Nitec and prove what i can do?</p>
              <p>Thanks for ur time, love &amp; kappa.</p>

              <p>A friend of mine, asked me at the age of 32, whether he should take a phd. I told him, by the time he graduates from the phd, plus application timeline of 1 year, he will be at least 37 years old. Is that what he wants? Not here not there, can't find job easily as well, being an over qualified middle age man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same advice for you. If you decide to go O level or eventually hit Poly, you will be at least 24~25 years old by the time u complete. Armed with your poly cert, you are competing with lots of 19 years old girls or 21 years old guys for the same jobs... You think an employer will choose you? What would make you stand out from these competitors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are of course many other options around, but it is up to you to explore and not appropriate for me to list out.</p>

              <p>In my opinion you should try option 1.</p>
              <p>Say you take a random Private O levels course, eg: http://www.sa.edu.sg/academic-courses/preparatory-for-o-level/ (not advertising, just using their course structure to calculate time)</p>
              <p>Lets say you slack a while and start 17 Feburary 2014. 24 Months later will be 17 Feb 2016, by that time you should be 22 years old.</p>
              <p>Maybe O level results come out Dec 2016.</p>
              <p>Say poly intake around march/april 2017. Poly full time 3 years, you will graduate by may 2020, you will be 26 yrs old by that time.</p>
              <p>Uni intake maybe start augst 2020, you will be 27 years old when u start uni. Say in worst case scenario you never take relevant course as your poly, you will take 4 years to get a degree. By then you are about 31 years old.</p>
              <p>Do you have any means to stablise your financial needs while studying?<br>How old do you plan to start a family?<br>Do you have enough time to enjoy life and flirt around with girls before marrying?</p>
              <p>Finally, if you took o levels, what course do you plan to study in poly? <br><br>If you work as a chef from next year, how long will it take for you to make decent income? <br>Will it be better than studying and getting a degree? <br>Will this option lets you enjoy life easier?<br>If you get degree at 30 years old vs work as chef till 30 years old, which one more worth it? Degree with no exp or diploma as chef with many experience?</p>

              <p>Lol.. whats this crap , post every 5 mins .. seriously</p>
              <p>Seriously u can't blame me for not studying well at the ago of 10 , when they put me in EM3. Most kids are ignorant at that age. Too bad society is like this big fish eat medium fish , medium fish eat small fish.</p>
              <p>Big fish = Express -10k per mth</p>
              <p>Medium fish = N(A) - 5k per mth</p>
              <p>Small fish = N(T) - 2k per mth</p>
              <p>I not sayin all, but majority will end up like this hard truth bro.</p>
              <p>To the bros above , thanks for ur advise , i will take into consideration.</p>
              <p>Will confirm my goal and work towards 2014.</p>

              <p>Do you have any means to stablise your financial needs while studying? (Depends)<br> How old do you plan to start a family? (Nope , Nope , not in singapore where the "women charter'' exist)<br> Do you have enough time to enjoy life and flirt around with girls before marrying?(Wow, wow wow i didn't see that coming! Life is a pain, what do u mean enjoy life? Are u enjoying ur life haha , i can ''only'' have the ''chance'' to ''flirt'' with ''girls'' if i go back to ''school''. No chance in working life, yea that sums it up)</p>

              <p>Lol.. whats this crap , post every 5 mins .. seriously</p>
              <p>Seriously u can't blame me for not studying well at the ago of
              10 , when they put me in EM3. Most kids are ignorant at that age.
              Too bad society is like this big fish eat medium fish , medium fish
              eat small fish.</p>
              <p>Big fish = Express -10k per mth</p>
              <p>Medium fish = N(A) - 5k per mth</p>
              <p>Small fish = N(T) - 2k per mth</p>
              <p>I not sayin all, but majority will end up like this hard truth
              bro.</p>
              <p>To the bros above , thanks for ur advise , i will take into
              consideration.</p>
              <p>Will confirm my goal and work towards 2014.</p>

              <p>Do you have any means to stablise your financial needs while
              studying? (Depends)<br> How old do you plan to start a family? (Nope , Nope , not in
              singapore where the "women charter'' exist)<br> Do you have enough time to enjoy life and flirt around with girls
              before marrying?(Wow, wow wow i didn't see that coming! Life is a
              pain, what do u mean enjoy life? Are u enjoying ur life haha , i
              can ''only'' have the ''chance'' to ''flirt'' with ''girls'' if i
              go back to ''school''. No chance in working life, yea that sums it
              up)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of couz if i am going for degree , i am going for a 10k job like
              oil rig, why would i go and waste 10 years of my life to earn back
              what i am suppose to earn now. haha</p>

              <p>1) Depends=No. Life taught me that if somone says depends, their plan is mostly likely to screw up because of the lack of research.</p>
              <p>2) Woman charter is to protect the kids. Well it is really up to you if you want it or not.</p>
              <p>3) You don't see much is life, or that you are too picky. Fat, ugly, too skinny, too [insert negative word here] ...? </p>
