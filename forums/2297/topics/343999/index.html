              <p> </p>
              <p>i have 12 pts raw, 10 pts after bonus.</p>
              <p>I have a dilemma between my first 2 choices, either AJC(cut off 8), or NYJC(cut off 10)</p>
              <p>Here is my problem,i hope to go ajc. I could put ajc as my first choice and see if they see my sincerity. however, if ajc doesnt accept me, nyjc may also not accept me based on- not 1st choice, and meet the cut off marginally.</p>
              <p>Qn 1) Is it even worth a risk to put ajc as 1st choice, is there a possiblity tat ajc may accpet me due to first chocie but not even reaching cut off.</p>
              <p>Qn 2) Given that i put AJC as 1st chocie, do i stand a chance to be admitted by appeal?</p>

              <p>They'd accept the students based on merit first, so those students regardless of first, second third choice (students rejected from first choice), they'll accept those who meet their science COP of 8. After which they will see how many spaces they have left and then start to accept COP of 9 onwards and whereby these people put AJC as first choice. (I think)</p>
              <p>By putting AJC as first choice, you're already in a way appealing to go in. If they really reject you, your second choice of NYJC should be able to accept you. If the results of getting into NYJC does not satisfy you, then I guess you'll have to have high tea with the principal of AJC. But of course, all these are based on the little that I know of. =/ </p>

              <p>I ended up in MJC.</p>
              <p>Moral of story? Don't be greedy. Anyway, your A lvls depend
                  mostly on YOU, and not the JC. It's just whether YOU want to let
                  the JC control your fate, or YOU control it.</p>

              <p>So is TJCs cut off lower than your pts? Simply, what was yoru points and what were the jcs' cut off at your time.</p>

              <p>To add to how the JAE works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Students are ranked according to their L1R5.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only when there is a tie, in terms of L1R5 score, then your placement of choice (eg. 1st, 2nd, 3rd choice, etc) matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg. If 2 students, Mr A and Mr B, both have the same L1R5.</p>
              <p>Mr A puts VJC as his 3rd choice while Mr B puts VJC as his 4th choice.</p>
              <p>There is only 1 spot in VJC left.</p>
              <p>If Mr A fails to get into his 1st and 2nd choice, and Mr B fails to get into his 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice, then Mr A gets priority over Mr B to get into VJC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's the one scenario you have to watch out for.</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Qn 1) Is it even worth a risk to put ajc as 1st choice, is there a possiblity tat ajc may accpet me due to first chocie but not even reaching cut off.</p>
              <p>Qn 2) Given that i put AJC as 1st chocie, do i stand a chance to be admitted by appeal? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you don't meet the cut off point, putting 1st choice does not help. You can't get in if you don't meet cut off point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; however, if ajc doesnt accept me, nyjc may also not accept me based on- not 1st choice, and meet the cut off marginally. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The danger, would be as described in my post above. If there's only 1 spot left in NYJC, you and another guy has same L1R5 score, and he puts NYJC as his 10th choice while you put it as your 11th, and both of you fail to get into your 1st to 9th (for you including the 10th) choices, then he will get the spot, not you.</p>

              <p>The cut off point is only a reference. The actual cut off is determined by the number of applicants as well as the points of the students being admiteed. Assuming the number of A1s and A2s... etc of last year is the same as this year, then the cut off points would increase because there is no "first-3-months"(this would require some verification because does A1 mean that one is top 75% of the batch?)</p>

              <p>I think this is particularly very impt since i do meet the cut off of NYJC and many others would have an advantage over me if i dont put it as first choice. Thanks a lot for your satisfying reply as usual. XD</p>

              <p>so when pple say their o level score is in terms of L1R5 or L1R4.</p>
              <p>so confusing sia.why can't they just standardised the o level score.</p>
              <p>just use one standard for entry to jc ,poly,ite.</p>
              <p>easier to see ma.make things so complicated.</p>
              <p>just make it like PSLE.</p>
              <p>upon 300.all same.you em1,em2,em3 or em4 also upon 300.</p>
              <p>then you go raffles sec,ac sec or abc sec also just look at one score.</p>
