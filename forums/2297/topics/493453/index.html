              Say you have 10 employees, but as a stingy CEO, you underpay them with unethically low wages. One night after work, the 10 of them try to enter a high-class nightclub, but only 2 of them have enough money to afford the $100 entrance fees and enter, while the remaining poorer 8 of them can only wait pitifully outside the club.<p>Some years later, after having a near-death experience, your perspectives as a CEO have changed, and now you decide to pay all your 10 employees generously. Now all of them have enough money to pay the $100 entrance fees to enter the nightclub. Happy ending.</p>

              Catalyst isn't a factor in this story. This story is about increasing their pay so they've enough money to enter, ie. more employees now have enough money (energy) to afford the entrance fee (activation energy).<p>For a catalyst story, it would be a near-death experience for the nightclub boss, causing him to decide to lower the entrance fee (activation energy) required to enter (for reaction to occur).</p><p>So EITHER increasing the emplyees' pay (molecules' energy), OR reducing the entrance fee (activation energy) required, would help to increase the % of employees who can enter, hence speed up the rate of the reaction.</p><p>You can of course, do both. But for A levels, Cambridge will test your students on each factor separately, not simultaneously.
