              <p>Some poly students after getting their diploma, will go for oversea university and get their certificate there. Then I was wondering, the cert from overseas uni and the cert people get from local uni, which one is better? Or they are the same in standard?? Like in terms of when you go out there searching for jobs and showing the cert to your boss...  Or must depend on what type of course you study also?</p>

              <p>Local university are for poor people who can't afford to go overseas and in the top league within the top 2 JC, they are for people who apply for and are rejected for scholarships.</p>

              <p>What i was saying is, like some poly student continue their studies overseas right, and the cert they get is from overseas. Then some poly students lucky lucky can go local uni, then the cert they going get is from local uni. So i ask my question above.</p>

              <p>Errr yes it is relevant.</p>
              <p>I'm using the world of JC students to explain to you the value of a local uni degree.</p>
              <p>All I can say is if you are blessed from a privileged family that is able to send you overseas to study like i was, you should kneel down and thank God and grab the chance.</p>
              <p>The only JC students who go to local uni fall into two categories: 1) from poor family or not rich family 2) not smart enough to get a scholarship offer from the government and private companies that award scholarships eg SIA, DBS, SPH.</p>
              <p>As a poly student you should feel pride in your education. Poly students are no way inferior to JC students. If only the crap and rejects of JC end up in local uni, there is no reason you should shortchange yourself.</p>
              <p>Btw, the people in local unis have no idea of how crappy and stinky their education was, because they've been nowhere outside SG and experienced nothing in their lives. SG is a place tiny that no one really gives a damn abt it if it sunk tomorrow. Local educated frogs in the well are very happy hopping and swimming in their small tiny well and the funniest thing is they think they're so elite, when the top tie of every cohort laughs at them.</p>
              <p>Even the head of the country is educated overseas and he made damn sure all his kids and his brother's kids go overseas to Oxford and MIT as well. So what do you think?</p>

              <p>Yes. Depends on which universities.</p>
              <p>The umbrella term Overseas Universities is very broad but I can tell you that even a third tier, backyard overseas university like University of South Australia, Woolonggong or some other university no one has heard of has higher value than a local degree.</p>
              <p>If you make it to respected universities with Nobel laureates which many poly grads do, like University of Melbourne, UNSW, Adelaide, ANU in Aussie, Birmingham, UCL, LSE, IC, Warwick, in UK and the list is endless really..there are too many respectable and reputable US universities to be named, it is a surefire entry to many jobs that tell local grads to "get the fuck out".</p>
              <p>I also personally know a few employers, including my brother who said that they throw away the CVs of local grads when they shortlist applicants for interviews.</p>

              <p>Honestly does not really matters, if you can get into local uni, it will get you a job in Singapore. </p>
              <p>Being armed with diploma cert, you will NOW discover that you can get a job easily compared to degree holder. </p>
              <p>So you can still depends on the diploma cert to bridge you for a while. </p>
              <p>You will discovered that after you get a degree it is not enough. People will go for MBA, Master, PhD, CFA, ACCA , grad. diploma after Bach. </p>

              <p>Depending on which oversea uni you are talking about. If you are talking about all those top university eg. MIT, then it's more recognised then local's</p>
              <p>Normally, those that took the poly route, graduating with GPA of 3.5 or more will try their best to get in local uni.</p>
              <p>Those with lower GPA that can't secure a place will probably choose to get a degree from overseas.</p>
              <p>If you took the poly route, it is very hard to enter top oversea uni without an outstanding GPA (more then 3.8 or rather 3.9 above) and a good port folio.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, you need to look at the financial factors, whether it's worth to get a degree overseas (work very hard to clear ur debts later on) or to study in singapore enjoying the tution grants.</p>
              <p>I was accepted by Ntu- Material science and engineering, direct entry to second year. Previously from Temasek Poly! Good luck and study hard, I believe you can achieve what you want.</p>
