              <p>I'm from a neighbourhood secondary school in east.</p>
              <p>My Prelim grades are as follow:</p>
              <p>EL                                                      B4</p>
              <p>CL                                                      A1 (already gotten this result for O Levels)</p>
              <p>HCL                                                   A2 </p>
              <p>EM                                                     A2 </p>
              <p>AM                                                     A1 </p>
              <p>Comb Sci (phy,chem)                     A1 </p>
              <p>Comb humans ( ss,geog)               B4 </p>
              <p>Let's<strong> assume that my grades are like this in the actual O level.</strong></p>
              <p>I need advice on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether i should go JC or poly.</span></strong></p>
              <p>These are my concerns:</p>
              <p>a) I'm <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">not acadamically inclined.</span></strong> I<strong> flunked my pure sciences</strong>, thats why i drop to combine science. Hence JC may not be a wise choice.</p>
              <p>b) I <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">dont know what i shoud do in the future</span>,</strong> and i have <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">no specific area of interest</span></strong> or something i am passionate about. Hence, i dont know what course to choose for Poly. As many people adviced, i read about their courses a lot, but i still got no idea. But I'm more to business studies, or humanities like pschology/ childhood pschology. I got no intrest at all in engineering and design.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #003366;">Q1) Where should i go?</span></em></span></strong></p>
              <p>Also, even after i list out serveral choices, i could not decide.</p>
              <p>JC: By my school's tradition, it's either <strong>Meradian JC or Tampines JC.  </strong>                              If I had decide upon JC, it'll be so easy for me to choose which JC to go cos i just have to see my result and choose the suitable one.</p>
              <p>Poly: <strong>Temasek poly / Ngee Ann poly / Singapore Poly</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Temasek</strong> is only <strong>15min </strong>trip from my house, very tempting for me. But there is no courses which i really have a special interest in. Maybe business? Or Law n management?</p>
              <p><strong>Ngee Ann Poly</strong> is rather <strong>far</strong> for me since i<strong> live in bedok.</strong> I may have to travel to tampines to take their shuttle bus there. But i trust that it have <strong>excellent facilities</strong> since it's the <strong>richest poly ranked 2nd in singapore. </strong>Also, I do have passion for chinese language, so their <strong>Chinese Studies </strong>may suits me. More over, my sister graduated from this course too. Their <strong>Advertising courses</strong> also caught my attention.</p>
              <p><strong>Singapore</strong> Poly is also <strong>very far</strong>. Need <strong>estimated 1 hr to travel there</strong>. But it's attractive bcos it's the <strong>top poly in SG. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> <span style="color: #003366;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q2) If choose poly, which one?</span></em></strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I'm really confused and lost. Please help.</p>

              <p>My best advice for you is to contemplate yourself which direction you wanna take.</p>
              <p>If you're good academically without any plans which courses to take then you should go JC.</p>
              <p>If you've any course in mind, go down to their open house and check it out.</p>
              <p>And by the way, most poly graduates dont work on a career that is related to their courses.</p>
              <p>They just get the diploma and pursue their interests.</p>

              <p>Just go JC because you do not have a poly course in mind. Science subject is not compulsory for art stream, you can take Maths as your contrasting subject if you want.</p>

              <p>Hey the "O" Levels results are already out so how did you do for the actual thing? <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Btw here one more piece of advice to help you along. <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"><br><br>Hmm...since
               you have no interest in engineering then I would suggest you try out 
              the arts stream for JC but do take note that some Social Sciences and 
              Business degrees do require A maths or H1 maths background as their 
              minimum subject requirements.</p>
              <p>If you are planning to take up a H2 
              science subject, then i think the JC might arrange you for extra lessons
               to touch up on what you missed as Combine Sciences do omit out some of 
              the things that are taught in Pure Science.<br><br>However, one thing as
               an Arts Stream student is that you would most likely be limited to 3 H2
               Arts subject and one H1 Science subject. Not sure on whether can you 
              take up a H2 Science subject and become a "hybrid" subject combi though 
              as I heard most who are able to take up a "hybrid" combi are usally 
              science students.</p>
              <p>Btw I have also included 2 sites where you can 
              check what are the JCs and Poly courses that your COP is eligible for. 
              They are...</p>

              <p>Anyway, i got a set of result that I'm rather satisfied. MY L1R5 is 11, after deduction it's 7.</p>
              <p>I had choosen these JCs : NYJC , SRJC and TPJC.</p>
              <p>And I'm quite sure that I am able to get into NYJC already. </p>
              <p>I think I'll be taking H2 Maths, Econs and CLL , plus H1 GSC. </p>

              Hi let me share with you my story. 
                                         
                                  A brief introduction of myself. I'm from PJC, taking H2 PCM H1 Econs.    
                                  EL B3
                                  EM &amp; AM A1    
                                  Pure Physics A2    
                                  Combined Chem/Bio B3
                                  POA A2
                                  Combined Humanities B3
                                  CL C5    
                                      
                                  When I enter PJC that time, I DO NOT NEED to even appeal for H2 PCM combi. It was already included as a choice. I don't know about your case since your combined science is a b3 and you want to take both h2 phy and chem. 
                                          
                                  Yes by RIGHT, you and me cannot take H2 PCM combi. But I dont know why my year they allowed me to take. Maybe they allow you to take? But if you cant take, appeal to the hod of subject combi then. 
                                      
                                      
                  Whether H2 maths econs chem is advisable depends on which course you want to go in the university. Certain course like pharmacy (for example), in NUS, requires H2 Math Bio Chem strictly. Please check at the university websites. Or you can google 'NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD course pre-requsites for instance. 
                                      
                                  Do reply to this thread. All the best.
