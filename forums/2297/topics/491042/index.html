Having spent much time thinking about how poorly I am going to perform, I figured out that I should spend some time thinking on the course to pursue after o levels. Can i get anyone's help and advice on how i should decide between poly / jc ? If JC , arts/science and If poly, which course in particular? I personally do not have any interest in any course yet, even after visiting NP and SP open houses yesterday. Thanks and all the best to students collecting their results on monday too!</p></div>

              <p>If you were to go JC, would you be able to work extremely hard so as to be able to go to a local Uni? Most JC courses can enter other Uni courses but you to have to have met the pre-requisites of the Uni course itself. Arts/Science stream somewhat depend on what you might want to do in the future. I suggest you take these last two days and search deep down for any possible passions.</p>
              <p>For poly, you need to not only work hard but have passion for the course in order to do well, you can't possibly do a course that you have zero interest in. Thus, I can't exactly pick a course for you, but if you do insist, I would suggest one of the engineering courses as they are the easiest to change fields in uni.</p>
              <p>Seeing as you are worried about performing poorly, perhaps you might want to consider MI? MI uses L1R4 and you can use your cca grade as part of your L1R4. It's basically a 3 year JC, from what I've heard, the first year gets you settled in and stuff. I would recommend it if you really want to do A lvls but don't have other options.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either way, every where you go, be it JC, poly or MI, you will need to work ridiculously hard. </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
