              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It is always a good idea to interpret the keywords (media, main cause or impact, youth violence) in the question.</p>
              <p>  In your conclusion, you should make a stand after saying lots in the body of your essay.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>no. </p>
              <p>youth violence</p>
              <p>the child need to find his identity, and his worth, he want to be in control of his life (seeking for freedom ) love, ideal of being wanted and needed. without these psychological needs, they are stress out. </p>
              <p>due to lack of parental guidance... parent are too busy working, they dont have time give attention to the kid. or the parent have been giving them too much attention, stressing the kid. both situation make then feel unwanted.</p>
              <p>the teachers keep on stressing the kid to work hard in a negatively way, making them feeling useless and unwanted in school. </p>
              <p>sometime, youth have psychological problem such as ADHD, reading disability, language disability, autism... which is not recognized by the parents and teachers and mistakenly thought that the child is being  naughty and ill-disciplined make the situation worse.</p>
              <p>most kid who practicipate in riots, street fight are just trying to let out their frustration in life. </p>

              <p>it is more about himself rarer than trying to hurt some1. where he get hurt it does not really matter to him because he just want to let out the stress and anger. </p>
              <p>Do you know that these school dropout, hang out on the street all day from 12 pm to 5 am everyday? they dont watch TV, play games that often compare the "normal" kids to stay at home all the time.</p>
              <p>Regardless, media sometimes showing negative violence scene, would still project bad ideas to all the kids. but the true action in violence came from the internal broken soul of the teenager , who are having emptiness and loneliness in their heart. ..<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> </span></p>
