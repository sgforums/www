              <p>1) A beam of electrons whose kinetic energy is K emerges from a thin foil window at the end of an accelerator tube. There is a metal plate a distance d from this window and perpendicular to the direction of the emerging beam. Show that we can prevent this beam from hitting the plate if we apply a uniform magnetic field of flux density B such that B&gt; (2mk/e^2d^2)^0.5</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>2) A cyclotron is an accelerator in which a beam of energetic particles is produced. The charged partilces describe a spiral path of many turns at right angles to a constant magnetic field and are given an acceleration always in the same sense from an alternating electric field, each time they cross the gap between the two conductors ( dees). These charged particles then leave the cyclotron at the outer edge. Note that within the Dees, the charged particles are shielded from the electric fields by the copper walls of the Dees</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) if the charged particles were protons explain clearly how the alternating electric field provides the acceleration</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) show that the frequency of the applied voltage is independent on the radius of the orbit</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) show that the kinetic energy gained per cycle is 2qV where V is the magnitude of the voltage applied but V does not affect the final energy of the charged particles.</p>

              <p>I guess for question 2, wiki should answer most of your queries. I shall post the more relevant parts here... The diagram in your question isn't very self-explanatory...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Cyclotron_patent.png/300px-Cyclotron_patent.png" alt="" width="300" height="162"><br> Diagram of cyclotron operation from Lawrence's 1934 patent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The electrodes shown above would be in the vacuum chamber, which is flat, in a narrow gap between the two poles of a large magnet.</p>
              <p>In the cyclotron, a high-frequency alternating voltage applied across the "D" electrodes (also called "dees") alternately attracts and repels charged particles. The particles, injected near the center of the magnetic field, <span class="mw-redirect">accelerate</span> only when passing through the gap between the electrodes. The perpendicular magnetic field
                  (passing vertically through the "D" electrodes), combined with the
                  increasing energy of the particles forces the particles to travel in a
                  spiral path.</p>
              <p>With no change in energy the charged particles in a magnetic field
                  will follow a circular path. In the Cyclotron, energy is applied to the
                  particles as they cross the gap between the dees and so they are
                  accelerated (at the typical sub-relativistic speeds used) and will
                  increase in mass as they approach the speed of light. Either of these
                  effects (increased velocity or increased mass) will increase the radius
                  of the circle and so the path will be a spiral.</p>
              <p>(The particles move in a spiral, because a <span class="mw-redirect">current</span> of electrons or ions, flowing perpendicular to a magnetic field, experiences a perpendicular <span class="mw-redirect">force</span>. The charged particles move freely in a vacuum, so the particles follow a spiral path.)</p>
              <p>The radius will increase until the particles hit a target at the
                  perimeter of the vacuum chamber. Various materials may be used for the
                  target, and the collisions will create secondary particles which may be
                  guided outside of the cyclotron and into instruments for analysis. The
                  results will enable the calculation of various properties, such as the
                  mean spacing between atoms and the creation of various collision
                  products. Subsequent chemical and particle analysis of the target
                  material may give insight into nuclear transmutation of the elements
                  used in the target.</p>

              <p>The centripetal force is provided by the transverse magnetic field <em>B</em>,
                  and the force on a particle travelling in a magnetic field (which
                  causes it to be angularly displaced, i.e spiral) is equal to <em>Bqv</em>. So,</p>
              <dl><dd><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/8/b/b8b50bd029f5abfa3d85a7e77eb2a950.png" alt="\frac{mv^2}{r} = Bqv"></dd></dl>
              <p>(Where m is the mass of the particle, q is its charge, v is its velocity and r is the radius of its path.)</p>
              <p>The speed at which the particles enter the cyclotron due to a potential difference, V.</p>
              <dl><dd><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/c/8bc9f5f5e8d6551e8ca6ebc382747278.png" alt="v = \sqrt{\frac{2Vq}{m}}"></dd></dl>
              <p>Therefore,</p>
              <dl><dd><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/9/3/9934a7b79bccaf602c63326d4a5ade2c.png" alt="\frac{v}{r} = \frac{Bq}{m}"></dd></dl>
              <p>v/r is equal to angular velocity, <em>ω</em>, so</p>
              <dl><dd><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/2/f52cabd037654591a844a248daf1c485.png" alt="\omega = \frac{Bq}{m}"></dd></dl>
              <p>And since the angular frequency is</p>
              <dl><dd><span class="texhtml">ω = 2π<em>f</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span></dd></dl>
              <p>Therefore,</p>
              <dl><dd><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/f/6/df6bd1a5326b501d07eb92588adc08ad.png" alt="f_c = \frac{Bq}{2m\pi}"></dd></dl>
              <p>This shows that for a particle of constant mass, the frequency does
                  not depend upon the radius of the particle's orbit. As the beam spirals
                  out, its frequency does not decrease, and it must continue to
                  accelerate, as it is travelling more distance in the same time. As
                  particles approach the speed of light, they acquire additional mass,
                  requiring modifications to the frequency, or the magnetic field during
                  the acceleration. This is accomplished in the synchrocyclotron.</p>
              <p>The relativistic cyclotron frequency is</p>
              <p><img class="tex" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/0/e301aebca157f925a787b2b4f71b44ea.png" alt="f=f_c\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}">,</p>
              <p>where <span class="texhtml"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> is the classical frequency, given above, of a charged particle with velocity <span class="texhtml"><em>v</em></span> circling in a magnetic field.</p>
              <p>The rest mass of an electron is 511 keV, so the frequency correction
                  is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11 kV direct current
                  accelerating voltage. The proton mass is nearly two thousand times the
                  electron mass, so the 1% correction energy is about 9 MeV, which is
                  sufficient to induce nuclear reactions.</p>
              <p>An alternative to the synchrocyclotron is the isochronous cyclotron,
                  which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with
                  time. The de-focusing effect of this radial field gradient is
                  compensated by ridges on the magnet faces which vary the field
                  azimuthally as well. This allows particles to be accelerated
                  continuously, on every period of the radio frequency, rather than in
                  bursts as in most other accelerator types. This principle that
                  alternating field gradients have a net focusing effect is called strong focusing. It was obscurely known theoretically long before it was put into practice.</p>
