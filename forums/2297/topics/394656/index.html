              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I am a 18 year old polytechnic student studying Information Technology course.</p>
              <p>Due to my poor 'O' levels results of only 21 points, not many choices are available for me hence I chose to study IT which isn't my interest.</p>
              <p>Currently, I am facing a difficult situation.</p>
              <p>Because of my GPA of only 0.88, repeating 5 modules of year one, I might be removed from my polytechnic if I do fail any of them in year two. and if my GPA drops below 0.8, I'll be liable for removal case to my understanding of what the poly has told me. If I'm being removed from polytechnic, no other polytechnic in SG will take me in.</p>
              <p>So, the school offered me 2 choices.</p>
              <p>1) Withdraw from the poly, serve NS, retake my 'O' levels for a better points and enrol into another poly.</p>
              <p>2) Continue with what I have currently, have a great risk of being removed by the school if I fail any year one modules again. Study hard and get promoted. But I will not be able to graduate on time, might need to take up to 4 years (maximum 6 years).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My interest is actually culinary, so I'm thinking if I should quit poly now, serve the NS and then study in Shatec get a culinary cert and then work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please advice me..</p>

              <p>I am interested in how you manage to get a 0.88.</p>
              <p>Either you are incredibly lazy to the point of not attending lectures and such, or you are totally not built out for this field.  </p>
              <p>If it is the first, then I will say you may as well give up studying if you are unwilling to work hard. </p>
              <p>If it is the second, go ahead and serve NS, and join SHATEC or Temasek Poly after you come out. Since you already have an aim, give it your best shot. </p>

              <p>I am a SHATEC culinary dropout and had a classmate who quitted polytechnic and joined the culinary course when he was 19.  I have no idea about the NS deferment for such case though.</p>
              <p>I will advice that you understand the industrial kitchen life first before investing money into a culinary education.  If you have worked in a kitchen environment, then it is alright to go ahead with culinary studies.  If not, then I would say that being a cook is not as glamourous or easy as you think.  It might end up not being your interest too.</p>
              <p>The average starting pay for a culinary skills graduate is around $1200 at a 5-star hotel.  If you can perform, you will rise up the ranks fast.  If not, you will just stuck there for life.</p>
              <p>It would also be good to serve NS first.  You get to know lots of people graduated from different courses.  Get to know what they have learnt in their courses, the pros and cons of different industries and from there you might have a better understanding on what you might be interested in pursuing.</p>

              <p>Damn... Which poly you attend? I just wonder how you can get so low GPA...</p>
              <p>Anyway, what are your interest in the first place?</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is better to go serve your NS first then continue your studies. It doesn't really have to come to the point that you get kick out.</p>

              <p>21 points seriously is not the end of life. However if you fail english, the course choices are really limited. Perhaps you can choose to enrol in another course, other than IT.It is a possible route to go to shatec, however Life in kitchen is really tough so be prepared.</p>
