              <p>There are some p6 maths qns that I encountered in my students' work that her other tutor solved using algebra, and I would solve them using algebra too. However, she has difficulty understanding as the p6 syllabus about algebra is is very basic. Therefore, I hope to see if there are any other ways to solve the qns apart from algebra.</p>
              <p>1) An art exhibition was held for two days. On the first day, 500 more men than women attended the exhibition. On the second day, the number of men decreased by 10%, and the number of women increase by 15%. The total number of visitors on the second day is 1680. How many females attended the exhibition on the second day?</p>
              <p>2) At 7am, Car A left Town X for Town Y. At the same time, Car B left Town Y for Town X. At 3pm, the two cars met. 5 hours later, Car A arrived at Town Y, while Car B was 150km away from Town X. What is the distance between Town X and Town Y?</p>
              <p>3) Alan and Barry have 480 marbles. Alan gave 2/5 of his marbles to Barry. Barry then gave 3/7 of the total number of marbles that he has to Alan. In the end, both Alan and Barry had the number of marbles. How many marbles did Alan have at first?</p>
