              <p>Since you are taking F &amp; N, it will be best if you research which type of food is best for athletes, in what quantity, and consumed during which period.</p>
              <p>You can also try narrowing down your research to a specific group of athletes ( e.g. Marathon runners, Swimmers, Gymnasts... etc.), and/or narrow down to a few food from a specified type/group of food.</p>

              <p>you can always do the other question on cereals. its slightly easier</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>Look at the key points</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p><strong>Athletes achieve peak performances</strong></p>
              <ul>

              <li>What are exampls of activities that athletes do?</li>
              <li>Amount of calories an average athletes need(Male/Female or both)</li>
              <li>Nutrients that ahtlete need?(Functions, sources)</li>

              <p>Athletes are interested in doing what? Maybe building the body to be healthy. You can do research on food that are healthy, and that will be a broad topic to research on.</p>
              <p>However, do not neglet on achieve peak performance. You can say when eating normally u need to eat healthy, then achieving peak performance</p>
              <p>Research on the food that athletes eats during the game, i remember there is this gel like food which they eat. Find out about the nutrient content they contain, research on them, maybe the proteins, vitamins, and many more</p>
              <p>Athlete need energy, achieving peak performance may be telling you food that lets u release the energy quickly, milo said something about actigen E which will help to release energy quickly</p>
              <p>Athletes exercise a lot, the joint may be prone to wear and tear. Look for those product that heals joint, lok what they contain</p>

              <p>i'm currently taking the same exam as the one whom asked for help. Because from what i know, before you start to choose the question, it is important to look for key points and then roughly plan out how would that coursework will be like. Because in my school, my teacher went through both questions and made us write down some pointers that is relavant to the question. So yeah, that's why i'm able to help him in a way.</p>
              <p> </p>
