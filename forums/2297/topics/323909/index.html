              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I am a student who's taking H2 A level History this year and it is possibly the absolute hardest subject to take in my opinion.</p>
              <p>I can't find guides, online essays or forums with regards to the Singapore history syllabus.</p>
              <p>I was hoping that some of you here do take H2 History or the previous version of it in the old syllabus and would have some resources to share. In particular, I am looking for compilation essays written for the Singapore syllabus question? I would be willing to buy if needed...or free resources will do. Really, its a hard subject to take for a first timer.</p>

              <p>Me also studied H2 History, but took the exam last year...got a 'B' grade, though I seriously doubt how I could have even pass in the first place. The questions that came out for the 'international' paper last year was totally unexpected for me, and I totally bullshitted all the way in my essay...for some essay, it was barely one paper long :(</p>
              <p>I would agree that H2 History is bloody damn difficult, simply because you don't know how to study for it at all. It is unlike maths and physics...all you have to do is just practice and practice.</p>
              <p>I spent great time and efforts memorising so many facts for my history, only to realise that it's not enough...I must know how to write and use those memorised facts to my advantage in the essay.</p>
              <p>And yes, not to mention that there is simply not much written essays for me to take reference to.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry I can't help you much either, because the essays I've written myself back then was totallp crappy also...the best essays would be like perhaps 16/25, the worst being 8/25. But I guess I can give you my old lecture notes and reading materials if you think it'll be useful...</p>

              <p>First, thanks for your offer but the thing is, my lecturers keep on pounding us with readings and notes of content that needs to be learnt.</p>
              <p>They don't seem to give sample essays or even teach essay answering skills, which is the major problem as my friends and I are trying to find out how to answer the different types of essays.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your offer though... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
