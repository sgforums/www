              <p>there are quite number of specialists from public hospitals going into the private sector outside, opening their own clinics and becoming their own boss. its more lucrative than earning a fixed salary in public hospitals. after hearing all these, do you wish to be a doctor in future? there is a saying, to be a doctor is a calling. if you are enticed by the money, then perhaps doctor is not the right profession for you. you should be motivated to be a doctor to treat patients.</p>

              <p>I can tell you a AST (advanced specialist trainee) pay is almost 7k. a HOD pay in a public hospital is 25k. so you can deduce how much pay is AC, consultant and senior consultant. by the way, a senior consultant is usually the HOD of a public hospital. as for professorship, you need to teach at NUS, sort of a title in the teaching profession. most are associate professors in public hospitals. those doctors who are senior in the profession and teaching for decades, are full professors. those doctors and professors teaching at NUS, are either senior consultants, associate or professors. our medical education are modelled after UK, but MOH has decided to switch it to the american model, ACGME and residency programmes.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>there are alot of things to learn as a trainee. medical officers are posted to different dept once every 6 months. although they are not supposed to do consultations or do surgery, they help the senior consultants in the department doing general medicine work. also they need to attend a lecture once a week for about 3 hours, not to mention of the times they attend conferences either in singapore or overseas. there are also think medical books to read to improve their knowledge. most of the time, the senior consultants in the dept are tasked teaching these trainee doctors, such as when doing surgery in operating theatre or doing the ward rounds in the morning.</p></div>

              <p>ya they also earned extra perks such as doing surgery in OT, or performing minor surgery. how much they earn in this I am not sure. for subsidised patient referred by polyclinics, they also earned a little amount, not much, but how much percentage I am not sure.</p>

              <p>you can go to ACGME website to read their information. its too detailed explaning to you here and you may get confused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>actually the residency programme is not much different from BST and AST, but there are some differences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BST and AST are taken care by the STC, but residency programme are the baby of the institution hospitals. STC recruit, teach and then decide whether they can become specialist all in one body, whereas ACGME have separate bodies within the institution, like recruiting, examning, teaching and then deciding if they can be specialist so that there is avoidance of conflict of interests.</p>

              <p>well if the patient does not complain against the surgeon, his/her family will. if they dun, the HOD will take up the case. if the HOD is the senior consultant, maybe his boss like the CEO may like to know. Hospitals have a committee to look into these things. last of all, SMC is the regulating body whereby doctors need to renew their license once every 2 years. the disciplinary committee at SMC will look into this and see what type of discipline measures against the surgeon. worst case scenario is non renewal of his/her license or immediate suspension of the surgeon license. there will be records kept on this, dun worry at hospitals and at SMC. if the surgeon moved to other countries and the hiring hospital wants to do a reference check, they can enquire from the hospital or SMC. but as medical field is quite a small world in this globalised world, some doctors from other countries may ask their counterparts in Singapore for reference check thru word of mouth.</p>

              <p>you watch pitch adams the movie? its a real life story on adams, he himself studied medicine quite late at his age. even if you are in your late 30s, its still quite ok to study medicine, as its only 5 years of study for a basic medical degree. I know of a PR doctor who applied to be a BST in his 40s, as he was in a western country after finishing his medical degree. look at what age he will be when he is AC after finishing his AST.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no I am not medically trained. I happened to work with doctors previously. doctors are clever people, who are articulate and intelligent. HODs are quite demanding doctors. thats how they become HOD isnt it, besides being capable, they also want the best.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your niece wants to be a doc? good on her. but ask her what is her motive to want to be a doc first. most doctors I know will say its their calling, they are not motivated by the money or prestige. anyway there is a difference doctors trained in Singapore and foreign doctors trained overseas. NUS recently emphasised on the ethics and compared to foreign doctors, ethics is the least emphasised at NUS due to a recent survey among doctors conducted by 2 esteem doctors in the field. the survey showed that foreign doctors are trained well in ethics compared to our local doctors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>foreign doctors are of the impression that when doctors visited the patients to treat them, they tend to focus on the disease or sickness, without even bothering greeting or acknowleding the patient when doing ward rounds. foreign doctors are taught in their medical schools that you should focus on the patient, not the diseases.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>most doctors start work at 7.30am. some started even earlier. first they do ward rounds with the trainees. after that, they go to their clinic at 8.30am. they do not have patients to see everyday. some have clinic on 2-3 days a week. besides clinic work, they are visiting consultants on private and public hospitals probably once a week. they also spend their time doing admin work in their dept, like corresponding by e-mail, planning and doing scheduling. they are also supposed to teach the trainee in their dept. every medical officer are tagged to a consultant to be their supervisor. every 6 months, they are supposed to do a supervisor report on them. if any trainee who slacked or got attitude problem, their supervisor will warn them either verbally or reflect in the supervisor's report. if the trainee doesnt improve, then its up to the STC to decide whether to kick out the trainee from training. I know one trainee who has completed his/her BST, but cos of attitude problem despite numerous warnings, he/she does not progress to AST. so its as good as kicking him/her out from the traineeship.</p></div>

              <p>medicine is not easy to study. once you are a doctor, its a demanding job as it involved very long hours.consultants do not need to do shifts as their clinics are office hours, but medical officers and trainees need to do shift work in hospitals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when studying medicine, you need to remember, memorise the names of the diseases and the medications, mostly in latin. I saw those latin names I want to faint already lol, let alone remember and memorise them. besides medicine and diseases, also need to study body, and doing surgery. MBBS - Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, like a double degree of sorts. MBBS is a basic medical degree whereby if you do not intend to specialise, you can be a medical officer in hospitals or work in raffles clinic as a GP or you open your own GP business. GP is good for  treating common ailments likd cough, common flu, gastric and things like that. for persistent cough after seeing GP many times, you need to see ENT specialist, as the cough is linked to your nose, as you may have existing nasal problems you may not know. they will use a scope to go into your nose to see what the problem is, and GP cant do that as they do not have the equipment to do so. its not cheap doing the scope in your nose. its better to go polyclinic to get referral letter and go to specialist clinic in public hospitals subsidised. instead of paying 300 plus if you go to a private specialist, you pay around 100 plus subsidised and pay via your medisave account.</p>

              <p>After MRCP, FRCS, I understand that some doctors went for 2 years fellowship / residency with world renowned hospitals and trained under world renowned clinical professors. What are these fellowship mean ? How are the doctors being selected for this type of fellowship ? Does this mean that doctors who have done this type of fellowship will have skills on par with the world top specialists in their chosen field of specialty ?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>fellowships they have to be recommended by their HOD, so as to get released by the dept. as manpower is an issue in the dept, cos releasing the doctor meaning one less doctor in the dept. for the HOD to recommend, the doctor performance must be good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once accepted, some will spend up to 1 year staying there, doing research. it also depends on what fellowship they intend to do there? research, clinical work etc? some go there to do research. basically research work in singapore is almost non existent. how many researchers we have in singapore as compared to the countries like UK or US. in US, those researchers full time job are research, whereas in singapore, researchers are doctors doing medicine, admin, teaching and research at the same time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to be a top specialist in your field, attending those top institutions doesnt mean you are destined to be a top specialist. what separate those elite are the things they have done well in their chosen profession and your name spread internationally. once you are an AC, you are on your own and do not have any supervisors or mentors anymore. you are required to diagnose and treat your patients well. if you misdiagnose and mistreat your patients, you may lose your license, never mind your reputation.</p>

              <p>the work of doctors are very demanding and hours are long. doctors worked very hard and some sleep for only 5-6 hours. even when they reach home, work does not stop. some will use these time doing research, reading, bring work back to home, or replying to e-mails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some senior specialists HOD are not only chairman in STC, they are also involved in some capacity in the colleges, either as president, or treasurer. Colleges are not appointed by MOH, its done via elections.</p>

              <p>how old is your niece now? need biology in her A levels though. to get a place at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine is not easy as there are top students from Raffles and Hwa Chong applied to study medicine. I saw their O and A levels transcript, all straight A's. I am not saying your niece need to be like them, but her grades for A levels need to be good. I think NUS accept about 200 plus medical students every year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know singaporeans go to Monash and Melbourne University to study medicine there as they cant get a place at NUS. Monash and Melbourne Uni are recognised by SMC for overseas medical degree there, but their fees are not cheap as they are international students, paying full fees. NSW I think is also recognised by SMC.</p>

              <p>Indeed, the cost to be trained as a doctor is very high.</p>
              <p>The son of my colleague scored 4 As, distinctions in 2 S papers but a B4 in GP could not gain admission to NUS Medicine faculty and my colleague wrote to Straits Times forum to complain but to no avail.</p>
              <p>So, my colleague had no choice and he sent his son to Australia to study for the medical degree. Fortunately, my colleague has the finances but it will cost him about $500,000 to $1,000,000 he estimated. </p>
