              <p>Depends on who the patient is, the majority of patients don't have much to go by, don't think they will give "red packets". Those that give red packets are those holding top post in the communist regimes and maybe those health tourist (but then again, those health tourist that visit Cuba from the surrounding region do so because it's cheap).</p>
              <p>But then again it's ONLY the top surgeons and doctors getting the red packets, not all surgeons and doctors.</p>

              <p>doctors earned more cos of many reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Their profession is highly specialised</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) their profession and licensure is regulated by Spore Medical Council</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) to obtain MBBS or medical degree, it took them 5 years to obtain their degree. if they want to specialise, they need another 5-6 years before becoming a specialist in their chosen field.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) their profession deals with life and death and treatment of diseases and surgery. do you feel safe with an untrained doctor in the underground world operating on you?</p>

              <p>I can tell you a AST (advanced specialist trainee) pay is almost 7k. a HOD pay in a public hospital is 25k. so you can deduce how much pay is AC, consultant and senior consultant. by the way, a senior consultant is usually the HOD of a public hospital. as for professorship, you need to teach at NUS, sort of a title in the teaching profession. most are associate professors in public hospitals. those doctors who are senior in the profession and teaching for decades, are full professors. those doctors and professors teaching at NUS, are either senior consultants, associate or professors. our medical education are modelled after UK, but MOH has decided to switch it to the american model, ACGME and residency programmes.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>most of the specialists are visiting consultants to other public and private hospitals. they only go there maybe once a week there. other that that, they stay at their own hospitals tending to their clinics, teaching and doing administrative work in the department. other times, those senior doctors head a committee in their hospital, such as the onset swine flu. MOH also appoint them to head STC(specialist training committee) taking in BST and AST. this model is going to switch to the american model of ACGME in future.</p></div>

              <p>for BST to proceed to AST, you need to pass FRCS or MRCP, depending on which specialisation you are. there are about 35 specialisations in the field of medicine in Singapore, although sports medicine is going to be a specialist in its own right in future, as is family medicine.</p>
