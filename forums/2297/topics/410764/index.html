              <p>personal opinion is to take the cheapest one and take the effort to study...if U dun want to put in the effort...give U all MOE teachers also no use....private schools(at least for O/A levels) are primarily not schools...they are private commercial entities out to make a profit...and to have profits...most of the time...the quality of the teachers will suffer...U need luck to have good ones...for those subjects with bad teachers...U still need to study on ur own.</p>
              <p>Also...have a look at <a title="http://www.ite.edu.sg/cet/ge/index.htm" href="http://www.ite.edu.sg/cet/ge/index.htm">http://www.ite.edu.sg/cet/ge/index.htm</a></p>
              <p>They used to use MOE teachers...I believe its still the same now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw now is Sept...O levels is not done yet....how come U are thinking of retaking liao?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if U still can retake in govt school next year and can take the insults....govt school is still the better option in terms of teaching quality.</p>

              <p>maths and science ar....retake science must have lab lessons one....check out the ITE link I posted...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how ar?...like I said...since ur grades are borderline pass...and maths and science are weak...most likely poly courses are out...not sure about ITE...</p>
              <p>Consider the possibility of going back to retake at ur secondary school....U might take a bit of heat there...but its much better than spending 8.5K a year just to keep urself out of army(if U are a guy) and retake.</p>
              <p>if U really dun want to go back...then private tuition looks to be a better option unless U are a guy...cos U need a school to give U a deferment letter to stay away from army...also depends on how good the rest of ur grades are.</p>
              <p>Example</p>
              <p>English- C6</p>
              <p>2nd language - C6</p>
              <p>maths - F9</p>
              <p>Science - F9</p>
              <p>Humanities - C6</p>
              <p>Maths+Science retake until A1</p>
              <p>English- C6</p>
              <p>2nd language - C6</p>
              <p>maths - A1</p>
              <p>Science - A1</p>
              <p>Humanities - C6</p>
              <p>like that also 20 points...can go poly....but maybe the more popular ones U also cannot get in.Which course U eyeing anyway?</p>

              <p><br>Negative.</p>
              <p>The cut-off point (COP) for each course is different from each other due to many factors. Popular courses like Mass Comm or Biomedical Scienes will command a lower COP. The COP and number of places offered in a course have a direct relationship between each other. If Mass Comm offer 50 places, the COP will be lower (implying more capable students) due to high competitive.</p>
              <p>What you have heard may be rumours. GCE O Level graduates with 18 points may still get into a local polytechnic for courses like Engineering and Sports Sciences. And 13 is not the norm.</p>
              <p>I hope I have cleared your misconception.</p>

It is <strong>quite reputable in the industry</strong>. <br>Link: <a href="http://www.bmc.edu.sg/academics/">BMC</a> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>ITE General Education (GCE prep course). Usually classes are held at night. They have good lab facilities. The staff are well-trained and most of them are from MOE. Generally, it is the <strong>most suitable for everyone</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>Citycollege, a subsidary/affiliate of City Harvast Church. Have a good reputation. <strong>A good percentage of private student retaking O Levels are from Citycollege</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>This is the route that you will take. Of course, as mentioned, you need to get the letter from the private school.</p>

              <p>Hello there darkness hacker!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, yeah its true. Ive also heard the bad reputaiton of MDIS. Same goes for JBS (Jamiyah Business School).</p>
              <p>What I fear of going to preperatory private schools is that they will ask you to do independent studies instead of them teaching, which is akin to having an RP type of teaching, which is what my friend at JBS told me. -.-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since uve given me the suggestion of the latter and former, Im now considering to either taking preperatory classes either in BMC and ITE now.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can enlighten me the pros and cons of both taking preperatory classes at BMC and ITE? Perhaps maybe in terms of fees, time schedules, administration, reputation of teachers and the fact that ITE has MOE teachers copared to BMC?</p>

              <p>ITE General Programme offers only English, Mathematics, Science (Phy/Chem) as at AY2009. It is just these three.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, BMC offer almost a complete range of subjects under their GCE O Level Prep course. Subjects like F&amp;N are not BMC forte.</p>
