                      As far as preparation for H2 Chemistry is concerned, O level Chemistry (whether combined or pure) is too oversimplified and thus rather useless. The most effective way to prepare for any H2 subject ahead of your school, is of course to find a good tuition. But if you intend to go it alone (ie. self-preparation), then use A level materials, not O level materials. It'll be a much steeper learning curve than what you've previously encountered at O levels of course, but you can still learn a lot through self-study of the topics ahead of your school lectures and tutorials.<br><br>Recommended Books for H2 Chemistry :<br><a href="http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry</a>

              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p> I am a chemistry tutor too. I find www.chemguide.co.uk very useful as it is rather simplified. You can start from the foundational topics first.</p>
              <p>You can revise mole concept and atomic structure first as JCs may teach these topics first. There is a change of syllabus for the new JC1s so JCs may restructure their teaching schedules and orders.</p>
              <p>Later on in JC life, you may go on to my website <a href="http://alevelchemistry.blogspot.sg">http://alevelchemistry.blogspot.sg</a> for some tips.</p>
              <p>Best regards.</p>

              Actually, no matter how good a book is, it's useless if you do not practice.
                              
              I know of one book series that is quite popular. It is a thick book by one local company. At the back cover of it got one newspaper article which says how one student use their book and got good results. The physics one is red colour. I cannot remember the name of the company. I do not know if Popular still have sell, but I think still have.
                                  
              Go for tuition. I am sure there is at least one well-known tuition centre (with many testimonials outside the centre) near your house. Stalford is quite good. At the tuition centre, there are practices... If you do not understand anything can ask.
