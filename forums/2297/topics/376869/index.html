              <p>@ Yihao Why must i reply leh :p Even though he is my SP junior la.</p>
              <p>Anyway, poly semster cannot be retaken. A poor 1st sem results doesn't mean you are doom but it does mean you need to seriously work hard for your other semesters if you still want to get into uni. Currently about 3.3-3.4 is the minimum requirement to get into a chemistry course.</p>
              <p>However regardless which of the chem course u are taking in SP since they have split the former DCP into 4 diff dip now, i would say the 1st yr contents are rather easy and revision base more than alot of new content. If you are not able to handle even them now, i really doubt you would ever be ready for uni.</p>

              <p>To add on on to this, the reason why much fewer people enter uni from poly in the past is that because many ( Not all -_- ) people who enter poly back then are those with the mindset that " I cannot enter JC, I don't want to go ITE " or " I want somewhere not as pressurizing as JC ", so they enter poly.</p>
              <p>It is different nowadays, as many students see the advantages of entering a poly, so even 6 pointers choose poly over JC, and thus the people entering uni from poly are gradually increasing over the years. </p>

              <p>lets avoid sidetracking from the main topic......</p>
              <p>case in point, a marketing student a local polytechnic with a gpa of 3.8 couldn't make it to NUS, the student actually ranks within the top percentile of all poly graduates with a merit certificate. </p>
              <p>now, this show that competition is much stiffer across all courses and uni requirements are tougher to meet. further, one main advantage which all JC students enjoy over poly students is they are given priority seats in Tertiary institutions.</p>
              <p>This can be pinned down on the government subsidy that all local students are entitled to during the school registration process. Under the government subsidy, a student can have his school fees subsidized by more than half the actual course fees over 3 years. </p>
              <p>The government subsidy kicks into action as soon as one is admitted into a polytechnic or university, but it doesn't apply to JC students. Thus, poly students would have enjoyed double the government subsidy if they were to enter a local university. It would not make economic sense to increase the proportion of poly students eligible to enter university even if they achieve excellent results. </p>

              <p>lets avoid sidetracking from the main topic......</p>
              <p>case in point, a marketing student a local polytechnic with a
              gpa of 3.8 couldn't make it to NUS, the student actually ranks
              within the top percentile of all poly graduates with a merit
              certificate. </p>
              <p>now, this show that competition is much stiffer across all
              courses and uni requirements are tougher to meet. further, one main
              advantage which all JC students enjoy over poly students is they
              are given priority seats in Tertiary institutions.</p>
              <p>This can be pinned down on the government subsidy that all local
              students are entitled to during the school registration process.
              Under the government subsidy, a student can have his school fees
              subsidized by more than half the actual course fees over 3
              years. </p>
              <p>The government subsidy kicks into action as soon as one is
              admitted into a polytechnic or university, but it doesn't apply to
              JC students. Thus, poly students would have enjoyed double the
              government subsidy if they were to enter a local university. It
              would not make economic sense to increase the proportion of poly
              students eligible to enter university even if they achieve
              excellent results. </p>

              <p>3.8 depends also on the courses he applies for. If you apply for business courses, they are alot harder to enter than trying for engineering or science courses so that is not definitel.</p>
              <p>A course that someone from poly with 3.8 cannot enter, A A's student will also require AAA/B or so to enter since i got a friend who from JC getting AABB tried 3 years and still could not get into NTU accountancy even though he was long accepted by NUS.</p>
              <p>Don't forget poly entry to uni looks at the O's as well. If you did badly for your O's then even 4.0 might not get you into the course when someone 3.8 got in just because the latter did alot better in O's.</p>

              <p>20% is not cap by course though so courses like business has less and engineering has alot of them.</p>
              <p>The influence of the foreigners can't be determined base on that 20% alone since it varies among all the courses.</p>

              <p>Nah hes lying.</p>
              <p>If you do get a perfect score for all the next 5 sems, you will get a GPA for about 3.6+</p>
              <p>However, if you want a chance in uni. You will have to score about 3.7 for your next 5 sems on average to pull up your grades to 1 that gives you a chance in local uni. However that also depends on what is your O's results since that has a decently huge % in computing your score for uni entry.</p>
              <p>Mind saying which dip you doing or pm me if you don't want to make it public.</p>
