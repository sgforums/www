              <p>Don't think about suicide so easily.... </p>
              <p>Being unable to enter NUS is not the end of the world. Just to let you know, I give up the chance of entering NUS to appeal my way into NIE.</p>
              <p>Don't jump over to JC unless you have planned what subjects you want to take. You will need 2 more science subjects besides chem and an arts subject. </p>
              <p>The best thing for you to do now is to wait till the end of your 1st year, then decide whether you should switch over to another Diploma course or not. </p>

              <p>Please update your facts. The amount of people getting into uni
              from poly is totally dependent on how well they themselves do and
              there is no % cap on the number of poly students getting into uni
              which is rising very significantly as the years go by with more and
              more top scorers deserting the JC route and taking the poly

              <p>actually, that particular fact was only one-year old, when this promoter from sp came to my school and told us about it. while it is true that almost 70% of poly students went on to <span style="color: #ff0000;">pursue</span> a degree a year upon graduation, it is unclear how many actually acquired a degree, or could even enroll into a local university. <br><br>and i'm referring to universities like nus and ntu, which are amongst the top 100.</p>
              <p>sure, there is no percentage cap on the admission of poly students, but there are certain academic requirements such pupils must qualify to enter. in other words, what i'm saying is, only about 15-20% of poly graduates can meet these requirements (usually in the gpa form) and gain entry into a local university. if every poly graduate is able to attain a gpa &gt;3.8, then i have no doubt about jcs going out of business.</p>
              <p>top scorers who desert the jc route are able to attain stellar results even in a poly, and hence serve as nothing more than competitors to those who do not qualify for a jc in the first place. then it's logical to assume that a large proportion of those who make it into a uni from a poly is made up of students who are able to choose between a poly and a jc.</p>

              <p>There are alot of poly students who can get into local uni that rather go overseas. With my dip, i can get a degree from Britain uni in 1.5-2yrs, from Aust in 2 yrs since i attend all the overseas uni talks with my results since i was well above their minimum requirements for exemption and they even accept slightly weaker poly students but without the 1-2 yrs exemptions. Some of those unis have ranking even better than NUS/NTU during that time.</p>
              <p>I have a large number of classmates who prefer that route since you do pay alot more but the 1-2 yrs earlier graduation you get gives you a much faster head start in the job market or further studies and many feel that its a better route to go so don't think all poly students just aim local uni. I went local uni and i have to be stuck 4 yrs in the course. I would have graduated by now if i were overseas.</p>
              <p>There are a number of students who didn't do well for O's etc but have very good results in poly. There are also ppl who did very well for O's and do badly in poly. The education system, the lifestyle etc is very different from the usual pri/sec/jc sort of life and not everyone fares well in such an environment. A 6 pointer from O's going poly does not assure he or she will be top student in poly as we have seen people with poor entry results top their respective diplomas before.</p>
              <p>Regardless you go poly or uni, your previous education may help alittle but in general most starts on similar ground with not alot of significant advantage which often is gone by year 1 so how you fare in the future is alot more dependent on oneself and not depending on their previous results.</p>
              <p>I was from SP, i went into NTU, i know the situation in both schools quite well since i have friends from other courses and how many of my friends have went overseas and are graduating this year while i am only doing my 3rd year in uni.</p>
