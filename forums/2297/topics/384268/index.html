              <p>Not sure if this is the right forum to post, but here goes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm a sec 2 student, proceeding to sec 3 in 2010. My academic results for this year was rather sucky and therefore i was posted to the last class of my school. The subjects that the class offers is 1000% not what i even want to study. Examples are Principles of Accounts. I do not plan to be an accountant in the future or any point of time in my life. The accounting of money can also be studied by reading books on finance.  This is one subject I have no interest to study at all. Other subjects include Food &amp; nutrition. I shall not explain...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, many people would just point the finger at me and say its my fault for not studying hard. But I truly regret that and what I am asking now is a solution to this problem of mine. Any ideas? I have tried to: appeal for class transfer(three bl00dy times! all rejected) ; appeal for transfer of school(currently on the waiting list of a couple of schools). </p>
              <p>Apart from what I have already done, is there anything possible I can do? Please, no flaming and crappy answers. I hope I can get a bit of feedback here.</p>

              <p>I believe i have told u before that though your subject choices will limit your options in JC, they will hardly affect any choice of diplomas in poly since all dip courses requires english, maths and either a science or a humans so any subjects you take in sec sch will let you be eligible for them.</p>
              <p>If you do not start changing your mentality and accept the subjects you get, you are very unlikely to be able to do well and maybe even flunk ur O's and for that, its too late to start saying you regret.</p>

              <p>Hi EchoStretch,</p>
              <p>If worst comes to worst, just work hard with the current subject combination you have. Just as dkcx has kindly warned, if you do not work hard on these subjects just because you do not like them, your results will suffer, and you will find yourself unable to enter JC or Poly.</p>
              <p>Have you received any awards in any competition or contest? It  will help in your appeal to transfer school if you have something to show. Alternatively, you may wish to try asking your current teachers to write a letter for you to support your request.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Here's a crappy answer:<br>Continue studying hard, and get that cert at the end of your school period.</p>
              <p>Here's a broader answer:<br>Continue studying hard,  get that cert at the end of your school period. Meanwhile, on the sidelines, also continue to pursue the subjects that you're interested in, so that you don't lose touch of it. Eg, if it's art, continue with it. If it's literature, keep reading and inferring.</p>
              <p>I know it's difficult to focus on a subject which you have little interests on, but life is such that it throws you in situation that we all have little interest on, and it's situation like these that you can either run away from or take it on and excel.</p>
              <p>Accounting is actually not so bad after all, cos you get to apply the principles that you learn in life later on, and you won't know how beneficial, just knowing how it all works can be.</p>
              <p>It's tough that you're not able to get a transfer, and if it comes to that, then heads up and tackle it face on. Do your best, and definitely opportunities will arise soon.</p>
