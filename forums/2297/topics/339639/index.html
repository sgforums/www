                  <br> <br> </span>Your Physics Test is coming... not in a month, not in a week... but
              three days’ time! How do you make the most out of the precious hours?
              O.K. Here is some straightforward survival tips from an ex-last minute
              Physics student who has become a Physics teacher.<br><br>If you have
              the luxury of studying over the weekend for a Monday test, your chances
              of survival is very high. If you are caught in the midst of a school
              week and your test is a few school days away, you need more
              determination and discipline in order to make it! I will teach you the
              different ways to organise your preparation time effectively in both
              situations.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Survival kit:</span></span><br>Physics Text book<br>Physics Ten Years Series<br>Dig out as many physics notes and worksheets AS YOU CAN (Do not sweat if you have trouble doing this)<br>Calculator<br>Pencil case and Paper<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What to do?</span></span><br>“I hear and I forget.  I see and I understand.  I do and I remember”<br>So,
              remain calm even if you have not been very attentive in class. Do not
              bother to stare at the complicated formulas and diagrams trying to
              print the images into your brain. The secret to success in learning
              is... DOING PHYSICS! In the remaining time you have, your goal is to DO
              as many questions as you can in the topics to be tested.<br><br>Begin
              with ten year series questions first. They are the most basic and
              direct questions. Here is the secret: Read through the questions in a
              topic first even if you don’t have the knowledge or understanding to do
              them. Just read through the questions first and pick out key words and
              terms used. You are to notice what stuff are commonly asked in the
              topic. Next, be determined to attempt the questions as if you are being
              made to sit for a test. You will probably feel anxious and will only be
              able to do very few questions. After you are done with this step, close
              your eyes and reflect what are the questions that gave you the greatest
              anxiety and which keywords appeared very frequently in the topic. Do
              this no longer than 10 minutes.<br>Now, you are allowed to flip open
              the Text and SCAN through the chapter for 15 min only. Your aim is to
              pick up simple information that you have forgotten so that you can
              complete more questions that you did not do earlier on. Do not read
              into chucks of details. After this, pick up the questions again and
              this time round, you should be able to do a few more questions.<br><br>Next,
              you are allowed to open up the Text and complete the most difficult
              questions along aside. You will find that you will be more motivated to
              read through sections of information in the Text in order to solve the
              more complicated problems. Also, you would have filtered out the
              sections which you have scanned through for the simpler questions
              earlier on.<br><br>OK. You have finished the Ten year series and
              feeling more confident and relieved. Great! Now, to achieve perfection,
              take out the notes and worksheets that your teacher has given you in
              class. This is the time to read through the notes slowly and carefully
              to consolidate and summarise the facts and concepts of the topic. When
              you are done, look at the worksheets and attempt the questions again. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who have the luxury of studying over weekend:</span></span><br>Set
              up your survival kit on Friday night and place the physics textbook
              under your pillow and sleep early. Wake up at 6am on Saturday morning,
              eat a LIGHT breakfast and finish your ten year series before noon. Take
              a break at around 9 am and eat some snacks to replenish glucose for
              your brain. After lunch, if you have not finished your ten year series,
              continue to work on it. You must finish before 3pm in the afternoon.
              Spend the rest of the time before dinner reading through notes and
              running through worksheet questions. After dinner, pick up the phone
              and call up the class geek to ask for help on questions that you really
              cannot do. Ask him to give you a quick tutorial on the concepts as well
              to clear things up even more. Thank him and buy him dinner when the
              test is over. Then, continue practising the questions well into
              midnight. Go to bed and wake up around late morning on Sunday, go to
              church if you are a Christian. If you are not, meditate and pray
              according to your religious inclinations. Spend the rest of the day to
              consolidate definitions and formulas, drawing mindmaps and practising
              questions for speed.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who do not have the luxury of a weekend:</span></span><br>You
              need to block out all the after school commitments and so-called “study
              groups” with peers. Go home as early as you can, explain to people who
              want your time that you are rushing home to study for a test. Take your
              meal the very moment you reach home and start the process as prescribed
              above. But you probably can only finish ten year series on the first
              day. Then go to bed as usual, do not burn midnight oil. On second day,
              work on notes and worksheets. The next day, catch the class geek and
              schedule some time after school to consult him. Then go home and
              consolidate your stuff and practise for speed and accuracy. You would
              be ready for test the next day!<br><br>This guide applies not only to
              those studying three days before a test. It also works for those who
              are not studying last minute. It is just a tested and proven method to
              prepare for a test in the shortest time possible. I wish you all the
              best in Physics Tests!<br><br><br>ExamWorld's addition: This
              methodology can also be applied to other hard science subjects like
              mathematics, chemistry, and biology as well.<span class="postbody"><br> <br> For free questions and solutions, do visit <a href="http://examworld.blogspot.com/">http://examworld.blogspot.com</a></span></p>
