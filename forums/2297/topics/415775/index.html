              <p>Hi everybody :)</p>

              ...</span></p>
              <p>I am very confused and in dilemma:(:(<span class="postbody"><br> I have a son who previously studied at Senior High School 1 in Surabaya,
              <br> so he'll be a returning singaporean i think...
              <br> <br> He supposed to attend sec 3 next year. 
              <br> <br> However, because of our
              <br> sudden move in the end of the year, i'm afraid he will not cope well 
              with the english especially.
              <br> furthermore, there will be streaming in the end of sec 2 .
              <br> So I think it will be better for him if he sits in Sec 2 next year.
              <br> <br> BUT.. <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_idea1.gif" border="0" alt="Idea"> <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="Very Happy"> <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="Very Happy"> <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_love.gif" border="0" alt="Love"> <br> If it's like then he will be looked bad..
              <br> all senior high school 1 indonesian students who move to singapore will 
              directly go to sec 3 after a half-month preparation in languge centre.
              <br> Moreover, going back to sec 3 has been a level downward. So, if
              <br> my son will study in sec 2, he will be 2 level downwards.
              <br> <br> I'm afraid universities and schools will think it as a bad things. 
              <br> BUT actually it is not. It's because our sudden move.
              <br> My major concern if he sits in sec 3 directly is:
              <br> -His O level score (especially in english) will be mediocre
              <br> -he can't excel in his cca or do HMTL
              <br> -HE WILL BE LIMITED IN HIS STREAMING and it'll affect his JC
              <br> <br> But, if he do sit in sec 2:
              <br> -he'll be able to transfer, but when they look at his educational 
              background... <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_banghead.gif" border="0" alt="Bang Head"> <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_yikes.gif" border="0" alt="Yikes!"> <img src="http://www.kiasuparents.com/kiasu/forum/images/smiles/icon_idea1.gif" border="0" alt="Idea"> <br> -EDUCATIONA BACKGROUND will be abit distracting especially

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  What is really important is for your child to fit into the system first.</p>
              <p>  It is okay for him to start at a lower level. What is most crucial is to allow him to build a strong foundation and excel at O-level later. With good results, there is no problem for further education regardless of background.</p>
              <p>  Good luck! Focus on the Now rather than worry too much about the future. The future is made Now, if you could see that :)</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>A few years of age difference will not be a problem for uni admission. There are plentiful of undergraduates going in at 25/26 to NTU/NUS, so your focus should be on grades rather than age.</p>
              <p>Don't bother about the 2 CCA points unless your son is able to excel in his studies, or be able to do relatively well at the minimal. These 2 points usually will require high participation and a lot of hardwork and effort put in into the CCA. Hence, if his studies is wobbly or below-par, his main focus should be the studies.<span style="font-size: 15.6px;"> </span></p>
              <p>I will be honest with you, if your son is having trouble with sec2/sec3, he will have to seek tuition (A.K.A. The necessary Singapore evil <span style="font-size: 15.6px;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span><span style="font-size: 15.6px;">). You will have to be prepared to loosen your pockets then.</span></p>

              i know they will not look at his age. but they will look
              your past academic results right. how if they knew thet my son supposed to go to sec 3) but chose to go sec 2, then would my son be disadvantaged and considered *weak* at his 
              academic ability even his results are good (eg.  US uni like UCal, NYU, etc), or UK unis , or ri?)? i can hope so he can *only hope* right?
              i'm really confused..

              <p>You are overworrying, though it is understandable that you are very worried for your son.</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as "must go to sec 3 because of senior high 1". There are plentiful of China students here, including some acquaintances of mine, who choose to study JC, despite completing its equivalent in China already. In the end, they still enter uni all the same. There are also many P5 foreign students who have completed the sec1/2 equivalent in China as well.</p>
              <p>For foreign top unis in us/uk, age is one thing, but the most important thing is results, transcripts and portfolio. They will be more concerned about what your son has done in areas both inside and outside academics, who are the ones who are writing in for him, so on and so for. If age is a main concern, you will not see 27/28 years old students entering harvard/cambridge. In fact, if you read around the internet, you will realise that some of those graduates from harvard has actually repeated a year in high school, because they weren't hardworking back then.  </p>

              <p>Sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>You must choose the 6 choice schools carefully when your child's SPERS results are known. Choose those schools that have taken in many returning students with special programmes / classes to help the returning students to catch up / adjust to Singapore standards.</p>
              <p>So, you need not worry further and you should enrol your child for Secondary 3 next year.</p>
