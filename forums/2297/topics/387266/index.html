              <p>Hello everyone! ,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all , thank you for stopping by my little timid thread about 'ITE' to 'MASTERS'. Now , i'm currently in my first year of NITEC (jan 2010 intake) at AMK or CW-AM. well , I've taken my GCE 'N(A)' Levels in the year 2009 as a school candidate and i got 16 as my cut-off point aggregate but failed EL - I got it denoted as 'U' for it. i cried for nearly 4 days of regret and i begged at my parents to let me pursue my studies at MDIS College by taking GCE 'O' Level and quit that miserable ITE..but they deny because my family is from a low-income category. everytime i enter ITE , i always felt that there's no hope coming here..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now , i want to ask you guys these...please answer honestly.</p>
              <p>I'm planning to take my GCE 'O' level - Night class at MDIS college?</p>
              <p>but i'll be still studying in the ITE? what will you say? it is good..?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well , honestly i don't deserve to be in ITE! i deserve to be in JC!!!</p>
              <p>(my opinion)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ITE in AMK is the most shitiest infratructure i've ever seen and i don't dare to go to the toilets and canteen over there because i really look down towards ITE...(no offence) it makes me throw up when i see someone eating in the 'refugee canteen' not 'cafeteria'..</p>

              <p>i have got a fren who started out as ITE.. and he end up with a PhD. not kidding. he was my mate in uni... till phd.... now married and staying in UK doing research. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but it does took him a while to reach there. So if that is what u want, try ur best and go for it. Not easy, but aint impossible either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a side note, he got his degree &amp; phd in uk.</p>

              <p>for a start, u should learn not to look down on ITE, nor think that you are too good for it when u didn't make it in the first place</p>

              <p>Supposedly you take your O Levels while in MDIS, can you handle it when you can't even handle it the first time round?</p>
              <p>Choose just one, I believe in second chance. I failed my O Levels first time round and yet was still stuck in a viral loop, believing in what you are believing in right now.</p>
              <p>I suggest you should just take up O Levels and do it once again, I failed my first attempt for O Levels and the world seemed to crashed down on me, everyone around me looked down on me except for my parents especially my father who so desperately went around asking for opinions just so that I could continue my education.</p>
              <p>I was like you, I felt that ITE was under me but my results said otherwise, I just wanted to go anywhere but ITE. I even had the same idea as you, take private O levels while enrolled in MDIS.</p>
              <p>After that episode, I went back to my secondary school and took my O Levels a second time and right now, I'm on track to enter a government university through polytechnic.</p>
              <p>If you really have the determination, I bet you could do better than me and go straight into a JC instead.</p>
              <p>Also, I never believed in private education because I think it's usually half a pail.</p>
              <p>Good luck, if you ever need someone to consult with, you can drop me a PM.</p>
              <p>One thing though, i assume N(A) Levels is N Levels? Scoring 16 should already wake you up, at this current state, you definitely are not JC material and would even struggle at a struggling level. Though who knows what might happen if you worked alot more hader?</p>

              <p>Seriously speaking, if you dislike ITE, the school so much. I suggest you go out and work now and earn your keep and then use it to fund your private studies.</p>
              <p>I didn't want to go to ITE (the school itself) too. I'm not going to lie, but the reason why I paid more to go to a commercial school to study higher nitec is because I want that cert to progress to a polytechnic. But since that goal has been watered down, I've decided to instead pursue a pivate diploma then to a degree. I don't want to waste anymore time dragging since i'm already in my early 20's.</p>
              <p>I failed my O's too but didn't want to retake simply because I lack the motivation and i'm the type to pass and go and try not to retake.</p>
              <p>Oh well, lesson learnt. So now, I just do what i'm suppose to do and also pursue my own interest at the same time.</p>

              <p>the question is not whether it is possible or not, but whether you want to or not.</p>
              <p>if you really want to, then put in the effort and work on it. no amount of external affirmation is going to matter if you yourself aren't going to put in what's necessary to reach your goals.</p>

              <p>One of my current g/f.</p>
              <p>Lets call her A.</p>
              <p>She dropped out of Secondary School.  Went over to Australia to try to get a diploma.</p>
              <p>Instead, she got pregnant to a abusive boyfriend.</p>
              <p>She runs back to Singapore to give birth.  Few years back, she manage to ran off to USA with a American lover sponsoring her for studies in USA.</p>
              <p>Now she is back in Singapore, after being dumped by her lover, trying to work out a living with her 'advance diploma' and is drawing a pay of $900/- at a nice ripe old age of 38 years old trying to feed two old folks, herself and her teenage kid.</p>
              <p>If you cannot finish off ITE or that you cannot be garanteed that you have legitimate reasons to jump a education level.  You are wasting not only yours, but everyones time.</p>

              <p>First of all , thank you for stopping by my little timid thread
              about 'ITE' to 'MASTERS'. Now , i'm currently in my first year of
              NITEC (jan 2010 intake) at AMK or CW-AM. well , I've taken my GCE
              'N(A)' Levels in the year 2009 as a school candidate and i got 16
              as my cut-off point aggregate but failed EL - I got it denoted as
              'U' for it. i cried for nearly 4 days of regret and i begged
              at my parents to let me pursue my studies at MDIS College by taking
              GCE 'O' Level and quit that miserable ITE..but they deny because my
              family is from a low-income category. everytime i enter ITE , i
              always felt that there's no hope coming here..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now , i want to ask you guys these...please answer honestly.</p>
              <p>I'm planning to take my GCE 'O' level - Night class at MDIS
              college?</p>
              <p>but i'll be still studying in the ITE? what will you say? it is
              good..?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well , honestly i don't deserve to be in ITE! i deserve to be in
              JC!!!</p>
              <p>(my opinion)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ITE in AMK is the most shitiest infratructure i've ever seen and
              i don't dare to go to the toilets and canteen over there because i
              really look down towards ITE...(no offence) it makes me throw up
              when i see someone eating in the 'refugee canteen' not
              'cafeteria'..</p>

              <p>Your statement strike a chord with me.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think I should be ruler of Earth, all beautiful women should throw themselves at me, everyone in the world should make my desires their 1st priority, if I buy lottery, then I deserve to win the 1st prize etc etc.</p>
              <p>Sadly the world is unfair and does not work the way it should (aka revolve around me).</p>
              <p>You seem to believe the grades you deserve is not what you got.</p>
              <p>Strangely, the grades which I expect my students to get is usually exactly what they get. For example, I expected 1 A1 &amp; 2 A2 from my 2 2009 NA students for the subject(s) I taught them and when the results were released, it was 3 A2s. Additionally considering that I guaranteed B3 or better or refund my tuition fees... it is weird how I didn't have to refund any fees for the more than a decade I have been a tutor. I mean... if people can fare worse than they actually deserve... how come my students all never got worse than a B3 ah? Dunno leh... I so lucky how come never strike lottery before ah?</p>

              <p>me took o levels there before. Word of advice, if you are really really determined, dont go ite, and just enrol there. But note that, the environment there is different, in any case, entering a private school to study o levels is NOT the same as your normal government school. You need a lot of determination to do well in a private school.</p>

              <p>I can bet with you. You take Private O level, confirm plus chop fail. Waste time and money. In the end still back to ITE.</p>
              <p>If you choose to retake your N levels, Just brush up your english. Get a pass. Move to sec 5. Take O level pass go poly.</p>
              <p>The reason why i say you will fail in private O level is because your english at N level is already a fail. Don't bother to think of O level.</p>
