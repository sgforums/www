              <p><br>Yes, you see, the idea is - once you (as an athlete) has conditioned your body to tolerate greater concentrations of lactic acid (by having training sessions in which you cheong anaerobic respration until you kena high lactic acid concentrations in your muscles, but you keep cheonging, shouting gloriously in Hokkien, "è¦�æ‹¼æ‰�<span style="color: #333333;">ä¼šèµ¢</span>!!!" like a raving lunatic), your body will then eventually be conditioned to tahan greater concentrations of lactic acid from anaerobic respiration which translates to you eventually being able to cheong and sprint your 2.4km the entire stretch while running over your opponent's collapsed corpses along the way.</p>

              <p><br>Both require energy. However, net result of tissue respiration is that you produce more energy (ie. ATP molecules) than you invest in during the respiration process.</p>

              stomata?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>1. The oxygen potential is higher in the cells in the spongy mesophyll layer than the layer of moisture outside the cell, therefore, oxygen would move down a concentration gradient by diffusion. The oxygen potential in the layer of moisture is higher than the intercelluar air space, therefore, oxygen would diffuse out of the layer of moisture to the intercelluar air space. By diffusion of molecules, the oxygen molecules would slowly move its way out of the leaf through a stomata. Transpiration only applies to osmosis of water( through liquid water or water vapour)</p>
              <p>2. It is the same as question 1 except in this case carbon dioxide moves to the cell as compared to question 1 oxygen moving out. Carbon dioxide would allow a plant to photosynthesize in the present of chlorophyll, light energy and water.</p>
              <p>Equation of photosynthesize is </p>
              <p>Water + Carbon Dioxide+Energy ==Light energy+Chlorophyll==&gt; Glucose+Water+Oxygen</p>
              <p>In symbols</p>
              <p>12(H2O)+6(CO2)+X(ATP)==Light energy+Chlorophyll==&gt; C6H12O6+6(H2O)+6(O2)</p>
              <p>X could be anything as ATP is energy</p>
              <p>H2 means a diatomic covalent molecule of hydrogen not 2 molecules of hydrogen</p>

              <p><br>ATP is the chemical form of energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Photosynthesis first uses light energy in the presence of chlorophyll to produce energy (in the form of ATP), which then uses this energy to rearrange the atoms of CO2 and H2O to give you glucose (which is also immediately used to synthesize amino acids, fats, etc).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aerobic (and anaerobic) Respiration is breaking apart glucose to get energy (in the form of ATP). Aerobic occurs in presence of oxygen (and takes place partly in mitochondria and partly in cytoplasm of cell) and you get more energy (more ATP molecules), compared to anaerobic respiration which occurs in absence of oxygen (and takes place wholy in cytoplasm of cell). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that photosynthesis and aerobic respiration are macham opposites, but in both cases, energy is worked with mainly in the form of ATP (there are other energy-rich molecules, you'll learn at 'A' level).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; it is about the CO2 becoming H2CO3 (carbonic acid) then diffusing through the cells &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Yes, carbon dioxide dissolves in water for form carbonic acid, H2CO3, which may be deprotonated (loss of proton or H+ ion) to form HCO3-. It is usually in this form, monohydrogencarbonate ion, that plants and animals (including humans) transport dissolved (ie. aqueous) carbon dioxide within the blood, within the film of water on mesophyll cells, on alveolar/alveoli walls, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, if asked to explain why acids react with carbonates to give you carbon dioxide gas, it is related to the discussion above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CO3 2- + 2H+ --&gt; H2CO3</p>
              <p>(carbonate ion gets protonated to form carbonic acid)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H2CO3 --&gt; CO2 + H2O</p>
              <p>(carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and water. Since carbon dioxde is a gas (at r.t.p.) and leaves the reaction mixture/solution, you get your 'efferverscence' observation.)</p>
