            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi all, Ive fairly got a GPA of 3.3 and i want to get placed into the part time NTU in the mechanical engineering course. Will it be hard for me to get in? Im taking up the part-time as ive signed up a bond with the government that ill be working for them for 3 years. Or should I break the bond and take up a full time course? But with a failry low GPA like this, will they even consider my choice even for the part-time?</p></div>

              <p>Hello</p>
              <p>You have to try it out and apply for it.</p>
              <p>Sometimes they might call you for interview or may accept you. My part time friends from NTU EEE have GPAs that are not high also.Thus, better to try applying, you might just get it. If you know what i mean.</p>
              <p>Part time studies is quite difficult in my opinion, lectures are about 3 hours, and that is after a long day at work. Sometimes during lecture phone ring got call from work.</p>
              <p>Exam may fall on weekdays and thus you may need to take leave for exam, or take leave to take time to prepare for exam</p>
              <p>Sometimes i study with part time students as well, help each other with assignments or tutorials and past year papers.</p>
              <p>Some part timers who have family have to sacrifice family time to study during weekends for the exams.</p>
              <p>Most important for fulltime/part time is to have a group of friends who can study tgt and help each other during exams/quiz. Else very hard in uni.</p>

              <p>@MyPillowTalks Thank you for guiding me and also my friends say it is easier to get into NUS Mechanical Engineering part time course than NTU. Is it true? Do you have any idea on this? And part timers have to learn more than half of the modules by themselves is it? </p>

              <p>I am not sure if it is easier to get into NUS or NTU, i do not know their selection criteria.</p>
              <p>However, from personal opinions and what we "see", GPA of 3.3 seems to have a high chance of getting into the NTU part time course. However this is just our "opinions" and from what we "gauge", u have to try to apply to know if they accept you. Must try to apply.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just asked my friends from NTU Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, they said that the professors will teach the module. Each lecture is about 3 hours, two lessons per week i think. 7-10PM. Tiring.</p>
              <p>However, as they are trying out some new online learning platform, some lectures will be online, meaning the lecture video is prerecorded, and halfway through the lectures there will be some questions which must be answered before u can move on with the next part of the lecture.</p>
              <p>What is important is to have friends (part time/full time doesnt' matter) who will sit down and discuss together nearing to the exam period/quiz period. Must network very big, must have access to many resources and tips.</p>
