              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  This thought has been inspired by a Dharma talk by Ajahn Brahm that I heard recently.</p>
              <p>  How do students typically respond when they make a mistake or get stuck in mathematics? My experience is that many feel stupid within or cringe in embarassment with some unkind remark that belittles their mathematical self-esteem. In doing so, one may run into a serious risk of thinking that he/she is stupid, rather than seeing that act as a silly one from which one can really learn from and grow in mathematical maturity.</p>
              <p>  One helpful method is to acknowledge that the mistake or mental block has been a silly act that was without intention, instead of saying "oh, how stupid I was!" We ought to learn to forgive our silly acts and remember more of our successes, so that we can progress upward in a virtuous cycle instead of a vicious one.</p>
              <p>  To all JC students who will be facing midyear exams soon, good luck and be kind to your silly acts. Sadhu sadhu sadhu!</p>
              <p>  Thank you.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>To me, Math is about logical reasoning and nothing else. </p>
              <p>The challenge is to find logic in the math problem that you are doing.</p>

              <p>One more thing. Sometimes you need to see how it is done at least once. Then the next time the question type appears, one will be able to do it again.</p>
              <p>That's how schools and tutors train their students: question types. There's no necessity to engage tutors to do so; one can look through, identify and practice the individual question types themselves as well. School teachers and tutors are merely facilitators to learning; the ultimate hardwork still comes from the student.</p>

              <p>Important thing is to learn from the mistakes, and try not to make the same mistake again</p>
              <p>With regards to careless mistakes, try and discover which are the most common careless mistakes you make, i.e. minus sign, division, etc... So during exams, take special care in these areas to minimize the carelessness.</p>
