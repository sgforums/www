              Yes, you're right. Imagine it's a freezing icy winter night. Which would keep you warmer (ie. shield you from the cold), a thick (ie. non-diffused) wooly jacket or a thin (ie. diffused) silk shirt?
              <br><br>
              For A level purposes (are you a student or a tutor? are you Singaporean taking the Singapore H2 syllabus, or you're a foreigner taking international A levels?), just use any analogy to help yourself understand. Cambridge will *not* require the A level candidate to explain the technical details of how the degree of diffusiveness of the orbital affects the strength of its shielding effect.

              Yes, that's right.

              Excellent. I noticed that your "bluepie" user account is new. You created a SgForum account just to discuss Chemistry here? (I'm proud of you!) Btw, how did you find out that you can discuss Chemistry here at SgForums?

              Ahhh that's good to hear! You're totally welcome to freely post your questions here, but as for 'answering all sorts of chemistry doubts', that's true insofar as : if it's within the H2 Chem syllabus, I'll address it. If it's beyond the H2 Chem syllabus, depending on my personal interest in that particular topic , I'll either decide to comment on it, or if not, I'll direct you to <a href="http://www.chemicalforums.com/">http://www.chemicalforums.com/</a>.

              <p>Hi i have another question relating to the atomic radius of transition metals.</p>
              <p>for element 1-20, going across a group, <strong>screening effect remains constant </strong>and the only factor affecting atomic radius is due to the increasing nuclear charge and thus increasing attraction between valence electrons and positive nucleus. </p>
              <p>However, such a trend is not observed for transition metals; their atomic radius stays relatively unchanged even with increasing proton no. This is because electrons are added into the inner 3d subshells and not 4s subshell, and hence the<strong> screening effect increases. </strong>(is it correct to say this?) The increasing screening effect offsets the the increase in nuclear charge and thus attraction between 4s electrons and nucleus is relatively same. Hence, atomic radius remains relatively unchanged. </p>
              <p>Are my explanations correct or is there a better way of phrasing it?</p>

              Your answer is correct.<br><br>
                          JC students commonly have difficulty with this topic, because it's just like the classic accountant joke (the boss is hiring and interviewing a physicist, a mathematician, a IT guy and an accountant; the boss asks, "what's 2 + 2?" The physicist, a mathematician, and IT guy each give a similar expected answer, with technical variants depending on their different backgrounds. When it comes to the accountant, the accountant replies, "What do you want it to be, boss?". The accountant got the job).<br><br>
                          For the qn, "<i>Why do d block elements have smaller atomic radii compared to s block elements?</i>", students are expected to state, "<b>3d orbitals are poor shielders!</b>"<br><br>
                          In contrast, for the qn, "<i>Why do the atomic radii and 1st ionization energy of d block elements remain relatively invariant across the period?</i>", students are expected to state, "<b>3d orbitals are effective shielders!</b>"<br><br>
                          The key to understanding this apparent contradiction, is of course (Einstein would be proud) : Relativity.
                          <br><br>
                          <b><i>For the same electron shell</i>, when compared to the 3s and 3p orbitals, 3d orbitals are poor shielders because of their shape. Hence d block elements have smaller atomic radii compared to s block elements.
                          <br><br>
                          At the same time, 3d orbitals (being part of the less diffused 3rd electron shell) provide more effective shielding compared to 4s orbitals (being part of the more diffused 4th electron shell). Accordingly, as we go across the period, because the additional electron is added into the 3d orbitals, which provide relatively more effective shielding compared to the 4s orbitals, and consequently the slight increase in relatively effective shielding by the additional 3d electron, partially offsets or counters the increase in nuclear charge, resulting in the relative invariance of the atomic radii and 1st ionization energy of the d block elements across the period.</b>
                          <br><br>
                          Anyway, that's just my own phrasing. Your phrasing is already perfectly fine, and will gain you full credit by Cambridge in the A levels.
                          <br><br>
                      Edited : Oh, in case some students are still wondering, "<i>If for the 2nd period, the shielding effect remains constant, then why doesn't the shielding effect also remain constant for the d block elements?</i>"
                          <br><br>
                      <b>The reason is : even for period 2, the shielding effect isn't absolutely constant. It does increase slightly across the period, when more electrons are added. But because electrons are added to the 2nd electron shell (which is the <i>outermost </i> valence shell), hence shielding effect from the 2nd electron shell is relatively negligible (shielding effect is mostly effective from <i>inner</i> shell electrons). In contrast, for the d block elements, the additional electron is added into the 3d orbital (which is part of an <i>inner</i> electron shell), which <i>does</i> provide significantly effective <i>additional</i> shielding effect for the outer 4s electrons, which are the electrons involved in determining atomic radii and 1st ionization energy.</b>
