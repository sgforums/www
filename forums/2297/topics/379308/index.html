              <p>The O level's approaching and I'm sure many of you here are frantically preparing for this major exam. Well, I must confess, I pretty much like studying and don't feel it's a chore since I've been a pretty much consistent worker in my 4 years of sec school. But has anyone of you ever "spaced out" in the midst of studying and wonder to yourself,"why am I studying so hard?"</p>
              <p>The realistic answer, to have a good future, of course. Then I'd ponder again, when I grow up, I merely want to get myself involved in things like humanitarian organizations, set up a tuition centre(maybe),  and do something i really like. My peers all see me as the great worker, who tries to strike a balance between hanging out with them and working real hard at school work at the same time. Of course, I do get quite remarkable grades in school. However sometimes I really want to "drop" all this studying obligations, go do something that is meaningful to me. No, I don't despise people who like studying because I love that myself. But I'm not very obsessed with that. I just enjoy learning, revising and of course, I must admit, there's a sense of personal glory. Till now, the main reason I can think of why I should still study is to secure a good future... a reason which I am not convinced of. I mean, studying is not just to get a good future, but reasons which I do not know of.</p>
              <p>Have you all ever felt this way? Haahaa, i know this's a weird question to ask. Best of luck for all your O's!</p>

              <p>I believe Yihao questioned that before sometime back as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you are interested in volunteery work, you can consider volunteering at family service centers, youth centers etc who often needs people to volunteer as tutors, to conduct events etc etc</p>

              <p>Hi Audi,</p>
              <p>  It is good to ask often why we do the things we do :)</p>
              <p>  Do search your heart and you'll find out the answer(s) one day.</p>
              <p>  In the meantime, use happiness as a yardstick. Do you feel happy and at peace doing this thing?</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>i felt this way...sometime back too. ure taking the O's not so bad. im taking the A's and theres really a lot a lot a lot to study. sometimes i ask myself what i slug through all these shit for. i kind of have no obligations to work like a horse or cow or goat or w/e. i think the problem with this education system is that it is focused too highly on grades. i know getting good grades seriously dosent mean much(of a person), but it does mean the liberation of certain circumstances for some people. eg if youre not that well off -&gt; can aim for scholarships, helps to relieve your family off that financial pressure(of course you must be interested in that bonded job that comes with it as well). </p>
              <p>so probably, if you know there's something that you really want in life, perhaps you will be better mentally prepared to slug it through with this education system and give it your all. however, simply put, dont think too much, it will many times get u feeling a bit...frustrated over this issue. (:</p>
              <p>on a side note i read that youre scoring pretty good grades. rmb never to be complacent about your grades esp. at this kind of time, you'll never expect the number of people who might surpass your grades at this last minute.</p>
