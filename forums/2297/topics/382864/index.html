              <p>How well are you faring in ur lower sec science and how high is ur interest in science?</p>
              <p>For double science, any plans for what you might want to do in future? If you totally have no plans, its best to take physics since it gives you more options in future compared to biology.</p>

              <p>You can get into JC regardless what subjects you take as long as you do well in them. However your choices of subjects will obviously affect the type of subjects you can take in JC.</p>
              <p>If you really feel you are not a science person, no point doing triple science but physics regardless whether you want do engineering or not, its more useful than biology unless you want another memory subject. Physics is closer to maths in the sense it has alot of calculations while biology is the most memory intensive of the 3 sciences.</p>
              <p>Humans are harder to most because they require alot more memory work and writing/analytical skills compared to the sciences which is more facts base and either you know or dunno. Diff people do better in diff situations so don't just listen to what others say since you are not them and their strengths/weakness may not be same as you.</p>

              <p>Hi Peaceoutdude828,</p>
              <p>In the past, not having triple Sciences do affect your chances of taking up university degree courses such as medicine, but that no longer applies now. The main advantage in taking triple Sciences nowadays lie in the fact that it gives you a broader and deeper knowledge background and understanding. </p>
              <p>It is not true that Pure Sciences is definitely more easy than Pure Humanities. Different people have different strengths, thus there will definitely be people who will find the latter easier than the former and vice-versa.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Pure geog requires abit more application of knowledge than history which is abit more pure vomitting of what you studied. Both are quite demanding writing task so if you are intimidated by them, both will be about the same in that sense.</p>
              <p>I never did hist since i was a pure geog student but i feel that geog knowledge has slightly more application and use than history though i would say i totally have 0 interest in history so that could be a cause.</p>
              <p>Generally i always advice people not to make any decision purely because of friends. I've met people who even choosing of poly and uni courses chose it because they friends did and in the end regret cause it was not their interest. Do note that alot of times you are on your own. Not studying the same subjects doesn't mean you will loss your friends and being in a different class might even give you the chance to make new friends and expand your circle of friends.</p>

              <p>Hi Teenybean,</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you take up History. This is because as you have stated, you have confidence in doing well for both of the subjects, and that you are someone easily affected by the people in your surroundings. </p>
              <p>If you are to enter the Geography class and do not get along well with your classmates, it will gradually affect your studies in Geography lessons. This will in turn have a negative impact on your Geography results. </p>
              <p>If you are to enter the History class, you will have the support of your friends, though most importantly, you must work hard yourself.</p>
              <p>History is a lot about memory work and some interpretation. The good thing about it is that if you put in the effort and memorise and understand the events, you will be able to score high marks. The downside is that if you do no put in adequate effort, it is easy to fail it as well, as the questions are usually quite straight forward without multiple answers.</p>
              <p>I hope this helps.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
