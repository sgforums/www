              <p>if you are willing to spend extra money, one cunning way is to
              take more than the recommended number of modules... and do it by
              taking them in special semesters... Study extremely hard to get As
              for these modules to pull up your grades</p>

              <p>I have a friend who did that but only manage to get a B at the end because the pace was way too fast. Is it true? <br>And anyway, $600 plus for one module in special sem is really... expensive man. LOL.</p>

              <p>Oh, yr taking Jap. No wonder. I took Jap too. Very demanding in terms of workload haha. But I enjoyed it very much. If you perservere to Jap 5 or 6, I think yr command of Japanese will be very amazing. Haha. Which sensei is teaching Jap 2?</p>
              <p>(tell you a harsh truth, studying for Japanese might pull down yr major's CAP due to the long hours required.. but I still can remember the kaiwas I had to "perform" from Jap 1, so many years from now haha.)</p>
              <p><br>If the old prof is still teaching bacterial plasmids for 1102, study hard for that. Because the scope he teaches is very little, the questions he can set are very limited. Ie draw and label the plasmid etc. That was 4 years ago though so I donno whether this advice is relavant.</p>
              <p>(My time, 1103 was closed book essay qn. So there were people who actually failed biodiversity. lol. but not relavant to your concerns so nvm.)</p>

              <p>Glad that you are mugging hard. Yes full marks is obtainable and many students do perform excellently, so the competition every year is tough. Level 1 is tough because its easy.. quite a paradox.</p>
              <p>I'd say, choose your GEM and SS modules very wisely so it doesn't interfere with the language and core module studies. S/U the B- and vow to do better.  Might want to consider saving the S/Us for Jap 3 and above though. Since year 2 will be as crazy as hell.</p>

              <p>Yeah, its interesting and fun. I always felt year 1 is the best time to take Japanese, because the workload is still relatively light. Quite easy to make friends there too, compared to science classes, lol.</p>
              <p>Yeah, not easy to do well for it. I spent much more time on my japanese modules than my core modules, but I wouldn't recommend that to any LS major.

              <p>Another one of my LS seniors, studied until Jap 3, took the overseas summer intensive course at Akita, came back and took Jap 6. (I think they write essays with thousands of words or something. No joke o.o ) I think he's worked as an interpretor for a while then moved to Japan for further studies or something. But he's really passionate about Japanese and japanese culture. So he graduated with a B.Sc and a strong command of Japanese.</p>
              <p>Since you are interested in Japanese, why don't you take for one more sem and see how it goes? As the above poster mentioned, S/U is actually meant for these kind of subjects.</p>

              <p>That's not true. 0.175 is a lot in CAP terms. I have a friend
              who missed 2nd upper just by 0.05.</p>

              <p>First year, first sem, 0.175 is not worth it.   </p>
              <p>Give another semester and it will be worth trying to pull that 0.175.  Like i said, the real CAP pulling starts when you can bag 3-4 A-'s  and 1 S/U option.  That will pull CAP much more effectively.</p>
