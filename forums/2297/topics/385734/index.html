              <p>Hi people,<br><br>I'm a nus freshie. Just done with my first semester. And it ended on quite a disappointing note, I would say.<br><br>I'm actually aiming for a CAP of 4.0 and above. However, my current CAP is 3.7.<br>If I were to exercise my S/U option on this module which I scored B- for, my CAP will increase to 3.875, which is nearer to my target CAP of 4.0 and above.<br><br>However, is
              it worth using the S/U option in my first semester? The difference it
              made to my CAP is an increase of 0.175. Is that considered significant?</p>
              <p>I've actually done some rough calculations on my own. Assuming that I'm able to get B+ for most of my modules next semester:</p>
              <p>If I don't use my S/U option for this semester, I will need at least 3 A- to pull up my CAP to a 4.0 next semester.</p>
              <p>If I exercise my S/U option for this semester, I will only need to get 1 A- to pull up my CAP to a 4.0 next semester.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I'm afraid that I may be getting Cs for some modules in future which may call for the need of S/U option again. Hence, I have no idea if it's wise to "waste" one of the three S/U options given to us on a module which I've score B- for.</p>
              <p>Also, I
              heard that it will get increasingly difficult to "save" your CAP as you
              take on more modules over the semesters. <br><br>So, should I or should I not
              use my S/U option in this case? Anyone care to share their insights? Thanks in advance! =)</p>

              <p>Yes, S/U the B- and study much harder next sem. Non-core modules aren't that important anyway.</p>
              <p>Did you feel that you put enough effort into your studies this semester? Try to do research on what modules are good to take. Some modules you have to struggle for a B, some modules are so easy that with consistent effort an A or A- is assured.</p>

              <p>Take into consideration how many courses you have that can be SU since different courses have different amounts of such courses. If you have alot of them, it might be abit riskly to use it so soon since you do not know what is to come in future which could be worse especially if you have alot more SUable modules.</p>
              <p>Not sure about NUS system but i assume SUs are more for electives and depending on the number of electives that you have to take, to some people its what they use to raise their GPA and to some its what cause their GPA to drop to rock bottom.</p>

              <p>I'm gonna say "save it" for now.</p>
              <p>The 0.175 increase isn't worth it.  Lets put it this way... 3.7 would still see you through to an honors program.  Just don't let it drop below 3.5 (assuming you are from certain Arts facs).</p>
              <p>If you really want to bump up your CAP, next sem, pick 3 modules from your major, and 2 outside. (ie GEK or UE thats outside ur faculty).  </p>
              <p>Work like mad for your major, and chill out for those GEKs and UE (enough to get a C).  If you get 3 A-s for that three modules, throw your 2 S/U options on the GEK/Breadth/UE and that would bump your CAP up even more than this pathetic 0.175.  </p>
              <p>I was in the same position as you, just a little more dire.  I had to throw my S/U to get my CAP to 3.5 to save my honors track. =P</p>

              <p>3.7 for the very first semester is still not a very dire situation. </p>
              <p>I would say to save your S/U for when you absolutely need it, i.e. if and when you actually get C+ next time. If you get another B- or below next semester, you may then want to use it.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, just work harder next semester and gradually pull your CAP up.</p>

              <p>Hi onigiri,</p>
              <p>I will strongly suggest that you do not use your S/U option now. As some of the other forummers have kindly suggested, you should use it only when you receive a grade which is very bad ( C and below ) which will have a huge impact on your overall CAP. </p>
              <p>You are currently in the first semester, so do not worry too much, as you still have quite a number of semesters to go. I have a friend with 3.6+ SAP in his first semester, who eventually received First Class Honours, thus as long as you are willing to work hard, nothing is impossible. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

                  don't let it drop below 3.5 (assuming you are from certain Arts
                  facs).</p>

              <p>That's not true. 0.175 is a lot in CAP terms. I have a friend who missed 2nd upper just by 0.05.</p>

              <p>Woo... CAP of 3.7, that is exactly the same as mine when I was in year 1 sem 1..</p>
              <p>Anyway, what course are you in? This is because different course allows you to S/U different type of modules. Also, are you from poly or JC? This is because poly students are exempted from some modules, meaning to say they have lesser electives and UE modules, therefore lesser modules to S/U, whereas for JC students, they need to do more modules than their poly counterparts and therefore they have more chances of getting bad grades and thus needing to S/U them.</p>
              <p>Anyway, dont be disheartened on your CAP of 3.7. I did badly for my first year as well, getting 3.7 in my first sem and then further dropping to 3.61 in sem 2. But then I worked hard and I got a CAP of 4++ now.</p>
              <p>From my experience, I can only say that, first, you need to work hard and get at least A- and B+ to push your cap ab above 4. First year is the year in which you will see your CAP fluctuate alot, and second year moderate fluctuation, third year, some fluctuation and last year, minor differences (0.01 to 0.1 kind).</p>
              <p>Try getting some A and A+ in your next semester and to pull your CAP higher. Do not get any B or B-. If you get a B-, you must at least get an A to counteract it, and thus giving you a B+ for both modules. Its best to have a higher CAP score in the first 2 years, and this will give you extra motivation to maintain it.</p>
              <p>However, you must also be prepared that even though I say that your CAP fluctuates less in year 3 or 4, getting a C+ or C-, would not doubt still pull your CAP down. I remembered that during my year 3, I used an A and A- to balance off my B and C+, and I can tell you, it was damn painful getting a C+.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to answer your question, yes you should S/U your B-. A CAP of 3.875 is a good starting point. Try working harder and not to get anymore B- or C. As long as you maintain a grade of B+, then you probably would not need to S/U anymore in the future as the difference between before and after S/U-ing is not going to be much.</p>
              <p>So, just S/U this module and work hard. Save your other 2 S/U options for the future in which you get a grade that is so fucking lousy that it pulls your CAP down an honours level, otherwise you probably wouldnt need to use them anymore if you study harder.</p>

              <p>Agree with above poster.</p>
              <p>S/U the B- now, because then you will psychologically push yourself to work harder. In the later semesters exercising your S/U option would not make much of a difference to your score.</p>
              <p>Really important thing is Choose Your Modules Carefully. S/Uable modules are all electives, so make sure that you take things that interest you or are easy to score.No point taking modules like Nation Building as your SS, if lets say your essay writing skills are weak.</p>
              <p>Really need to know your major, though, if the forumners can give you more specific advise.</p>

              <p>Hi people,</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot for your replies! Really appreciate it! =)</p>
              <p>I'm actually a Science student majoring in Life Sciences and I'm from JC. My friends from poly were telling me they used up their S/U options in their first semester. But like what <a href="/users/243444">MaNyZeR</a> had said, they have less S/U-able modules and hence, can afford to do so. After doing some calculation of MCs, I have around 12 S/U-able modules to take in total (inclusive of the 2 GEMS, 2 Breadths and 1 SS modules). And out of these 12, I can only choose to S/U three of them. Thus, I'm not sure if I should really exercise my S/U options right now.<br><br> Personally, I find that it's really difficult to even get an A-, let alone an A or A+. The cohort is very competitive, I would say. And because NUS goes by the bell curve system, I find myself at a disadvantage when the cohort happens to be really good. For example, for one of my core module CAs, my raw score was around 40/50 but I was awarded with a C grade as there were just too many people scoring full marks, 49 and 48. Then again, I couldn't S/U that module if I did too badly because it's one of my core modules and thus, not S/U-able.</p>
              <p>And like what many have said, we can pull up the CAP over semesters. But it gets increasingly difficult to pull up as time goes by because the modules will definitely get tougher and the impact of the results in our later years on our CAP seems to decrease over time as well since we are taking on more and more MCs. So is it true to say that the starting CAP we have is important? And thus, we should try to get a CAP as high as possible in our starting semesters?<br><br>The deadline for S/U option is tomorrow and I'm still very much caught in this delimma. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>If I were you, I will not use my S/U. Since the cohort is so tough, you shouldn't be surprised if a D popped up, so you will have to save your S/U for these emergenices.</p>

              <p>A higher CAP now or later has the same effect since yr 1-3 modules all have the same weightage and count the same to your overall CAP. Why alot of people think that later yr modules dun affect their CAP much is simply because your CAP is the overall of ALL your modules and when you have 5 modules and when you have 20 modules, obvious the effect on the 5 modules is alot more than the 20 modules.</p>
              <p>It would be best for you to try to roughly plan what are the 12 modules you plan to take that are SUable and see whether any of them you feel might be challenging for you. I have any peers who spent their SUs very quickly in 1st yr when they feel the content is tough and regret in later yrs cos the same module taken in senior yrs might be harder to score not because the module is more difficult but because the latter yrs core modules get tougher and more time is spent on them which reduce the amount of time and effort you have to spent on electives.</p>

              <p>Really have to warn you, year 2 will be extremely challenging. LSM 2101 2102 and 2103 are very hard core. :p</p>
              <p>I can understand the sentiment of A- being very difficult to obtain..</p>
              <p>Seriously buck up and study like mad. Not meant as an discouragement but as a challenge to you. It only starts to get "easier" in year 3. And much more fun, IMO.</p>
              <p>And year 4 is very interesting, challenging and fun. If you take the modules what you really enjoy..</p>
              <p>Again, encourage you to S/U now. I never understood the rationale of holding back S/Us. Or CORs bidding points. Its not as if you can cash out $1 for each point you have in your general account. but a lot of my life sci friends have thousand over points in their general account when they grad, and only bid the minimum required to get elective modules.</p>
              <p><br>What core are you taking next sem? What electives are you considering.</p>

              <p>A higher CAP now or later has the same effect since yr 1-3
              modules all have the same weightage and count the same to your
              overall CAP. Why alot of people think that later yr modules dun
              affect their CAP much is simply because your CAP is the overall of
              ALL your modules and when you have 5 modules and when you have 20
              modules, obvious the effect on the 5 modules is alot more than the
              20 modules.</p>
              <p>It would be best for you to try to roughly plan what are the 12
              modules you plan to take that are SUable and see whether any of
              them you feel might be challenging for you. I have any peers who
              spent their SUs very quickly in 1st yr when they feel the content
              is tough and regret in later yrs cos the same module taken in
              senior yrs might be harder to score not because the module is more
              difficult but because the latter yrs core modules get tougher and
              more time is spent on them which reduce the amount of time and
              effort you have to spent on electives.</p>

              <p>Yup, I get your point regarding the CAP being the same overall regardless of whether I've S/U-ed in earlier years or later years. I've roughly planned out what are the 12 S/U-able modules which I can take but I can't say for sure if I will do well in them, because like what you've said, as we move on to latter years, we will have less time and effort to spend on these non-core modules. <br><br>That's why I don't know if I should use the S/U on this B- or wait till there's a C and exercise it.<br><br>Thanks for the fab replies nonetheless! =)<br><br></p>

              <p>I think next semester I will be taking 1102 and 1103 and probably the chem module 1401 as my core modules. My peers were telling me 1102  and chem 1401 are really tough modules so I'm actually quite worried for the next semester.<br><br>As for electives, I'm thinking of taking up a freshmen seminar module (since it's 4 MCs, no exam and goes by the S/U grading without having to use up any of my S/U options) and japanese 2 module (since I thought I did pretty okay for japanese 1).<br><br>I loved 1104 and enjoyed the lectures tremendously. Though I mugged hard for it, the results weren't what I desired despite the fact that the exam is in MCQ format. The competition is really stiff.<br><br>Anyway, I've just withdrawn from my second major programme today so that the module which I got B- in can be S/U-ed if I want to do so.<br><br>So, in your opinion, I should just go ahead with the S/U-ing?</p>
