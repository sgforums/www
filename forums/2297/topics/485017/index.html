However my point is that i really want to take back my A math as i really want to go into JC , and i felt that the June Holiday is coming i can also use this chance to catch up my A math , but the Math departmenet told  me that if i didint pass my A math i must drop it .

              <p>Do you have remedial lessons in school or tuition for A Maths?</p>
              <p>Are you doing well in E Math and your other subjects? A Math is a prerequisite for H2 Maths but certain JCs may allow you to take H2 Math if you have distinction in E Math. You don't necessarily need to take A Math to go to JC but without A Math or distinction in E Math, your choice of subject combinations will be limited and you can only go to the Art Stream. In Art Stream, you could take subjects such as H2 Literature, Geography, History or Economics and H1 Maths.</p>
              <p>If you are doing well for E Math and your other subjects, try appealing again and tell your HOD you did badly due to panic and being nervous. Might want to see your school counsellor about the anxiety issues too so that it won't affect your future exams.</p>

However for the rest of subject i am not really sure about it but i will know tomorrow . I dont want to go to art stream cus i wanted to be a engineer ... thats my ambition .. Can i ask for extension  like until next term if i still cant make it i drop it? , i only scared the teacger wont listen because they already stated the term clearly .

              <p>Yea top schools usually set exam papers which are more difficult than O Levels.</p>
              <p>You will have more justification to appeal if you can cope well with your other subjects. If you fail your other subjects, your teacher might just tell you to drop A Math to concentrate on the other subjects.</p>
              <p>We don't know whether your teacher will grant you an extension or not as we aren't mind readers. Talk to your teacher humbly and tell him/her you will try to do better in the subject. The worst that could happen is just getting "No" as an answer. If your teacher still wants you to drop the subject, get your parents to help you persuade the teacher. If still cannot, then try to get distinction in E Math and go to one of those JCs which let you take H2 Math without having A Math</p>

              <p>The saving grace is you only failed one subject but you are quite weak in Maths, English and Humanities. If this were your O Level results, the L1R5 would be 21 points and you wouldn't qualify for JC. Study harder and aim for at least B3 in each subject (6x3=18 points) since your goal is to go to JC.</p>

              <p>I took my O levels last year. I failed my Prelim 1 A Maths with an F9. 26% to be exact. I was weaker than you. I wanted to get into a JC just like you. My prelim 2 score was 46%, my prelim 3 score was 69%. I got a B3 for O levels though damn. I was hoping for at least an A2 but I mucked up one of my questions so oh well. </p>
              <p>My advice to you would be to do as much A Math papers as you can. Attempt as much questions as you can from the harder topics. It is not too late trust me. I regret not working hard enough last year. I would recommend you to attempt as much topical questions as you can from the harder topics, seek assistance from your teachers to clarify your doubts and start doing full papers in preparation for your O levels from September onwards. The earlier the better.</p>
              <p>By the way, I got into a JC and I am doing H2 Maths.</p>

I will definately work hard in my Math during the June Holiday if i am given a chance again , ( i will discuss with teacher tomorrow) , however i really wanted to do very well in my exam is it causing me too much stress that i my brain cannot take it ? i remember during test my result will alwyas be a A or B it is very dissapointing to see my result today , i am at a loss ... , and can i know what A math topic to focus on? Quadratic inequalities? , my teacher have not taught me logarithm and i heard from the express that log is a very hard chapter , should i start read up the chapter on log ? . I also dont know how to convince my teacher with my disapoiting result , any advice will be great . </p></div>

              <p>I did quite a lot of quadratic inequalities. It is a good chapter to start on as it is fairly easy to master. Logarithms isn't really all that hard. It becomes rather intuitive as the questions tend to be fairly repetitive. Can you give me a list of topics you have learnt so far? That way I would be able to better assist you. If I were you, I'd probably beg like there is no tomorrow, or get my parents to write a letter to give you a second chance. The latter is most likely to be more effective as teachers tend to listen to parents anyways. As for the examination stress, the best way to counter it would be to have confidence. Trust me, if you walk into the examination hall after doing 4 practice papers and getting 80+% for all of them, you won't feel nervous at all. My best advice to you would be to for you to prepare yourself very well. </p>
              <p>So get your parents to talk to your teacher, start your work from now on before it is too late and don't get complacent once you start to do well. That was my downfall. One more thing, H2 Maths is a continuation from what you have learnt from O levels. You must master A Maths before moving on to H2 Maths. I have friends from NA doing fairly well in H2 Maths and you can most certainly be like them in the future. It just requires effort on your part.</p>

              <p>Yeah. some of my friends who got D7s consistently jumped to a B4 for Os. They did put in quite a bit of effort though. Sort of like sprinting the final 100metres in a 2.4km run.</p>

Yea i been failing my math since Sec 1 , cus i didnt really listen to teacher while they are teaching only until sec 3 i reliase my mistake i hope it is not too late now too change it .</p></div>

              <p>TS: Have you ever considered pursuing an engineering course in poly? (since you said you want to be an engineer)</p>
              <p>Your strongest subjects are POA and Chinese but after O Levels, you might not be taking POA. POA as a H2 subject is not offered in any JC and is only offered in Millennia Institute and while POA can be counted in your University Admission score, it is not a subject prerequisite for any university course. For H1 Chinese, it is not a compulsory part of the university admission score and is only included in the computation if it improves your score. The other subjects matter more. You just need to get at least S grade for H1 Chinese to meet the universities' MTL requirement.</p>
              <p>With that said, you need to work harder on your other subjects too if you want to go to JC</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I was weak in indices and surds as well. You have been given a second chance. Don't screw it up! Like I said, practice with topical exercises. My best advice would be to attempt easier questions first to get a hang of it, and quickly move up to the harder questions. Do as much as you can, and clarify with your teachers as to how to do those you can't do. Oh and Indices and Surds is a must to master. It pretty much becomes as common as addition and subtraction in JC. Polynomials is my favourite. I got highest in class for that. It pretty much boils down to practice. I strongly recommend you to study A Maths once in every 2 days at least during the June hols. That was how frequently I studied Maths. Now go and prove those who questioned your ability wrong :)</p></div>
