              <p>This is probably one of the most debated issues in Singapore education. <br><br>I invite everyone to share their views and opinions, no right or wrong answer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JC Route</strong></span><br><br>The “traditional” way of going to local university and getting a degree.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>For those who wish to enter NUS, NTU or SMU should go to JC and get a GCE A Level certificate. However, it depends on what course you wish to take and your ability. I do know of many students who struggled in JC, retained and eventually quit to attend polytechnic. But I also know of students who managed to struggle through A Levels, but did badly or moderately who went to polytechnic eventually. <br>Bear in mind that if you only attained average A Level grades, you may not get into the dream course you want in local universities. You may end up going overseas universities/polytechnics or private institutions. <br><br><strong>Commitment to your A Level</strong><br><br>You should ask yourself these questions before committing yourself into JC. Am I able to handle the stress in JC? Am I able to work extremely hard with few hours of sleep daily? <br><br>If you are an average student, you definitely need to work extremely hard to catch up with JC. If you are already struggling in O Levels, then JC is definitely not for you. I understand from a JC student that JC curriculum is extremely long, from 7am – 10pm. Ordinary school curriculum, CCA and self-study. If CCA ends at 10pm, it does not mark the end of the day; you still have to do your own self study and homework.<br><br>If you have the ability of going JC, then go ahead. If you are having doubts, then you are taking a risk of not doing well in A Levels which may result in you being rejected by the local universities; retaining in JC 1 or eventually dropping out. If you are an average student, ask yourself if you can compete with top JC students like RJC, HwaChong JC, VJC, TJC etc. These JC students are also competing for a place in NUS, NTU, SMU, especially hot courses like law, medicine, accountancy and business administration etc. <br><br>To sum up: <strong>Be prepared to work like you have never worked before in JC.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Polytechnic Route</strong></span><br><br>Poly is often perceived as being an “alternative” route of JC. Some may think poly is slack. Poly's syllabus may not be as tedious as A Level, but definitely not slack if you want to get to a local uni, read on.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>In recent years, polytechnics are becoming hot choices for O level students as well. There are students scoring distinctions, single pointers with L1R4 as low as 6 choosing the diploma route. O Level students should understand that JC and Polytechnic is VERY different. In JC, the environment is very similar to secondary school life, but with extremely in-depth focus in academic areas. On the other hand, polytechnic is very specialized and focused into the industry of your diploma. <br><br><strong>Polytechnic Curriculum </strong><br><br>Most polytechnics’ diploma curriculum is held over a period of 3 years and a total of 6 academic semesters. Each semester is INDEPENDENT of one another. For example, if you study Macroeconomics in Year 1, semester 1 (Semester 1.1), you take the exams and do the project in that particular semester. It is not like you study for 3 years then takes it at the 3rd year like secondary school. <br><br>Your performance is assessed through a system called Grade Point Average (GPA). In secondary schools, you have L1R5 and L1R4, but in polytechnics and universities, it is GPA. GPA is upon a total score of 4. So the best grade you can get is 4.0. Cumulative GPA (CGPA) is the accumulation of your 6 semesters’ GPA. So if you did very well in Year 1 but do very badly for Year 2, your CPGA will be affected.<br><br>Therefore it is very important to either improve or maintain your CGPA as this is the one which you will be using to apply to Universities. For most polytechnics, it is not compulsory for students to have a CCA. But it is highly recommended for those who wish to build up their portfolio to apply to local universities (especially SMU, which takes into account of both academic and non-academic areas). But the main criterion is still your CGPA.<br><br><strong>Further Studies Prospect</strong><br><br>Perhaps the most concerned issue of students. It is possible for poly students to go to local universities and even popular courses like law, medicine, business etc. BUT the percentage is very low. Though I do not have the statistics with me, but the standard GPA to secure a place in uni is 3.5. However, as time passes, it gets really competitive and even if you have a GPA of 3.7 may not secure you a place in university. You have to understand that there are students scoring perfect GPA score of 4.0 competing with you. International students are also competing for places in universities.<br><br>In addition, JC students are given priority over poly students in admissions. <br><br>Many may ask “I want to get my degree but local universities wouldn’t accept me!”<br><br>If local universities don’t accept you, it doesn’t mark the end of your education route. I know of many poly students who further their studies overseas, private institutions etc. Yes, it may be expensive, but you must understand that there are currently only 3 universities in Singapore. With the 4th university coming up which caters for especially poly students, hopefully more diploma holders can move on to get their degree.<br><br><strong>In a nutshell, no matter which path you choose, you have to work hard.</strong></p>
              <p>Hope this gives O Level students who are in a dilemma to make a wise choice during their JAE.</p>
              <p><br>Word of advice: It is best to consult your teachers/ parents or seniors in JC/Polytechnic and make your choice wisely!</p>
