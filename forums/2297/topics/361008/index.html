              <p>As a tutor myself , I felt obliged to help forummers taking  O level English Exams this year</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on my many months of teaching , I have some pointer to offer to the student who are taking English this year</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Passage of High Literacy Value gaining Prominence</p>
              <p>It is no sheer coincidence that more and more of such passage of literature land themselves in O level Comprehension in recent years .</p>
              <p>Student who wish to prepare for this ,should be encouraged to read up 4 or 5 books on book of such values</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Books like Shawshank redemption , to kill a mockingbird , Schindler's list , A river runs through it ,and short stories of William Somerset Maugham and John London stories of Alaska</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Such books provide the insight to understanding the situation of the subject matter [Comprehension Passage]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vocabulary wise, student are encouraged to buy a A4 book to write the meaning , the form of the word [adjective, adverb, present,past tense,noun] and the sentence example</p>
              <p>A good guide will be learning 20 words per day ,reaching the goal of 500 wordsand beyond before English O level Paper .</p>
              <p>When a question express in your own words, it is greatly encourage to extract the answer from the passage in pencil and changing the word to a suitable vocabulary so to achieve the question requirement</p>
              <p>Note : do not overdo this in the form of words like "of , the , and all articles</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is any question raised in this thread ,  i will be willing to answer as this thread continues</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Talking about dictionary , most student will be contented with the use of Student edition paperback for it lightweight .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In my observation , Once i possessed the Collin Cobuild Dictionary of English Language and Usage Database which is the most comprehensive which gives you the sentence structure and even the thesaurus for it .It makes your English learning an enriching experience</p>
              <p>I strongly encouraged student to go for that dictionary as it is beneficial in the long term</p>

              <p>Summary can be a science if one knows the art of extracting the relevant points</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the next few post , i will show from Cambridge paper ,what are the common skills involved extracting points for summary</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be an excellent summary writer, please answer all the question first before attempting the summary question</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This gives the candidate a "feel " of the point needed in the exam</p>
              <p>I cant say how much difference when Oxford takes over , but i believe the initial phase is still remain the same , unless Oxford takes on a scientific approach on the type of Comprehension Passage</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The English Syllabus have changed significantly throughout the years , to excel , please do the tedious task for researching and appreciate English Writing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you do not   cane yourself , the cane [GCE O level result]  will still dawn upon you</p>

              <p>Yes,i have to agree, but why i say to not rephrase one's points if one is unsure as a student might be good at extracting relevant . YET, when he writes it down and rephrases it, it loses its MEANING. Hence make the originally relevant point irrelevant !</p>

              <p>to do a good summary you have to have some form of vocabulary at hand already, to make it succinct and precise at the same time.</p>
              <p>moreover, to craft it so that it fits the requirement (e.g. to answer it from some viewpoint or some angle), and make it sound like a smooth, flowing piece of prose rather than a 150-word regurgitation, is an art worth mastering.</p>

              <p>different people have different ways to summarise :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rephrase though a makeshift method ,reduce messiness and for those who arent so strong in linking sentence without writing down</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats why summary writing require practise and intelligent extracting</p>
              <p>Take for example ,</p>
              <p>the 197x San Francisco left an indelible scar on the resident of San Francisco</p>
              <p>How do we summarise this ?</p>
              <p>The weaker student will just copy it down first and change the phrase "indellible scar"</p>
              <p>to a similar meaning</p>
              <p><br>Its by no mean easy ,for ones without a good vocabulary bank , will find this part daunting</p>
              <p>Nevertheless even if its tough , I still wish to share some light according to my tutoring experience</p>
              <p> </p>

              extracting</p>
              <p>Take for example ,</p>
              <p>the 197x San Francisco left an indelible scar on the resident of
              San Francisco</p>
              <p>How do we summarise this ?</p>
              <p>The weaker student will just copy it down first and change the
              phrase "indellible scar"</p>
              <p>to a similar meaning</p>
              <p><br> Its by no mean easy ,for ones without a good vocabulary bank , will
              find this part daunting</p>
              <p>Nevertheless even if its tough , I still wish to share some
              light according to my tutoring experience</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please feel free to circle my shortcomings as I also learning
              from many Expert tutors out there</p>

              <p>Somehow you turn me and him into forbidden93. : D</p>
              <p>I know he is right, but I guess I misunderstood him. You promised that you would post up the summary parts later :</p>
              <p><strong>In the next few post , i will show from Cambridge paper ,what
                                      are the common skills involved extracting points for summary</strong></p>
              <p>but he suddenly pop in and said this:</p>
              <p><strong>Yes,i have to agree, but why i say to not rephrase one's points
                                      if one is unsure as a student might be good at extracting relevant
                                      . YET, when he writes it down and rephrases it, it loses its
                                      MEANING. Hence make the originally relevant point irrelevant !</strong></p>
              <p>Hence I thought he was trying to start an argument or something.</p>
              <p>I apologise if I ruffled a few feathers, but I will rather you put up your full summary work 1st before anyone start any scrutinising.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the main area why student find it difficult to summarise is they summarising based on the whole passage in point form</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If one look carefully , every paragraph have one main idea and supporting statements</p>
              <p>some paragraph even have sub ideas and supporting statements for that \</p>

              <p>Student are to write those related to present how difficult the journey and worrying to the author</p>

              <p>rephrase is good .Only if you have strong sentence structure .I tried rephrasing answer in the past ..but after several attempt i realised its put the strain on the student as it is very demanding on the overall comprehension of the passage ...</p>
