              <p>hi everyone, i am new here :) please help me with my problem:)</p>
              <p>i am a student from a top secondary school in singapore(just graduated in november) it has an integrated programme, which leads to JC 1, a top jc in singapore that only admits 3 pointers. However, the problem is, i am the bottom 5 percent in my top school. When i entered the school, i was borderline cutoff only. Throughout the years, i struggled with my grades. i even repeated a year of secondary 4 because of bad grades. Now, i am not those ah lian type that don't study. I study quite a lot and get adequate help from my parents(they are quite smart), very focused but still got bad grades in my school.</p>
              <p>Now that i have graduated, i am thinking of transferring to another jc(not a neighbourhood jc, but a 9/10 pointer jc). the reasons are as follows</p>
              <p>1. the jc i want to transfer to is near to my house. There are 3 JC i am considering. They are all at most 30 minutes away, unlike the jc i am supposed to go(one hour away). i feel location is very important to me. jc is going to be quite hectic and every minute counts, so i don't want to spend so much time on transport</p>
              <p>2.  the top school i went to often stressed me out. one year, i felt very depressed and moody every single day, but my parents told me to "just deal with it" . i feel an average jc would be easier on me. Sure, it will still be stressful, considering i have A levels, but the change in enviroment/culture will make me not so stressed?</p>
              <p>3.the top jc i am supposed to go to said i can't take economics, which i'm keen on taking. this is because i did not meet the grade requirements to take economics. I feel taking a standard PCME course will be better for me to enter UNI</p>
              <p>4. i am very afraid of being asked to repeat another year in jc. </p>
              <p>so the abovementioned are my reasons. as you can see,  I am NOT the superficial kind who look at uniforms etc, i am concerned about my future.</p>
              <p>However, here are some drawbacks in transferring:</p>
              <p>1. what if the when i apply to a local uni(i'm planning too) and i'm the borderline case and the admission officer sees two applications, one from me and one from someone from a top jc, like rjc with same grades and decide to admit the rjc person because of the top jc status?</p>
              <p>2. will it affect my job prospects? ie the boss deciding to hire the person from a top jc even if we have similar qualifications.</p>
              <p>3. i am not so sure about the percentage of people who can get into uni from the average jc i am thinking of transferring to. they won't tell me.... </p>
              <p>so, what do you think? please help me as its very urgent!!! i am thinking of writing the</p>

              <p>That is not true.</p>

              <p>Questions 1 and 2 are irrelevant. Your job is to do your job well, period. If you fail to make the cut, you fail to make the cut. If you want something badly, you will work badly for it.</p>
              <p>Question 3: Of course nobody knows. Again, irrelevant question. If you want something badly, you jolly well get your act together, and do it.</p>
              <p>In case you wonder, getting into local uni is usually not a problem, especially 9/10 pt school.</p>
              <p>Its what you get at the local uni that is another story.</p>

              <p>seriously. you shld discuss this with your parents and teachers....not seeking help in forums.<br>from all that you have written. you will get killed in any top jcs.<br>your psle results only gotten you that far....into an IP school.<br>from sec and jc, you need more brains than hardwork.<br><br>the bottom 5% of the top jc or IP sch may not be smarter than the top 5% of neighbourhood jc. where do u belong?</p>
              <p>go to a jc you are comfortable with and learn.</p>
              <p>so what if top jc has 95% eligible for uni? you may be that bottom 5%.</p>
              <p>so what is a normal jc has only 70% qualifying for uni? you may be that 70%.</p>

              Do discuss with your parents about this. 
                      
              Qn 1: Not sure, but I don't think it matters. But if you want to think about it, the uni make take the neighbourhood jc student instead, simply because if a person from the neighbourhood jc can get the same result as the top jc, then what for take the top jc student. But then again, if you don't make it for the cut, u don't. 
                      
              Qn 2: JC cert only allow you to enter uni, nothing else. It's the uni qualifications that matters.
                      
              Qn 3: Don't worry about the % . If you really want to know, I'm from a neighbourgood jc, 14 points and above (Not telling which jc i went to), and it's around 50% - 60%. However, the reason why student in my jc dont make it to uni is they are lazy. So I come to the conclusion that no matter which jc you go, so long as you work hard, you can still make it to uni. Just that for hot courses like medicine and law, simply working hard may not be enough. 
                      
              About transferring, you perhaps should. Transfer to a jc that is nearer and perhaps doesn't stress you out too often. Not sure about a 9/10 pointer jc though, but I think they don't stress their students as much as a 2/3 pointer jc. 
                      
              For subject combination...depends on which uni course you want to go. Sometimes the standard PCME combination isn't the best, which depends from person to another person.

              <p>hi everyone, thank you for you replies:) i have discussed this matter with my parents  since last year and they are supportive of it. i am sending out the transfer letter tomorrow. Only problem is whether i will get accepted or not. after all, 9/10 pointer schools are good schools! </p>
              <p>also, may i know if anyone who is a student /ex-student of anderson/nanyang/catholic jc who can tell me the percentage of people retaining in year one? </p>

              <p>I entered JC with the lowest of L1R5 grades throughout the school.</p>
              <p>I graduated with almost perfect score (except for GP :(  )</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Seriously, I think JCs throughout Singapore are about the same. But if you intend to graduate from JC, stick with your current JC, and seek help if you need for the topics.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My advice is, ask yourself what you want. Having a graduation cert from a "branded" JCs will help you much more in future than you know. Ultimately, everyone from all JCs will still take the same National Exams anyway.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you cannot meet the requirements for Economics, try appealing. State your reasons, and ask the principal.</span></p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <p>1. the jc i want to transfer to is near to my house. There are 3 JC i am considering. They are all at most 30 minutes away, unlike the jc i am supposed to go(one hour away). i feel location is very important to me. jc is going to be quite hectic and every minute counts, so i don't want to spend so much time on transport</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you go NUS next time, will it be one hour as well?</span></p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2.  the top school i went to often stressed me out. one year, i felt very depressed and moody every single day, but my parents told me to "just deal with it" . i feel an average jc would be easier on me. Sure, it will still be stressful, considering i have A levels, but the change in enviroment/culture will make me not so stressed?</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You can be bottom of the school, but still emerge among top few percent of the national cohort.</span></p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <p>3.the top jc i am supposed to go to said i can't take economics, which i'm keen on taking. this is because i did not meet the grade requirements to take economics. I feel taking a standard PCME course will be better for me to enter UNI</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not true. Economics is not necessary for most uni courses. </span></p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <div><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. what if the when i apply to a local uni(i'm planning too) and i'm the borderline case and the admission officer sees two applications, one from me and one from someone from a top jc, like rjc with same grades and decide to admit the rjc person because of the top jc status?</span></div>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not for Uni applications</span><br></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">=================================</span></p>
              <div><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. will it affect my job prospects? ie the boss deciding to hire the person from a top jc even if we have similar qualifications.</span></div>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yes, a little.  A lot still depends on the interview. When you are shortlisted for an interview, your grades and school does not matter anymore. It's how you carry yourself.</span></p>
              <p>=================================</p>
              <div><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3. i am not so sure about the percentage of people who can get into uni from the average jc i am thinking of transferring to. they won't tell me.... </span></div>
              <p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They won't. It is still the same national exams.<br>Since you are already in, why not stay? Work hard at it. And like I said, seek help when you need it. Not necessarily tuition, you could post in this forum and ask for help too. I will help when I have the time, so will other moderators and fellow students. Education is meant to be shared!</span></p>

              <p>SBS is right that you study hard and understand what you are doing can alr. Dun need to fear getting retained. Even if you have difficulty coping with ur studies in any jc, there are alawys many ways which you can use to improve e.g. getting private tution, or get consultations with ur jc tutors often.</p>
              <p>If mjc is one of ur mentioned jc, u dun need worry that they are trying to purposely retain students who are not doing well for the sake of good show. They don't, and i noe as i graduated from there 2 years ago =). the requirement to get promoted back then was at least get 40% on overall and a pass in GP (back then everyone was failing badly and the school also considered the average). even if u dun meet the requirements, there are some certain additionnal test for you as an extra opportunity to see if u are suitable to pass on to JC2. Afterall, retaining 1 year may not be such a bad thing if you are really struggling to understand the topics and to cope with the tiring schedule in JCs.</p>
              <p> It was very common to see most ppl in various JCs failing this and that, and passing a certain content subject is actually very wonderful. Well, in the end many of people still can get gd results in A lvls. One very common reason is that they like to slack in 1st year for example, then later chiong during 2nd year and the "catch-up" result will then finally show in like, during their midyears or prelims.</p>
              <p> Lastly, there may be something important for you to know. these 9-10 pointer jcs' exam papers may be no easier than RI/ HCI papers. For example for H2 Chem, I've always felt that difficulty of tjc/mjc/ri/hci/cjc/njc/vjc/ maybe nyjc papers are on par with each other. For H2 math papers and H1 Econs, RI/HCI are usually more manageable than most other jcs'. There was even one jc (AJC if i rmb correctly) who likes to release hellish qns for their h2 math papers. Give an average guy twice the amount of time to do and i doubt he can finish half of it.</p>
