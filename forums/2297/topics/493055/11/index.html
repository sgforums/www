              just rely on your school's compiled questions, go obtain for
              yourself (and do them!) all the Prelim papers from the last 5 years
              at least (eg. you can buy them online) to challenge yourself.</p>
              <p>And of course, seeing how your OC mastery is already top of your
              JC, I'm more interested in you sharing tough Ksp and TM questions

              <p>My school provides revision packages for H2 Chem covering every single topic compiled from past year prelim papers from other schools from 2011 to 2016.So considering I just started doing a few questions on the Ksp/Transition elements revision package my school has given only,I guess for now I can just get by with it as I also have other subjects to juggle too.</p>

              Fair enough. Though I'd still recommend you take the initiative to self-compile all the Ksp and TM questions from all the Prelim papers you can get your hands on (eg. last 5 years), since these topics are your (and all JC students' too, just that the average JC student isn't even as prepared as you are in all the other topics as well) Achilles heel. Remember to share any TYS or Prelim paper Ksp and TM questions that you find difficult.

              No, your method of answering the question is not acceptable.

              Both questions are within H2 syllabus and can be asked by Cambridge, although the 2011 question is slightly less commonly encountered for Singapore JC students and hence might be a tad more confusing and accordingly a tad more challenging.<p>
              For the 2011 question, as you said, you wouldn't be able to think of the answer the first time you come across the question. But now that you've seen the solution and understand it, if a similar question came out for the A levels, you can do it liao, right?</p><p>
              For the 2013 question, yes 'free' ions means counter ions, not ligands.</p><p></p>

              <p>Something to do with p-orbital overlap?Since Cl has a smaller electron cloud it is able to have a larger effective orbital overlap with phosphrous thus has higher rate of rxn.Br with a larger electron cloud is more diffused and hence forms a less effective orbital overlap with phosphrous,thus resulting in a slower rate of rxn.</p>

                  Nice try, but effectiveness of orbital overlap refers to the strength of bonds formed (while you conveniently ignored the conflicting corresponding strength of bonds broken), without directly addressing the different rates of reaction.<p>This is a BedokFunland JC Challenge Qn, so JC students are not expected to be able to come up with the correct answer. Those who are curious can try asking your school teacher or private tutor, and see if they know the answer (some will, some won't).</p>

              You confuse FGL with OS, but that's a minor issue. More importantly, "oxidation" doesn't cut it. The require keyword to score the mark is more precise, less ambiguous. I'll edit my question to give a further clue.

              I know where Hwa Chong stole that question from.<p>
              Anyways, small matter, but technically, FGL has "level" as a prefix, while OS has "+" or "-" as a prefix. Cambridge will accept either, no worries.</p>

              <p>JJC P2 Q1(e) why is it that even though reaction is independant of 
              [I2], when [I2] is halved, time is halved? wouldn't that be first order?</p>
              <p>Q5(c)(iii) How does this mechanism look like? Is it possible for the Br- from step 1 to attack instead?</p>
              <p>P3 Q1(b)(ii) Why does the answer state that when the reaction just becomes feasible G=0? Isn't the reaction feasible when G&lt;0? When G=0 isn't it just at equilibrium?</p>
