Then how about you guys nominate any MCQ from the 2017 Prelims, that is tougher than that MCQ? Share it with your fellow J2s mah. If you guys bother to discuss, it's you guys who will benefit.

              Nvm I'll explain it here anyway, in case some of you ask for it later when I'm away from keyboard, and no one else here helps out (though I'm quite sure at least some of you can solve this MCQ, but no one seems to be in a volunteering mood).

                  Based on the Kc formula, find molarity of either product (since molar ratio of products are 1:1, numerator becomes square of the unknown molarity of either product) at 1st equilibrium = (0.5Kc)^0.5, and at 2nd equilibrium = (2.5Kc)^0.5.</b></p><p><b>Convert molarity to moles, you get (2Kc)^0.5 and (10Kc)^0.5 respectively.</b></p><p><b>

                                                Based on the stoichiometry of the balanced redox, and considering the limiting reactant, the relative amount of products are 2 mol of 32g isotope for every 1 mol of 34g isotope, hence average molar mass of S(s) = (32+32+34) / 3 is your answer.

              <p>Been a long time since I last posted here:</p>
              <p>For me personally,i feel that most school prelim p1 are relatively harder as opposed to the A levels.For instance is not easy to exceed 16-18 marks/30 for VJC/NJC,same for neighbourhood JCs like SRJC paper,where i scored 16 marks which I really didn't bother doing the last few remaining questions i have yet to attempt for that paper as it was really tilting.</p>
              <p>For me,I'm just mainly focusing on TYS P1 questions,which to me are more relatively straightforward,and simple with exception of the last 10 questions(q30-q40) for previous years which are slightly more challenging.For me,scoring 25-27/28-30(Due to some qns not in syallabus) for the first 30 questions is the norm whereas the last 10 questions 5-6/8-10(due to some out of syallabus qns) is the norm.Prelim papers to me are only beneficial in the sense of stretching one's mind,thinking and understanding of chemistry concepts in greater depth.</p>
              <p>I personally feel today's paper will be a 2/3 mix of straightforward qns seen in past yr q1 to q30 types and also a 1/3 mix of q30-q40 type which are slightly higher in difficulty,to create a paper with moderate difficulty.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>All right MapPwner, it seem slike nobody's gonna ask any more qns, so I'm gonna leave it in your good hands to post your MCQ answers after today's Paper 1. I'll be surprised if you get anything less than 85% score for today's P1 (if you do, it'll be indicative of how tough today's P1 is).</div>

              <p>paper was okay ; although abit weird to have multiple option questions mixed in (the 1 and3, 1,2,3 etc)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however some qns very tricky in my opinion but I did manage 28 which i am quite happy with.</p>

              Thanks for your effort, MapPwner.<p>
              Some people just can't handle the truth, and emotionally take out their inadequacies out on other people. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection">psychological projection</a>. </p><p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, MapPwner, I'm curious as to which you think are the trickiest or most difficult few MCQs (I assume this includes the 4 MCQs you got wrong? or were there even trickier qns but you got them right?) for yesterday's P1. Possible for you to take a photo to upload, and either post here or PM me? Not the entire paper, just the toughest MCQs. Curious leh. Thanks.</div>
