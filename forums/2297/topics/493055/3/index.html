                                  That's because Vitamin C isn't a carboxylic acid.<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/L-Ascorbic_acid.svg/220px-L-Ascorbic_acid.svg.png"></p><p>From moles of CO2 generated, find moles of C in sample to be 3.4091x10-2 mol, ie. 4.0909x10-1 g.</p><p>From moles of H2O generated, find moles of H in sample to be 4.5x10-2 mol, ie. 4.5 x 10-2 g.</p><p>

                  <i>Edited to add in italics</i><p>    Because the O level method is just an average value <i>and makes simplified assumptions about common OS values for various elements which aren't always correct in context</i>, while my BedokFunland JC formula for OS (which only the best few Singapore JC teachers are familiar with) is superior in that you can use it to calculate the OS of individual atoms in individual resonance contributors.</p><p>In more complicated molecules and ions such as the S2O8 2- ion, you *must* use my BedokFunland JC formula to arrive at the correct OS. A recent Singapore H2 A level exam question in which Cambridge asked for the OS of a certain atom, also requires my BedokFunland JC formula to arrive at the correct OS.</p><p>BedokFunland JC FTW! ;Ãž</p>

              <p>"When 10cm cube of a gaseous hydrocarbon were exploded with 100cm cube of oxygen,the residual gas occupied 70 cm cube.After shaking these residual gases with aqueous sodium hydroxide,the final volume was 20 cm cube.All volumes were measured at room temperature and pressure.Calculate the molecular formular of the hydrocarbon."</p>
              <p>Does the residual gas includes the excess,unreacted oxygen?(CO2+O2+H2O)</p>
              <p>The final residual gas is (O2+H2O)?</p>
              <p>Since CO2 reacts with NAOH.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how to solve the 'residual gas' type of combustion analysis.I can solve the normal ones though.</p>
              <p>Ans is C5H12</p>
              <p>I got 5 for C but I have no idea how to get H...</p>

              <p>Dear UltimaOnline,</p>
              <p>I am a J1 this year, and I've just started my first Chem tutorial on Atomic Structure. However I'm stuck on this question. Can you help me with it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give a brief explanation of the following observation in terms of ionisation energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Orange street-lamps contain sodium with a small amount of neon, and light is produced when gaseous atoms are ionised in an electric field. It is observed that when the street-lamps are turned on, a red glow characteristic of neon is first emitted and the orange glow of sodium predominates after a time.</p>

              70 cm3 = unreacted O2 + CO2 (H2O is liquid at rtp)</p><p>
              Since 20cm3 = unreacted O2, hence 50cm3 = CO2
              </p><p>
              Since 80 cm3 of O2 used per 10 cm3 of hydrocarbon, hence (5 + y/4) = 8, ie. y = 12 
              </p><p>

                              This is an interesting question that was asked by Cambridge in a TYS qn, yet a proper understanding of how the lamp works actually goes beyond the H2 syllabus.
                              </p><p>For the simplified version that will suffice for the H2 syllabus (which being oversimplified for A level purposes, is unfortunately inaccurate and misleading in several ways) :
                              </p><p>
                              Neon is already gaseous, while sodium is solid, under standard conditions. Hence upon switching on the lamp, the neon gas is ionized first, producing a red glow, while it takes some time for the sodium metal to be vaporized then ionized, then producing the yellow-orange flow of sodium. Na(g) having a less endothermic 1st ionization energy compared to Ne(g), ionizes more readily, and hence being present in a larger quantity, its yellow-orange glow thus predominates.</p><p>
                              (Beyond H2 syllabus, for those interested)</p><p>But the above simplified A level H2 version is misleading in several ways. Firstly, the ionization itself doesn't produce the glow. The glow occurs when the atoms (whether neon or sodium) transit from a higher energy state, to a lower energy state, in the process emitting electromagnetic radiation or photons of a specific frequency corresponding on that element's emission spectrum (that sodium has a brighter glow than neon, is actually due to their different emission spectrums, rather than the misleading A level explanation given above). This actually happens after, and is separate from, the ionization process.
                              </p><p>
                              When the lamp is turned on, the electricity applied ionizes and oxidizes the Ne(g) at the anode, and the Ne+(g) cations are accelerated by the applied electric field toward the cathode, in the process colliding with Ne(g) atoms, which transfer their electrons to the Ne+(g) cations. The Ne(g) atoms (having lost an electron during the collisions), ionize into Ne+(g) and accelerate toward the cathode, while the Ne+(g) cations (having gained an electron during the collisions), become reduced to Ne(g) *and* return to a lower energy state, emitting a photon of light of neon's characteristic frequency (ie. red glow) corresponding to neon's emission spectrum.
                              </p><p>
                              The above process generates the heat required to first vaporize the Na(s) to Na(g), and then ionize the Na(g) to Na+(g) at the anode, and thereafter, the same collision process described above with Ne(g) and Ne+(g), then takes place with the Na(g) and Na+(g), resulting in the emitting of photons of light of sodium's characteristic frequency (ie. bright yellow-orange glow) corresponding to sodium's emission spectrum. In practice, inter-elemental collisions between the neon and sodium atoms and ions do occur as well.
                              </p><p>
                              Advice to JC students : always first understand the simplified A level concepts first (A levels is a transition bridge between O level child's play, and the real Uni level science), and then only if you're interested and able to handle it, delve into the more correct Uni level details.

                              tutorial on Atomic Structure. However I'm stuck on this question.
                              Can you help me with it?</p>
                              <p> </p>
                              <p>Give a brief explanation of the following observation in terms
                              of ionisation energy.</p>
                              <p> </p>
                              <p>Orange street-lamps contain sodium with a small amount of neon,
                              and light is produced when gaseous atoms are ionised in an electric
                              field. It is observed that when the street-lamps are turned on, a
                              red glow characteristic of neon is first emitted and the orange
                              glow of sodium predominates after a time.</p>

              Hi Alive17,<p>1. The old 9647 H2 Chem syllabus is available upon request, you have to email SEAB. Whether to register for the new syllabus or old syllabus, depends on whether you intend to go for H2 Chem tuition. If self-study, then old syllabus. If tuition, then new syllabus.</p><p>2. Tuition will definitely help (especially if you're registering for the new syllabus). Go for tuition if you can afford it.</p><p>3. Group Tuition ($300+) is a lot cheaper than 1 to 1 Tuition ($600+).</p><p>4. Whichever approach works best for yourself.</p><p>If you're interested in my <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=bedokfunland+jc">BedokFunland JC</a> tuition for H2 Chem, you can PM me.

              Well if you attend my tuition, you can still stick to the old syllabus if you wish. Coz my BedokFunland JC tuition is a small group tutorial system with personalized attention (so whether you take the old or new syllabus, I can help you no prob), not like the large group mass lecture system of most other H2 Chemistry tuitions.<p>The old syllabus and new syllabus has a number of differences, but the change isn't anything earth-shaking, and it isn't anything you can't cope with, no worries.</p>

                      <p>' 10cm3 of a hydrocarbon Z were exploded with 100cm3 of oxygen
                      in excess.The volume of the gaseous products was 80cm3 but was
                      decreased to 40 cm3 when these products were bubbled through
                      aqueous akali.All volume were measured under the same conditions of
                      temperature and pressure.What is the molecular formula of
                      Z?' </p>
                      <p>How do I solve problems like this does not give the
                      conditions(temperature and pressure)?</p>
                      <p>I am not able to determine if steam is also part of the residual
                      gases.</p>
                      <p>I only know that CO2 is 40cm3.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>AND</p>
                      <p>A completely off-topic question: When do you think the A level
                      assessment books are going to come out?(Updated according to new
                      syllabus)</p>
                      <p>Due to syllabus changes,the books that are on the shelves of
                      popular bookstores currently aren't really useful.</p>
                      <p>Just based on your own experience.</p>
                      <p>Thanks in advance.</p>

                      You don't need temp and pressure, coz such qns will not require the use of PV=nRT. H2O is always taken to be liquid under standard conditions, unless the question implies that H2O is gaseous under the question's non-standard conditions.<p>
                      Oxygen used = 60 = 10(4+y/4) hence y = 8, ie. hydrocarbon is C4H8</p><p>The 2016 TYS is already out, but since the latest 2016 paper is old syllabus, hence you will *not* be able to get any TYS updated to new syllabus before the 2017 A level exam. This has always been the case for every pioneer batch of syllabus change. No worries, doing the old syllabus TYS is still useful, and your school teachers will inform you of the parts of the syllabus that have changes, as well as give you adequate practice for the new content not in the old syllabus exam papers.
