              Specimen papers are just to reflect the updated content of the new syllabus. Don't expect the difficulty of this year's papers to be necessarily similar to the Specimen paper.

It's heartening and affirming to observe that many higher-level questions (eg.

Very well done, all Singapore JCs! Excellent work setting the 2017 new syllabus tougher Prelim Papers! Hopefully Cambridge doesn't disappoint us this year (and every year from now on)! :D</div>

              The vast majority of JC students cannot reproduce the full details, nor score anywhere close to full marks for the Planning. This is expected, and should not be a cause for worry. As long as you (ie. the student), understand what the experiment is about, just do your best to come up with an appropriate Plan for the experiment, and just fill in as many details (with reasonable values for volumes, molarities, etc, based on the apparatus involved) as you can along the way, and work according to the values you've provided. In other words, see the big picture, don't sweat the small stuff. If you can do this, you can pass your Planning (don't try to score full marks, it's not realistic). And together with near full marks for your Theory Papers (that's way more realistic), an overall A grade is easily within reach (as I personally demonstrate every year).

              <p>Compared my answers with many sources(classmates,friends from other schs like AJ/HCJC),excluding planning my score is about 30/41 for the 15% of practical,which is supposedly rather decent among those i asked so far(my friends from AJ/HCJC supposedly did worse than this score out of 41,and some skipped planning altogether).</p>
              <p>I counted my score rather stringently so yeah,somewhat disappointed but oh well,at least i didn't do any worse as the practical really looked simple yet tricky,which was maybe why a lot of people lost a lot of marks due to careless mistakes,which I did too.</p>
              <p>Lost approximately 4 marks in energetics component(-1 for failure to write down o2 evolved relights glowing splint,-1 for not taking into account x2 stoichiometric coefficient for enthalpy change of decomposition in both cases-assuming there is ecf,-1 for possibly inefficiently explaining how fe(h2o)6 3+ acts as catalyst and -1 for giving wrong reason for fe(h2o)6 3+ forming fe(h2o)5(oh) 2+ and h3o+ due to high charge density)</p>
              <p>Kinetics lost 3 marks due to calculation misunderstanding,otherwise was relatively manageable,such as quoting of 2 consecutive t1/2 to prove whether is it first order or not(for me it is yeah).</p>
              <p>Inorganic QA probably lost 3 marks,-1 due to failure of writing down blue ppt formed for test 2 but just wrote blue soln instead,-1 for not accurately explaining why the second test tube with naoh evolves o2,merely stated redox and mno4- reduced while OH- oxidised to O2 which im unsure whether thats correct so assumed wrong.Also -1 for incomplete observation of compound formed and reasoning for part ii,only said Co(NH3)6 2+ formed due to ligand exchange reaction,never accounted for Co(OH)2.</p>
              <p>On top of those mistakes would also want to ask the following questions:</p>
              <p>In part iii of role of H2O2,its a reducing agent if one deduces that from equation 2 of page 8 and quoting oxidation states of elements affected?Then explaining fe(h2o)6 3+ as a catalyst,is this the structure as follows:</p>
              <p>In step 1,Fe(H2O)6 3+ reacts to form an intermediate Fe(H2O)5 something (1m)</p>
              <p>The intermediate complex decomposes to form 2 products in step 2,which subsequently reacts with h2o2 to regenerate Fe(h2o)6 3+ in step 3(1m)</p>
              <p>technically,such an explanation is 2/3m only right?I assume the last mark is with respect to colour change of solution during the steps.</p>

              <p>Student plotted graph,range of temperature change:10.5-11.5 degrees(most people i asked got 11-11.3 range).</p>
              <p>T2 max is more accurate as use of a graphical method accounts for the compensation of heat loss to the surroundings as the temperature of the mixture becomes greater than the environment(1m)</p>
              <p>Then fe(h2o)6 3+ catalyst qn(3m) It forms an intermediate complex(name the compound too also which I forgot)in Step 1(1m),it decomposes in step 2 and then one of the products reacts with h2o2 to regenerate fe(h2o)6 3+ in step 3.(1m) Idk how the other 1m is allocated,maybe stating it is homogenous catalyst etc.</p>
              <p><br>Fe(h2o)6 3+ +H2o-&gt;fe(h2o)5(oh) 2+ +h3o+ Fe3+ has high charge density then polarises,weakens OH bond in H2O of the complex to release H+ ions,which is accepted by H2O to form H3O+.(1m)</p>
              <p><br>Why is there a change in colour?as there is a difference in energy gaps,thus different wavelength of light absorbed,resulting in different colours observed(1m)</p>
              <p><br>Kinetics: <br>Gradient: negative 3.3-4.2 something cm3min-1(well I mod my gradient,so it became positive,idk whether that's correct)</p>
              <p><br>Rate of change of KMno4- = concentration of KMnO4 solution given x gradient of curve/1000cm3=___molmin-1</p>
              <p><br>Last 2 marks idk</p>
              <p><br>H2o2 is first order(agree with student)(1m).As seen from graph as t 1/2=7.2min and 2nd t 1/2=6.7min,which is approximately constant(accept within 20% difference of each other).It is thus first order.(1m)</p>
              <p><br>Planning I not sure.</p>
              <p><br>Inorganic QA: Observations: Naoh soln turns purple to colourless aft addin kmno4,and turns blue aft some time.(1m)Deionised water remains purple/pale pink after addition of KMnO4.(1m)</p>
              <p><br>Addition of NH3 dropwise produces a blue precipitate in solution which produces gas with turns moist red litmus blue.Gas evolved is NH3(1m)</p>
              <p><br>Upon addition of H2O2,solution turns dark brown with a dark brown precipitate formed.Effervescence is also observed and gas evolved which relights a glowing splint.Gas evolved is O2(2m).<br>Part (I):The second test tube containing boiling NaOH.(1m)Redox reaction occurs which reduces MnO4- and oxidises OH- to O2(1m)[Or better phrasing].<br>Part (II) Co(OH)2(blue ppt) and Co(NH3)6 2+(dark brown ppt) is formed(1m).CO2+ reacts with OH- produced by dropwise addition of aqueous ammonia to form Co(OH)2 precipitate.Addition of H2O2 result in the formation of Co(NH3)6 2+ through a ligand exchange reaction as NH3 molecules displaces h2o ligands in Co(H2O)6 2+(1m).<br>50% observation+50% explanation correct for the 2 mark explanation question(part ii)=1m For observation questions(2m in energetics and 4m in inorganic QA,a deduction of 1 mark per missing/incomplete information will probably be meted out).<br>Part(iii) Role of H2O2 is a reducing agent then quote O.s states using eqn 2 on page 8.</p>
              <p>Those are supposedly the answers to most of the questions.But i suspect the part(ii) explanation of inorganic QA is wrong as chemguide uk said is Co(OH)3.</p>
              <p>UltimaOnline,do you find the practical today easy?I felt it was doable but probably due to complacency and negligence i lost quite some marks.</p>

              MapPwner, I didn't do the Practical today. I'm skipping this year's A levels due to a scheduling conflict, and if you miss just 1 paper, you miss all papers for that subject, because you'll be awarded an "ABSENT" grade for that subject. So I'm skipping all the Papers this year.<p>
              So I'll leave it to your good hands, MapPwner, to lead the forum discussions on P2, P3 and P1. And since I won't have seen any of the Papers, I can't comment on the difficulty of the questions. If you'll like me to address any particular question, you'll have to type it out from memory (for P2) or upload an image of the question (for P3 and P1).

              <p>For inorganic QA,we were tasked to add 1cm depth of CoCl2,followed by addition of NH3(aq) dropwise,forming a blue ppt and blue solution.Then thereafter,we are supposed to add H2O2(aq),resulting in formation of dark brown solution and dark brown precipitate.</p>
              <p>I identified dark brown solution as co(nh3)6 2+ but is probably wrong as it is co(oh)3 i think.Failed to identify co(oh)2 as i only saw a blue solution in my test tube.</p>
              <p>We were also tasked to compare role of h2o2 between the reaction mentioned above and role of h2o2 in reaction between MnO4- and H2O2.</p>
              <p>For energetics the practical was on determining enthalpy change of decomposition of H2O2,given by the equation 2 H2O2-&gt;2H2O+O2  Hdecomp=to be determined</p>
              <p>Many people could calc heat change and amt of h2o2 used,but failed to take into account the stoichiometric coefficient in energetics in calculating Hdecomp of H2O2,which is 2 moles,so -1/2 marks at least.</p>

              Damn, this makes me all the more regretful that I'll have to be skipping the A levels this year. If this year's A levels P2, P3 and P1 are also concordantly so much tougher than the Singapore Prelim Papers (as appears to be the case for P4), I would really have liked to take them. If this really turns out to be the case (which would be rather shocking to Singapore JC school teachers), don't feel too badly or worry too much : after Cambridge finishes marking and sends the raw scores to SEAB, SEAB will apply the bell-curve to assign grades after moderation.

              Ahhh Ellipsisss of HCJC, I see you attempted my BedokFunland JC Challenge Qns... ok I'll have a look and give my comments, but you must understand, I won't reveal the full solutions here. I'll only give full solutions to my own BedokFunland JC students. I'll reply you on your attempted answers in a couple of hours. Check back later tonight.

              Here are my comments on your attempted answers.</p><p>
              For Q1, your order of basicity is wrong, and your explanation has multiple errors (including an internal inconsistency, prolly just ur careless typo), and a word of advice : for A levels, never use "it", but specify exactly which, otherwise Cambridge will think you're trying to smoke your way through and you'll kena penalized (even if your answer is otherwise correct). Hint : your answer would be somewhat less wrong (but there are still errors) for a typical alpha-amino acid, but Histidine happens to be anomalous amongst alpha-amino acids (this is afterall a BedokFunland JC Challenge, ie. difficult even for A grade students, and for some private tutors and school teachers as well), but still totally explainable, if you understand your chemistry well enough. You can 'cheat' a little and google out where the 3 pKa values belong, and thus 'reverse engineer' the basicity of the 3 N atoms (the least basic N atom doesn't even have a Kb value, if Cambridge asks why, do you know how to explain?).</p><p>
              Q2. Correct, well done. More than half of all JC H2 students wouldn't know how to solve this.
              </p><p>
              Q3. Ok, I was admittedly being unfairly sadistic in setting this question, as the pH values for the more extreme ends of the titration cannot be correctly obtained by using the A level acid-base equilibria within-syllabus methods, which are only approximations that fail when dealing with fairly strong acids and bases. In addition, do note that if the initial molarity of the acid or base is not sufficiently larger than the change in molarity (ie. as indicated by the magnitude of the relevant Ka or Kb value), it becomes inaccurate and indeed invalid to neglect the change in molarity, and to simply approximate equilibrium molarity back to initial (as taught by Singapore JCs, and as you had done in some of your calculations). But no worries, Cambridge probably wouldn't be as sadistic, and would also usually set initial molarities to be much larger than the change, so you usually wouldn't need to solve quadratic or cubic equations for H2 Chemistry (though all students should still bring 2 calculators as a backup, a non-graphing and a graphing). So as far as A levels are involved, very well done, your titration pH values are mostly correct.
              </p><p>
              Q4.
              Correct, well done. Most Singapore JC students are confused by the effect of temperature change on the Gibbs free energy change value VERSUS the equilibrium constant Kc value, because they simplistically assume that the larger the Kc value, the more negative the Gibbs free energy change. This is only true for constant temperature. When temperature changes, you must consider both the enthalpy and entropy changes. The effect of temperature on Kc is controlled by the enthalpy change, while the effect of temperature on Gibbs free energy change is controlled by the entropy change. Interested A grade H2 students, H3 students and Olympiad students, can explore this aspect of thermodynamics deeper for themselves, including the Van 't Hoff equation.
              </p><p>
              Q5. Almost correct, but not quite. Did it not occur to you that the decarboxylation (both with and without enzyme catalyst) is kinetically feasible only due to the zwitterionic nature of amino acids? An intermediate with a uninegative formal charge on a C atom that is not delocalized by resonance is prohibitively destabilizing making your mechanism kinetically unfeasible. On a related note : writing C- or H- for Grignard reagents and LiAlH4, is an oversimplification, and does not actually exist as an intermediate, but only as a transition state (so to speak). On another related note : investigate the mechanism for decarboxylation of beta-keto-carboxylic acids (which Cambridge used in a Singapore TYS Qn) followed by prototropic tautomerism, notice there is no C- intermediate there either.
              </p><p>
              Overall, a very good attempt by Ellipsisss of HCJC, you should be able to get your A grade if you don't screw up your remaining P2, P3 and P1.</p>

              Alongside RJC and DHS, this year's VJC prelim papers also rank amongst the top of all Singapore JCs' prelim papers, in terms of quality of questions and standard of difficulty.<p>
              Based on yesterday's P4, you can expect that this year's 2017 A level's P2, P3  and P1 to be comparable with the RJC, DHS and VJC papers. So be sure you (ie. all JC students intent of scoring a distinction for your H2 Chem) go through these 3 JCs' 2017 prelim papers very thoroughly.
              </p><p>
              Disclaimer : I haven't, and probably won't, go through all of the other remaining Singapore JCs' 2017 prelim papers (I've gone through about 2/3 of all JCs, and find the quality of the RJC, DHS and VJC 2017 prelim papers in particular to be worthy of honorable mention). So it's entirely possible that some other JCs' 2017 prelim papers are every bit as good as RJC / DHS / VJC. And everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion. If you've any specific JC's 2017 prelim papers that you particularly enjoyed doing (helps if you're masochistic), do share your vote here.</p><p>Overall, I'm honestly glad to see a substantial increase in both the quality and difficulty of all JCs prelim papers this year. Very good work done here setting the 2017 prelim papers, all Singapore JC teachers. And based on yesterday's P4, Cambridge certainly seems to have the same idea (ie. raising the quality, creativity and difficulty of the A level papers for the new syllabus). So be mentally (and emotionally!) well-prepared.

              <p>Hi UltimaOnline thank you for taking the time to look over my answers!</p>
              <p>Q1. Do excuse my disaster of an answer to this question. This is why I am so worried, there are so many gaps in my concepts thanks to all the sleeps I had during lessons, I dont even know if doing papers will be able to fill in these gaps. With regards to the question, would it be correct to deduce that the ability of the lone pair of electrons on the N to delocalize into the double bond would depend on the hybridization of the N atom and the orientation of its orbitals? I would guess the least basic N would be the sp3 hybridized one in the ring, as its lone pair of electrons is delocalized into the ring, so not available for protonation, hence no Kb value?</p>
              <p>Q3. I was very unfamiliar with drawing the graph the other way around (protonation of histidine). I am so sorry I was just rather confused in general!</p>
              <p>Q5. Apologies for my horrendous mechanism. Wow I will definitely go look it up! Thank you for the tips!</p>
