              P2 Q1e) If I2 was 1st order, then the half-life would be constant, ie. no change. Since I2 is a 0th order reactant, half-life is halved when molarity is halved.<p>P2 Q5ciii) SN1. If the leaving group Br- attacked back, then you would end up with the original reactant, ie. no net reaction occurred.</p><p>
              P3 Q1(b)(ii) Yes you're right, but what exact value are you going to substitute in for delta G? -1? -0.1? -0.01? -0.001? So just use delta G = 0 first, then state that for the reaction to be thermodynamically feasible, the temperature needs to be <b>higher than</b> 958K (ie. take initiative to improve on the given mark scheme answer, when answering such questions in the A levels).

              Btw, Lee Hsien Loong's effort to combat diabetes in Singaporeans notwithstanding, you should still always go for Regular Coca-Cola over either Coca-Cola Zero or Coca-Cola Light (marketed as Diet Coke in some countries), because artificial sweeteners are always even more unhealthy than natural sugar.

Short term, the increase in CBS enzyme activity should lead â€“ and does lead â€“ to increased glutathione production. The problem is, long term, with MTHFR, and oxidative stress, the glutathione oxidation increases beyond the point of glutathione production. This is because the traditional transmethylation cycle (Methionine cycle) and BHMT pathway help produce CoQ10, carnitine, phosphatidylcholine, creatine, SAMe â€“ all of which are big players in antioxidant production and mitochondrial function. As those decline, oxidative stress increases, CBS upregulation is even higher â€“ and in turn, due to decreased CoQ10, carnitine, creatine, etc, ammonia levels climb and potentially so does hydrogen sulfide levels â€“ and the inability for the sulfonation pathway to keep up with the increased sulfite/sulfide production thus leading to sulfur sensitivity and molybdenum deficiency. I should also add that the likelihood of cysteine, glycine and B6 levels declining are high due to long term oxidative stress. Then â€“ the production of glutathione is also affected. Not to mention the decline of vitamin C, selenium and vitamin E which help prevent oxidized glutathione and help recycle it back into reduced glutathione. I believe that if we support the levels of CoQ10, carnitine, creatine, magnesium, phospholipids, molybdenum, decreased sulfur foods initially â€“ and decreased sulfur supplements â€“ and possibly increase SAMe right out of the gate â€“ before even supplementing with glutathione, methylfolate or methylcobalamin, the degree of improvement should increase quickly. As improvement occurs, then supporting phase 2 with glutathione, NAC and glycine should further help. I think now if we support the MTHFR defects this way â€“ by reducing oxidative stress, improving cell membrane stability and replenishing mitochondrial and antioxidant levels â€“ our patients will improve much faster. Then â€“ once those are in play â€“ then supporting MTHFR for long term natural production and hopefully removing that initial supplementation. - Dr Lynch

                                      <i>"Why excessive vitamin B2 causes a reduced amount of Serotonin : B2 is used in 3 very important enzyme complexes that are related to energy production, and that also use B1 Thiamine : the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and the branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (which allows valine, etc, to enter the TCA cycle as intermediates or acetyl CoA). If a person is low on B1 Thiamine, then taking B2 without B1 Thiamine (and you need more of the B1 Thiamine than the B2), they could drive their B1 Thiamine levels even lower because taking B2 will push these enzymes, which also use B1 Thiamine. B1 Thiamine is also used in the Pentose Phosphate pathway, or PPP, which provides NADPH for Glutathione reductase, among many other pathways. With low B1 Thiamine, the NADPH production from the PPP is reduced and then the body has to make up the difference through the Folate cycle. It isn't well known that the Folate cycle can produce NADPH, but it is. When glycine is used to make 5,10-methylene THF, ammonia is released. What do you need to get rid of ammonia? BH4. What is one of the things you need to make Serotonin? BH4. What happens is that the other amino acids are shunted into making serine and glycine for NADPH synthesis and so the urine amino acids are low, except for taurine, which can't enter the TCA cycle. The amino acids enter the TCA cycle and when they become malate they can enter the pathway to make serine and glycine. This is what showed up on my husband's urine amino acids test, with all the essential amino acids very low except taurine. My husband has had minor depression for years, and also high ammonia for years (we can smell it in his sweat and it comes out on urine tests.) It doesn't matter whether he has a high protein or low protein diet, his sweat smells, or smelled, like ammonia. We felt that it might cause a problem with his BH4, but we couldn't see what to do about it. Well, 3 days ago he started taking 1000mg of thiamine, instead of 100mg, along with his other vitamins, and last night he came in after exercising and sweating like crazy, and he said, "My shirt doesn't smell like ammonia now when I exercise!" And it didn't!"</i></p>

              PJC P3 Q4(a). Ask yourself to compare the solubility of amines before and after adding HCl, and the solubility of phenols before and after adding NaOH, and you have your answer.<p>K comes from G, which contains 3 OH groups (since there is no COOH group since G doesn't react with Na2CO3, and the idea of the O atoms being carbonyl C=O groups is inconsistent in terms of degree of unsaturation with the subsequent reaction products implying presence of a benzene ring), 1 of which must be a secondary alcohol (since J reacts with 2,4-DNPH but not with Tollens) which is eliminated during dehydration to form K, hence the 2 remaining OH groups, which don't react with PCl5, must be phenolic OH groups, which is consistent with K being oxidized by KMnO4 to L (use degree of unsaturation to deduce benzene ring oxidation).</p><p>Q5ai) The -1.02V refers to standard oxidation potential of tartaric acid to CO2, but the question asks you for standard reduction potential of CO2 to tartaric acid, that's why.</p><p>
              P2Q6b) 3 or 4 membered lactone rings are strained (ie. ring strain), because their angles deviate from the ideal bond angles as predicted by VSEPR theory (ie. angle strain). </p>

              Yeah Practical's like that, everyone also kena such problems, no worries. Focus on what you can control, ie. scoring near full-marks for the Theory papers, and just do your natural, stress-free best for the Practical. I every year lepak-lepak throw away both my Practical paper and my Planning Qn (ok from this year on, they're both in the same Paper), and I still get my A grade every year, stress-free.

                                      Did you know... raw onions, raw garlic and durians have peculiar effects on some people, such as making you thirsty and/or sleepy? Such 'allergic' reactions are genetically determined (by a number of inter-related genes), and are certainly associated with the various metabolic biochemical cycles and systems that we've been looking at, in the other posts here.

                                  Need a clue? What do all 3 (onions, garlic and durians) have in common? Their pungency? Which is caused by? That's right, sulfur-rich compounds (eg. proteins rich in cysteine amino acid).</p><p>
                                  As you should know by now (reading my other posts in my <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/5451">Health Hacks forum</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione">Glutathione</a> is a key anti-oxidant which requires the sulfur-containing cysteine amino acid (which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-acetylcysteine">N-AcetylCysteine</a> is often used by medical doctors to replenish a patient's Glutathione levels).</p><p>
                                  And the metabolic biochemical cycles and systems involved in generating and regulating Glutathione levels, also involve the MTHFR gene, all the B Vitamins, as well as the undermethylation versus overmethylation issue.
                                  </p><p>
                                  It's therefore not surprising, that sulfur-rich foods such as onions, garlic and durians, have such peculiar effects on some people. And what exactly it means for people 'allergic' to these foods, in terms of the MTHFR and associated genes, the undermethylation versus overmethylation issue, is not so straightforward and little understood even by medical doctors at the current time.

                          spiralgal : <i>Isn't it important to test the SUOX gene, the CBS gene and other genetic SNPs as well? Some people can't eat a lot of sulfur veggies and need to deal with this before going through an MTHFR protocol? I wonder about that when chronically ill people change their diets to a more sulfur enriched veggie diet, but don't feel better and maybe worse.</i><br><br>NEN : <i>I agree it is important to test for other genetic SNPs. My doctor tested me for MTHFR and found I had one copy. But the more I supported myself with sulfur-rich foods and supplements the worse I felt. After doing the 23-and-me genotyping I learned I was CBS homozygous and had several other serious mutations. When I backed off the high sulfur diet and changed up my supplement protocol I had a dramatic improvement in symptoms.</i>
              <br><br>
              MissBloat  :<i>I was diagnosed with Leaky Gut 6 months ago and have seen been on a very strict, clean diet, and have detoxified my life. My symptoms have, however, worsened substantially. I have been feeling so confused and disheartened by my progress. Recently, I did 23andMe and am heterozygous MTHFR, heterozygous CBS A360A and homozygous CBS A360A. My diet has been very high in sulfur and I wonder if that may be contributing to the problem. It seems the healthier I eat, the more sick I feel!</i><br><br>
              Mandy : <i>I recently found out that I have CBS mutation, which explains why I felt terribly poorly when I juiced supposedly healthy broccoli and kale (this was before I did the genotyping). It took me really, really long to figure this contradiction.</i></a>

              This should have been intuitive and not surprising : any chemical that uses its powerful biologically destructive effect, ie. most bleaches employ strong oxidizing agents such as sodium hypochlorite aka sodium chlorate(I) for its bleaching, cleaning, disinfecting functions, will most certainly have similarly destructive effects on the human biological body.<p>Many restaurants in Singapore use bleach to wipe tables and mop floors even when customers (eg. myself) are present and still eating, the bleach smell has always nauseated me and I've always intuitively known there would be harmful damaging biological effects, even on customers with occasional exposure, let alone clueless, hapless and helpless employees using the bleach (similar to some pitiful employees working under installed UV lightings at their workplace, eg. Singapore Zoo / Night Safari, without realizing the carcinogenic DNA damage UV light causes, which is also why you should get your anti-cancer Vitamin D from supplements rather than from sunlight exposure, no thanks to ozone layer depletion).

              Related to the previous post above, sodium hypochlorite [Latin name] or sodium chlorate(I) [Stock name] is often used as the active oxidizing ingredient in most Bleach solutions (this varies with brand). NaClO is obviously an ionic compound, which is thus non-volatile. Yet, you can certainly smell Bleach, and the vapors have now been shown in medical studies to cause irreversible oxidative damage to your lung alveoli tissue, resulting in severe lung diseases such as COPD. Explain this apparent contradiction.</p>

              Yo!<p>No need to explain further.</p><p>If one species has intermolecular hydrogen bonding while the other only has intermolecular van der Waals interactions, there is no need to specify the type of van der Waals interactions.</p><p>
              If both species only have intermolecular van der Waals interactions, then the most important point to consider (ie. which outweighs the polarity factor described next) is the size of the molecule and total number of electrons in the species.</p><p>Only if both species have similar molecular size and total number of electrons, then you consider the polarity of the 2 species, and bring in the type of van der Waals (ie. only for similar molecular size and number of electrons, then Keesom van der Waals forces outweigh Debye van der Waals forces outweigh London dispersion van der Waals forces).</p><p>
              Another factor to consider (for organic chemistry alkanes, etc), is branching, which reduces the surface area available for van der Waals interactions.</p><p>
              And for alkenes, the cis isomer (having a greater polarity) has a higher boiling point than the trans isomer, but the cis isomer may (or may not) have a lower melting point than the trans isomer, because there is the additional factor of effectiveness of stacking, which relates to the Coloumb's law and strength of van der Waals interactions.</p>
