              <p><br> Thanks for making the effort and taking the trouble giving a
                          detailed look at the entire P2, MapPwner, appreciate it :)</p>
              <p>So your top 10% friend and some sarcastic teachers in your
                          school said it was easy, while you found it moderate in difficulty.
                          The rest of your peers? And your friends in other schools?</p>
              <p>From your description, quite as expected, Cambridge balanced out
                          the paper very nicely, with a fair mix of easy, standard and
                          difficult questions. Let's see if this continues for P3 and P1.</p>
              <p>Let me know if you want me to comment on any question in
                          particular. Good to see some interesting questions in there, so at
                          least Cambridge didn't disappoint me in that regard ;)</p>

              <p>Regarding the friend who found it easy,yeah when he stepped out of the hall he said only lose a few marks but after discussing most of the paper that snowballed to 25 marks.</p>
              <p>My class on average the B graders(only 1 person) lost about same marks as me(15-17,he thought the paper was easy as he felt he only lost 2 marks but guess not),the rest probably might have done worse,another i asked lost 22 marks supposedly(he got E for prelims).Rest lost 25-30 or so.But i estimate the rest to lose on average 25-30 or so in all seriousness,as one couldnt even decipher the skeletal formula given in one of the question to deduce proper reagents and conditions.</p>
              <p>Of course i have friends in AJ losing same marks as me or even more,up to 30.My Hwa Chong friend who did much worse than me for prac aced this paper,lost about 5-6 marks</p>
              <p>I too,felt the paper was actually simple(except for qn 6 and 7,but qn 7 was like a repeat question from my secondary sch sec 2 chem paper for a few parts so it was actually familiar),but panic probably killed a lot of people.</p>
              <p>If i were to give an honest evaluation i would rate Qn 1 to 2 as easy(but i screwed up question 2 quite badly),qn 3 to 5 as moderate,qn 6 and 7 as moderate-challenging difficulty.</p>
              <p>Question 6 especially,as the question was unusual in the sense we need to state the purpose of benzoic acid that makes it useful for this calculation of heat capacity of calorimeter in a water,without considering about the water.</p>
              <p>Majority of the ppl were confused(&gt;50% in my school) and other JCs,they didnt use -(q x(avg temp rise)/amt of benzoic acid in moles for enthalpy change of combustion,but other ways,which were wrong.</p>
              <p>Organic chemistry component was moderately difficult to me,yet a fun question to do even though it was a pain doing so as it was really interesting for me(only lost 1 mark for organic component part,which was Qn 3 and 4).</p>

              Ahh, so your top 10% friend didn't do as well as he initially thought, but prolly still well enough to get A grade. In contrast, your HCJC friend really only lost about 5 marks for P2, enough to make up for his P4 errors. So MapPwner, yourself, you're well on track for A grade (so far overall score &gt; 80%, yes?).<p>
              Agree with you that the calorimetry question is a good challenging question for Singapore JC H2 students. I can actually think of 5 different reasons why benzoic acid is used as a standard for calorimetry (just as I can think of 3 different reasons why LiAlH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4), but Cambridge as expected, is already very lenient : any 1 reason (for both the benzoic acid and LiAlH4 questions) will suffice to score the 1 mark allocated. But the majority of Singapore JC H2 students are unlikely to have prior exposure to such questions, which is why these are, all things considered, good and fair distinction questions (not too unreasonable as to require 3 reasons for each question, but challenging enough to differentiate A graders from the rest).</p><p>
              Similarly for the Naphthalene aromaticity question (from your description, the entire question is about Naphthalene being aromatic with resonance delocalization of pi electrons, while in the basic H2 syllabus only the simplest aromatic species, benzene, is taught), another excellent question that (from your description), didn't disappoint me, in the sense it is interesting and A grade differentiating.</p><p>
              But as you (and your sarcastic school teachers) pointed out, Cambridge has already been very fair, since these are only a sprinkling of challenging questions amidst mostly easy or standard questions. So (unless P3 and P1 are hellish... hell yeah! I should set the A level papers Lol!) I doubt the bell-curve will deviate too much from past years.
              </p><p>
              Keep up your excellent A grade performance, MapPwner! :)

              <p>Generally more complaints about single mark losses here and there due to carelessness than about the toughness of the paper. Overall, managed a -13 to -15 in the worst case (Assuming zero marks for questions that I may have gotten a few points) and assuming they are very strict on the marking (eg penalising for lack of equation generation of nucleophile for question on reduction of aldehyde with NaBH4, even though the question already told you to assume H- is the nucleophile) etc. </p>

              <p>Overall score no lah how over 80% lol,my prac was rather bad.Prob for prac alone is 56%,this paper is 77-80%(pretty sure my estimates are very accurate,in line with my estimates for past chem papers for my exams this year,even if they deviate the score is higher than the estimated score).</p>
              <p>My prelim raw % scores for individual components were p1:80%,p2:72%,p3:76%,p4:56%,so more or less similar to a levels.</p>
              <p>As with regards about my HC friend,he probably will lose way more than 6 marks,i estimate eventually same marks lost as me as he only immediately excluded those he know is definitely wrong.[Edit:Yep just asked her more about it,he lost more marks(3 marks) due to the wrong calculation of enthalpy change of combustion as he used mc delta T,where m is mass of water/substance instead of only c delta T.So i'm pretty sure he will end up losing abt 15-17 marks too as we only discussed a few parts and already 9 marks lost].</p>
              <p>Edit:I miscalculated my prac %,shld be 56%,same as my prelim score instead of 60%.But thats somewhat decent as opposed to most of my friends who said they would be glad if they passed.</p>

              Nice nice. So that means you're on par with, or better than, both your JC's top 10% friend, and your HCJC friend.<p>

                  Good good, as long as you don't cockup your P3 and P1 (ie. about same performance as your Prelims), your overall score as a safe estimate will be between 75% to 80%, so that's a guaranteed A grade (as I said before, when students are shocked they didn't get A grade, it's not that the A grade boundary &gt; 75%, it's that they overestimated their own scores, but this shouldn't be an issue for you MapPwner).
                  </p><p>
                  So P2 was mostly easy to average, with only a couple of tough questions. But since you're the top 20% of the national cohort, MapPwner, perhaps the average Singapore H2 student found this paper mostly average in difficulty, with quite a few tough questions. But that's still totally within expectations of a Cambridge paper, so the bell-curve shouldn't have too many surprises this year.

              <p>My AJ friend who replied me told me he lost at least 20 after checking.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless,the amount of careless mistakes i made in my opinion,were avoidable,such as definition of homogenous catalyst,saying that 'it is in the same state as the reactants,which are aqueous',whereby the word 'phase' is used in place of 'state',so carelessly threw 1 mark away.</p>

              <p>yes, state that hydrogen has SMS, weak dispersion forces, hence low elec conductivity (or mp/bp), and briefly compare that with metallic bonds in grp 1 metals</p>

              Practical P4 was tougher than average, but today's P2 (and likely P3 and P1) is mostly average, perhaps slightly on the tough side. So at most, the A grade boundary may shift slightly closer towards 70% than 75%, but for Singapore A level Chemistry (even across syllabus changes), the A grade boundary has almost always been between 70% and 75%. And considering today's mostly average paper, there is no reason to believe it will shift to less than 70% (it'll never happen Lol) or go beyond 75% (unless P3 and P1 are significantly easier than P4 and P2).

              <p>Contrary to popular belief about the need for equation(s)[If you are referring to the blood and lactic acid buffer question for question 2],it is actually only 1 equation,which is the buffer buffering against H+(i forgot the exact eqn).</p>
              <p>Considering that question was 2 marks,and i just merely breezed through wrote 2 eqn,1 for H+ presence,the other for OH- without explaining how buffer works+ H+ source i will probably only get 1mark,since equation is only worth 1 mark.</p>

              Uhhh, I gotta leave some BedokFunland JC trade advantages for my own BedokFunland JC students (in future cohorts), too many private tutors silently lurking on the forums.<p>
              Besides (more relevantly for you), since it was already asked in P2, no way Cambridge will ask again in P3 or P1. And as you saw for yourself, while I can think of 3 reasons, Cambridge will accept any 1 reason to get the full 1 mark, so no worries (u prolly already got that mark).</p><p> U can go google out for yourself if interested. If u don't understand what you google out, you can link to it and I'll comment on it. This applies to any other Chemistry topic.</p><p>
              Gambatte for P3! :D</p>

              <p>Pretty sure 2 of the 3 reasons are Al-H vs B-H bond overlap due to diff in atomic size of Al and B,Al-H bond less effective orbital overlap,bond of Al-H thus longer and easier to break to release hydride.Another is diff polarising power of Li+ and Na+ and since Li+ caitionic radius is smaller it polarises,weakens the Al-H bond in Lialh4 to a greater extent to release hydride ions.</p>

              Unfortunately, both CB2883J and delurach gave the wrong answers, because both of you offered constitutional isomers, instead of stereoisomers of the same alkane.<p>
