                  Good attempt. While not the A grade answer, at least it's not the U grade answer. I know you don't have a private tutor, so try asking your school teacher? But don't be shocked to find out that most JC school teachers and private tutors will also give the same answer you did.<p>
                  Assuming you'll like to try again (eg. after asking your school teacher), only post the correct final answer here, and don't post the correct working (as it'll ruin the fun for others).</p><p>And I can't give any hints, because it's impossible to give any hints without giving away the correct working and hence answer.</p>

              You're right that the 2013 SAJC paper is more or less A level standard. Whether it's slightly tougher or not depends on which year of the A level exams that you're comparing with. I expect this year's A level exam to be more or less that of the 2013 SAJC papers standard. I'll be surprised if the A level paper is any easier or any tougher than 2013 SAJC papers.

              Indeed, this is one topic that Cambridge can set more challenging questions (especially for new syllabus), that can be used to distinguish A grade students from the rest of the cohort. Because this topic is so vast, that different JCs will expose different students to different coordination complexes, colors and geometries, as well as extension applications such as Kstab.<p>So evidently this topic, together with solubility equilibria, are your Achilles heel. And guess what, Cambridge can set challenging (ie. A grade) questions combining coordination complexes with solubility equilibria, eg. Kstab + Ksp. Your Achilles heel combo! *evil laugh*</p><p>But don't worry lah, you don't need to outrun the bear, you just need to outrun your peers on the bell-curve, if you can't do the question, then likely (have confidence in yourself) that the majority of the national H2 student cohort also can't do.</p><p>
              </p><p>Back to the TYS qn : the more exposed you are a greater number of coordination complexes (ie. various metal cations coordinated with various ligands), their geometries and colors, etc, the better equipped you'll be when Cambridge asks such questions, testing your exposure to the depth of this topic.</p><p>If there's any specific part of the question that you have a query regarding the given answer (either provided by your school or a TYS publisher), go ahead and ask me on the forum.</p><p>Not just MapPwner, but all 2017 JC students, anything you don't understand about a TYS qn or Prelim qn, go ahead and quote the source, eg. 2016 RJC P2 Q3, and specify what about the answer that you don't understand or agree with.</p>

              <p>I will try to compile them all when I'm free while doing my revision for chemistry.I think for transition metals the reason why I couldn't do that question was because I didn't read my notes thoroughly to deduce the unknown colourless compound to be [CuCl2]-,as d-orbital splitting resulting in d-to-d electronic transition to form coloured compounds only occurs if the transition metal ion has partially filled 3d orbitals .In this case Cu(I) has fully filled 3d orbitals thats why it is colourless.</p>

              Your fatal error (ie. why your alternative answer will not be accepted by Cambridge), is that your E (unlike VJC's answer) is not capable of geometric isomerism, as your double-bond is within a 6 membered-ring.<p>

              The VJC and AJC questions are very similar, except that, as you say, the VJC question is slightly tougher because of the double bond. So this particular AJC question is considered slightly below average difficulty for top tier JCs, and approximately average difficulty for medium tier JCs.
              <p>
              Btw, since you've evidently no problems solving OC questions, how about focusing more on Ksp &amp; TM questions?

              prelim questions at my own free time and currently the questions i
              encountered are relatively manageable for now.Only asked about this
              particular organic deductive question because it was part of my
              school's set of banded lecture questions,which is part of the
              band 1 lecture questions.My school ranks students into 4 bands,band
              1 being the best and band 4 being the worst and the
              questions provided for each band varies.</p>

              Surely your band1 questions include tougher OC deductive elucidation questions than the VJC and AJC questions? If not, don't just rely on your school's compiled questions, go obtain for yourself (and do them!) all the Prelim papers from the last 5 years at least (eg. you can buy them online) to challenge yourself.<p>And of course, seeing how your OC mastery is already top of your JC, I'm more interested in you sharing tough Ksp and TM questions that you struggle with. </p>
