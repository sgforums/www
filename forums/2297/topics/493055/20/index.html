                  If P1 is easy, it'll rise back up to nearer 75%. If P1 is tougher
                  than the other 3 Papers, the it'll slide down to nearer 70%.</p>
              <p>Based on your estimates for the Papers completed, as long as you
                  and your friends score near full marks for the upcoming P1, you

              <p>Thanks for the reply! :) yeah I think I need a close to perfect, at the least &gt;27 for mcq to scrape an A. No matter how easy/hard p1 is I personally feel the A grade range is not going to be high this year.

                           Edit : On 2nd thoughts, I've worked out how Cambridge is probably awarding those 6 easy marks. It's all good for most students, and for yourself too, do12453 (you can just estimate you scored 4 marks). No worries.

                          As 'longaf' said on Reddit : <i>"no one can give an exact overall percentage"</i> for the A grade boundary for this year, in fact not even Cambridge or SEAB, simply because the papers haven't been marked by Cambridge, and the raw scores haven't been submitted to SEAB, and no one right now knows how this year's cohort of students have performed (even after P1 is completed, let alone today is before P1), because that's the very idea of a bell-curve, ie. dependent on how every single student in this year's cohort has performed, which right now, neither Cambridge nor SEAB has any idea on this, because the papers aren't marked yet.<p>
                          </p><p>
                          And the astute will note that I'm certainly not giving an "exact overall percentage", I'm merely stating that, just as an atomic orbital is the region of space around a nucleus in which the probability is the highest (but never 100%) of finding an electron associated with that orbital, similarly, I'm merely stating from experience, that the A grade boundary has the highest probability of residing between 70% to 75% (hardly an exact percentage, you see), and of course it's entirely possible (just extremely unlikely), that this year's A grade boundary might go below 70% or above 75%, because nobody knows how easy / tough P1 is, and nobody knows how every single student in this year's 2017 cohort has performed.
                          </p><p>
                          You're probably hoping for me to just directly reveal whether I have insider info from SEAB, or if these values are nothing more than my own personal estimates without evidence, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response">without revealing too much, let's just say it's 'somewhere in between'</a>, ie. I have very good reasons for giving this confident 70% to 75% estimate for the A grade boundary, unlike say, show-off school teachers who delight in sadistically bragging to their students, "<i>I just saw this year's Paper and it's ridiculously easy! The A grade boundary for H2 Chem this year confirm 82.5% liao! Wahahaha!!!</i>"</p>

              <p><br> As 'longaf' said on Reddit : <em>"no one can give an exact overall
              percentage"</em> for the A grade boundary for this year, in fact not
              even Cambridge or SEAB, simply because the papers haven't been
              marked by Cambridge, and the raw scores haven't been submitted to
              SEAB, and no one right now knows how this year's cohort of students
              have performed (even after P1 is completed, let alone today is
              before P1), because that's the very idea of a bell-curve, ie.
              dependent on how every single student in this year's cohort has
              performed, which right now, neither Cambridge nor SEAB has any idea
              on this, because the papers aren't marked yet.</p>
              <p>And the astute will note that I'm certainly not giving an "exact
              overall percentage", I'm merely stating that, just as an atomic
              orbital is the region of space around a nucleus in which the
              probability is the highest (but never 100%) of finding an electron
              associated with that orbital, similarly, I'm merely stating from
              experience, that the A grade boundary has the highest probability
              of residing between 70% to 75% (hardly an exact percentage, you
              see), and of course it's entirely possible (just extremely
              unlikely), that this year's A grade boundary might go below 70% or
              above 75%, because nobody knows how easy / tough P1 is, and nobody
              knows how every single student in this year's 2017 cohort has
              performed.</p>
              <p>You're probably hoping for me to just directly reveal whether I
              have insider info from SEAB, or if these values are nothing more
              than my own personal estimates without evidence, but <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response">without revealing
              too much, let's just say it's 'somewhere in between'</a>, ie. I
              have very good reasons for giving this confident 70% to 75%
              estimate for the A grade boundary, unlike say, show-off school
              teachers who delight in sadistically bragging to their students,
              "<em>I just saw this year's Paper and it's ridiculously easy! The A

              "Limited" is actually indeed required to ensure monochlorination, and should have been included for a good answer. Cambridge has in some past papers let it slide, but in some other past papers penalized it. So you may or may not get away with this one.</p><p>

              "<i>Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric (sic) acid at a temperature not exceeding 50Â°C.

              That's for benzene, so for deactivated benzene, 55Â°C is actually (and ironically for you) reasonable. But then again, that's <a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/arenes/nitration.html">Jim Clark's opinion (different A level syllabuses in the UK used slightly different temperatures)</a> ; in the pre-2017 H2 syllabus, Cambridge actually wanted "50Â°C &lt; T &lt; 60Â°C" as the ideal student answer for nitration of unsubstituted benzene.</p><p>But for the 2017 P3 Qn, Cambridge actually only required (and wanted) "heat under reflux" (more correct than just "heat", since this is a synthesis question, but fortunately for many students, Cambridge will probably accept just "heat", but seriously you students should have known better), since this new syllabus no longer requires (or even wants, ie.

              Cambridge's fault lah.<p>If they expected what most of you students wrote, then it doesn't seem worth 6 marks to me.</p><p>If they expected what I would write if I took the A level paper this year (ie. beyond what JCs teach, ie. why ionic oxides are basic, why covalent oxides are acidic, why ionic oxides with covalent character are amphoteric), then that's worth more than 6 marks (because those points would be in addition to, not in exchange of, what you guys have written).</p><p>So neither here nor there, just take it (ie. the more likely case is) that the standard answers most of you wrote can get the 6 marks lor.</p><p>
              But Cambridge really nonsense this year, some questions so time-consuming only so few marks allocated, then some questions only got short answers yet so many marks allocated. Sheesh. *clap*clap* good job, Cambridge.
              </p><p>
              But on an objective note, like MapPwner said, it's not that the paper's questions are super difficult, it's mostly that the entire paper (all the questions collectively) is time consuming, which results in a paper on the difficult side.
              </p><p>
              So overall this year, the consensus amongst the general student population is that this year's Papers (assume P1 is of similar difficulty to all the other Papers) are significantly tougher than previous years, so yeah I expect the A grade boundary to slide down closer towards 70%.</p><p>
              Then of course, like over at Reddit, you have students, or more accurately, friends of students, and school teachers, who brag that this is a ridiculously easy paper, it's a walk in the park, etc.</p><p>
              Hey, the questions are easy for me as well, but you don't see me bragging (oh, I see what I did there) that this is an easy paper, because I think this is a time-consuming hence difficult paper, relative to previous years. So I agree with MapPwner that the A grade boundary should slide down towards 70%, but (let's be realistic), SEAB will resist lowering the A grade boundary to anything less than 70% (or the Universities will complain to MOE of grade inflation making it harder to select students for elite Uni courses).</p><p>
              Thing is, this so-called grade inflation over the years is not because the papers are getting easier, it's rather that more Singaporeans are studying more desperately to do better for the sake of their futures, but that's harsh cruel reality of physical incarnation for you : like what elite PAP ministers say : Singapore can't have all doctors and lawyers and graduates, the economy needs lower non-graduate qualifications for lower pay jobs as well.

              contrast, Cambridge was inconsistently generous to allocate 6 marks
              for the acid-base nature of oxides across Period 3) ; that they
              stingily allocated only 3 marks here (and as such misleading many
              students) is likely thus : 1 mark for describing the trend down the
              Group (including a generic decomposition equation and stating that
              HCl is thermally stable and does not decompose), 1 mark for
              explaining the trend (just relationship between bond length and
              ease of bond dissociation will suffice, no need effectiveness of
              orbital overlap, no need quote Data Booklet values), and 1 mark for

              substituent was deactivating, they erroneously thought that
              Cambridge was being sneaky-cunning and had required "more than

                          Cambridge probably will accept lah, no worries.
                      <p>
                      Edit : At least for this year (1st year of new syllabus), they'll probably accept. If too many students all write the same answer which is not the Mark Scheme answer, especially if Cambridge recognizes it's a new syllabus teething problem caused by an entire country of teachers still teaching from the old syllabus, the Cambridge Markers will submit this issue to the Cambridge Chief Marker for him/her to make a decision on the matter, and the Cambridge Chief Marker will usually make a fair decision, so as not to unfairly penalize an entire country of students.</p>

              Well, you got exactly 1 week to brush up on your MCQ. I strongly advise you (ie. all JC2 students), do ALL the 2017 Prelim MCQs (any MCQ u need help with, post here), and when you're done with this, do either the TYS MCQs, or the 2016 Prelim MCQs (since both are of the old syllabus anyway, but more practice is always better than less).
              <p>
              As for this MCQ (adapted from anyway), I won't reveal the answers. So wait for other JC2 students to post their answers here (preferably with working, so other students can understand), and I'll tell you guys if your answers are correct.

              So no one (ie. including you reading this) on this forum can answer this Singapore JC Prelim MCQ? (I removed the A B C D options, but the original JC Prelim Qn is an MCQ). This isn't even one of my BedokFunland JC challenge questions, it's a Singapore JC within H2 syllabus MCQ. C'mon pple, you gotta be able to solve this question to be confident of securing your A grade.
