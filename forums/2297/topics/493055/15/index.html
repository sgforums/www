              <p>I was bored merely and just commented there+posted suggested answers for the practical(which aren't 100% accurate and shouldn't be taken to be fully correct,especially QA explanations)</p>
              <p>But of course,there are slight disagreements to the answers i posted,such as the question in the practical showing the reaction mechanism of Fe(H2O)6 3+ catalyst with H2O2 to decompose it,which the question required with your observations.My suggested answer just said stating the formation of an intermediate complex in step 1 as the catalyst is used up,and regeneration of the catalyst in step 3 is already 2 marks secured,and of course someone said must use observations throughout haha,which i think should be the last mark bah to get the full 3 marks for the question.Maybe you can suggest what u wrote for this question?</p>

              <p>Alongside RJC and DHS, this year's VJC prelim papers also rank
              amongst the top of all Singapore JCs' prelim papers, in terms of
              quality of questions and standard of difficulty.</p>
              <p>Based on yesterday's P4, you can expect that this year's 2017 A
              level's P2, P3 and P1 to be comparable with the RJC, DHS and VJC
              papers. So be sure you (ie. all JC students intent of scoring a
              distinction for your H2 Chem) go through these 3 JCs' 2017 prelim
              papers very thoroughly.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer : I haven't, and probably won't, go through all of
              the other remaining Singapore JCs' 2017 prelim papers (I've gone
              through about 2/3 of all JCs, and find the quality of the RJC, DHS
              and VJC 2017 prelim papers in particular to be worthy of honorable
              mention). So it's entirely possible that some other JCs' 2017
              prelim papers are every bit as good as RJC / DHS / VJC. And
              everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion. If you've any specific
              JC's 2017 prelim papers that you particularly enjoyed doing (helps
              if you're masochistic), do share your vote here.</p>
              <p>Overall, I'm honestly glad to see a substantial increase in both
              the quality and difficulty of all JCs prelim papers this year. Very
              good work done here setting the 2017 prelim papers, all Singapore
              JC teachers. And based on yesterday's P4, Cambridge certainly seems
              to have the same idea (ie. raising the quality, creativity and
              difficulty of the A level papers for the new syllabus). So be
              mentally (and emotionally!) well-prepared.</p>

              Ellipsisss, no worries about my BedokFunland JC Challenge Qns. If Cambridge used my BedokFunland JC Challenge questions for A levels , the number of distinctions in the Singapore cohort would be reduced to 1%.<p>
              Focus on doing as many 2017 Prelim Papers as you can now, both Ellipsisss and MapPwner (and all other students reading this thread). Any questions from any 2017 Prelim Papers, feel free to post here, I'll help you guys out.
              </p><p>
              MapPwner and Ellipsisss, let us know which JC's 2017 Prelim Paper you vote to be the toughest. And individual questions as well, eg. MapPwner found the DHS question on sulfonation to be tough.
              </p><p>
              In this way, the many silent JC student lurkers reading this thread can choose to attempt your recommended tough questions from 2017 Prelim Papers, and they can learn and benefit from such questions.</p>

              The SRJC 2017 Prelim Papers are very good, well-balanced papers, with a good spread of both easy and difficult questions. If this year's P4 is an accurate indicator of the difficulty level of the remaining papers, then you can expect the difficulty of this year's A level P1, P2 and P3 to be very close to the SRJC 2017 Prelim Papers.
              
              Of course, the remaining A level papers *could* be shockingly tougher or easier than everyone's expectations, but I seriously doubt the variance will be that large, most likely will be very close to this year's SRJC standard, which is already considered tougher than previous years' A level papers. Welcome to the new H2 syllabus.
              <p>
              Good recommendation by Hello199999. All JC students do attempt the SRJC 2017 Prelim Papers.

              Both sets of the PJC and AJC 2017 papers are well-balanced papers (with a good spread of easy and slightly tough questions), that all JC students should certainly practice on.<p> Difficulty-wise, as you say, AJC is slightly tougher (particularly P3) than PJC, and both JCs' 2017 papers are somewhat easier than the RJC / VJC / DHS / SRJC 2017 papers.
              </p><p>
              It's fair to expect the difficulty standard of this year's A level exam papers to mostly lie somewhere in between the 2 difficulty levels, but of course, there's a small chance it could be an unexpected outlier : even easier than the PJC papers, or even tougher than the RJC papers, but this is extremely unlikely (based on the P4 just over, P2+3+1 are unlikely to be easy papers).</p>

              Because the equation is Cu2+(aq) + Mg(s) --&gt; Cu(s) + Mg2+(aq), and the thermodynamic activity of solids is taken to be 1 (mathematical derivation of this is done at University level).

              Excellent recommendation by CKTR!<p>
              The ACJC 2017 prelim papers certainlyy belong to the upper difficulty tier of 2017 prelim papers, together with RJC / VJC / DHS / SRJC etc.
              </p><p>
              Indeed in some ways, this might be just be my favorite set of 2017 prelim papers, due to it's multiple extensive questioning (ie. 5 questions across P2 &amp; P3) of unfamiliar (ie. not taught within the H2 syllabus) curved-arrow electron-flow reaction mechanisms, which as some of you might know, is in line with BedokFunland JC style (ie. I would be utterly delighted if the actual Singapore A Level exam papers used the ACJC 2017 prelim papers).
              </p><p>
              So all JC2 students serious about scoring a distinction grade, be sure you thoroughly go through this upper-tier set of ACJC / RJC / VJC / DHS / SRJC papers before next week's P2 &amp; P3. Any questions post em here.

              Difficulty-wise, given the high standards of the NYJC papers in recent years, a little disappointing this year. Quality of the papers is still good (and still recommended for all students to practice on), but difficulty-wise, it's somewhere in between the 2 difficulty tiers for this year.

              <p>I feel ACJC P2 is rather doable but P3 otherwise there are certain parts(reactions of halogens with H2SO4,decomposition of Group II nitrates) which are technically not part of our syallabus but tested in the paper somewhat stumped me and I read about them slightly in depth to play safe,as my school didn't touch on those as its said to be out of syallabus.</p>

                                            To be precise, "accepts... from", not "forms... with". But bear in mind I- is an anion, and the adduct is an anion, so for dot-and-cross diagrams (if required), while the dative bond should still be shown with a dot-dot or cross-cross, a hollow-dot (ie. electron accepted from the species which reduced 1/2 I2 to the I- reactant, presumed to be the counter-cation present throughout, eg. K+) must be clearly shown as part of a lone pair in both the I- reactant and I3- product.<p>
                                        Yes, of course (isn't it obvious why the ionic geometry of the adduct is linear?), Cambridge can certainly ask you to draw out the full mechanism (in which case no 'dative' arrowhead bonds should be shown anywhere in the product, just a curved arrow from the I- or Br- nucleophile to the I2 electrophile, then all straight lines (ie. normal bonds) in the product, any 'dative' arrowhead bonds shown will be penalized), as this mechanism is already much easier than the other ones asked in 2017 ACJC Prelim papers.

                                            The conceptual basics (eg. trend of redox potentials), yes. The technical details (eg. memorization of equations), no. But distinction A grade students are indeed expected to be exposed beyond the syllabus, and/or are expected to be intelligent enough to figure out the reaction, equation and products (eg. using Data Booklet for hints) even without prior exposure. So yes, Cambridge can indeed ask on these not-in-syllabus reactions, although Cambridge would probably be a little kinder, and give slightly more hints than Singapore JC prelim papers.

              Ellipsisss, here's a chance for your 'redemption' (you were game enough to attempt my earlier BedokFunland JC Challenge Qn, but as I said, I'll only reveal the answers for such Challenge Qns to my own BedokFunland JC students, so I left you hanging back there regarding the imidazole ring of histidine, well, here's a simpler question that has a higher probability of being asked by Cambridge for the new H2 syllabus).<p>
              Since the new syllabus specimen paper asked for the hybridization of N atoms (where in the old syllabus, questions were restricted to C atoms), almost all the 2017 Singapore JC Prelim Papers started following suit. So here's a BedokFunland JC question for all of you.</p><p>
              <b>State *and* explain the hybridization of the N atom in the amide functional group.</b></p><p>Note : At Uni levels, the actual hybridization will be x% this, y% that, z% something else, but at A levels, you're expected to identify the single 'major' hybridization that contributes most to the actual hybridization.
              </p><p>I'll leave it to you guys (feel free to attempt and post what you would write as your answer if this question comes out in this coming week's P2 or P3) to discuss this very easy question, I'm sure you guys don't need me to spoonfeed you the answer, but try to resist googling out the answer before attempting it yourself, that's just lazy.

              You'll need to elaborate to get full marks. If you say sp2 because of trigonal planar electron geometry, then why trigonal planar electron geometry?

              You're still missing the mark (literally, hehe).<p>
              Comparing the N atoms in both amines and amides, both have 1 lone pair + 3 bond pairs, so why are their hybridizations different?</p><p>
              I've given out too many clues liao, I'll leave it for other students here (including you silent lurkers, post leh!) to attempt and post their answers. See what they say.</p>
