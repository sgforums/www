              1. See if the question specifically asks for it.
              <p>2. See if it's directly relevant to the topic (eg. energetics directly relevant, periodicity not directly relevant, except some parts eg. hydration then hydrolysis of AlCl3).
              </p><p>
              3. When in doubt, go ahead and write it.
              </p><p>4. For ionic equations, always write state symbols.</p>

              Just to check, are you a school candidate or private candidate, and are you taking A levels this year? You've been asking a mixture of J1 and J2 topics.<p>You're not allowed to use acronyms such as pd-pd in the A level exams. Zero marks.</p><p>Interactions include both attractions and repulsions, and depending on context, either or both can be used.</p><p>Students are advised to use the following phrasing in the A level exams :</p><p><b>Between polar molecules, the intermolecular interactions are permanent dipole - permanent dipole Keesom van der Waals forces.</b></p>

              Understandable, you tutor both O and A levels.<p>
              At O levels, the diagram of the setup is often simplified, because O level students are not expected to understand why or how a salt bridge is necessary.</p><p>At A levels, the student must draw a proper setup separating the cathode and anode (to force electrons to flow in the external wire), and a salt bridge is necessary to allow the electrons to flow. </p><p>That's why your previously suggested setup (which doesn't separate cathode and anode) fails.</p>

              Depends on which reactant is in excess. For Group 17 purposes, use NaHSO4. In other contexts, see which equation is more relevant to the question and/or final products.

              Also, it's likely that some setups you're referring to, do not need salt bridges or separate compartments, because they're not Galvanic-Voltaic cells, but are electrolytic cells.<p>O levels test mainly on the latter, while A levels test equally on the former and the latter both.</p>

              This anomaly is one of those interesting tricks (I have an entire BedokFunland JC collection of such fascinating Chemistry anomalies) that I usually only share with and reveal the answer to my own BedokFunland JC students, and I won't spoonfeed these answers here. But you should be able to find the answer for yourself quite easily with Google.<p>Cambridge is unlikely to ask A level students this question, but if they do, they'll phrase it as, "<i>Suggest a reason for this anomalous trend</i>" to function as a distinction-type question to separate the A graders from the rest. While one can of course easily google out the answer, the point is students don't have access to the internet during the exam paper, which is where exploring beyond the basic syllabus throughout the year will help prepare determined students to get A grade.</p>

                              <p> when to use the term "delocalised electrons" and "mobile
              electrons"? what is the difference between these two terms?</p>

              As with many other such terminology pairs (eg. heat vs reflux, energy vs enthalpy, shielding vs screening, oxidation state vs oxidation number, resonance vs mesomeric, etc), in most cases they can be used interchangeably and Cambridge will generally accept either term, except in specific contexts where one term is clearly more appropriate than the other.<p>To explain why molten or aqueous ionic compounds and metals conduct electricity, it's better to use "mobile". To describe the resonance effect, eg. why amides are much less basic than amines, it's compulsory to use "delocalized".</p>
