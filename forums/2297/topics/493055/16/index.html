              It's not available online. Only some JCs gave their students a hardcopy (ie. no softcopy to share online) to practice on. No worries lah, just practice the 2017 Prelim Papers.

              No. Spotting won't work for Singapore H2 Chemistry papers.<p>
              Even after tomorrow's P2, you still can't reliably spot topics for P3. Let alone before P2.

              Well this year, if P2, 3, 1 are as tough as P4, the bell-curve will be 'steeper' than in recent years. Whether that works for or against you (ie. each student), depends partly on yourself (you'll have to be significantly above average no matter what) and also partly on how SEAB chooses to apply the bell-curve (it's up to SEAB to shift the bell-curve to the left or right, the % of A graders are different every year, it's not a 'hard' or absolute bell-curve grading, but a 'soft' one).

              That's safe. The A grade boundary has almost never exceeded 75% (but is always above 70%).<p>The problem is students, when counting their own scores, usually miss out on errors they didn't realize they made, or they think their answer phrasing (eg. copied from school notes) would get full marks from Cambridge, when it wouldn't (especially if the question has a twist in it, so regurgitating school notes won't be enough).</p><p>
              So if you (ie. all students) counted you got &gt; 75% but still didn't get A grade, it's far more likely that you overestimated your own score, rather than the actual grade boundary being &gt; 75%. So always play safe when counting your own score, and just assume you get zero marks for iffy questions.</p>

              <p>Paper was considered of moderate difficulty but required much prudence to score.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Weird questions were why Lialh4 stronger reducing agent than nabh4(orbital overlap between al and H less effective easier break to release more molecules to reduce molecules) and suggesting why c6h5cooh is useful to measure specific heat capacity of calorimeter.Determining specific heat capacity of calorimeter for this particular energetics question is somewhat unusual,using only -(ct)/amt of benzoic acid) for enthalpy change of combustion of c6h5cooh,whereby c is specific heat capacity of calorimeter and t is average temperature rise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More standard questions were defining homogenous catalyst,deducing another structure for c2h4o other than etheneol and ethanal(which is a triangular structure with c-o-c bond),calculation of ph of soln and concentration of a salt in a buffer solution.</p>

              <p>Fyi the qn on Lialh4 and nabh4, i brought in the stronger polarising power of Li+ and larger, more polarisable electron cloud of alh4- hence Al-H bonds weakened to grwater exrent, easily releasing H.

              <p>For lialh4 explanation i explained above thats the answer,orbital overlap so easier to release more hydride molecules(if u did other sch papers orbital overlap was the main reason why)Not forgetting one needs to show the generation of hydride molecule from BH4- in step 1 of nucleophilic addition.</p>
              <p>I wont dare say its easy,i have a friend,hes top 10% in level for chem,said the paper was easy and lost only 5 marks.We discussed only 70% of the paper and that increased to 25 marks loss total so far.However of course there were chem teachers who said it was simple and beared a tinge of sarcasm by saying qn 6 and 7 is 'only slightly harder'.</p>
              <p>As for me after stringent calculation of my score after discussion with many people,i probably lost 15-17 marks.</p>

              <p>Qn 1(Ionisation energies of element A(chlorine) and hydrogen properties)</p>
              <p>Increase in I.E as successive electrons are removed from element A(1m),as it is increasingly difficult to remove a negatively charged electron from a positively charged element A ion(1m).Large increase from 7th to 8th i.e as the 8th electron is located in an inner electron shell,which is closer to the nucleus and thus more energy required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction,resulting in large rise in I.E.(2m)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Element A is chlorine(1m).1s^22s^22^p63^s23p^5.(electronic configuration-1m).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hydrogen can be classified as a grp 1 element as it has 1 valence electron in its outermost shell(1m).</p>
              <p>Cannot be classified:</p>
              <p>Grp 1 elements-metal lattice structure vs simple covalent molecule structure for H+describe(1m)</p>
              <p>Contrasting properites=grp 1 higher melting/boiling point than H/H2+accounting for the reason why(1m)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Qn 2(Acids and buffers of HCO2- and blood)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>part i)ph=2.60+showing calculation(3m)</p>
              <p>(ii)forgot the answer</p>
              <p>(iii)ph will fall if no buffer system in a human while exercising</p>
              <p> Qn 3,4,5(C2H4O/cinammealdehyde and transition elements)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>qn3)</p>
              <p>(i)showing molecular formula is c2h4o(relatively straightforward)</p>
              <p>(ii) structure is a triangular molecule with c-o-c bond and c-c bond between both c for c2h4o,with remaining h bonded to the 2 c ensuring octet rule fufilled.</p>
              <p>Reaction with Br2(aq)=orange br2 decolourises rapidly to colourless</p>
              <p>Na2co3:No vigorous effervescence,production of co2 observed.</p>
              <p>Kc is small which thus show most of the product is the (LHS one-I forgot the name) and thus position of equilibrium lies more to the left(1m).Kc shows the extent of favourability of product formed in the equilibrium and can be used to determine the amount of product formed based on Kc value.''If Kc small=poe left while if Kc large=poe right.''(Stating something like this is 1m I think)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(iv) memorise balanced eqn of triiodomethane with ch3cho</p>
              <p>cant really remember much for qn 3...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>qn(4)</p>
              <p>for cinammealdehyde,1 structure still has c=c and aldehyde just that it is arranged at different positions(swapped)=positional isomerism,while the other only has an aldehyde group and no alkene group=structural isomerism(Or show cis-trans version for one of them).</p>
              <p>After that is Hcn(aq),trace amount of nacn(aq),in the cold,10 to 20 degree.</p>
              <p>when the nitrile compound is reduced as shown in question by h2,alkene and nitrile is reduced,but for lialh4 alkene is not reduced.</p>
              <p>behind the mechanism is nucleophilic addition(relatively straightforward)</p>
              <p>Generation of Hydride ion:BH4- -&gt;(reversible arrow) H^- +BH3.</p>
              <p>Then the slow and fast step relatively standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why lialh4 a stronger red. agent than nabh4=orbital overlap of Al and H in AL-H bond or different polarising power of Li+ and Na+ of anion electron cloud to release hydride ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the naoh thingy just dilute the thing(1m) and state how to deduce order+brief procedure of expt such as recording time taken for ppt formation at diff concentrations via dilution and comparing it with diff expt to determine order(2m)[I made naoh more concentrated but as my back part is right i probably lost 1 mark as only dilution is accepted to concentration lower than 2mol dm^-3].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Graph shows a first order downward sloping curve with constant half life(reaction time) halves for a doubled increase in successive concentrations of naoh up to 2moldm^-3.[I labelled beyond 2 moldm3 so if lenient i lost 1 mark at most,if strict 2 marks lost].[I forgot whether this was part of qn 4 or 5]</p>

              <p>to find heat capacity of calorimeter is -(q x average temp rise for sample 2 and 3)/amt of benzoic acid in moles=-3230kj mol^-1,where q is the heat capacity of calorimeter.One should end up with something like -(qx30)/0.05= -3230kj mol^-1 before eventually arriving at 5.38kj bla bla for q.</p>

              for chem,said the paper was easy and lost only 5 marks.We discussed
              only 70% of the paper and that increased to 25 marks loss total so
              far.However of course there were chem teachers who said it was
              simple and beared a tinge of sarcasm by saying qn 6 and 7 is 'only
              slightly harder'.</p>
              <p>As for me after stringent calculation of my score after
              discussion with many people,i probably lost 15-17 marks.</p>

              Thanks for making the effort and taking the trouble giving a detailed look at the entire P2, MapPwner, appreciate it :)
              <p>
              So your top 10% friend and some sarcastic teachers in your school said it was easy, while you found it moderate in difficulty. The rest of your peers? And your friends in other schools?</p><p>
              From your description, quite as expected, Cambridge balanced out the paper very nicely, with a fair mix of easy, standard and difficult questions. Let's see if this continues for P3 and P1.</p><p>
              Let me know if you want me to comment on any question in particular. Good to see some interesting questions in there, so at least Cambridge didn't disappoint me in that regard ;)
