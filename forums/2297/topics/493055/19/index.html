              <p>Hello, I’ve got 2 questions..</p>
              <p>1) how do you determine which substituent “overpowers” the other? Say you have a phenol and an NO2 if you were to talk about electrophilic sub of No2, will you expect harsher or milder conditions? </p>
              <p>2) I’m confused with the common ion effect.. and how you can compare just the solubilities of say Ca in Caco3 and Mg in Mgco3 to determine whether they precipitate or dissolve. Is there a way to understand this common ion effect? And if if were to be Na2co3 why wouldn’t it work this way? (similar to sajc p3 q5) </p>

              <p>Hello, thank you for your reply! </p>
              <p>How do u determine which is a stronger activator or deactivator then? Am i allowed to just assume OH and NO2 are the strongest activator and deactivator respectively? And if I’ve got a Br2 aq do I need to find the common “intersection points” of OH and NO2 and sub the Br on it, or do i just tri sub it regardless of the position? </p>

              In aqueous solvent, yes.<p>
              Just base it on the OH group, as it outweighs the NO2 group.</p><p>
              Whether mono, di or tri bromination occurs, of course depends on the availability of the ortho and para positions.

                  I'll give the correct approach, then you see if you can figure out whether your approach (which isn't very clear, without showing your actual working with values) is right or wrong. Did you get the final answer correct? if you did, you'll may even get full marks, because if you did get the final answer correct, and Cambridge doesn't see anything overtly wrong with your working, however weird it is, you may still get full marks.<p>
                  Your approach (since you just gave a generic description, it's difficult to explain what's wrong, if you gave full working with all values included, it's easier to point out which step you got wrong, and why that step is wrong, ie. your exact misconception at that step) seems to be wrong (I say seems, because your approach isn't very clear), because of a couple of reasons :</p><p>
                  Just because Zn is the reducing agent, you can't assume the OS of vanadium in G and H differs by 2, since excess Zn (ie. non-stoichiometry) is used to reduce the vanadium. You can only deduce such, only if the moles of Zn is the same as the moles of the vanadium species it reacts with, which is not the case here (you're using excess Zn, so you've no idea how much Zn was reacted).</p><p>
                  You idea of "subsequently equating the difference to be for every +1 in O.S" can be used only for comparing the relative amounts of MnO4- required for oxidizing the same amount of vanadium in G versus in H, ie. 24.6 - 16.4 = 8.2 cm3 of MnO4- magnitude difference, which implies 1.64 x 10-5 mol of MnO4- magnitude difference, which implies 8.2 x 10-5 mol of e- magnitude difference, which upon division by amount of vanadium species present 8.2 x 10-5 mol (see my working below), gives you 1.0 OS magnitude difference, which is correct, ie. the magnitude difference between V2+ is H and V3+ in G, is 1.0 OS magnitude difference.
                  
                  </p><p>
                  <b>My BedokFunland JC approach for 2017 P3 Q3c</b></p><p>
                  Based on Data Booklet redox potentials, you can show (ie. by calculating standard cell potentials for each redox step) that under standard conditions, using Zn as the reducing agent, the vanadium species can be reduced to dipositive V2+, ie. OS of +2, and no further. This is the easy part, which almost all students should be able to get. (Though for 3 marks, Cambridge won't require you to waste time writing out all the individual redox steps and calculating all the standard cell potentials, just a brief statement explaining how you know the final OS of vanadium is +2 will suffice).
                  </p><p>
                  The 1st portion of G reacts with 3.28 x 10-5 mol of MnO4-, ie. 1.64 x 10-4 mol of e- transferred.</p><p>
                  The 2nd portion has now been reduced to contain V2+ as solution H, and reacts with 4.92 x 10-5 mol of MnO4-, ie. 2.46 x 10-4 mol of e- transferred.</p><p>
                  Since the final oxidized vanadium species is stated as VO2+ (ie. OS of +5), and the initial vanadium species was V2+, for each mol of V2+, 3 mol of e- is lost.</p><p>
                  Since 2.46 x 10-4 mol of e- was lost, hence mol of V2+ oxidized = 8.2 x 10-5 mol</p><p>
                  This implies 8.2 x 10-5 mol of vanadium species was also present in the 1st portion (since both are of equal volumes).</p><p>
                  Hence, no. of mol of electrons lost per mol of the original vanadium species, in being oxidized to VO2 + (ie. OS of +5), must have been (1.64 x 10-4) / (8.2 x 10-5) = 2 mol of electrons.</p><p>
                  Since the final OS of vanadium in VO2+ is +5, the initial OS of vanadium must have been +3.</p><p>
                  Hence molarity of V3+ in G = mol / volume = (8.2 x 10-5) / (25 / 1000) = 3.28 x 10-3 M</p><p>

                      MapPwner and do12453's estimated scores (for P3, and prolly for all the other papers too) are excellent and approximately on par. As long as you keep it up and score close to full marks for MCQ (which I expect should be no problem for both of you), the 2 of you should be getting between overall 75% to 80%, a confirmed A grade (as I've said many times before, the A grade boundary almost never exceeds 75% ; if students expecting A grade fail to get A grade, it's because they had overestimated their scores ; don't believe that bullshit about A grade boundary for H2 Chem being 80+% or 85+%, that's just ridiculous).<p>
                      
                      delurach, how is your overall % score so far? You shared on the Reddit thread that you didn't do very well for P3, but as long as you score close to full marks for P1, you should be able to get somewhere in between 70-75% overall score, yes? That would give you a good chance of scoring an A grade, and considering that this year's Papers are somewhat tougher than the last few years.</p><p>Most people agree that this year's P3 is considered on the difficult side (relative to past few years TYS), mostly because it is rather time-consuming, so most students won't be able to finish P3.</p><p>As such, I know most students are hoping that, (and this will indeed likely be the case, if P1 is of similar difficulty to the other 3 Papers so far), the bell-curve and A grade boundary will slide down a little more away from 75% and down towards 70% (eg. 72%). So if you manage an estimated 70-75% overall score, you've a very good chance of scoring an A grade this year.

                          indeed likely be the case, if P1 is of similar difficulty to the
                          other 3 Papers so far), the bell-curve and A grade boundary will
                          slide down a little more away from 75% and down towards 70% (eg.
                          72%). So if you manage an estimated 70-75% overall score, you've a
                          very good chance of scoring an A grade this year.</p>
              <p>Be constructive : the best thing you (ie. all J2 students
                          reading this) can do now for the next 2 weeks, is to do *ALL* the
                          2017 Singapore JC Prelim Paper 1s, and if you've any query on any
                          MCQ, be sure to post here on the forum to ask for help, and I (or
                          MapPwner, do12453, etc) will give you our comments.</p>

              <p>Edit:Prac probably pulled down the overall so far.If i assumed P2 57-58/75,P3 65/80,P4 30/55,its probably 62.5/85 marks so far or so.</p>
              <p>I also have some friends who didn't manage to finish the paper.</p>
              <p>I feel that 70% for A this year may probably happen.</p>

              <p>Depends on which school you were from + how many marks the cohort lost on average.</p>
              <p>I'm from a mid-tier JC and most of the people i talked to lost 25-30 marks by superifical marking,some of them graded stringently but not all I suppose.</p>
              <p>I enquired other friends from other JCs and even top JCs about the paper and all of them gave the same reply,it was difficult,couldn't finish,not easy etc.</p>
              <p>So your current score I suppose has a fair chance of scoring A probably this year I think?I felt that this year was comparable to 2010.2010 the difficult components were paper 2 and maybe a bit of paper 3.But this year the harder than average papers were P4,and possibly P3 and also P2(even though it looks easy,but it really isn't unless your chem skills are really solid).Unless if many people got the same range of score as you,its probably a B as it sets a median score,I feel.So a near full mark for P1 is required.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm from HCJC.</p>
              <p>I can't say for sure the average marks lost for the cohort, but I did discuss the paper amongst my friends, who all got low to mid A for prelims, and I personally scraped an A, so we're around 70th percentile and above in sch (based on prelims results). With the 3 papers having concluded, we're expecting 55-60/80 for p3. p2 and p4 we are less certain of the exact marks but quite sure we're get somewhere in the score of 30/55 and 50-55/75 respectively. If coupled with a 25/30 for mcq, that's around 67-71% only which is lower than our prelims results. </p>
              <p>Ultima, does this mean that there's a higher chance of us scoring a B than an A? Would really suck to get a lower grade in As than prelims. initially thought i screwed up bad but my schoolmates who scored As in prelim are expecting similar results...perhaps the bell curve would be 67/68%?</p>

              The A grade boundary is unlikely to go below 70%, no matter what. If P1 is easy, it'll rise back up to nearer 75%. If P1 is tougher than the other 3 Papers, the it'll slide down to nearer 70%.<p>
              Based on your estimates for the Papers completed, as long as you and your friends score near full marks for the upcoming P1, you guys will have a good chance of getting your A grade, no worries.</p>
