              <p>ELECTRIC NEWS<br> <br> New study: That PowerPoint presentation is... POINTLESS<br> <strong>April 21, 2007</strong><br> <br> BUSINESSES regard it as an important tool to sell a product or get
                                      a point across.<br> <br> Schools use it in presentations and some churches even use it to
                                      promote their activities.<br> <br> These days, PowerPoint, the Microsoft program for PCs, seems to be
                                      everywhere.<br> <br> It allows a presentation to be designed in a series of slides which
                                      are beamed onto a screen for the speaker to use as a visual
                                      aid.<br> <br> It is so popular that there are even PowerPoint presentations on
                                      how to do a PowerPoint presentation, reports the Telegraph.<br> <br> But is it really the all-powerful tool it is often made out to be?
                                      Not at all, some would argue.<br> <br> CHARTS AND SLOGANS<br> <br> In fact, a new study claims that many who sit through PowerPoint
                                      presentations end up bored when faced with a seemingly endless
                                      stream of mission statements, charts, slogans, messages in capital
                                      letters for emphasis, and proposals given in bullet points.<br> <br> The common scenario is that the speaker, often an executive or
                                      trainer, merely repeats the words on the slides so the audience
                                      gets the information twice.<br> <br> FIZZLES OUT<br> <br> And what starts out flashy at the beginning soon fizzles out.<br> <br> And that, according to researchers at the University of New South
                                      Wales in Australia, is because the human brain cannot cope with
                                      processing information coming from a screen and a voice at the same
                                      time.<br> <br> That kind of repetition makes the brain switch off,<br> <br> A speech would be far less of a waste of time, the research
                                      claims.<br> <br> The study concludes that PowerPoint presentations have little power
                                      and even less point.<br> <br> It branded PowerPoint presentations a disaster and called for them
                                      to be scrapped.<br> <br> According to Prof John Sweller, who headed the study team, there is
                                      a scientific explanation for a room full of PowerPoint viewers
                                      yawning and looking at their watches after a couple of
                                      minutes.<br> <br> He said: 'If you have ever wondered why your eyes start glazing
                                      over as you read those dot points on the screen, at the same time
                                      words are being spoken, it is because it is difficult to process
                                      information if it is coming in the written and spoken form at the
                                      same time.'<br> <br> PowerPoint is a Microsoft program for PCs. Prof Sweller said notes
                                      should not be read aloud from a display.<br> <br> Doing so does not double the chances of the message getting across,
                                      he said.<br> <br> He added: 'The use of the PowerPoint presentation has been a
                                      disaster. It should be ditched. It is effective to speak to a
                                      diagram, because it presents information in a different form.<br> <br> TOO MUCH LOAD<br> <br> 'But it is not effective to speak the same words that are written,
                                      because it is putting too much load on the mind and decreases your
                                      ability to understand what is being presented.<br> <br> 'PowerPoint can backfire if the information on the screen is the
                                      same as that which is verbalised because the audience's attention
                                      will be split between the two.'<br> <br> But MrChris Rothwell of Microsoft Corporation, said: 'We believe
                                      that PowerPoint remains a very powerful tool that can add impact
                                      and variety, but it is no substitute for being a good
                                      communicator.'<br> <br> Anyone care to speak off the cuff then?<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> The use of the PowerPoint presentation has been a disaster. It
                                      should be ditched. It is not effective to speak the same words that
                                      are written...<br> <br> - Prof John Sweller, who headed the research team<br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> WHAT THE STUDY CLAIMS<br> <br> The audience sits through a stream of mission statements, charts,
                                      slogans and proposals while a speaker repeats the words on the
                                      slides.<br> <br> The audience gets bored and 'switches off'.</p>
