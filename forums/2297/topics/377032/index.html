              <p>2) Hmm, O2 is generally the 1 that burns, H2 is quite explosive. Not very sure i would say... Both acidic gases can react with alkaline.</p>
              <p>3) P will drop and Q will rise for CO2 since it diffuses slower than N2 and O2 so the 2 gases will diffuse out and increase the pressure thus pushing P down. Its the reverse for H2.</p>
              <p>4) Isotope part is just to tell you answer is between 203-205.</p>
              <p>Simpler method i feel using more chemistry than maths in ur working</p>
              <p>Take 15.2-10g gives you mass of Cl.<br>From that, calculate moles of the element. <br>Use mass/moles gives u Mr</p>
              <p>5) correct</p>
              <p>Just use the powers to X. Ca2+ and Y3-, bring the charges to the oppersite elements give u Ca3Y2 if you get what i mean.</p>
              <p>6) a (I'm surprise you can't do this)</p>
              <p>In this case, you know that X a +5 needs 3 more electrons to form octet, 1 way is to share 3 electrons. Y is a -1 so just share 1 electron. Combine the 2 together gives you a XY3</p>
              <p>7) Not too sure but Ca and Mg might too reactive for them to react similar to Na and K since they are also high up in the reactivity series.</p>
              <p>8) a.  If it was period 3 onwards with the d-orbitals, c can also be correct due to violation of octet structure but in O's i don't think you all learn that.</p>
              <p>9) b. Cl itself already have more electrons than Mg</p>
              <p>10) a. Only N, P and B can form 3 bonds so B is out. For Y, only P can form 5 bonds due to violation of octet. C and N strictly obeys octet rule and thus will never form 5 bonds.</p>
              <p>11) Si is correct. SiO2 which is common sand has a very high melting point. The other 3 forms oxides which are mostly gaseous in nature.</p>
              <p>12) Everything is made up of atoms regardless whether its a macro or micro molecule.</p>
              <p>13) Nothing wrong with c. Is answer a and c? If a is correct then it could  be related to the fact that all the acids are covalently bonded compounds while all the alkalines are generally ionic bonded.</p>

              <p>You post new reply la, i no need scroll so much...</p>
              <p>14) My answer would be neither of a-d. I would pick 3X10^23. 10^23 is the number of moles but in terms of atoms, you need X 3 since there are 3 atoms in each molecule of CO2</p>
              <p>15) Same explaination as qn 14. Read the question ask for ATOMS not MOLECULES.</p>
              <p>16) I got answer similar to yours. Maybe someone else can try.</p>
              <p>17) I agree with you</p>
              <p>18) Agree with you</p>
              <p>19) Similiar with Qn 14 and 15</p>
              <p>20) Similar with the top few i believe. Never try it but all qns that say atoms u seem to treat as molecules</p>
              <p>21) unsure and lazy to really go think.</p>
              <p>22) 6dm3 means 1/4 mole of gas. 1/4 mole of gas weights 13g, 1 mole weighs 52g which is the mass of ans a</p>
              <p>23) QN 57 b and 58 a since the mass difference is ratio 1:2</p>
              <p>24) You need to calculate number of electrons needed then try to balence the equation. Getting old le, do so many qn feeling tired liao so leaving this to u :p</p>

              ~ can you explain to me why the concentration of H2SO4 did not decrease? i thought that the hydrogen ions will be discharged. thanks! ~
              
              That's at the cathode. What gets oxidized ("discharged" means removal of charge, notice the product is a neutral molecule) at the anode is OH- ions, which means in effect water is being electrolysed away as hydrogen gas (at the cathode) and oxygen gas (at the anode). So the sulfuric(VI) acid gets more concentrated as time goes by.

              ~ 21) 6,94g of mixture wwith BaCO3 and CaCO3 is heated. after removing CO2 , 4.74g of mixture with CaO and BaO is obtained. Orginal weight of BaCO3 is? ~
              
              Let x and y be the moles of each carbonate present. Before heating, write an equation in x and y. After heating (ie. removal of CO2), write an equation in x and y (notice that no. of moles of metal oxide = no. of moles of metal carbonate). Solve for x and y using simultaneous equations. 
              
              
              
              ~ m Fe2+(aq) + n H+ (aq) + MnO4-(aq) -&gt; Mn2+ (aq) + p Fe3+ (aq) + q H2O(l) ~
              
              First write reduction half-equation. MnO4- is reduced to Mn2+.
              
              Second write oxidation half-equation. Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+.
              
              Third, balance these half-equations within themselves. To balance oxygens, add water molecules. To balance hydrogens, add protons (H+). (If it were in alkaline conditions, you need to remove all H+ by adding OH- on both sides.) To balance charges, add electrons (e-).
              
              Fourth, ensure that the no. of electrons gained (in reduction) is the same as the no. of electrons lost (in oxidation). Do this by multiplying across one or both half equations (eg. lowest common multiple).
              
              Fifth, add up both half-equations together to obtain the balanced redox. The electrons cancel out perfectly (if you did everything right). Anything that's common on both sides, cancel them out as well. (Eg. 16 water on LHS and 10 water on RHS, becomes 6 water on LHS and 0 water on RHS).
              
              Have a bit of practice with balancing redox equations. It's useful to understand these processes better, even at 'O' levels (where it's not strictly required).
