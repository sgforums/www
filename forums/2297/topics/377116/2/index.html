              <p>correct. but very roughly, 'A' lvls chem paper is split into 40%
              organic, 40% physical, 20% inorganic.</p>
              <p>I THINK</p>
              <p>which shows that maybe inorganic is not so impt (haha, i hate
              it, boo), but the physical component is crucial, which means you
              need your basic math. after all, as you said, they can slaughter
              you with crazy elucidation/organic synthesis questions, which means
              you may need your physical component to back you up.</p>

              <p>There should be analytical chem in ur syllabus.</p>
              <p>All the MS, UV, IR, NMR, AAS, ICP etc that you should have learn (not sure how many in the list) are all under analytical chemistry.</p>
              <p>As a uni chem student, personally i would say analytical chem is the most impt of the 4 main branches since without analytical chem, most of the experiments/tests done for the other 4 branches cannot be done since almost all of them require the use of analytical chemistry knowledge someway or the other.</p>
              <p>Organic chemistry is the largest of the 4 branches especially since organic compounds outnumber inorganic compounds many many times.</p>
              <p>Physical chemistry is 1 most uni chemist hate since uni chemist hates physcs (physicist hate chemistry too). Even ultimaonline die die dun wan help me with my physical chemistry topics on thermodynamics and quantum :p</p>

              Spectroscopy is taught only in H3 Chem, and not in H2 or H1 Chem.
                                
              As for what you say regarding physicists vs chemists, it's also pretty much true for physicists vs biologists, and biologists vs chemists.
              
              BioChemistry, for instance, is a common nightmare for both 'pure chemists' and 'pure biologists'.
                                
              Interfacing between the multiple sciences (including engineering sciences), is of course, germane to evolving new technologies that can benefit mankind.
                     
              'TakChek', a Singporean with a PhD in Science, has found greener pastures elswhere to do his research and development. His work involves the interface and interaction between all 3 Sciences and engineering (so he's a physicist-chemist-biologist-engineer rolled into one), and his blog is worth a read.

              <p>Only in H3 now? My classmates mentioned they studied it in A's before even thought they study all the theory without knowing what the hell they learning eg Mass spec. Rare to see them reducing the content instead of increasing the content esp when i would say spectroscopy is an important area of chemistry. U cannot work in any chemical industry without that knowledge even if you ace your organic, inorganic and physical chemistry.</p>
              <p>I rather to biochemistry than physical chemistry. At least biochem looks more chem than physical chem which is all numbers. Yihao will cry for sure :p</p>

              <p>lol when i saw the first line of the qn i tot is some kind of chim chemistry.. but as i read on, onething straight into my mind is that it looks more like math. well, people with little knowledge of Chem can do it.</p>
              <p>i'm gonna tell u, this is some kind of real life questions you have to answer . and its more than this..in the industry , its not so straight forward which the questions are given to you. you have to construct your own question given a senario .</p>

              It's not merely "in the industry", it's "in life". Every individual must critically question and frame the purpose of his/her life (as opposed to cruising through life aimlessly or blindly, zombie-like, going-along-with-the-crowd, following soceital dogma, meaningless), and decide what the validity, purpose and meaning of his/her life is.
              
              What we call, the existential program for a particular lifetime for a particular individual. This isn't something that anyone or anything outside of you (no external authority, government, domineering parent, organization, peers, or religion) can impose upon you (that is, if you're intelligent and have a sufficient degree of self-awareness), but something (ie. the meaning and purpose) that you yourself find higher meaning, relevance and purpose for yourself, something that you choose for yourself at all levels of your soul.
              
              You are the captain of your own destiny. Will you be a wasteful captain, or a wise one?
