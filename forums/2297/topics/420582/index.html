              </p><p>Hey there. I'm taking the Science course. I'm taking Physics, Chemistry and Maths. But I'm not sure which contrasting subject I should take. <strong>H2 Lit or H2 Econs.</strong> I took Literature in O levels. I got an A2 for that. A1 for English. I really enjoy Literature and would love to take it again. But I found out it's 5 books in slightly less than 2 years. 2 papers, 3 hours each. That seems tough! So I would like to know how it's really really really like to take H2 Lit. Do you have time to reread all your texts? What's the distinction rate?  </p>
              <p>Or should I take H2 Econs instead? Is it more manageable? Heard it's the kind of subject whereby you either get it or you don't.</p>
              <p>Any advice? Thanks.</p>

              <p>  Gather more info when you listen to the subject talks during JC 1 orientation. You may pose these questions to the presenters. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Here is a concept map on the topic of a country's economy, to give you a flavour of what economics is about:</p>

              <p>As someone who studied A level economics until last year, this is my 2 cents.</p>
              <p>plus:</p>
              <p>1)it will really open your eyes to some things that you will probably never think about if you didnt study the subject.</p>
              <p>2)
              could help with GP as some problems in economics are problems that the
              world is facing today. it could also help you look at some political
              issues from another perspective.</p>
              <p>3) can be applied to everyday
              life. after studying econs for awhile, you'd soon realize that there it
              is everywhere. you'll know what i'm talking about if you study it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>minus:</p>
              <p>1)
              even though the content is easy to understand, the difficult part about
              this is interpreting the questions and coming up with enough content to
              score the marks. This is not like O Level Social Studies where you will
              be rewarded as long as you are familiar with the content.</p>
              <p>2) i
              dont know which school you're going, but i should bring to your
              awareness that some schools teach econs in a very user unfriendly
              manner. They will give you lecture notes to study which is great. But
              when you take a lecture test and come back with a low grade, do not be
              surprise at all. Look at the answer template that is given to you, and
              you will find that some of the phrases, key words, and even points that
              are used there (which is key to scoring in the question) are not
              reflected in the lecture notes.</p>
              <p>3) As a result of points 1 and 2,
              it is quite difficult to self study and do well for econs. you probably
              will spent time consulting your teachers, which could mess up your
              schdule especially towards major exams when time is money.</p>
              <p>summary:</p>
              <p>If
              i could choose again i would have studied another subject. But bear in
              mind that these are my experiences, you may have a more pleasant one
              than that. Whatever i highlught in the minus part of this post is what
              you <em>could</em> experience ie it is not a guarantee. I'd say go ask
              around for literature. How different / similar is it to O level
              literature? What are some of the common problems that others who have
              taken the subject encounter? After you get these answers, compare both
              subjects and see which problems you are more confident of handling</p>

              <p>Go to your senior and borrow their economics textbook or lecture notes. Peruse over them ( read if you are so hardworking) and decide whether it is your cup of tea. During my JC, I took H2 econs in my first 3 months of JC and decide to shift back to Geography later despite doing rather well with Econs.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about literature, but economics are often the most read arts subject both by arts and science students in junior college, that can mean good or bad in terms of bell curve.</p>
