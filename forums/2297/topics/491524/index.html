              MOE Teacher Matthew Zachary Liu posted on his Facebook :<br>    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matthew.singapore/posts/1094680177250954">https://www.facebook.com/matthew.singapore/posts/1094680177250954</a><br><a href="http://www.domainofexperts.com/2016/03/we-should-look-deeper-and-do-more-for.html">http://www.domainofexperts.com/2016/03/we-should-look-deeper-and-do-more-for.html</a><p>
                      <i>IÂ’ve been struggling, contemplating whether to share this publicly.. but it being the March school break now, with time to sit down and reflect deeper, IÂ’ve decided to write this post to share about two particular classroom moments from the first term that made me extremely emotional.<br>
                      <br>
                      I understand what iÂ’m about to write may be very sensitive and again get me into potential trouble, but iÂ’ve chosen to write about this publicly because after these particular two classroom moments, I strongly feel that perhaps we as a society, parents and education system should start to look deeper and do more for our young ones.<br><br>
                      The first classroom moment was with a Secondary 1 Normal Academic class.<br>
                      <br>
                      These bunch of kids were not only disinterested, the kids were somehow filled with a lot of animosity and anger. They hated each other. They were very vulgar and hostile towards one another. There was no way I could conduct my lesson plan proper because the class was just very disruptive and destructive - cursing, shouting, almost fighting every other minute. I felt the need to intervene..<br>
                      <br>
                      The kids disliked each other because of their perceived differences and all the petty things like name calling, Â“ship-ingÂ”, Â“you stare at me for what!Â” and typical teenage angst/ insecurities. I decided to explore that deeper. My purpose was merely to get them to understand how similar they actually are and hopefully to bridge their differences once they realised this.<br>
                      <br>
                      But what happened during my spontaneous experiment broke the entire class down in tears and hit me very hard.. for me, it was THE most emotional moment in a classroom.<br>
                      So I got all the kids to close their eyes (which they loved because Â“yay can sleep!Â”) and told them iÂ’ll be asking them a few questions.. every time they felt connected with the question(s) I asked, I wanted them to stand (still with their eyes closed).<br>
                      <br>
                      It started harmlessly enough.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“Who likes chicken rice?Â” Â“Who loves Taylor Swift?Â” Â“Who hates Math?Â” Â“Who reads manga?Â” Â“Who plays kendamaÂ” Â“Who watches youtubeÂ” Â“whose favourite Youtuber is Night Owl Cinematics"Â… every time they felt connected with the questions I was asking, theyÂ’d stand (eyes closed) and then iÂ’d get them to look around the room to see who was standing with them as well.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“Eh you read manga too! I didnÂ’t know sia,Â” Â“wah you also hate Man U! High five!Â” Â“you hate maths? I thought your maths power one!"<br>
                      <br>
                      They started realising similar things about themselves and their classmates and instantly felt a little more connected. After a few Â“funÂ” questions and with the whole class now engaged and participative, I decided to go a little deeper..<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“How many of you feel useless or have ever been told youÂ’re worthless?"<br>
                      <br>
                      With their eyes shut, the entire class stood up.<br>
                      <br>
                      And when they opened their eyes, a few gasped.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“Why?Â” i asked them.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“because I not cleverÂ” Â“because iÂ’m not good at anythingÂ” Â“my parents donÂ’t care so I donÂ’t careÂ”, a few of them said. The one who said Â“my parents donÂ’t careÂ” instantly drew a tease from another classmate who mocked him Â“HA even your parents donÂ’t care about you!Â” and a fight was about to break out again.<br>
                      <br>
                      But the mood in the classroom was shifting. From simply realising that they have similar interests as their classmates and laughing about it, when we started talking about the more serious stuff, many were silently nodding their heads in agreement. I started asking deeper questions.. and the class started breaking down their walls and opening up their worlds.<br>
                      <br>
                      Then when we were talking about family, I asked this one question that just opened a floodgate of emotions..<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“How many of you have ever lost a loved one? Someone close to you, someone you love.. someone thatÂ’s no longer in your life,"<br>
                      <br>
                      About half the class stood up. The ones who were standing looked at each other silently but with a certain understanding. The ones who didnÂ’t stand looked at the ones who were standing silently but respectfully.<br>
                      I knew I was entering extremely sensitive zone. But there was something happening with this class and I wanted them to explore things further.. I asked if anyone would like to share.<br>
                      <br>
                      A few wanted to but were hesitant. One of the boy (whoÂ’s also one of the class Â“clownÂ”) almost did but when he half raised his hand, his friends sniggered (probably expecting him to crack some joke) and he withdrew. I got very serious with the class and told them we were going into a very vulnerable space - the ones who stood up lost a loved one.. I wanted the entire class to be mature about it and to give their utmost respect to anyone who wanted to open up. No teasing. No nonsense. They promised.<br>
                      <br>
                      The same boy then stood up and shared his story..<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“I lost my father when I was 11Â…Â” the class became very quiet. Some of them had their mouths open in shock.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“Â… every day I try to be happy but I miss my dad a lot,Â” he shared. With tremendous courage. I literally had goosebumps and a heavy sadness in my heart.<br>
                      <br>
                      Slowly, some of the other kids built up their courage to open up a very private chapter of their lives. And the stories just got even more heartbreaking.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“I lost my grandma when I was youngerÂ… I never really knew her but every time my mother talks about her and tells me how grandma helped to raise me and support my mom, it makes me really want to meet her. Now, every time other people talk about their grandma I will miss my grandma a lot and wish she was still around,Â” one of the girls shared.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“I lost my father when I was 7Â… and lost my second father when he left my motherÂ… but I just have to be strong for my mother and we have to move on with our lives,Â” one very emotionally mature girl opened up.<br>
                      The kids who had stories to share started building up courage to step forward voluntarily and share something so intimate.. and the class began showing compassion and care for one another as the stories unfolded. After a few of the other kids had shared their stories, one of the girls who was now in tears, decided to share her story..<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“IÂ’ve never told anyone this before.. but sometimes iÂ’m sad because.. I lost my younger sister when I was 8..Â” she broke down and couldnÂ’t continue. But as she retreated to her seat, the ones around her who initially seemed as if they were void of any kind of emotion started to comfort her. It was heartbreaking to hear the stories yet extremely heartwarming to witness the instant change in the kids.<br>
                      <br>
                      The last boy who wanted to share was the class Â“ah bengÂ”. But he wasnÂ’t the kind of ah beng that tormented his peers. It was the opposite. He appeared fierce and vulgar on the outside but he was always getting picked on by the rest of the class.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“I lost my motherÂ… because my father went to find another woman and have a family with herÂ… I now stay with my other mother and father,Â” he began his story.<br>
                      Â“Do you hate your stepmom?Â” one of his classmates asked.<br>
                      <br>
                      Â“I donÂ’t hate my stepmother because she is nice to me. But I miss my real mother. I wish my dad last time never beat her. I hate it every time he beat my mother.. but i still love my father.. I wish he care about me more only. When I come to school with you guys, I actually donÂ’t like it when all of you keep teasing me but I feel more home here than when I go home so I tahan only lor,Â” he said, trying his best to hold back tears.<br>
                      <br>
                      I wrapped the unexpectedly powerful, emotional moment with them by first thanking them.. for being mature, for being honest, for being vulnerable, for being respectful, for caring. I shared with them that I too was extremely moved by their stories and inspired by their tremendous courage because theyÂ’ve been through so much in their short 13 years of living that I may not even fully understand. Then we talked about how all these stories, all these emotions and similarities.. how all of these real connections and emotions bind us as people but weÂ’re always so blinded because of the walls of hate we build up against each other before we even get to really understand them.<br>
                      <br>
                       I personally think them witnessing and experiencing this right before their teary eyes absolutely hit home because even though it was still a bit awkward for them, they were starting to be genuinely nicer towards each other. Also shared with them that whatever they may have been through in life so far, whatever anyone has ever said about them negatively, all these things do not define them. They showed so much courage opening up their lives and sharing their stories, but they possess even greater strength inside because theyÂ’ve lived through these moments and have the power to make it better. I challenged them to do better, be better and they sincerely said Â“iÂ’ll tryÂ”. For me, that was a start. When the ah beng later thanked me for Â“the best lesson everÂ”, that was a bonus.<br>
                      <br>
                      IÂ’m writing this because we live in a society and system that is results driven and care little or have little time for anything else. And itÂ’s a culture ingrained in us since young. By parents expectations, by society standards, by school KPIs. But our young ones are not results churning robots. They feel too. They know. Sometimes, they donÂ’t. And thatÂ’s why all the more, we as parents, teachers, mentors, society and even policy makers should not just do more, but be more interested and invested in the lives of these young ones.<br>
                      <br>
                      I personally know many amazing teachers who truly care about their kids more than just the grades they attain on papers. They want to do so much more. But they simply do not have the time, resources or freedom because of all the other administrative duties or red tape they have to adhere to.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dear MOE, please, I implore you to give our teachers more time to share lessons of life, to invest and inspire their young charges the way theyÂ’d like to, the way they were filled with dreams, passion and hope to do so much more for the next generation when they chose teaching as a career the way you sold it to them. ItÂ’s a different generation of kids. We need to change to.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dear parents, especially if your kids are in primary school.. your kids may be suffering in silence. There is another heartbreaking classroom moment that happened with one of the P6 class I was teaching that I may write about and share soon but for now.. dear parents, this March school break, please talk to and more importantly, listen to your kids. Really listen to them.. allow them to invite you into their world.. not just the world you want to build and demand of them. The more you force that, the higher they will start to build their walls. Your kids love you. Please let them know and feel that you love them too.</i><br>
