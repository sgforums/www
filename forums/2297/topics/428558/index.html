              <p>I'm a student that is taking O level this year. My aim now is going to jc as I have not decided what courses to take for poly. Here comes my problem.</p>
              <p>1) I'm taking combined chem. How much is the difference between combined chem and pure chem? I got A1 for combined chem. If I eventually go to a jc (which I decided that I will go pioneer jc), I will take H2 chem as a subject. So, is it advisiable for me to go to jc or poly if I take combined chem?</p>
              <p>2) Any ways to study combined humanities effectively? (SS/Geo). My grade is in the range of C6-F9. I heard that the minimum grade to go to a jc for humans is C6?</p>
              <p>3) Any ways to revise for chinese O levels? I'm in the C5-C6 range for composition but failing CL paper 2 very badly (I did pass my CL paper 2 chinese before). And what's the minimum requirement to go to JC for chinese?</p>
              <p>Btw, I have no problem coping with my other subs like A,E Maths and Pure physics. I sincerely hope that someone will help me. All advices will be appreciated ^^</p>

              <p>Dear CaiHongRainx,</p>
              <p>I understand that now you are still unsure whether to go JC or poly after your O level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) The difference is not much. I've know of some people taking pure chem and did badly for H2 Chem. I've also have student taking sci(chem) and do very well in H2 Chem. So it depend on individual mindset. I'm glad that you're putting in a lot of effort in achieving A1 for your science.</p>
              <p>Both Sci(Chem) and Pure Chem doesn't have much impact on what you'll be learning at H2 Chem [ it's far more indepth such that whether you're pure chem or sci(chem), it makes no differences).</p>
              <p>2) Yes, Minimum a C6 pass. To study humanities subject effectively, you will first need to understand the marking scheme. How do the examiner reward the marks. Do read up the Level of Respond Marking Scheme(LORMS) for Geo and SS. Once you understand how examiner award the mark, then you will work towards earning the marks.</p>
              <p>Most of my student feedback to me saying that their SS and Hist teacher rely heavily on Mindmap. While I'm not a fan of mindmap, I still do understand its usefulness in organising huge number of facts.</p>
              <p>3) Minimum is a C6 pass. For Chinese O level, try to write at least a composition every week and submit to someone who can help you mark. Try using key words that you've learn from your textbook.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How much do you get for your sci(bio)? Science (chem/Bio) is together consider one subject. If you do very well for Sci(Chem) and average for Sci(Bio), it'll affect the overall grade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Advice:</p>
              <p>JC students are very determined to get into University. Polytechnic trains student for the workforce on specific skills. If you go into JC because you haven't find what you want to do in life, then you'll suffer in JC. Many students who are like you (unsure which path to take) ultimately dropped out from JC due to the stress.</p>
              <p>When I see you post, you remind me when I was younger <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> Strong in maths and Sciences, weak in languages and humanities. :-D</p>
              <p>Post back ya?</p>

              <p>Biology pulled me down, I got a B3 grade in my chem/bio, but I know I'm able to get A1 for this subject. Yah! Strong in maths and sciences, weak in languages and humanities (: Yeah, I know the A level cert will have no value in it unless the student is able to get to university. Since my ultimate aim is uni, I'm determined to work hard while deciding what I want to do for my future!</p>
              <p>Yeah I'm getting help from my teachers in SS/Geo. Btw, I thought the standard for CL to go to jc have drop to D7?</p>

              <p>Pardon me for my misleading information. You are right...</p>
              <p>According to JAE2011 booklet, it is indeed that the minimum score for MT is D7. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"></p>
