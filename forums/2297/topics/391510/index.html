              <p>Hi guys!</p>
              <p>I'm taking a class about the culture of people from all around the world, in order to compare it to my country's (Mexico). This week's assignment is to do an interview to somebody around my age (20s) about his o her daily life. I have a few questions about daily life, meals, parties, traditions, celebrations and stuff like that. I hope someone has some free time to help me with this. It would be great if you guys could send me your email through a private message so i could contact you by email or msn messenger to discuss about it :D Or maybe you can write something about it here too :)</p>
              <p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>

              <p>Ello,</p>
              <p>Singapore is a multi-cultural country, thus different races will have largely differing cultures, traditions and such. You may wish to interview a few Singaporeans from different races to get a more complete picture of our culture here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you can try posting all your questions here, and some of the forummers here, especially the regulars in the homework forum, will be happy to help you out.</p>

              <p>1) I wake up at 5am to prepare to go for classes. ( I am studying in a uni. )</p>
              <p>2) Bread and Milo for breakfast, rice with some simple dishes such as cooked cabbage, fried fish, luncheon meat...etc. for lunch and dinner.</p>
              <p>3) Chinese New Year (Only be Chinese), Mother's Day, Father's Day, Labour Day ( Not that we really celebrate it, but hey, it is a holiday after all. Other non-celebrated holidays include Children's Day and Youth Day. ), Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji ( Only by Malay ), Deepavali ( Only by Hindus ), Christmas.</p>
              <p>4) I am an oddball, I hang out with my books and notes at home during the weekend.</p>
              <p>5) It usually depends on one's educational qualifcations. There are people who start work around 16, and there are those who study till around 25 or so before getting a job.</p>
              <p>6) No comment. You can visit the Speaker's Corner sub-Forum for more insights into this question. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p><strong>Do you guys have some special celebrations? (For example, here

                                      birthdays, "quinceañeras" (a celebration for the girls who are
                                      celebrating their 15th birthday), easter, mother's day,
                                      christmas...)</strong></p>

                                      alcohol....)</strong></p>
              <p>Now, work. I work 7 days a week. I build my websites for adsense income, and I teach tuition on weekends.</p>
              <p>During school, I slack. Watched youtube, or TV, or just plain surfing sgforums and other forums.</p>
