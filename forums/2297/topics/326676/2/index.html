              <p>Excellent find. I just create a link to that website. Ha it will save me some effort. Won't scan what is already here. Instead simply tell my students to download by visiting that website. haha</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current issue is that neighbourhood schools swap each others'. The elite schools swap each others'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even school teachers dont have much access to other school's papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I have a feeling that MOE is against this selling of other school's papers and I don't think they want students to have access to such materials either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most importantly, think about it. They banned the publishing of Camridge level TYS. Now its all 5 year series. They make the publishers to pay royalty. Currently the only publishers still doing the 5ys is Dyna. SAP does topical and Redspot does notes.</p>

              <p><br>actually, in bras barsa, IF you are willing to search WELL enough there are actually quite a number of old *YS i dun consider it TYS, like i said previously, i have a fifteen yrs series, physics, chem, 1988-2003, chem, topic by topic 1979-1997, one is 1997-2007 topic by topic,  physic, j/nov, 1979-2004,  amathematics [syllabus D] 1990-2004, btw can someone tell me wad is that syllabus d, i still have no idea.</p>
              <p>i think TYS is well enough for u tp get at least a B3-4 for o's provided you know how to do all de qn inside... i've tried them all, quite promising results. 4 A1, for a.ma, e.ma, chem pure, phy pure. ...</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="mailto:tr@nsp0rt_F3V3R">tr@nsp0rt_F3V3R</a>,</p>
              <p>Congratulations, you have done well in your maths and science.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it is more important to practise actual "O" level exam questions instead of practising on school Prelim exam papers or questions in assessment books or questions in textbooks. There are many questions in the school exam papers, assessment books and textbooks that are not really similar to the actual "O" level exam questions.</p>
              <p>When a student practises doing the ten year series, he or she will soon realise that there are patterns or fixed ways that the actual "O" level exam questions are being asked. These patterns appear years after years.</p>
              <p>So, to excel in the "O" level exam, students are always advised by teachers to practise the whole ten years series at least 3 times before the "O" level exam. Many students got A1 or A2 using this method of study, provided the students can remember the patterns and the ways to solve these questions without careless mistakes. Careless mistakes in the actual "O" level exam can easily cost students a grade (or two grades) below eg from A1 to A2 or from A2 to B3 and so on.</p>

              <p>Wishing <a href="mailto:tr@nsp0rt_F3V3R">tr@nsp0rt_F3V3R</a> getting straight As in his or her coming "O" level exam.</p>

              <p>I thought you had just completed your "O" level Prelim exam and you are preparing for the coming "O" level exam.</p>
              <p>Never mind, getting 4 A1s in your secondary three year end exam is also very good results. Keep up the good work. Aim for straight As in your next year "O" level exam. Do lots of lots of ten years series questions and REMEMBER the patterns and the ways to solve/ answer these questions without careless mistakes in the actual "O" level exam.</p>
