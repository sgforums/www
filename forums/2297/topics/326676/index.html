              <p>ha... but I have my own website at www.maths-tuition.com and the exams papers are available in my download section for all to download.</p>
              <p>What I am looking for is fellow tutors to share the annual workload of scanning papers as every year I gotta scan around 30 sets of papers  to generate enough paper practise for my tuition students... I am sure other tutors need to have access to enough material too. So instead of  every tutor scanning 30 sets annually, 5 tutors can scan 6 sets each and share it around...</p>
              <p>Currently, my scanned school exams papers are locked with a password which happens to be the title of my website so as to avoid other tutors leeching off my efforts (days of scanning, touching up and merging scans into combined pdf files.). Of coz, if anyone is willing to work together, we would send each other unlocked versions which we could then password protect with the titles of our individual websites.</p>

              <p>There's a 30-sheet Automatic Document Feeder for copying, faxing or scanning. Can't remember whether it was $399 or $299 (bought at Harvey Norman), but there's a $100 rebate in the form of a cash card</p>

              <p>With regards to the bandwidth, whether you lock it a not, people can still download and use up your bandwidth. Perhaps you should implement it in such a way that people will need to key in a password before downloading. The implementation via javascript using a .js file shouldn't be that hard, and this should stop most amateurs; not everyone knows how to download and sieve through everything to find the password.

              <p><br>Hi, yes I have been asking around alot of people whether they know of places that sell other school testpapers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know there's two operating. Each stall (if you like) have their own so-called "agents" that collect school student's papers. They each have their own logo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bras Pasar's is VERY expensive. For N/O levels they charge about $30.</p>
              <p>This thing is mostly underground?</p>
              <p>Eagle, the problem with bras pasar is that they tend to leave out alot of answer sheets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And another problem is that sell two different stacks for e.g E Maths O lvl prelim. Both stacks will have some same schools and different. They can easily sell one stack but thats a catch to make sure that you buy both.</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current issue is that neighbourhood schools swap each others'. The elite schools swap each others'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even school teachers dont have much access to other school's papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I have a feeling that MOE is against this selling of other school's papers and I don't think they want students to have access to such materials either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most importantly, think about it. They banned the publishing of Camridge level TYS. Now its all 5 year series. They make the publishers to pay royalty. Currently the only publishers still doing the 5ys is Dyna. SAP does topical and Redspot does notes.</p>

              <p>I strongly believe it's effective to drill oneself in questions to score high for exams. Other school test papers merely serve as additional practices. It is more effective than most assessment books because they are real exam questions. Question based approach forces the students to think rather than regurgitate.</p>
              <p>What I always tell my students is, just skim through the textbooks before exams. A large percentage are misc stuff that are unimportant. Do and do and do questions, open-booked a not doesn't matter. Questions help direct you immediately to the important points, so your studying becomes better focussed. However, for this method to be extremely effective, you have to do near 10 questions for each topic, or more for each topic you are unsure of. Again, one can do it open booked. I verified this method personally, that's why I believe in it so strongly.</p>
              <p>I use this method to teach my students, but I add in explanations and real-life applications of concepts for every question, in addition to exam strategies in approaching them.</p>

              <p>That's why I created <a href="http://examworld.blogspot.com/">ExamWorld</a> with the aim of having at least 20 questions per topic for the moment. Students will have free access and not get limited by the 3-4 questions in other books.</p>
              <p>But it's hard to get good questions, and even harder sometimes to type the questions out... It's indeed more effective to do it on paper, but hey, paper has both monetary and environmental costs!</p>
              <p>I have to, unfortunately, select questions which are not too tough to type out... Some of the questions I put out are very very conceptual, so rather simple, but some are tougher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's really a tremendous task to build up <a href="http://examworld.blogspot.com/">ExamWorld</a>. Hopefully I can accomplish my first goal, then I will decide what to do. Most of the questions will still likely be useful 10 years from now. :D</p>

              <p>Hi Mikethm,</p>
              <p>A call to the ten years series publishers and you will be told that the ten years series publishers have to follow the MOE's guideline that they can only publish "O" level and "A" level exam questions from 1997 to most recent year ie 2007. So, there are not many questions in the ten years series now. In the past, there can be twenty years or even thirty years of exam questions in the old ten years series. </p>
              <p>Thank you for your kind attention.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
