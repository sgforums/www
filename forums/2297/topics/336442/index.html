              <p>B: a green ppt and a blue solution (ppt: precipitate)</p>
              <p>C: a green ppt and a colourless solution</p>
              <p>D: a white precipitate and a blue solution</p>
              <p>Answer is C. How did they get the green ppt?</p>
              <p>1998</p>
              <p>2) All ammonium salts on heating with sodium hydroxide produce ammonia gas. From which ammonium salt can the greatest mass of ammonia be obtained?</p>

              <p>B: 0.5 mol (NH4)2 SO4</p>
              <p>C: 1.0 mol NH4 Cl</p>
              <p>D: 1.0 mol NH4 NO3</p>
              <p>Answer is A but I get B?</p>
              <p>3) Which statement about graphite is not correct?</p>

              <p>D: It is used as a lubricant.</p>
              <p>Answer is B but I get A? (C and D is confirm out but graphite burns to form CO2?)</p>
              <p>1999</p>
              <p>4) What do both an atom and an ion of the isotope of sodium, Na, contain?</p>

              <p>C: 23 neturons</p>
              <p>D: 23 protons</p>
              <p>Answer is B but I get A? (Why is it 12 neutrons when it is an isotope? Although I know now that A should be wrong as the atom and ion should have different electrons but B should also be incorrect?)</p>
              <p>2000</p>
              <p>5) An excess of sodium hydroxide is added to an aqueous solution of salt X and boiled. Ammonia gas is only given off after aluminium foil is added to the solution. What could be X?</p>
              <p>A: ammonium chloride</p>

              <p>Ans is D but i got A? Why is it sodium nitrate?</p>
              <p>2002</p>
              <p>6) If a strip of magnesium is dropped into excess hydrochloric acid an exothermic reaction occurs. The rate of reaction increases during the first few seconds because:</p>
              <p>A: the amount of magnesium is decreasing</p>
              <p>B: the magnesium is acting as a catalyst</p>
              <p>C: the solution is becoming hotter</p>
              <p>D: the surface area of the magnesium is increasing.</p>
              <p>Answer is C but I get A. What has the solution getting hotter got to do with increase in rate of reaction? oo</p>
              <p>7) Aluminium is extracted from purified bauxite by electrolysis but iron is extracted from haematite by reduction with coke.</p>
              <p>Why is iron not extracted by electrolysis?</p>
              <p>A: Haematite needs to be purified but bauxite does not</p>
              <p>B: Iron is less reactive than aluminium</p>
              <p>C: Reduction with coke is cheaper than electrolysis</p>
              <p>D: Redcution with coke gives a purer product than electrolysis</p>
              <p>Answer is C and I find the answer very weak. Isn't it supposed to be B? Also I thought that cost of substances for chemistry should be put to the least priority?</p>
              <p>2003</p>
              <p>8) Which of the following, when added to water, makes a solution that is a good conductor of electricity?</p>

              <p>Other forumners &amp; students, and Mod TinTin, pls feel free to reply to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/245742">Peoplethinkimsarcastic</a>'squestions in detail.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very brief comments &amp; hints.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q1. Determine limiting reactant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. Compare no. of moles of NH4+ ions present for the 4 options.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3. It's an allotrope of C, not compound. In excess oxygen, you get CO2. Otherwise, CO.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q4. The proper definition of isotopes (90% of students and even secondary school teachers get it wrong) is "Isotopes of elements have atoms with the same no. of protons but different no. of neutrons", and not "isotopes are atoms..."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q5. Cation can't be NH4+, or else you get NH3 gas immediately upon adding OH-(aq). Nitrate ion is first reduced (by Al metal) to NH4+ ion, which combines with OH- ion to give NH3(g) and H2O(l).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q6. Increase in temperature results in greater % of reactant molecules having energy equals or exceeding activation energy required for reaction, hence rate of reaction increases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q7. B is true enough to make C correct. C answers the question more directly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q8. CaCO3 is insoluble.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q9. Unsaturated means it has at least one (or more) double or triple bonds between adjacent C atoms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q10. "Answer is A but i get A?" Perhaps *chemistry* isn't the issue here? Exam stress can be counteracted by relaxation...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q11. CO2 is a non-metal oxide and hence an acidic gas. CO2(g) + H2O(l) &lt;---&gt; H2CO3(aq).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q12. The only possible products of burning hydrocarbons is carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q13. Grp I (Alkali Metals) metals react with water to form metal hydroxides and hydrogen gas, which is non-polar, doesn't ionize (eg. like HCl does), and hence insoluble in water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q14. Non-metal oxides are acidic and will react with the carbonate base. Carbon monoxide is a reducing agent (it wants to be oxidized to the more stable CO2 form), and has no reaction with carbonates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q15. Write the reduction half-equations at the cathode, for both metals. Calculate the no. of electrons transferred. Work with algebra ("Let the oxidation state of the Ti cation be +X") if you prefer. If every 1 mole of the titanium required 4 moles of electrons to reduce it to Ti atoms (ie. titanium metal), the oxidation state must be +4 (ie. the charge must be 4+).</p>

              <p>CuSO4 (aq) + Na2CO3 (aq) ---&gt; CuCO3 (s) + Na2SO4 (aq) + some excess unreacted sodium carbonate</p>
              <p>No. of mol CuSO4 ---&gt; 0.004*1.0 = 0.004 mol<br> No. of mol Na2CO3 ---&gt; 0.008*1.0 = 0.008 mol</p>
              <p>Hence, copper
              (II) sulphate is the limiting reagent (meaning it will be fully
              reacted), so the resulting solution will not have any blue colour.</p>
              <p>The ppt, copper (II) carbonate, formed is green in colour, while sodium sulphate is colourless.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the result will be a green ppt in a colourless solution.</p>

              <p>Graphite is an allotrope of carbon, meaning to say it consists of only carbon atoms. (Allotropes are different forms of the same element)</p>
              <p>Combustion of graphite produces carbon dioxide.</p>
              <p>C + O2 ---&gt; CO2</p>

              <p>Hmm, I think that B is incorrect too as a sodium atom contains 11p, 11e, 12n while an ion of the isotope of sodium contains 11p, 10e and a number of neutrons which cannot be 12 as it is an isotope.</p>
              <p>EDIT: I think I get what the question is trying to say.</p>
              <p>"What do both <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">an atom of the isotope of sodium</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">an ion of the isotope of sodium</span></strong>, Na, contain?"</p>
              <p>In this case, since both are isotopes, they should contain the same number of neutrons. Hence, B is the answer.</p>

              <p>Since ammonia gas is given off when solution is heated with aluminium foil, nitrate ions are present.</p>
              <p>As ammonia gas is given off only after aluminium foil is added, X cannot contain ammonium ions as this would mean that X is an ammonium salt.<br>When an ammonium salt is heated with an alkali (in this case NaOH), ammonia gas will be immediately given off.</p>

              <p>15) In an electrolysis experiment, the same amount of charge
              deposited 16g of copper and 6g of titanium. What was the charge on

              <p>Ammonia gas reacts water to form ammonium hydroxide, an alkaline substance, which turns red litmus paper blue.<br>Chlorine bleaches damp red litmus paper.</p>
              <p>B is wrong as hydrogen chloride gas reacts with water to form hydrochloric acid, which turns litmus papers red.</p>

              <p>Erm... I know halogens react with water.</p>
              <p>But my question is will it change the colour of litmus solution?</p>
              <p>Because there is a question:</p>
              <p>Excess chlorine gas is bubbled through litmus solution. Which colours are seen when the reactions are complete?</p>

              <p>The answer is A.</p>
