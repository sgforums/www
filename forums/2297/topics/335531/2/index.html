              <p>From wiki:</p>
              <p>Bonus points can be deducted from a student's raw score, thus lowering
              it. These bonus points may come from either scoring an 'A' or 'B' grade
              in CCA, taking Higher Mother Tongue Language and obtaining a minimum of
              'D7', or through affiliation (for feeder schools). Bonus points are
              capped at 4, with exception for those applying to schools offering
              Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP) or Malay Language Elective
              Programme (MLEP).</p>
              <p>However it has always been the case that a JC may not accept a student if his l1r5 after bonus is exactly the same as the cut-off</p>

              <p>My L1R5 for prelims was 9, L1R4 was 6. Yes, they are raw scores. None of my friends got above 27 points for their L1R5, and even then they were all upset and worried. Sorry to rain on all of your parades, but I'm honestly a little horrified by how people can boast about getting an L1R5 of above 40. I may sound catty, but seriously, get your act together. You have no idea how important this exam is.</p>

              <p>Much agreed. My L1R5 was 11 for Prelims, L1R5 was 7.</p>

              <p>Why not state your school before comparing Prelim's L1R5? Anyway they can't be used for admission anyway, so just take it as a "gauge" for your standard, Pre-O</p>

              <p>I heard from my friend that Bonus Points from CCA and HMT will
                                              only come into consideration if your L1R5 raw score is the same as
                                              your competitor who also applied for the same JC. I am skeptical
                                              about this.</p>
              <p><strong>If it's true, does it mean that a student who got D7 for his CCA
                                              and does not take HMT, but scored a raw point of 9 can actually win
                                              a student who scored a raw point of 10, however A1 in both CCA and
                                              HMT ??</strong> That'd be unfair.</p>
              <p>Anyone who is familiar with the MOE system please verify,

              <p>YES.</p>
              <p>If you're gonna score worse than someone who <strong>almost failed in CCA (this is very unlikely, unless that person is some kind of a geek who doesn't even do charity, then maybe the institute would reconsider)</strong> and no HMT, whereas you get A1 for both CCA and HMT and still get 10, then you "deserved" it (what they call it) for over-focusing on some aspects and not being an all-rounder.</p>
              <p>I know this sounds offensive, but this is reality. Not some video games where you focus tech on one aspect and go around killing people.</p>
