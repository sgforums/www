              <p>I think if you want fun + academically awesome school, they will be RJ, HC and AC.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular beliefs, my friends actually told me that NJ is quite awesome. Many says that it is a mugging school. well true, but who doesn't mug for your A's when the whole course is only like one year plus? Hmm, my friends actually say that your schooling life is more happening if you take part in house activities more actively.</p>
              <p>But I heard schools like NYJC and SAJC also not bad. Pioneer JC is also rising. Got increasing no. of scholars from there</p>

              <p>Although RJ/HCJ are the best academically, you can consider VJ too :) Nicole Seah is from there. but of course that's besides the point. Mainly, VJC has an extremely infectious school culture. Cheers are done practically all the time (the changing lightbulb joke is so true), everyone KNOWS how to play hard there. Personal experience. I was pleasantly surprised by the strong school spirit when i went there :) </p>
              <p>Their results are good too, always maintain their ranking at about 4th amongst all the JCs :) their a level results this year were especially good. uniform is not bad if you compare to some others.</p>
              <p>just a suggestion, because it sounds like what you're looking for :) you can go research deeper on all the JCs suggested :D keep up your work-hard-for-your-goal spirit haha!</p>
