              <p>Q1.     2/7 female and 3/8 male were underweight.</p>
              <p>There were twice as many underweight male as female.</p>

              <p>total amount of elephants = 53 units = 159 elephants</p>
              <p>= &gt; 1 unit of elephant = 3 elephants</p>
              <p>= &gt; total female elephants = 21 units = 63 elephants</p>
              <p>See the 2 underline numbers? The amount of males is directly twice the number of females, hence a direct comparison could be made.</p>
              <p>Q2. I assume that you can handle some algebra, since this  is P6 Maths.</p>
              <p>3 coins = $1.50 and 7 coins = $3.50</p>
              <p>If she spend $4, she will take x days to have $3.50 left, if she spend $2.50, she will take y days to have $1.50</p>
              <p>= &gt; $4x + $3.50 = $2.50y + $1.50</p>
              <p>        2.5y - 4x = 2</p>
              <p>         5y - 4x = 4</p>
              <p>= &gt; By trial and error, we let y be 2 and x be 1,</p>
              <p>       5(2) - 4(1) = 2 ( rejected )</p>
              <p>      Now, we let y be 4 and x be 2,</p>
              <p>       5(4) - 4(2) = 4 ( correct answer )</p>
              <p>= &gt; Hence minimum amount of money she has = $ ( 4(2) + 3.5 )  OR  $ ( 2.5(4) + 1.5 )</p>
              <p>                                                                                 = <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$ 11. 50</span></strong></p>

              <p>Q3. Since I cannot draw a model here, i will refer to the question in terms of units.</p>
              <p> If 6 more ppl were given masks, ppl with masks will be 780 more than ppl without masks.</p>
              <p>Also, ppl with masks will be 11 times ppl without masks.</p>
              <p>= &gt; 780 = 10 units of ppl</p>

              <p>2/3 were female</p>

              <p>Q4.</p>

              <p>factors of 48 = 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,48</p>
              <p>Looking at the highest common factor of both numbers, it is deduce that 8 is the HCF.</p>
              <p>= &gt; Maximum of 8 bookmarks could be made, with 5 red beads and 6 green beads on each bookmark.</p>

              <p>They are now 'playing' algebra for P6 in quite a number of Pri schools. It is still not a must thing though under normal curriculum, but I expect algebra to be brought down within the next 5 years or so.</p>

              <p>Btw, only Q2. REALLY needs a model to better express it, the rest can be work out without algebra or models. It will be good if someone is kind enough to help out the TS by loading up a model diagram for Q2.</p>

              <p>It is good that you help to solve the problem sums for PSLE students.</p>
              <p>But you need to solve the problem sums in a way that PSLE students can understand (model drawing method), not to solve the problem sums using the method that you are familiar with (secondary school algebra).</p>
              <p>You have told dkcx "in the thread Primary 6 Maths" that you NEVER teach your students to try and guess the correct answer for problem sums but you have just used it for your solution for question two.</p>
              <p>" By trial and error, we let y be 2 and x be 1,</p>
              <p>       5(2) - 4(1) = 2 ( rejected )</p>
              <p>      Now, we let y be 4 and x be 2,</p>
              <p>       5(4) - 4(2) = 4 ( correct answer )"</p>
              <p>You are contradicting yourself. It is also NOT true that guess and check method cannot be used in PSLE exam as you have claimed it. The guess and check method can be used in PSLE exam but it is usually used only as a last resort.</p>
              <p>For your information, question 2 is a variation of the "Money not Enough" type of question (ie one of the many PSLE questions classified under the different patterns and topics) in PSLE exam.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Steps to solve question 2 using the model drawing method.</span></span></p>
              <p>1.   $2.50 = Five 50-cent coins       $1.50 = Three 50-cent coins</p>
              <p>      $4 = Eight 50-cent coins          $3.50 = Seven 50-cent coins</p>
              <p>2.  Since the amount of the money must be the same for both cases, we will draw   two equal length bars.</p>
              <p>3.   First Bar       : 5 : 3  :                       :            </p>
              <p>     Second Bar   :    8    :    7   :             :</p>
              <p>4.  Next,  we will add 8 into the empty space in the second bar</p>
              <p>     First Bar        : 5 : 3  :                       :            </p>
              <p>     Second Bar   :    8    :    7   :       8    :</p>
              <p>5   7 + 8 = 15</p>
              <p>     since 15 can be divided by 5, we will not add more 8s into the empty space in the second bar.</p>
              <p>6.  Hence,</p>
              <p>      First Bar       : 5 : 3  :   5 :  5   :  5    :            </p>
              <p>     Second Bar   :    8    :    7   :    8       :</p>
              <p>7.  So, the minimum amount of money she has = (8 + 7 + 8)coins  x 50 cents</p>
              <p>                                                                    = $11.50</p>
              <p>     Alternatively, the minimum amount of money she has</p>
              <p>     = (5 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5) coins x 50 cents = $11.50</p>

              <p>      $4 = Eight 50-cent
              coins          $3.50 =
              Seven 50-cent coins</p>
              <p>2.  Since the amount of the money must be the same for both
              cases, we will draw   two equal length bars.</p>
              <p>3.   First
              Bar       : 5 : 3 
              :                      
              :            </p>
              <p>     Second
              Bar   :    8   
              :   
              7   :            
              :</p>
              <p>4.  Next,  we will add 8 into the empty space in the
              second bar</p>
              <p>     First Bar     
                : 5 : 3 
              :                      
              :            </p>
              <p>     Second
              Bar   :    8   
              :   
              7   :       8
                 :</p>
              <p>5   7 + 8 = 15</p>
              <p>     since 15 can be divided by 5, we will
              not add more 8s into the empty space in the second bar.</p>
              <p>6.  Hence,</p>
              <p>      First
              Bar       : 5 : 3 
              :   5 :  5   : 
              5  
               :            </p>
              <p>     Second
              Bar   :    8   
              :   
              7   :    8      
              :</p>
              <p>7.  So, the minimum amount of money she has = (8 + 7 +
              8)coins  x 50 cents</p>
              <p>                                                                   
              = $11.50</p>
              <p>     Alternatively, the minimum amount
              of money she has</p>
              <p>     = (5 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5) coins x 50 cents
              = $11.50</p>

              <p>  This is a good site to learn more about model-drawing:</p>

              <p>Glad to hear that you like the method used to draw the bar model.</p>
              <p>Baiyun's bar models are much better than mine.</p>
              <p>I really like Baiyun's bar models. They are so beautiful.</p>
              <p>I do not mind.</p>
              <p>It is good of you to help to solve the problem sums for PSLE students.</p>
