              <p>I don't understand. If you are in my group and of course your name will be in it, be it you do or not. I just need a copy of a project to amend the whole project for the school. </p>
              <p>I could not hand in whatever I got from anyone, because there's something call tunein, which will spot plagiarism in the project. If I have a copy of a project I have to amend 85% of it to be different from others. Only 15% similarity is allowed.  </p>

              <p>Well, I hope that you read it carefully, I didn't said that I "WANTED/WILL"  pay someone that can help me to do my project in the very last minute. I said "IF" I pay, I rather ask someone to do it for me right? Provided it must be grade A. </p>
              <p>Because IF I pay and I get a grade B, might as well I do it myself. -.-</p>
              <p>Isn't team mates should do their parts of the project? They did nothing until this moment. Now I'm asking whether anyone have the project, which I just need the outline of the project. </p>
              <p>I hope that you don't misunderstood anything. </p>
              <p>You try telling people over and over again, that you hope that project can be done before CNY, so that you got the time to arrange it, print and bring it to bind and everything. In the end you get nothing. And few of them kept on missing the lesson, don't even get to see them before CNY. How would you feel, when you had done your part and not the others.</p>

              <p>Well, I hope that you read it carefully, I didn't said that I
              "WANTED/WILL"  pay someone that can help me to do my project
              in the very last minute. I said "IF" I pay, I rather ask someone to
              do it for me right? Provided it must be grade A. </p>
              <p>Because IF I pay and I get a grade B, might as well I do it
              myself. -.-</p>
              <p>Isn't team mates should do their parts of the project? They did
              nothing until this moment. Now I'm asking whether anyone have the
              project, which I just need the outline of the project. </p>
              <p>I hope that you don't misunderstood anything. </p>
              <p>You try telling people over and over again, that you hope that
              project can be done before CNY, so that you got the time to arrange
              it, print and bring it to bind and everything. In the end you get
              nothing. And few of them kept on missing the lesson, don't even get
              to see them before CNY. How would you feel, when you had done your
              part and not the others.</p>

              <p>Failing which if the person still refuses to pull weight, I will just DIY and refuse to put the fella's name.</p>
              <p>Eh, not very hard to DIY. I have done that a few times already and sometimes its advantageous to yourself depending on the situation.</p>

              <p>How do your know that I'm not working on the project? I'm of course still working on it to complete it. </p>
              <p>For your info, I'm studying part time, whereas I'm working full time. I'm now using my working time to do my project. I have my responsibility at work too. I'm not pushing any of the responsibilities to anyone else other than my group mates. Please don't judge what you see here by it's cover. </p>
              <p>You never know I didn't drop any message to my lecturers or my course in-charge, I don't threaten, that's only shows that I got no guts to inform about their irresponsible acts. I'd already drop an email straight to course in-charge about this matter. </p>
              <p>Me and one of my group mate, who is a girl, were thinking whether we could get any help from anywhere, to let us complete this project by tonight. But what have the other 2 group mates, who are the guys. This only shows that guys have no sense of responsibility than the girls. Just like your that comments without thinking for your words. </p>
              <p>We never thought of paying anyone in the first place at my very first post to do the project for me. Even if someone is that kind to offer the project to us. We still have to amend the whole project, is just that the outline is there and it will be faster and easier for us to amend. Is FireIce the one that start asking me whether I'm paying or not, I'm not the one that mention I'm going to pay for someone that is willing to do the project. </p>
              <p>Please get to the right point of it. I'm casual and friendly answering what FireIce asked me. And your started to pin point that I'm irresponsible too for doing my project at the very last minute. I am in time to do the arrangement of the project and print it out and bind. I came here for the last resort is because at this point of time both of the guys still not replying me. </p>
              <p>This is why I'm here. Not here to let your pin point and scold. </p>

              <p>This is the reason why I didn't trust private schools. The students there just went there to pass time and for any assignment or project we didn't even know if it is genuine work or copy and paste from internet. Not to forget to mention the "examination" bodies who give the grade as well.</p>
              <p>My best advise is if your "private" school have orientation for new students before it is always an good idea to make friends who are senior in your level. For example if you are in the year 2 of the diploma class and you have friends who is study similar module/subject in year 3, your senior would have an better idea on where to find the resources and what the teacher will look for to reward marks and they are the best people you can look for help. This is an well-known secret which all my peers know during poly days.</p>
              <p>For your case as mention in an "private" institution, your classmate just didn't seen to brother and I doubt your future employer would "recognised" an A+ for an private diploma anyway (another open secret now you know), so why so serious ?</p>
