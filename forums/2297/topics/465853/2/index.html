              <p>You asked to be suaned.</p>
              <p>Because plagiarism is a huge taboo to many of us as a matter of principle. Never mind all the cheating scandals out there, many of us work our bums off for something we see fit to complete.</p>
              <p>It isn't about what 85% amend = new project, as long as the ideas and points generated are not yours, its still plagiarism.</p>
              <p>And your argument cuts zero ice with me.</p>
              <p>You failed to enforce, so too bad.</p>
              <p>I already pointed out that you could just DIY and drop the names by matter of principle in fact without what threats or anything.</p>
              <p>In fact you could even "spoil-market" by doing DIY and then to avoid a scene, just include the lazy a**hole's name. Been there done that too.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the end product matters. No end product, no talk. Period.</p>
              <p>And plagiarism?</p>
              <p>Well, I said my piece.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>How do your know that I'm not working on the project? I'm of
              course still working on it to complete it. </p>
              <p>For your info, I'm studying part time, whereas I'm working full
              time. I'm now using my working time to do my project. I have my
              responsibility at work too. I'm not pushing any of the
              responsibilities to anyone else other than my group mates. Please
              don't judge what you see here by it's cover. </p>
              <p>You never know I didn't drop any message to my lecturers or my
              course in-charge, I don't threaten, that's only shows that I got no
              guts to inform about their irresponsible acts. I'd already drop an
              email straight to course in-charge about this matter. </p>
              <p>Me and one of my group mate, who is a girl, were thinking
              whether we could get any help from anywhere, to let us complete
              this project by tonight. But what have the other 2 group mates, who
              are the guys. This only shows that guys have no sense of
              responsibility than the girls. Just like your that comments without
              thinking for your words. </p>
              <p>We never thought of paying anyone in the first place at my very
              first post to do the project for me. Even if someone is that kind
              to offer the project to us. We still have to amend the whole
              project, is just that the outline is there and it will be faster
              and easier for us to amend. Is FireIce the one that start asking me
              whether I'm paying or not, I'm not the one that mention I'm going
              to pay for someone that is willing to do the project. </p>
              <p>Please get to the right point of it. I'm casual and friendly
              answering what FireIce asked me. And your started to pin point that
              I'm irresponsible too for doing my project at the very last minute.
              I am in time to do the arrangement of the project and print it out
              and bind. I came here for the last resort is because at this point
              of time both of the guys still not replying me. </p>
              <p>This is why I'm here. Not here to let your pin point and
              scold. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay, so you've already reported the goons to your lecturer. So what on earth are you still doing here? Just log out, do your work as best as you can, then submit without the names of those goondus!</p>
              <p>You want to ask for help with your work? You are not taking responsibility for your work by doing that, and that will make you no different from those irresponsible people.</p>
              <p>So log out, and get down to your work already. Sheesh.</p>
