              <p>I have better students when i give volunteery tuition at Boon
              Lay Sec/Jurong Sec. My former boys at the Boys Hostel are also hard
              working though the current are...</p>
              <p>The reason y i continue to give volunteery tuition is at least
              that feels more like tutoring and guiding than paid tuition which
              is more being paid to test my patience. Paid tuition is mostly the
              parents wanting the child to have tuition and very rarely its the
              child themselves which is what makes it so torturing. having the
              door slam in your face by the student when he is giving attitude
              problems definietely is not something i enjoy even if its
              occasional.</p>
              <p>If i were to add in the total hrs i 'teach' and get paid per
              week, i should be the cheapest tutor that earns less than $15 an hr
              for teaching upper sec and that gets lower when i return to Boon
              Lay Sec to tutor mostly in Aug.</p>

              <p>This will be better in AA.</p>
              <p>A lot of tutors are peeling their eyes for people in this forum like you so that they could ask you to let them tutor you. I won't be surprised if some of them create new accounts just to post on this thread to entice you into accepting their tutoring services.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic, tuitioning is not a must, you are just succumbing to peer pressure. You see that everyone has one, and hence you worry that your results will suffer if you do not have one. This is a negative mindset, and you will find yourself blaming on the fact that you do not had a tutor everytime you get bad results. This will cause you to unconsciously lose your morale, and result in you being unable to work as hard as before.</p>
              <p>Indeed, being kiasu is a typical Singaporean mindset, but what you should do now is to focus on your studies. You can always come here to look for us for help whenever you need it.</p>
              <p>On a side note, eagle is a straight 'A's student despite the fact that he has never been tutored before. And though my ABB pales in comparison to his, I have never been tutored before too. This shows that hardwork and effort is always more important than having a tutor.</p>

              <p><br>I believe it's a psychological issue. Having tuition may be beneficial too an extent, it's not a magic centre. It doesn't not guarantee you will improve if you choose not to pay attention in class and put in effort. Best is to trust in yourself and work hard in a positive manner without much constant guidance. Till then you will be proud to say u have succeeded.</p>

              <p>Btw, I do had grp tuition at Mavis last time for A Maths only... That was because I was too lazy to do extra practices, so my mum put me in tuition for the extra practices.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, most of the time, in tuition class, I was just doing the questions because it was rather easy to me... And I topped the whole of Mavis in my year for the internal paper the teacher created, scoring full marks. In school, I went away with 98% for prelims. (ok, I know this is unnecessary bragging info <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif">)</p>
              <p>In short, for maths (and for physics), practice really makes perfect. No matter how good you are, you still need the practice to push yourself to the next level. That's what I believe. There's no use thinking and saying (as many of my classmates try to tell me) that it's no use scoring above 90 when 75 can get you an A1. <br><br>In life, one should aim for the best that one can do. Why should we compromise this for school? Just because 75 marks is the benchmark for A1, does that really mean we should aim for 75 and stop there? I don't think so.</p>
