              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Today my teacher has released my POA assignments for the week. When I started one of them, I realised that there is one adjustment in Financial Statement question that I don't quite understand.</p>
              <p>This adjustment is as follows:</p>
              <p>"The bank loan was obtained on 1 January 2015. The repayment of the principal sum and interest will begin the next year and on 31 December every year. The loan is to be repaid within 5 years. No adjustment has been made in the books"</p>
              <p>To provide an overview, the balances of the books of the Sole Proprietorship were extracted from 30 June 2015. What I was given was that:</p>
              <p>Cash at Bank = 33 000</p>
              <p>5% Bank Loan = 100 000</p>
              <p>I had requested for my teacher to explain it but she said that she don't know and need reference from the answer key. I asked a few of my friends but none knew how to do. And this was the first time I encountered this...</p>
              <p>Any kind soul willing to explain it to me? Thanks in advance.</p>

              <p>This is like 3 months late, really sorry about that. Just going to tackle for May curious souls out there.</p>
              <p>"5% Bank loan" is the total bank you you have in your bank, not 5% of it. The percentage is for your interest expense. Meaning that you are suppose to pay (100000x5%)$ for your interest expense.</p>
              <p>going back on topic. You have to pay your loan of 100000$ over 5 years, so each year, you are suppose to pay 20000$ each year. It is said that you have not record yourself paying 20000$ this end of year.</p>
              <p>cash at bank can be left out of this, the other double entry is "Current portion of long-term borrowing"</p>
              <p>what you are doing is basically taking a portion of long term borrowings and putting it in current liabilities, because you have to pay it that year.</p>
              <p>so in your balance sheet, Long term borrowings would be (100 000-20 000)$ in your non current liabilities. In current liabilities, you will have an entry that isÂ <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"Current portion of long-term borrowing" of 20 000$.</span></p>
              <p>and you are done!</p>
