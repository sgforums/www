              <blockquote>How public policy impacts ethnic groups in Singapore is also keenly
                                      examined. Ethnic discrimination is carried out at the highest level
                                      of government. One prominent indicator is Singapore’s
                                      government-sponsored overseas university scholarships to
                                      students.
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Citing
                                      statistics from 1966-2007, the authors note that of the 228
                                      President’s Scholarships awarded only 14 (about 6.1%) went to
                                      minority ethnic students.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The percentage dropped to 3.5% in the years between 1981 and
                                      2007, even though minority ethnic groups make up more than 20% of
                                      Singapore’s population. The number of scholarships given by the
                                      Singapore Armed Forces to minorities is even more telling: only
                                      2.2% of the awards given between 1971 and 2007 went to non-Chinese
                                      recruits. Messrs. Barr and Skrbis point out that it is not so much
                                      a question of whether, but rather of how consciously, these
                                      selection panels base their decisions on the wishes of Mr.
                                      Lee.<br> <br> Both Mr. Lee and his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, have
                                      openly stated that Singapore is not ready for a non-Chinese head of
                                      government. But in an irony that only autocratic systems can
                                      sustain, Mr. Lee has outlawed public discussions of race relations
                                      in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Singapore is color blind and only the best, white or black should be offered and to serve our nation in public service or private sector. In the meantime, each minority group should be encouraged further to excel, the way we as a society had done since indepence, regardless of old or new citizens. Their allegiance is to our society - us - our families, relatives and friends, and theirs.</p>

              <p>Instead of merely stating that which scholarship went where, to whom etc. , the author should provide statistics of the achievements of those who are eligible for application of such scholarships. If a particular ethnic group does not seem to excel in areas required for this scholarship, I guess we can say that nature had made it this way. Reserving scholarship slots for different ethnic groups would seem to discourage the hardworking ones and cushion the ineptness of others.</p>
              <p>Likewise, everything in this world has something called "balance". If the particular ethnic group does not meet this scholarship's requirements, I am certain to say that they WILL be eligible for other scholarships, just that they need to extend their necks a little further.</p>
              <p>And of course, hard work comes before anything. There is no point in complaining about deprivation when one isn't even willing to commit blood and sweat to earn it.</p>
