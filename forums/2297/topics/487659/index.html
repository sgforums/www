              It is advisable to specify either "reduction potential" or "oxidation potential" when discussing feasibility of redox reactions.<br><br>
              The standard oxidation potential of 2Br- to Br2 is -1.07 V, which is <b><u>more positive</u></b> compared to the standard oxidation potential of 2Cl- to Cl2, which is -1.36 V.
              <br><br>
              Hence, assuming standard or equal molarities, the oxidation of Br- ions to Br2 is more feasible compared to the oxidation of Cl- ions to Cl2 at the anode.

              At the anode, oxidation occurs. Both the nitrate(V) ion NO3- and the sulfate(VI) ion SO42- cannot be oxidized at the anode because both the Group V Nitrogen and Group VI Sulfur are already at their maximum oxidation states of +5 and +6 respectively. It is possible for the oxygens to be oxidized (instead of the nitrogens and the sulfurs), but under aqueous conditions, it is more thermodynamically feasible to oxidize the oxygens from the water solvent, or if you prefer to think of it as, from the hydroxide OH- ions from the auto-dissociation of the water solvent, hence generating O2 gas at the anode, rather than oxidizing the oxygens in the nitrate(V) or sulfate(VI) ions. Therefore for A level purposes, the nitrate(V) and sulfate(VI) ions are to be considered inert and unreactive when carrying out electrolysis of aqueous salts (electrolysis of molten nitrates and sulfates are beyond the scope of the A level syllabus).

                  Oxidation of sulfate(VI) to peroxodisulfate(VI) S2O82- with the 2 peroxo O atoms having an OS of -1, is indeed what I was referring to in my previous post, that is, oxidizing the oxygens rather than the sulfurs. However, as also mentioned in my previous post, the oxidation of the oxygens in the water solvent (and by definition of solvent, it's present in much higher molarity than the sulfate(VI) ions) to generate O2 gas, is more thermodynamically feasible.<br><br>For A level purposes, unless otherwise indicated in the question, electrolysis of aqueous sulfates will not oxidize the sulfate(VI) ion into the peroxodisulfate(VI) ion.<br><br>
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpotential">Overpotential</a> is a complex matter (as this is a broad term that includes different types of overpotential with competely different and even unrelated underlying chemistry and physics reasons), and is safely beyond the scope of the A level syllabus, and as such I suggest you do not confuse your students with this. On rare occasions when the Cambridge A level exam question includes beyond-the-syllabus concepts such as overpotential, sufficient data (eg. relevant formulae) will certainly be provided in the question to allow the A level student to cope.

              At the anode, the copper metal of the anode electrode is itself oxidized, thus generating soluble Cu2+(aq) and thus 'dissolving'.
              <br><br>
              
              The oxidation potential for Cu(s) to Cu2+(aq) is more positive than the oxidation potential of either OH- or H2O, to be oxidized to O2. You cannot use Data Booklet values for this, as Data Booklet are for standard conditions (including molarities) only.
              <br><br>
              The copper electrode is solid, and by definition of solids, thus have a much higher molarity compared aqueous ions (so much so that we don't even give any value for the molarity of solids).
              <br><br>
              Therefore, for A &amp; O level Chemistry purposes, consider the reactivity of the electrodes. Generally, copper and any metal more reactive than copper, would be preferentially oxidized if used as the anode electrode, over any other species present in the aqueous state.

              <p>What is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">always</span></strong> observed when aqueous CuSO4 is electrolyzed using carbon electrodes.</p>
              <p><strong>A</strong> Copper (II) ions are reduced at cathode</p>
              <p><strong>B</strong> Sulfate ions migrate to anode</p>
              <p><strong>C</strong> The blue solution fades</p>
              <p><strong>D</strong> oxygen is produced at anode</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is <strong>D</strong> the correct answer?? since if <strong>A</strong> is a correct answer then <strong>C</strong> would have been correct also. This is because OH- will migrate towards anode in preference to sulfate ions as the E is feasibly positive than sulfate ions. Am i correct??</p>

                  <br><br>This is a trick question. The only option in which you can <b>visually observe</b> is option C : blue colour fading.
