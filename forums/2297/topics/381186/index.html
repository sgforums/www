              <p>Hi anpanman,</p>
              <p>For question 1), Ice has lower potential energy and kinetic energy than Liquid Water, thus it is correct that water molecules lose potential energy.</p>
              <p>For question 2), D will be a technically more correct answer. The point to note is that there is no specification as to how large is the "large attractive force".</p>
              <p>For question 3), The resultant force refers to the force working against the mother now. Hence work done = ( Total force - opposing force ) X Distance</p>
              <p>For question 4), I believe your workings should be acceptable.</p>

              <p>Hi qdtimes2,</p>
              <p>For your 1st question, when the ball is at its maximum height, it is about to start moving downwards, thus there is a gravitational force of 20N working on the ball, hence the resultant force is 20N.</p>
              <p>For your 2nd question, I will have to say that it is a bit ambiguous. Perhaps the question is assuming that you cannot have two forces applied at the same spot at the same exact angle at the same time.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>@anpanman's qns 1, </p>
              <p>is it also explainable by using sign convention? potential energy arises due to intermolecular forces of attraction, and since this is an attractive force(negative sign convention), when distance between water molecules decreases, the PE also decreases(becomes more negative).</p>

              <p>ur smaller letter f refers to friction? cannot be 20N resultant force opp to the direction of F exerted by the lady...</p>

              <p>fyi, tys answer done by grad students. ~.~</p>
              <p>qn5)  why 20n ?  because thats the weight of the ball ma. it stops at the top because the force u supply= gravity. hence the ball drop =)</p>
              <p>or .</p>
              <p>f= m x a</p>
              <p>f =  2x 10</p>
              <p>=20 .</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i think TS got a misconception here... for the first question in the first post..<br><br>we always do those physic question that has a slope then one rollercoast, ask u about energy these all...<br><br>this type of question is always asuming that there is NO LOSS of energy through friction or any resistance... in reality there is usually a sound or heat energy produced from friction.. <br><br>now back to the question.. when water change to ice... the water MUST be cooled in order for freezing to take place... thus a overall energy drop... since temperature has no change, molecule move same speed... so no change in kinetic energy... but we only learn 2 type of energy in substance, kinetic and potential... so no change in kinetic, drop in overall, can only result cuz of drop in potential energy...<br><br>and potential energy in substance is caused by the intermolecular forces.. not the speed...<br><br>so if u compare the type of question that has slope and all that, there is NO overall energy change... so u can always equate them or manipulate it...</p></div>

              <p>Hi ItchyArmpit,</p>
              <p>The brightness of the light bulbs will not be affected.</p>
