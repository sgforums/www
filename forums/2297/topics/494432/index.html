              Yes, I take the A levels every year as a private candidate, and I ORD'd many decades ago. Though starting this year, if I don't get enough sleep for that day, I may decide to sleep in and skip that paper. Of course, once you miss even 1 paper, you get an Absent grade for that subject, so no point taking the rest of the papers liao.
              <p>
              But you're probably taking A levels because you want to use the A level certificate to apply for Uni. In which case, YOU CAN'T SKIP ANY PAPERS!!! Or your entire A level certificate is useless for applying to Uni!</p><p>
              It's obviously too late for you now to apply for 2017 A levels, so you are thinking of applying for 2018 A levels? Be sure you check the various University courses' required A level subject combination, from the NUS, NTU, SMU, etc's websites.</p><p>For instance, if you intend to apply for Medicine, you need H2 Chem + H2 Math and either H2 Bio or H2 Phys. Choose your A level subject combination carefully.</p>

              Hi, thanks. As I left school donkey years ago, I reckon the syllabus has been changed drastically ? I can't find any private school that is teaching A Level subjects except those tuition centres and quite embarressing to sit down with a bunch of so much younger than me students. lol. I am not daring enough. 
              
              So my learning route will be self-learning type, if there are any available other options as supplement will be much appreciated.

              <p>I should say that OwlCove and TickNinja, being by past students for current students... has a very distinct disadvantage for the A Level as these students were only trained in the previous syllabus.</p>
              <p>The A level has just undergone a major syllabus change. While 80% of the previous syllabus still applies, 20% has changed. And this 20% matters. Studying outdated notes may make a student worse off.</p>
              <p>E.g. for Quantum Physics, the formula for uncertainty principle had a slight change. Students following the previous syllabus' formula will always get a wrong answer, even though the formula is technically correct.</p>
              <p>Students following the definitions of the previous syllabus for the topic of Gravitation will also find that they lose marks to one or two additional key words that have been added to the SEAB syllabus.</p>
