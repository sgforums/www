              <p>A tuition teacher merely speeds up the learning curve.</p>
              <p>But if the student still refuse to work hard or stay unmotivated, no matter how good the teacher is, the student will still not be able to learn much.</p>
              <p>Btw I don't attend tuition. I teach tuition.</p>

              <p>I'm an ex-MOE full-time teacher and am now a full-time ('A' levels and 'O' levels Chemistry and Biology) tuition teacher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even during my days as an MOE teacher in school, I would advise some of my students or their parents, to look for private tuition. This is because, as an MOE teacher, I'm fully aware of how it is, in practice, impossible for every student to get all the attention he/she needs, from the (severely overworked and underpaid) MOE teachers in school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a student, you would experienced this - during lesson, you have a question or query about the content, but you don't have the chance/inclination to ask, because</p>
              <p>i) your classmates would think you're trying to be teacher's pet, or</p>
              <p>ii) your classmates think you're trying to show off, or</p>
              <p>iii) your teacher is rushing the syllabus and doesn't have time to entertain qns that he feels will distract the lesson/class, or</p>
              <p>iv) after school, you're too busy to ask your teacher, or</p>
              <p>v) after school, your teacher is too busy to let you ask him, or</p>
              <p>vi) etc. etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact is, in Singapore education system, classes are way too big for effective learning, and most of the class for many lessons are not even paying attention, and too much time is wasted for discipline issues, teachers are overburderned with work not directly related to teaching, and don't have the time/energy/opportunity to give every student the full attention which the individual student may require (this varies across students, depending on their own focus, competency, interest, and intentions).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So to summarize and give a simple, short, answer :</p>
              <p>In Singapore education system, tuition is not compulsory but it is helpful.</p>

              <p><br>Quite the contrary, at least for my tuition and my tuition students. Before tuition, they loathe the subject in school, because they see it as meaningless and just something they're forced to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After my tuition, they appreciate, understand and enjoy the subjects (I teach Chemistry and Biology) for the beauty of the subject, and not for hollow paper chase qualifications. As a result, they truly enjoy the subject and consequently, do much better in these subjects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many schools and school teachers only tell students what they they need to memorize. Good teachers and good tutors, instill the love of the subject in the students, and support their learning process in a helpful way.</p>

              <p>what maths tuition you taking. Do challenge your tuition teacher to the fullest by asking as many questions as possible. Don't wait for him to give you questions.</p>

              <p>I dunno for others, but I will try to make the subject interesting, pepper the lessons with acnedotes and exam strategies at the same time, and make sure they still learn. In short, I really want my students to score... I will really be sad if I can't get them to an A..... :(</p>

              <p><br>The 'educated idiot' syndrome is essentially an asian phenomenon of kiasuism and dogma, in contrast to USA society of creativity and entrepreneurship (eg. Silicon Valley), caused by a combination of the following</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(i) the person's own personal lack of competence,</p>
              <p>(ii) the person's own personal lack of creativity and passion, </p>
              <p>(iii) made worse by the dogma of a judgmental, paper-chase, materialistic, superficial society, eg. common in Singapore society</p>
              <p>(iv) kiasu parents who are dogmatic, judgemental, fearful... good intentioned maybe (some cases are selfish and impose their own thinking and judgements onto their children; living your parent's life instead of your own)</p>
              <p>(v) incompetent teachers and burnt-out teachers (the latter is exacerbated by the faulty Sg education system) who unintentionally do harm to students, stifling their passion for true real learning.</p>
              <p>(vi) same as part (v), but for tutors.</p>
              <p>(vii), etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if the soul is strong and able to rise above adversity, judgement and dogma of the society, parents, and (incompetent) teachers, then the soul has broken through and triumphed up to it's own level of personal success against adversity. Entrepreneurship and courage, in spite of lack of academic qualifications, is one such example. But it applies to other aspects of one's life as well, including one's relationships and one's spirituality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But tuition, by and large, is ethical and helpful, giving keen students the help they need and ask for. And as for other cases, as Bear has pointed out and as I've elucidated in my posts, it's the unfortunate consequence of societal kiasuism, societal dogma, societal judgement, foolish parents, incompetent teachers/tutors, and a flawed Singapore education system.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But tuition is still good. (At least mine is.) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>hmm in this kinda case, seems like really tuition is inevitable, but private tuition or tuition in small group more effective?</p>
              <p>n yea i do agree some kids are against tuition but parents dun see the point. I've known quite a lot of parents who enforced tuition ( and other stuff as well) on the kids. nothing really efficient came out of there.</p>
              <p>i'm really wondering whether kids have got any child hood these days, and maybe its the education system's problem.</p>

              <p>It depends on how you make use of your learning opportunities....you can either ask for help for every question you get stucked at, or you can try ways and means to solve it failing which you seek for help.</p>
              <p>In both cases, you gain insight and knowledge. But nothing beats the satisfaction you derive when you get the solution on your own, and that should be the driving force behind learning.</p>
