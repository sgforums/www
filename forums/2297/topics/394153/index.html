              <p><br>FYI. The deadline for registration was yesterday. (You can still register in the next few weeks, but you'll have to pay a late-penalty fee).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It might be more manageable to retake your 'A' levels next year, as you may find it less stressful to study when you're nearer your ORD and have accumulated significant off-days or leave-days to clear. Even better if you ORD a couple months before next year's 'A' levels.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You can try applying for a place first in the local unis. Since you have three chances, even if you get rejected the first time, you can try again after re-taking your "A"-lvls. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Alternatively, you can also consider entering some of the poly courses which requires an "A"-lvl cert. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Anyway, if you are considering retaking, the most important thing is for you to be committed. Army life can be tiring, especially if you get sent to those more "xiong" units, but even so, you will still need to find time out to study. If you find yourself to be unable to be committed to your studies, than it will be pointless ( No offence ) to retake your "A"-lvl.</p>

              <p>Dear Charlesykins,</p>
              <p>  Go on and apply, and support your applications with teachers' testimonials.</p>
              <p>  Consider retaking your exams in year 2 of your NS, and ask for time-off from your unit to study.</p>
              <p>  Remember that where there is struggle, there is life. Stay hopeful and press on. No difficulty is daunting to one who is determined to succeed in life. Jiayou!</p>

              <p>With your results, I believe you cannot get into the local U.  Your situation is just like mine many years ago. </p>
              <p>This is what I happened to me  : Because I've already passed the "A" levels, I can;t go back to JC again as I have already passed, but can;t get into a local Uni as I am not good enough although I meet the minimum requirements.  This is the way our screwed up education system was and apparently still is.  So I took the "A" levels again in my 2nd year in the army, back then I had to do 2 1/2 years.  First attempt as a private candidate, did not improve on my grades.    Then I took a second time after ROD.  I studied FULL TIME with zero income for half a year.  The Maths &amp; Physics syllabus had also changed.  But I did not give up, I studied and practiced exam papers not stop 10 hrs every single day for 6 months to take the exam as a private candidate.  I did extremely good to to get into NUS.    After getting in, it was a major disappointment as I discovered there were so many <a href="mailto:fu@king">fu@king</a> foreign students taking up places that could have been given to Singaporeans, especially someone who have just wasted, I repeat, WASTED 2 1/2 yrs to NS.  The feeling sucked and it really make me hated National Service and the gahment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So, my advice to you is this :</p>
              <p>1 ) Apply for a local U and try your luck, who knows you may get a place.</p>
              <p>2 ) If you cannot get in, and still want to go to a local U, then be prepared to sacrifice another one year of your life to study hard.  Remember you have already wasted 2 years in NS.  No compromise, do or die to get in, otherwise you will waste another one year of your life.</p>
              <p>3 ) Apply for a foreign Uni - beg, borrow or steal, just do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My choice would be (3) as you will practically relearn everything once you are in Uni. So absolutely no point taking A levels again.  It's a stupid waste of time as you have already passed i.e. you have ALREADY MADE THE GRADES and can be accepted into many other Universities in the world.  Only in S'pore will you be denied a University education because you have been squeezed out by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p><br>This issue is particularly severe and clear-to-see with Medicine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They've deliberately set the number of available places so low, that it is now ridiculously near-impossible for most local students (even those who score a perfect AAAA) to get into Medicine (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/pressreleases.aspx?id=1076">and for many years, women were further discriminated against, only one-third of each cohort could be women</a>), in that out of 1000+ local students with AAAA who apply every year, there are only 200+ places available; such that :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#1 - there is now a severe shortage of doctors in Singapore, so much so the government has been desperately importing large numbers of foreign doctors into Singapore every year. "No choice, we not enough doctors, so have to bring in more foreign doctors". Whose fault is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 - the majority of local students opting for Medicine are forced to (spend enormous sums of money to) go overseas to study Medicine. In many overseas Universities offering Medicine, a significant proportion of Medicine students are Singaporeans. Many of these students don't return to Singapore, practicing Medicine overseas, as a result. Which brings us back to #1 above.</p>
