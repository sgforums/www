              <p>Social Studies is complusory so you don't have to care about it. You just need to decide whether you want to combine it with which other humans.</p>
              <p>If you are good in maths and science, i would advice you take double maths and double science Pure Phy and Chem unless you feel you can do triple science. Pure Chem and Bio is not a very useful combination and Pure Phy and Bio is rather useless. Since you have no plans in mind, Phy and Chem gives you the widest options in future regardless you going JC or Poly.</p>
              <p>Entry to JC requires L1R5 which is Eng, Maths, Humans and 3 others or something. Going to be a decade since i did my O's so not sure whats the current criteria.</p>

              <p>Current criteria still the same. L1R5 at most 20 with eng pass.</p>
              <p>This is because YJC has promised before to NEVER lower the criteria, hence it will never change for this particular JC.</p>
              <p>The rest of the JC will requires at most 18 points ( TPJC ), even though some of them rank even lower than YJC.</p>

              <p>Physics is required for all the engineering courses so its more useful than chemistry for anyone who wants to consider engineering. Chemistry's scope is more limited compared to physics and this is coming from a Chemistry undergrad.</p>

              <p>Either you are not working hard enough, or it is a good time to change tutors.</p>
              <p>I will leave that to your own interpretations.</p>
              <p>Eagle will be happy to give you tuition if you are willing to pay him.</p>
              <p>For Maths, you will have to drill yourselves repeatingly.</p>
              <p>For English, since narratives are still available for "O"s, try to write some stories of your own and exchange with your friends and read each other's works. This way you and your friends can scrutinise each other's work. </p>
              <p>You can do the same for chinese, but the best way for chinese is to copy other people's compositions and the chinese dictionary on paper. It will help you in memorising the words.</p>

              <p>Carelessness there is no direct way to really solve. You just need more practice and pay more attention when you work. Know which areas which cause you to be careless and work on it such as handwriting, pressing of calculation, algebric manipulation etc work from there.</p>

              <p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">More top O-Level scorers choosing polytechnic route</span></span></strong><br><em><span>By Hoe Yeen Nie, Channel NewsAsia |</span> <span>Posted: 19 February 2008 2101 hrs</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: <strong>19,800 of the 36,800 students who took part in the Joint Admissions Exercise in 2008, have got a place in a polytechnic.</strong><br><br>Many of them are top students who said that they're aiming for an alternative route to university.<br><br>Joshua Loo scored an aggregate of 10 points (L1R5) in the O-Level examinations and that is more than enough for him to secure a place at a junior college.<br><br>But Joshua is looking for a different experience. The former student from Clementi Town Secondary has applied for a Business Studies and Accounting course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br>He said: "They have to do research on their own, they have to depend not only on their lecturers but themselves too. There’s also more hands-on experiences, such as more project work."<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Polytechnic places are in high demand and getting more competitive.</span> In 2008, there were 25,000 places available, an increase of 2,000 from 2007.<br><br><span style="color: #008000;">Polytechnics have also lowered their cut-off points for those courses that tend to attract the brightest students. These include Business Studies and Aeronautical Engineering.</span></strong><br><br>For example, the highest aggregate score among 2007 entrants into Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Banking and Financial Services diploma was 11, but in 2008, it was 10.<br><br><strong>In the past two years, nearly one in three students offered a place in polytechnic was also eligible for a junior college. In 2006, it was 30 per cent and this went up to 32 per cent in 2007.<br></strong><br>Lydia Liao was more than eligible to enter a junior college, with her aggregate score of seven points. But she is choosing the polytechnic route because she sees it as a faster way to reach her goal.<br><br>She said: "I decided that tourism was a big prospect in the future, because of the IRs, so I thought I'd join tourism at NTU. So I decided to take Tourism and Resort Management in poly now."<br><br>With top scorers opting for polytechnics, some applicants are worried about their chances of getting the course that they want.<br><br>Lydia continued: "Some of my friends had cut-off points that were able to make it for last year's batch, but they couldn't make it this year. So I think it's getting more competitive in the polys also."<br><br>However, despite a higher demand for some diploma programmes, polytechnics said there are enough places to go around, where other courses are concerned. - CNA/vm<br></span></p>

              <p>To be eligible for deferment to pursue an overseas course, you must be able to commence on your full-time overseas course before the age of 17 1/2 years. A bank guarantee of a minimum of S$75,000/- or 50% of the combined annual gross income of both parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher, is needed. No deferment will be granted for degree studies.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. Is any monetary bond required by MINDEF for Overseas studies?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes. A bank guarantee of a minimum of $75,000/- or 50% of the combined annual gross income of both parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher, is required. You must also be able to commence on your overseas course before you are 17 1/2 years old.</p>
              <p>However, if you are accompanying your parents on overseas employment, you are only required to be bonded by deed instead of providing a monetary bond.</p>

              <p><br>Yes English is the only must but you don't need to choose it.</p>
              <p>However, A Maths is the most worthwhile among the subjects you can choose.</p>
              <p>While at O level, studying A Maths aid your E Maths and Physics performance. There is great synergy between these subjects. Practically all the A1s in E Maths are sewn up by A Maths candidates. And putting the effort here give you 2 distinctions.</p>
              <p>Next, regardless of whether you go the poly route or JC route, A Maths give you an advantage. In poly, you have to do calculus and right away the A Maths students have an unfair advantage.</p>
              <p>For JC, if you didn't take A Maths, you have to take H1 Maths which is a waste of time as it does not count toward the entry points and YET half the university courses required a good pass in H1 OR A Maths. Oh and the other half want a good pass in Maths C or H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>And from the learning point of view, Maths is the most important thing you want to learn if you have a geniune interest in the sciences.</p>
              <p>"If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics..." <br>— <a class="authorNameRegular" title="view all quotes by Roger Bacon" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/119129.Roger_Bacon"><span style="color: #663300;">Roger Bacon</span></a></p>
