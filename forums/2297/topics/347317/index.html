              i think compared to someone who put in 3 to 4 yrs to earn his degree in the local U or overseas, what u are talking abt is not as recognised.  For sure, in the government sector, ur degree won't be recognised. 
              
              U may get some luck applying to the private sector.

              <p><br>that is not true.   someone got a honour from Uni of LOndon landed herself job in govt co and is doing well.   in fact, most MNCs prefer external degree.   They like people who can think out of the box</p>

              I have read something like this somewhere:
              
              If it's a technical degree, there are professional bodies such as Board of Engineers, Law Society, Medical Council etc in Singapore that can provide a list of recognised universities. However, if it is a non-technical degree such as business or marketing, the govt will recognise if the university itself is recognised by the local govt of the country where the univerisity is located.

              <p>The reults obtained in the degree matters a lot.</p>
              <p>Even if you get an external degree from University of London but if you get a first</p>

              ha...if its MDIS/SIM maybe...Kaplan ...maybe not.
              
              also, did they enter as fresh grad or with some years of experience under their belt?  If you look at their ads, they always put "recognised degree" - that alone is already discriminating.  A degree is a degree - what do you mean recognised degree?

              I think every government agencies and employers have their own list of recognised universities. I have a friend who studied part time degree and is now working in a government agency. I guess somehow government agencies will favour degree from govt subsidies universities such as NUS, NTU and SMU for fresh grads. After that, it's the working experience that counts.
              
              I do agree that if you're studying full time, it is always best to do it in a proper insitution whether local or overseas rather than attending lessons at private agencies.
