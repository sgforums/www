              Yes, every degree is supposed to be recognised but every employer has their own preference of universities. Similarly, if you graduate from a univerisity in Singapore and try to apply for job elsewhere, the employer might not favour you and will pick graduates from their own local universities instead. By the way, I heard that our local universities send many of their students to overseas universities for exchange programmes but very few students from overseas universities are willing to come over to our local unis.

              <p>those students have same mindset as most asians, that the 'western' uni are always better</p>
              <p>in fact, uni with students of the very best calibre are found in the national universities, esp India and China. Times magazine previosly featured an article regarding Indian Uni, and said that some Indian students go to ivy league sch becos they can't get into the Indian big 2 Unis, so u can imagine the calibre of those in the Uni itself, scary</p>
              <p>if now u hav an exchange with an India U and a US U, i guess most will opt for the US Uni, even if it is not as good as the India U</p>

              That's the mentality of our govt &amp; staff in local unis. They mentioned several times about increasing the uni intake but it seems that they are not interested to give more places to poly grads. A' level grads are the first to be considered which I think is quite fair. Next, they will consider foreigners and left-over places are given to poly grads. I guess the govt heavily subsidised for our poly education therefore they are not interested to subsidise for our uni education anymore. But then when many Sinagporeans head overseas for furthur education, they bring a large sum of $ out of the country which benefits the country they go to.

              <p><br>i dun think so, i'm a poly grad who found a place in ntu. Nowdays alot of poly grads are entering local uni, but there are still some points to note.A diploma is so easy to "pass", copy from friends and study one day before the exam. hence, there will be some cut off point to maintain the standard of student getting in. just like if your A level result sucks i dun think you can get into local uni too. so if you just pass your dip(gpa&lt;3.5) i dun think you work hard enough.....</p>

              <p>afterall, in the first place, the academically stronger students go to JC, dat's why more will go to local uni too. if it was the other way round, where better students go poly, the reverse will happen</p>

              Yes, you can say it is rather easy to pass exams in poly. That is because the focus is more on hand-ons and a large percentage of the grade is based on assignments and projects. Therefore to score good grades, you will also need to put in effort to do well in projects as well. Similarly, A'level students who are academically brighter may not do so well if they are in poly as they may be lacking in terms of creativity.
              
              I agree with you that there should be a minimum standard or entry requirements for our local unis. It is not true to say that those poly grads who didn't manage to get a place in our local unis did not do well enough in poly. I have several friends who acheived above average results and one of them was even in the top few percentage since he got a cert of merit. None of them manage to get a place. The issue is not that they don't do well enough but rather very few places are allocated for poly grads. The situation is very different in another country where students with good results go to a good university and those with lousy results go to a not-so-good university. Nobody is deprieved of university education. 
              
              We are aware of the numerous achievements and awards which our poly grads won in international competitions and it proves that many of them are of good calibre who certainly deserve a place in our local unis. It is very demoralising to see poly grads with quite impressive results spending so much money for education overseas. It is so unfair for this group of people that even their parents have to beg, borrow or steal to ensure that they receive university education. We shouldn't blame a handful of them who take up permanent residence or citizenship in the other country since our country did not even give them a chance to complete university education. We would have done so if we were in their shoes.

              <p>Definition of university with mediocre standing  ==&gt; the standing of the university is mediocre. Asking me "e.g australian state unis mediocre standing?" is just weird.</p>
              <p>Australia have so many university you want me to lump them together and grade them as mediocre, excellent or whatever? Let's say USA, which one is mediocre, non state university of harvard? or state university of texas?</p>
              <p>I can assume that the "national" university of any country is not bad. It is foolish to assume that the "state" university is not bad. difference is like neighbourhood sec schools or elite sec school in singapore.</p>

              <p>if u are good, u are good, i don't think it matters where you
              come from. all this poly / jc debate is so lame, pro means pro.</p>
              <p>if a poly grad can get into Harvard / Oxford but can't get into
              NUS, then come find me again, then there's really sthing wrong with
              the system</p>

              Ok. Let's not debate cos I agree with you that this is lame. We're slowly getting off-topic.
