              Yes, you can't really say that state unis or national unis are better. There are also other city unis that are better.

              You're right in the sense that it's sometimes hard to determine which one is the best. But then I guess nobody will choose a uni which we never heard of.

              This is subjective. But most people prefer unis in the group of Eight (go8) or those which are member of Universitas 21 (U21).

              <p><br>Yes, you can say it is rather easy to pass exams in poly. That is because the focus is more on hand-ons and a large percentage of the grade is based on assignments and projects. Therefore to score good grades, you will also need to put in effort to do well in projects as well. Similarly, A'level students who are academically brighter may not do so well if they are in poly as they may be lacking in terms of creativity. I agree with you that there should be a minimum standard or entry requirements for our local unis. It is not true to say that those poly grads who didn't manage to get a place in our local unis did not do well enough in poly. I have several friends who acheived above average results and one of them was even in the top few percentage since he got a cert of merit. None of them manage to get a place. The issue is not that they don't do well enough but rather very few places are allocated for poly grads. The situation is very different in another country where students with good results go to a good university and those with lousy results go to a not-so-good university. Nobody is deprieved of university education. We are aware of the numerous achievements and awards which our poly grads won in international competitions and it proves that many of them are of good calibre who certainly deserve a place in our local unis. It is very demoralising to see poly grads with quite impressive results spending so much money for education overseas. It is so unfair for this group of people that even their parents have to beg, borrow or steal to ensure that they receive university education. We shouldn't blame a handful of them who take up permanent residence or citizenship in the other country since our country did not even give them a chance to complete university education. We would have done so if we were in their shoes.</p>

              <p><br>hmmmmm, maybe your friend who got cert with merit try to apply some course that is not related to his poly course? cos i'm a cert of merit holder too, we are able to apply for most of the course in local uni even unrelated ones.... but you must think if your apply for those unrelated course you cert of merit will be nothing, cos its unrelated or your friend go and apply those like law or medicine den comfirm cannot get in ma. i try to apply two time (cos want to change course) both time i got into both nus and ntu, cos i sent both(i sent to related course).....and if every one in singapore can get into local uni so easily den i must as well throw my ntu cert away. worth less.... and seriously even i got my cert of merit in poly, and i compare the work load of poly and uni, my uni course is seriously more den poly.... in poly i can just studyÂ one day before the exam and get A and above, in uni i do this i die like shit.....Â </p>

              <p>The reason so many smart people choose to complete poly and A level before entering a university that does NOT accept O level applicants is because they are very free and have alot of time.</p>

              <p>Scare? Are you kidding? Students should be excited instead, intellectually stimulated and invigorated by the deeper, more comprehensive, more satisfyingÂ study of a subject they have passion for, at higher levels. 'O' level students should be excited at theÂ prospect to study their personal favourite or beloved subjectsÂ (eg. Chemistry, everyone loves Chemistry) at 'A' levels (or a related Polytechnic course), and 'A' level or Diploma holders, should be even more excited at the thought of studying their personal favourite or beloved subjects at an even higher, University level.</p>

              hmmmmm, maybe your friend who got cert with merit try to apply some
              course that is not related to his poly course? cos i'm a cert of
              merit holder too, we are able to apply for most of the course in
              local uni even unrelated ones.... but you must think if your apply
              for those unrelated course you cert of merit will be nothing, cos
              its unrelated or your friend go and apply those like law or
              medicine den comfirm cannot get in ma. i try to apply two time (cos
              want to change course) both time i got into both nus and ntu, cos i
              sent both(i sent to related course).....and if every one in
              singapore can get into local uni so easily den i must as well throw
              my ntu cert away. worth less.... and seriously even i got my cert
              of merit in poly, and i compare the work load of poly and uni, my
              uni course is seriously more den poly.... in poly i can just
              studyÂ one day before the exam and get A and above, in uni i do
              this i die like shit.....Â </p>

              I don't know how's the system is like now. During my time, poly grads are not allowed to apply for any uni course which is not related to the course they study in poly. They have a list that says which are the courses in which your diploma is eligible for. Therefore, a poly grad would have about 2 or 3 choices at most.
              
              Yes, I do agree that the workload in uni is many times more than poly. You need to work hard consistently in order to score good grades or even just to pass. Even if the uni were to increase intake, I don't see that their degree become worthless as after all, those who don't work hard will not graduate and obtain the cert either.

              Yeah that's 100% right. Sometimes we come across advertisements in newspaper that some unknown universities accept students with just O'levels qualifications which is very ridicious. There are also some that allows you to jump straight to Masters or PhD. All these are possible just because they want money. On the other hand, recognised overseas universities accept poly grads into final year because they have collabrations with our local polytechnics. They will do a thorough analysis of the modules taught in the polytechnics and exempt the student accordingly. If I'm not wrong, the school of nursing in NYP was set up by staff from the Uni of Sydney and the syllabus are similar to those taught in the foundation years in the university. That is why the graduates from this nursing school can go direct to final year when they enrol in this university.
