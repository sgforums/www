              Hi ultimaonline, thank you for taking your time to reply, really appreciate it.
                              I have a few o level questions to ask.
                              1) what are the difference between addition and condensation polymerisation?
                              Can i state addition produces polymers that have the same empirical formula as the monomer itself whereas condensation does not? I am very certain about the other 2 differences.,
                  
                  
                              
                              2) why do isomers(with the same molecular formula) have different enthalpies change of combustion(heat energy generated from combustion)?
                              can i state because they have different physical properties(melting and boiling point), therefore different amount of heat energy is absorbed and produced during bond breaking of reactants and bond making of products, therefore enthalpy change is different? 
                              
              
              
                              3) why do alcohols with increasing carbon atoms produce more heat energy during combustion?
                              Because larger volume of co2 and h2o are produced, therefore more heat energy is released during bond making....?

              Sure no prob.<br><br>
              
              Q1. Yes, that's correct.
              <br><br>
              Q2. No, that's not quite correct (you stated two facts correctly, but there's no direct link between them, or the link is indirect and tenuous at best). Different isomers (eg. structural, functional group, geometric, etc) have different thermodynamic stabilities and hence possess different potential enthalpies, and therefore their combustion enthalpies (ie. magnitude of enthalpy difference between the isomers, and the combustion products) are different. A good example at A levels would be terminal alkenes vs internal alkenes (internal alkenes have greater number of stronger C-C sigma bonds with the higher % s orbital character), or cis alkenes vs trans alkenes (cis alkenes have greater steric van der Waals strain or repulsion between bulky alkyl groups on same side of the double bond). At O levels this question shouldn't, and wouldn't, be asked by Cambridge at all. Whoever asks this question at O levels (eg. school prelim paper, Cambridge, etc) should be shot, as the correct answer requires a minimum of A level Chemistry.
              <br><br>
              Q3. Correct, per unit volume of the fuel, there is a greater number of C and H atoms, and hence greater number of C and H atoms oxidized (exothermically via combustion) to CO2 and H2O, and concordantly, larger amount of heat released during combustion. An additional secondary effect, results from having stronger van der Waals attractions between molecules with larger number of atoms, allowing for closer packing of the molecules, ie. increasing density of fuel, hence resulting in greater number of fuel molecules per unit volume.

              <p>To answer Q2</p>
              <p>Just to add,(though it's A level requirement) I am quite uncomfortable mentioning enthalpy change of combustion (as the definition of enthalpy change of combustion is the energy change when 1 mole of an reactant is completely combusted in excess oxygen [if we mention standard enthalpy change of combustion it's at standard conditions of 298K, 1 atm])</p>
              <p>For isomers (since TS mentioned same molecular formulae, I will assume it's referring to structural isomers - rather than geometric isomers), there can be a case when enthalpy change of combustion maybe different:</p>
              <p>E.g.</p>
              <p>C3H6O2 can refer to either ethylmethanoate (CH3CH2OCOH) or propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH). When 1 mole of either compound completely combusted in oxygen, there will be 3 mole of CO2 and 3 mole of H2O</p>
              <p>Equations will be as follows</p>
              <p>CH3CH2OCOH + 7/2O2 --&gt; 3 CO2 + 3 H2O  (equation A) </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">CH3CH2COOH</span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> + 7/2O2 --&gt; 3 CO2 + 3 H2O  (equation B)</span></p>
              <p>Using Bond energies to derive enthalpy changes of equation A &amp; B</p>
              <p>Enthalpy change of equation A is </p>
              <p>= bond energy of reactants - bond energy of products</p>
              <p>= [6 C-H + 1 C=C + 2 C - O + 1 C = O + 7/2 O = O] - [6 C = O + 6 O - H]</p>
              <p>= 6006 - 7200</p>
              <p>= -1194KJ/mol</p>
              <p>Enthalpy change of equation B is </p>
              <p>= <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> bond energy of reactants - bond energy of products</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">= [5 C-H + 2 C-C + 1 C - O + 1 C = O + 1 O - H + 7/2 O = O] - [6 C = O + 6 O - H]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">= 6064 - 7200</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">= -1136 KJ/mol</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Hence, enthalpy change of combustion of ethylmethanoate is higher than enthalpy change of combustion of propanoic acid (theorectical - need to be verified by bomb calorimetric results / experimental readings) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">In conclusion, enthalpy change of combustion may be different for structural isomers BUT for geometric isomer do refer to UltimaOnline answer </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">NOTE: The above is A level Chemistry already, it will be very out of syllabus for O level </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">P.S: UltimaOnline, if there are errors in my explanation above do point it out, thanks :) Too long never touch Chemistry cause in NS ... </p>

              Yes, good additional points on varying combustion enthalpies of structural isomerism by SBS n SMRT (aren't you in Uni now? which course? if chemistry related, then any 'NS effect' would already have worn off, yah?)<br><br>
              Basic idea is to draw an energy profile diagram with y-axis as energy/enthalpy level. Near the top would be the elements, near the bottom would be the combustion products, and in the middle (with varying energy/enthalpy levels and thermodynamic stabilities) would be the different isomers. By Hess Law, overall (formation + combustion) enthalpy would be the same. But if the isomer is less stable = more energy, its formation enthalpy would be less exothermic but its combustion enthalpy would be more exothermic; if the isomer is more stable = less energy, its formation enthalpy would be more exothermic but its combustion enthalpy would be less exothermic. Examples would be (as I mentioned earlier) internal vs terminal alkenes, and cis vs trans alkenes.

              I'm an A level expert, not an O level expert, but to be frank, it doesn't look like you'll get any marks for both questions. Or at most 1 mark (for both questions combined), if Cambridge is lenient. It's actually also costly to recycle metarials, but we need to do so, because non-renewable resources are rapidly being depleted from the earth, leaving insufficient resources for future generations. Incomplete combustion results in the production of carbon monoxide, which is directly toxic to humans, as well as soot, which contributes to haze pollution, etc.

              Omg... the isomer question came out for this year o level pure chem paper.... and it is of a level standard???? 
              
              These are some questions from this year paper... please help me see whether my answer is good enough.
              
              What are the similarities and  differences between diamond and graphite in terms of structure and bonding(4 marks)?
              1)diamond and graphite have giant molecular structures with strong covalent bonds within the atoms
              2)diamond have a tetrahedral structure with strong covalent bonds whereas geaphite has a hexagonal structure with weak van der waals forces between the layer of hexagonal layers
              3)diamond cannot conduct electricity, due to its tetrahedral strucutre, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to 4 other carbon atoms, therefore there are no delocalised electrions.
              graphite is covalently bonded to 3 other carbon atoms, therefore it has delocalised electrons.
              
              why are the burning of alchols an exothermic reaction(3 marks)?
              Heat energy is absorbed by reactants to break the covalent bonds between the reactant molecules and particles. Heat energy is released by the products in forming covalent bonds between the co2 and h2o molecules. There is a net release of heat energy of the ptoducts as the heat energy released by products is greater than the heat energy absorbed by the reactants, enthalpy change is negative

              <br><br>Well if you're an excellent O level student (as you sound to be), you then have the capability to moonlight (ie. earn some cash on the side) as an O level tutor, perhaps when you're in a JC or Uni. Feel free to continue posting your Chemistry questions here if/when you go on to study Chemistry in a JC.

              It's actually also costly to recycle metarials, but we need to do
              so, because non-renewable resources are rapidly being depleted from
              the earth, leaving insufficient resources for future generations.
