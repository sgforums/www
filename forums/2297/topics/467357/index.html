              <p>Hi. Im currently a jc2 student struggling with my academic badly. I got promoted last year by mere luck because my whole cohort did badly. Im now caught in the dilemma between whether to transfer to poly or just hang on and continue with jc. I dont wanna continue with jc because its really very stressful for me and my promo results was DDE/E for 3 h2s and h. my gp got a S grade. I admit i had no motivation to study and till now still no motivation. </p>
              <p>I wonder if poly will be a better route for me because i prefer hand-on stuff and projects, and im kinda interested . However, i know jc will get into uni easier. But then again, if i were to appeal to retain after my common test, im not sure whether i can handle all the "looks" from my friends and whether i will still strive hard. By the way, one reason that i dont wanna appeal to retain because my jc school is quite a distance away from my house. </p>
              <p>Another thing that is bothering me is the cost of poly/uni. im from a low-income family. I am considering.. if i take a level, i will work for a year before taking uni. or just finish my education with a diploma and start working (but i know the pay wont be as high as a degree graduate). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can someone give me a wise advise please? i really need opinions. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>rate your school paper a compare to A lvl, if its way harder den u may have a gd chance in A lvl, if not just go for poly.GP grade is also very impt for university entry. dont worry about poly cost as i m a student now in diploma n its very heavily subsidies and there are bursary and scholarship that will help you pay promptly. poly at most u pay 1k per year while university u need to pay around 7k/yr but you only require to pay only after you graduate. make a decision to learn and study because u gain something out of it and not how other view u. i used to be trap by this stigma, but i have since cross it. i was once in jc den i went to a private university before i head to a poly. long path but you can do it.

              <p>I was in the same situation as you previously - I advanced to JC2 despite my lousy grades (I got USE/E). However in JC2, I worked really hard so in the end I was able to achieve decent A level results. I</p>
              <p>In your case, you said that you still do not have motivation to study, even though you are already in JC2 (and it's March). If that is so, I personally think that you should not waste any more time in JC. However you need to think very carefully before deciding to drop out of JC. You still have more than 6 months to A's, you can choose to put in your best efforts and attempt the A levels, instead of wasting more time.</p>
              <p>I don't think you should appeal to retain. If you do not feel motivated to study at all, there is no point in repeating a year. You can consider going poly, but if you're not going to work hard, you don't even need to think about Uni admission.</p>
              <p>Because I'm from a low income family as well, I can understand your worries with regards to the costs of poly and uni. I will advise you to fight for a place in the local Uni by working hard for A's - that is the easiest path to go. Ideally, you should be focused and be very sure that studies is one of your priorities. If you really find JC very stressful, to the extent where you can't feel motivated, then poly could be a better choice. That said, I'm not saying that poly isn't stressful, but if you aim to graduate with a diploma &amp; start working, poly could work for you.</p>

              <p>hi guys, thanks for the opinions, really appreciated them. but im still unsure of what to do. i know with hard work i can get a decent result for a level but i really have no motivation.. furthermore, being in a neighbourhood jc demoralize me even further because my jc a level results aint very good as compared to those prestigious jc. and im in a science stream with 3 heavy h2 content physics chem math. and my gp have been failing all the way. </p>
              <p>If i continue with jc, how can i find the motivation? </p>

              <p>yes, you can get a bank loan (interest free during the 4 years of uni) for uni fees, and only start repaying the bank loan upon graduation.</p>
              <p>Typically it would take a grad about 4~5 years to complete payment.</p>

              <p>The bank loan will only cover up till 90% maximum. Which means you still have to pay 10% every semester. That is no small amount either, but fairly easy to cope with if one works part-time (e.g tuition).</p>
