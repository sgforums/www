              <p>Are you asking people to do the homework for you ?</p>
              <p>The double entries for the above transactions are very straightforward and easy.</p>
              <p>Just use the CALER method to do the double entries.</p>
              <p>For the 1st transaction to start business with cash,</p>
              <p>Cash is asset and the cash is contributed by the owner ie Capital.</p>
              <p>So, debit cash account and credit capital account.</p>
