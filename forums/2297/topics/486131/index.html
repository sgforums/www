              <p>this is an interesting topic as  I can relate to this.</p>
              <p>More than 15 years ago, I have no clue what  I want out of life, what I will become and definitely not the cut out material to study. Why  I did it ? Because all my friends did it ,simple as that.</p>
              <p>Then I went to the Army and fell in love with hitting the gym. I found a buddy and we worked hard together to build our "perfect body". I was passionate and obsessed in in , training about 4 x a week.</p>
              <p>One day, I was talking to him and he said this to me; I see you are not very happy in your job but when you are here (the gym) you are a totally different animal. You know, if you upgrade yourself by taking a part-time degree, you could up your salary, increase your chance to look for better jobs.</p>
              <p>That piece of advice was worst than my last heavy rep and it hit me hard. I think about what he said over the weeks. And  I took his advice to complete my part-time degree at a private University for 18 months. It was very tough as I had to rush off from work to attend lectures at night, sometime stay till 12 midnite to complete assignments.</p>
              <p>But what he said was true! I did leave my job upon receiving my transcript and indeed it open many doors for me. Ironically, for someone who did not ace in school is now actually an educator in the Uni. </p>
              <p>Of course, time have changed and the teenagers these days are so much smarter, brighter, tech savvy than my time.  To take up the degree or not , it depends on the person goals in life.</p>
              <p>1. What is your expectation from achieving this degree?</p>
              <p>2. Why are you doing it ? Parents pressure, peers influence or is just the way it is ?</p>
              <p>3. Understand what is your strength** (cant emphasize enough of this)</p>
              <p>I would advise going to take a course on something you truly like than to follow what others said. </p>
              <p>Look at your hobbies, interest, how friends describe you, your part-time works, internships if any, etc. These are tell-tale signs. </p>
              <p>When you know what you really want then taking the next step (be it a degree or not) is one of the many options to choose.</p>
              <p>All the best !</p>

              <p>I got my degree for the sake of a degree. Studied something I wasn't REALLY interested in. But I got to say its a safe choice. Didnt regret it.</p>
              <p>Even if you want to do something else in life, u need money/capital. A degree can help you save up faster because the pay is simply higher. And even if you fail at what you wanted to do, at least you got a degree to consider other options.</p>
              <p>What I'm saying is, keep doors open for more options. Unless you are already extremely sure what you want and will not consider doing anything else.</p>

              <p>Explore for other interests if you are at loss of what you want in life. Or venture further and find out more about the courses you are interested in such as the job prospect, the rigidity of the study schedule if you plan on taking, and the content of the study materials! It doesn't matter if u have a degree for the sake of it or for own interest. What matters most is that you know you have gotten what you hope to have. And by that, it could be things such as wage/money, academic achievements, social standing in the company or solely just interest. </p>
              <p>If you plan on staying on in the company, it's good if you explore on the job opportunities that they can offer you with if u attain a degree. Or even better, training courses if you are fine with it! </p>
              <p>Lastly, most important of all (if you are very vey determined to get the degree) is that you have the patience and perseverance to finish the entire course of study! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best!! </p>
