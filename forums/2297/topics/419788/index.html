              kind of lost now... I need some advice / wisdom / guidance for my future
              study...I’m 19 this year, I just completed a 2 years NITEC courses
              (info-communication technology) and got a GPA of 2.9 (I know the points are not
              enough to get into poly as NITEC to POLY require at least &lt;3.5 GPA. but i
              still want to apply for poly (no harm in trying).  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt; line-height: normal; background: white;"><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: black;'>The problem is I use to
              have interest in culinary and IT. so I stated my choice for ITE.. 1st
              and 2nd as culinary courses, 3rd as info-communication tech (which I had
              interest in and so i got in the 3rd choice.. sigh)... anyway i was from
              normal tech..(Some may think why I didn't study hard and get into normal acad?)
              The fact is i did, and got a chance to normal acad but I rejected it due to I’m
              weak in chinese compo..(Made the biggest mistake) I hope it not too late to
              start planning my study now..</span></p>

              student is compulsory to take related courses in higher NITEC courses /
              polytechnic. But I had lost my interest and passion on IT stuffs. i know i can
              go higher NITEC for sure but i had lost interest on IT and it another 2 years
              courses..I need to serve NS for 2years too..so if i really take higher NITEC. By
              the time I completed poly I will be 25 years old.. </span></p>

              <p>Don't worry, you won't get a bad as me.</p>
              <p>22yo, O Level cert.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>From your post, your passion seems to be in the culinary and cooking area.</p>
              <p>Option 1) this seems viable. what if your passion for cooking is lost after two years of NS?</p>
              <p>Option 2) This option seems good. Do take note JAE student gets priority placement. You need to get extremely good grades for your O Level before they even consider offering you place. You can make use of Homework Forum because you have found the place where experts are hiding here.</p>
              <p>Option 3) Most likely you will be promoted to higher nitec. You will be back to doing IT stuff which doesn't interest you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know about you. Usually people come online is to seek alternative opinion, or just want to hear some reassurance. My opinion is.... Get promoted to higher nitec, Study go Poly, then go NS.</p>
              <p>If you can prove to me that you have great determination in scoring 10points in O Level (It is highly possible for people with great determination and conviction), then I will say go this route. Private O --&gt; Poly -- &gt;NS. This route open more door to you. You may get into the course that you like if your results are good.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if you like to get some insurance... choose the third choice. If you failed to get to poly, at least you are back to high nitec. :) I am sure you can apply what you have learn. This is safest, less advanturous.</p>

              <p>gunner : thanks for the advice =D<br><br>Darkness :  hmmm... what you said is true.. i might lost my passion for cooking after 2 years of NS.. and more door will be open for O level student... but what if i fail O level? i just wasting my parent money.. anyway private O is $7k as my friend's friend is taking private O</p>
              <p>maybe i should take your advice. get promote to higher nitec , complete NS then go poly.. as i left 1 time deferment for NS, so if get promoted to higher nitec.. i must go NS.. then continue my study in poly.. and higher nitec get to choose any courses include nor-related courses in poly. 4 years ( 2 yrs higher nitec + 2 yrs NS) later i might lost interest in cooking.. and able to choose other courses which i my passion is... <br><br>but don't you feel weird? imagine you in poly.. your surrounding is 17 / 18++ yrs old and you are 23 yrs old....and maybe having hard time just to get along with them..<br><br>anyway thanks for your advice and i appreciate it alot..<br></p>

              <p>My classmates from Poly..  1 or 2 are from ITE. The age gap is not a disadvantage. We see it as experience advantage.</p>
              <p>Indeed, those from ITE went on to Poly, then have much more experience. Those 17/18 kids are nerds! o.O"</p>

              <p>If you want to take Higher Nitec, make sure you can score well for practical, or work to gain more experience, then take O levels. Either this if not you can man man lai for Poly also won't mind.</p>
