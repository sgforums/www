              <p>If you feel like a fish out of water, you can apply for admissions into a Polytechnic. You may contact the Polytechnic's admissions department to enquire.

              <p>I understand that the environment at MI may not be condusive for
              learning, especially in Science courses.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this question: "Do you want to go to a
              University?"</p>
              <p>By the fact that you come to MI, it means that you want to go to
              a University. So, it's definitely yes.</p>
              <p>Stay on in MI, and go for private tuition at tuition centre.
              Because more places in NUS/NTU/SMU are given to A level holders
              than Diploma holders. Although MI environment may not be conducive
              for learning, you can go for private tuition at tuition centre at
              night or during weekends, where the environment is definitely
              condusive. If your O Level L1R5 is eligible for JC, you can apply
              to JC during next year JAE.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is not as simple as "Do you want to go to a University?" Many diploma holders do indeed go to a University, whether or not straight after their diploma or midway through their careers.</p>
              <p>First, lets examine why you are in MI, so what maybe you can understand the choices you made better, is it because you die die want to do A levels but couldn't get into any JC? Or was it by choice, you could go into a JC but you wanted 3 years to prepare for your As?</p>
              <p>To answer your question, yes you can, but I believe the academic year for polytechnics have already started and it is too late to join this year. I suggest you apply for next year's intake, and also stay in MI until the end of the year (unless you really cannot tahan).</p>

              <p>Advice: do not let anyone in MI know that you are contemplating whether to stay on or transfer. VP Azman has zero tolerance on this; he will ask you to leave.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>I recommend that you stay on and give it a try. Go for private tuition at tuition centre. Be interested in wanting to pursue the A levels. Feel hungry for A levels. At the end of the year if you really cannot promote or advance to second year, then you consider Poly route.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>If you need motivation besides the fact that NUS/NTU/SMU got more places for A level holders, here's another one: Money. A level route is much cheaper than Diploma route, even with private tuition and outside resources.</p>

              <p>Actually I kinda only joined because i wanted to give it a try, but when I had wanted to appeal, someone told me it was too late so I gave up. But now since Im kinda desperate, I just trying to appeal again. </p>

              <p>Come on. You chose to come to MI study A levels.</p>
                                          <p> </p>
                                      <p>I feel that the problem is because your A level is next year and the year after, not this year, that you all have so much time to think of other things besides A levels, that you all wander off, and slack.</p>
                                      <p>I know promo one is after June holidays la, but, it is hard to learn everything during the june holidays.</p>
                                      <p>Once again, if you find it hard to understand what is taught in class, you may want to go for private tuition at tuition centre. (Do not worry about yours is three years while theirs is two years. JC got people repeat, and still spend three years. So, it's the same la.)</p>
              <p>Anyway, no matter what, next year try to go year two. Whether is it promote, advance or retain. If retain, appeal. because stay back one year very waste time, might as well change course study diploma. Anyway, give it a try and see how it goes. If I remember correctly, it's minimum 1 h2 and 2 h1 pass then can go year two. All the best.</p>

                      <p>It's about having priorities.</p>
                              <p>Know what you want.</p>
                              <p>Know when to do what.</p>

                                 <p>The children in Africa mostly do not have the opportunity to go to school. You have the opportunity to go to school, to take the A levels. Please appreciate what you have and cherish it.</p>
                              
                               <p>I am sure you know of people who are top scorers for O level. They are not active on social media, or do not use social media at all. What do you think they do most of the time? Study.</p>
                              <p> </p>

                                                  <p>Anyway, I already gave advance notice that I am going to stop. Now is the time.</p>
