              <p>Hi, I'm 15 this year taking O level next year. As stated in the tittle. I am wondering if I should drop to combined science? Basically I am taking Pure chemistry and Pure physics right now. Since my school don't offer Pure biology and I have a huge interest in bio, I take pure biology as my additional subject. So I am doing TRIPLE PURE SCIENCES. To give a back ground information, I never pass chemistry and physics more than ONCE in the whole of my Sec 3 life in 2013 . I have been failing and failing and failing miserably, I kept on getting F9. On the other hand, I have been ace-ing my Pure Biology. I feel sick, tired and demoralized of seeing the failure I have for Chemistry and Physics. So today was the day where we have to go back to our school to take back our papers and results from our EOY and yes, I fail Pure Chem and Physics AGAIN, DOUBLE F9 some more...</p>
              <p>So, I went to talk to my teacher about dropping to combined sciences, he asked me which post-secondary plan I want which is Poly or JC? </p>
              <p>I said "Poly." Then he asked which kind of course I will mostly likely to take.</p>
              <p>I said " Since I love biology, I would do courses that are biology related like biomedical or Life Sciences like human body and plants. " But my teacher told be that if I want to do biology courses in poly most likely I will need Pure Chemistry and Pure Physics so that they will accept me in the course. </p>
              <p>Soooo, can anyone give me any advise? Can somebody tell me the criteria I need if I want to do biology related course in poly?  Is it a must to have Triple Pure science for the biology courses in Poly or combined science plus Pure Biology is already sufficient? </p>
              <p>I don't know what to do, I am afraid if I carry Pure sciences I'm afraid I can't handle the stress but first I need to know the criteria I need in the future. </p>
              <p>Your advise is greatly appreciate :)</p>

              <p>no need pure. combined phy/chem is fine</p>
              <p>min. C6</p>
              <p>but of cos u not just going to aim C6 right?</p>

              </p><p style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;">Drop the subject if you:1.do not do well in it and receive teacher's recommendation 2.cannot cope with the academic workload 3.not relevant with your Jc/poly requirements.4.You know that even by putting a lot of effort and seeking teacher's consultation,you just can't understand the concept.</p>
              <div><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Biomedical science is L1R4:9. Life sciences will be slightly higher,hovering around 11-12. Triple science not compulsory for Biomed and life sciences.I suggest you consider the above options carefully first,before dropping to combined phy/chem or take double pure if your weakness is time-management for studying. Double pure should be pure bio/chem as it is most relevant with life sciences.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I can understand the stress you have when you fail one or more subjects,even more if it is consecutive.To get rid of this problem, perservere&gt;(nah) Instead of hard work,I suggest looking through your mistakes again from your exam scripts or let your phy/chem teacher analyse your script.If the common problems are concepts,it means that you can try this:put the textbook at your left hand side of the table,followed by the exam script.Cover the mcq answer, and redo the mcq questions.Each time you can't solve it,refer to the textbook. If you still can't solve with the textbook and it's a basic question which involves understanding,I suggest you consider to drop the subject.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/oh.png" alt="oh.png"></div>
