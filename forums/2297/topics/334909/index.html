              <p>Nope. Good mood coz my only EM only student lost at most 15 marks. 6 marks lost for sure but we assumed another 9 marks of carelessness for a girl who is very careful. And weirdly paper 1 is her weakness. ;)</p>
              <p>Next time I talk to prospective students by phone must be very clear I teach only AM+EM students. Else I will be bored to death again. It is a torture watching students do factorising and simplifying just for the sake of proficiency.</p>

              <p>By the way, don't share the location of the solutions with non forumers before thurs. I only share here coz this is a SMALL forum. I frequent HWZ more and I never say anything there coz it is too big. <br><br>You share the solutions and if a lot of tutors know the question types asked in detail already, They will be able to predict exactly what will come out in paper 2. Then you get a lot of people mugging only the correct questions types. 100 students study correct is no big deal but if 1000 study correctly... then there will be an effect. So don't share please.</p>
              <p>If you don't know what came out in paper 1, you can predict only 50%. With info on paper 1, you can predict 90%.</p>

              <p>For expert players (A Maths students) with more tools at their disposal and double the experience, of coz can mentally react to whatever happen. But for a novice player ( E Maths only students), then being warned exactly of what will happen will be necessary because they are very nervous (due to lower aptitude for Maths). Having switched my students from individual to group in the final month, I nastily told my AM students that I rather pray they have the wrong answer when they and my EM only student having the wrong one.</p>
              <p>And your teacher's list is 20+ questions one right? My list is only 9 questions. I only list confirm will come out one. The final one which I can't predict they ownself react. They just get 8 out of the 9 listed questions correct then my  guarantee of minimum B3 is safe liao. Arbo wait I have to refund $2000-4000 how? I never refund before and don't intend to.</p>
              <p>And you don't need the old Mathc C papers lah, the H2 maths so damned easy nowadays. I only don't dare tutor H2 maths coz wait they apply for H3 maths then the head pain liao.</p>

              <p>None of them had any problem with that. In fact, they offered to write me recommendations on my website but I say no thanks. I just want to have a scanned picture of their results slips . So if they do not have a problem with doing what I ask of them... who am I being unethical to?</p>
              <p>I am absolutely ethnical. I insisted on teaching proper logics according to the aims of the syllabus when I could shave plenty of time  and have increased success rate by teaching brainless methods.<br><br>I would be unethical if I were to reveal to others what are the questions which will come out when their efforts gave me a clear picture of what will come out. Which I didn't explicitly.</p>
              <p>Everyone lost less than 10 marks except a girl who lost 15 marks at most. And that girl happened to be assigned "Qn 26 onwards" (guess why I assigned Qn 26 onwards to her?).  Oh btw, confirmed loss for her is only 6 marks and we just assumed she was careless in answers which she can't recall and that all were wrong.</p>
              <p>So bite me. Wanna to flame me also can. I am very free until Wednesday afternoon.</p>

              <p>For expert players (A Maths students) with more tools at their
              disposal and double the experience, of coz can mentally react to
              whatever happen. But for a novice player ( E Maths only students),
              then being warned exactly of what will happen will be necessary
              because they are very nervous (due to lower aptitude for Maths).
              Having switched my students from individual to group in the final
              month, I nastily told my AM students that I rather pray they have
              the wrong answer when they and my EM only student having the wrong
              one.</p>
              <p>And your teacher's list is 20+ questions one right? My list is
              only 9 questions. I only list confirm will come out one. The final
              one which I can't predict they ownself react. They just get 8 out
              of the 9 listed questions correct then my guarantee of minimum B3
              is safe liao. Arbo wait I have to refund $2000-4000 how? I never
              refund before and don't intend to.</p>
              <p>And you don't need the old Mathc C papers lah, the H2 maths so
              damned easy nowadays. I only don't dare tutor H2 maths coz wait
              they apply for H3 maths then the head pain liao.</p>

              <p>Haha... I never give guarantees, but so far, my worst case for physics was B3 and E maths A2, A maths A1 :(</p>
              <p>The B3 was because the student was really lazy... and only started to work a bit more nearer to end of year... At least from C6 to B3... still can la...</p>
              <p>Actually I don't know how h3 maths is like... Would be interesting... do you have any papers? And for H3 physics as well? Cuz I wan to start tutoring H2 physics, and hv to prepare if any of them go for H3.</p>

              <p>Aiyo dun worry lah. No matter what... it is impossible to get less than B3 for A/E maths one lah. Once a week 2hrs tuition is already too much already. Give guarantees to make sure that those fly-by-night tutors got no students. Would be good for the pool of responsible tutors who have to deal with those cut price scammers. All responsible tutors offer guarantees then there will be no rooms for liars.</p>
              <p>No, don't have H3 material, only have H2 materials to make sure I am teaching my O level students in the appropriate manner.</p>

              </p><p>Here is an unpublished article from my website for you to laugh at... sibei heng I thought better of publishing it on the off chance that it finally come out... which it did hahaha</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Once again, I see this type of logarithm questions asked in school examinations...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>log<sub>3</sub>x-log<sub>3</sub>27=log<sub>x</sub>9</p>
              <p>Which make me so glad that I always touch on the approach to such questions despite it never having occured before in the past 30 years in the O levels.</p>
              <p>Seriously, this type of questions stand a 0.1% chance of coming out so I always wonder why it is almost sure to come out in school examinations.</p>
              <p>One may argue it is good for thinking but if you want thinking... think up something innovative please.</p>
              <p>Almost every year, I am impressed by the way the O level throw up something new which teachers and tutors will not be able to predict and thus drill their students for. Which is why I never try to predict the unique questions and don't spend thing drilling my students on 101 type of unlikely questions. For unique and/or tough questions... it is better to work on the reasoning ability of the students and just hope that the question will be one that they can reason their way through.</p>
              <p>It make me very very glad that there has never been a single year that the O level have threw up more than 2 such questions as invariably I am bound to have one or two students who will get a B3 under the best of situations and 2 of such questions may throw them into the C region if they panick.</p>
