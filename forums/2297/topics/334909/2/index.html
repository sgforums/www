              <p>Eh don't tell Singnet but I host it on my 10Mbps Singnet ADSL line with upload of 1Mbps.</p>
              <p>Equipment</p>
              <p>Shuttle K45 with Intel E2160/250GB HDD/Ubuntu OS/Apache/Joomla! CMS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However tickering with linux is a hobby so I don't expect you to want to go my route.<br><br>So I'll tell you what I will do if I am not hosting my own server.</p>
              <p>Domain name registration is cheap USD6.99 per year each.</p>
              <p>Shared hosting is usually very bad with slow performance of dynamic websites but dedicated hosting is too expensive. I recently tried to switch my website to a Singapore host but testing a trial website show slow loading and lotta problems. Right now the only Singapore hosting I would trust and the cost is not too hefty is Orynet Networks at www.on.com.sg at S$10/month.</p>
              <p>As for the look of the website and maintaining it, you would want to look at Joomla!, Drupal or Moodles.  These are free opensource Content Management Software which create how your website look like and adding pages. You administrate your website by going to say http://www.weewee.com/administrator to log into your backend where you can change the look of your website by adding templates( prebuilt website formats), add toys like countdowns by adding plugins, edit and publish new pages. All these are easily done with a few clicks. Your webhost will usually offer to preinstall Joomla! or Drupal for free for you should you need it.</p>
              <p>However, Joomla and Drupal are general CMS and it can be difficult to input maths symbols ( I use jpg or pdf files instead). Moodles on the other hand is designed for educational website and is more suitable for mathematical websites... but it does not look as slick.</p>
              <p>You can probably break even or even make a tiny profit if you use Google AdSense to put advertising on your website. My income from Ads is 6USD this month. That would pay for your hosting and a bowl of laksa. :P</p>
              <p>Adding forums and other features in Joomla! is very easy. Just click click click.</p>
              <p>Adding articles is just like posting a reply in this forum.</p>
              <p>The time consuming problem would be search engine optimisation.</p>
              <p>Should you want to play around with Joomla and webhosting and domain names. I have a few unused domain names (to take advantage of hosting discounts) on a hosting account for you to play with.</p>
              <p>mathsforum.info olevel.info sgtuition.info sgmathsforum.com</p>
              <p>These are hosted on a netfirm hosting plan which cost USD10/yr for the 1st year but the performance is rubbish... but good as a testing platform.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">For a proper self maintained website hosted on a decent Singapore webhost, it would cost around S$150 per year with a 20GB cap on traffic per month</span>.</p>
              <p>To decide if you are comfortable with maintaining your own website using a CMS, just email me at mikethm at yahoo dot com for the password  to manage http://www.sgmathsforum.com/.</p>

              <p>or to reduce the hassle of setting up a CMS (or paying $10 for webhosting a month), can use blogspot... just cannot set up forums like what joomla</p>
              <p>you can even get a domain name (of cuz pay one lah) and point it to blogspot for free hosting, and with your own domain name</p>

              <p>eagle you don't want to use blogspot really. wee is using freewebs at the moment, he has a forum and lotta articles. and buyers of his TYS who type in his url and yet his alexa ranking on Singapore traffic</p>
              <p>www.freewebs.com/weew/index.htm 39,458</p>
              <p> www.exampaper.com.sg 4160</p>
              <p>www.$ingaporeolevelmaths.com  6207</p>
              <p>examworld.blogspot.com 50,223</p>
              <p>is far behind Miss Loi's website (4160). Lose to Miss Loi nothing to complain about coz she is good at marketing and in my opinion has a real product... but there is a website called singapore o level maths dot com on which I should have no comments. which rank just behind Ms Loi just coz of a nice domain name. The domain name matters.</p>
              <p>Actually Joomla! is good for maths too... provided that  you know either Tex which  {tex}$\frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2  - 4ac} }}{{2a}}${/tex} or know MathType which can translate into Tex... meaning you can type equations into your webpages easily like<a href="http://www.maths-tuition.com/gce-o-level-maths-tuition-info-for-students/75-sport.html"> this</a>.</p>

              <p>Squat finish all the domains (.com, .info, .org, .com.sg, etc), then suddenly you realise I decide to change name or register as exam-world...</p>
              <p>actually examworld.com is taken... in may 03, expires may 09, but doesn't matter to me<br><br>:D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lazy to learn Joomla at the moment... Or you want to help me set up :D</p>
              <p>See how first ba... Me still got full-time work to think about on top of tuition</p>
              <p>Might consider changing to joomla or wordpress and get a hosting this december.... <br>Either that or get a domain name, but continue to use blogspot as the CMS</p>
              <p>FYI, I just checked that alexa ranking for weews is <span class="geo_number descbold"><span class="cb3f">36</span><span class="c6af">,0</span>4<span class="c92e">1 while it is now 36,018 for examworld :D<br></span></span></p>
