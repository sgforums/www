              <p>Hey guys, I got my O level results today (like everyone else) and I'm having a little bit of a crisis - I can't decide which poly to go to.<strong> NYP or TP</strong>.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty keen on the Visual Communication course on the two polys, and I got 8 points (after deducting CCA point).</p>
              <p>I am determined not to go on the JC path. x)</p>
              <p>I missed my chance to go to the NYP open house, but I've been to the TP open house, and me and my friends had a fairly good time there. So while I do have an inkling of what it's like at TP, I know nothing much about NYP.</p>
              <p>I really like TP, but distance-wise, NYP would be preferred, since I live in Yishun. Plus, I have a cousin studying in NYP, so I guess she could help me with stuff there.</p>
              <p>Regardless, I'd like to have a third opinion. TP or NYP??? Thanks!</p>

              <p>You might want to consider the School of Film and Media Studies in Ngee Ann Poly. The FMS in NP is well known for creating many creative intellectuals. They have four courses, Advertising and Public Relations(which I am in, and it is also a new course), Mass Communications, DVFX and Film Sound and Video.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For sure, Advertising and Public Relations and Mass Comm have Visual Communications. In fact, as I am typing now, I am in my Visual Comm lesson <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Distance shouldn't be a problem. NP is at Clementi Road(just off Bukit Timah) and I live in Tampines, and I also have friends who stay at Yishun. Trust me, Visual Communication module thru Advertising and Public Relations/Mass Comm is very fruitful.</p>

              <p>Congrats on such great results! Any poly would be thrilled to have you on board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some other points for you think about:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a high-achiever, consider a course with a lower cut-off point. I think the VSC course in TP has a lower cut-off than NYP, last year it was 14. Not sure what the NYP cut-off is. Not that TP is better than NYP but with a lower cut-off the cohort would be closer to you in terms of aptitude and ability and in this case, would be more stimulating and challenging for you in the long run. Ooh, am I gonna get flamed for this?? Sorry, just my personal opinion! ;-p</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Distance aside, I would choose the course that offers you the most scope and potential. Something that stretches you and your talent and offers you many open doors to get to the next step. Not all design courses are created equal, not all courses have the same reputation in the eyes of industry and universities (especially if you are thinking of furthering your studies overseas) so you really need to also look beyond the course curriculum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TP VSC was started out of the old Baharuddin VI and its been around for many many years. It's had lots of time to build a very solid reputation in the eyes of industry and unis. The fact that the TP Design students sweep the annual Crowbars every year is testimony to the fact that industry holds their work in high esteem. Several of today's top Creative Directors and Art Directors graduated from TP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So IMO you gotta look at reputation as well. While I agree distance is something to think about, it should not be the key deciding factor.</p>
