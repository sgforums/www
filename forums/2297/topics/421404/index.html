              <p>I'm eligible for 4H2 but I was thinking of taking 3H2 + 1H1 and trying out for 1 H3 as I heard that it is as good as 4H2. Is that true?</p>
              <p>However, if I do take 4H2 and for example got 3 As and 1 B, won't the subject which I have gotten a B be converted to H1? What if the converted subject is necessary as a H2 pre-requisite for a university course? Can't I just have AAB/A?</p>

              <p>There is no right or wrong decision. As with everything in life, there are pros and cons either way.</p>
              <p>But on a practical note, taking 4H2s make more sense than taking 3H2s + 1H1 + 1H3.</p>
              <p>Why? Because H3 subjects are not used for computing your University application score.</p>
              <p>And yes, if you take 4H2s you can 'downgrade' your lousiest H2 subject to a H1 subject when computing your University application score</p>
              <p>Don't worry about "What if the converted subject is necessary as a H2 pre-requisite for a university course?", because prerequisite means as long as you've taken the subject and scored a decent grade, it's ok.</p>
              <p>If you didn't score well in a subject that's essential to your course, then it doesn't matter whether you use that subject as as a H2 or a H1, does it? Either way you're screwed.</p>

              <p><img src="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/Sg_A_Levels_to_Uni_Score.gif" alt="" width="394" height="297"></p>
              <p> You need to include : <br>- Your best four content subjects (i.e. 3 H2 and 1 H1 content subjects, with at least 1 subject to be from a contrasting discipline).<br>- Either GP or KI grade taken in the same sitting. <br>- H1 Project Work.</p>
              <p>The maximum points for H2 and H1 subjects are 20 and 10 respectively. <br>Note that H3 papers taken at the 'A' Level examination are not considered in the computation of the University Score. <br>Finally, take note that the marks-for-grades allocation values (table above) are subject to the 'BellCurve' which varies every year.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Say you wanna take Chemical Engineering in NUS (NTU requirements are slightly lower), which requires a distinction in both H2 Chem and H2 Physics. If you didn't manage to get an A for these two subjects, you can't get into the course REGARDLESS of whether you use them as H2 or H1 subjects when computing your University application score. </p>

              <p>Ok, I think you're probably worried that, say you need H2 Physics, but you did worst for your H2 Physics, so you're worried that your physics (being your lousiest subject) will be automatically downgraded to a H1 which will consequently exclude you from many courses (since H2 Physics is required, H1 Physics is useless).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, my point that "either way you're screwed" still holds true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But apart from that, don't worry, when calculating your University Admission Score your lousiest H2 subject is considered your H1 subject, but as far as University course prerequisites are concerned, you took the prerequisite subject at H2 level, not H1 level. So don't worry! :)</p>

              <p>Hi everyone. I'm currently in J1, eligible for 4H2s. i've heard that the advantage of taking 4H2s is that by the end of J1 promos, you can choose to downgrade one H2 subject ( that you're not good at ) to H1 ( less content ).</p>
              <p>However, if i take the A's with 4H2s, the H2 subject with the lousiest grade can be downgraded to H1 for the allocation of marks. If it's 4As for all H2 subj, then it doesn't make a difference from taking a 3H2 + 1H1 and getting all As for them right?</p>
              <p>So how does it actually work? Let's say if i get a C for a H2 subject. Downgrading it to a H1 subject, i'd get a better grade?</p>
              <p>I've tried googling for answers but couldn't find any. Thanks in advance, your help is very much appreciated! :)</p>
              <p>p/s : anyone taking geog, can you tell me your experience too! thanks! ( both h1 and h2 ) because i'm struggling between econs and geog ( took elect geog in Os, A1 ) but leaning towards geog because i enjoyed geog in sec sch. TY!</p>

              <p>Say you take 3H2s and 1H1, and your grades are C A A / A for your 3 H2s and your 1H1. Your combined score for these 4 subjects (ie. excluding GP, PW, etc) will be 65.0<br><br>Say you take 4H2s, your grades are C A A A for your 4 H2 subjects. Your lousiest will be considered a H1 subject. Your combined score for these 4 subjects (ie. excluding GP, PW, etc) will be 67.5<br><br>That's the advantage of taking 4H2s over 3H2s + 1H1. Of course, taking 4H2s take up more of your time. Some students will perform better if they had more time. So it's a bit of a balancing act. There is no right or wrong best approach. Depends on yourself and your personal aptitude and competence in your chosen subjects.<br><br>Note : some students are worried that if their lousiest H2 subject is a prerequisite for some Uni courses and it's downgraded to a H1 for Uni application score, it means they don't meet the prerequisite for that particular Uni course. No worries. As far as prerequisites are concerned, you took that subject as a H2. As far as Uni application score is concerned, you took that subject as a H1. No worries.</p>
