            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi all, im currently a year 1 student in NP. after 1 month of being in my course, I want to withdraw from my course so badly. I had no interest in my current course and by the time i realised that i don't like my course, it was already too late for any transfers/appeals to another poly. im feeling very vexed right now, because i don't know whether i should withdraw NOW from my current course and meanwhile work and at the same time wait for the next intake next year and apply for DAE. has anyone been in the same situation before? has anyone withdrew from their course and reapplied through DAE and succeeded? i heard that many ex-poly students applying for DAE and failing to get what they want.</p></div>

              <p>You should continue with your course and then apply for DAE next year. If your DAE application fails, at least you have your current course to fall back on. However do note that students are only eligible for tuition grants for a maximum of 10 semesters. This includes the tuition grant you received in your current course. For example if you  complete two semesters of your current course, you will only have tuition grant for up to 8 semesters in your next course. Once you exceed that (by repeating a semester), you will have to pay the polytechnic full fees and the full fees are expensive. Thus you shouldn't change courses too many times.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think more likely is the first one bah. after all, after O levels, you were most likely playing everyday for around 5 months before Poly started.

              <p>must be because you have the interest to pursue a certain field and you want to opt for this course to obtain a diploma and thereafter seek further qualifications to achieve the kind of employment opportunities you want, that's why you opt for this course to begin with.</p>
              <p>do you still remember why you want to pursue this diploma course?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">anyway, from the way you write, I do not think it is really because you lack interest that's why you want to withdraw. "Lack interest" is just an excuse and actually, it is because you prefer to in another polytechnic that's why you want to withdraw, right? because you mentioned that "it was already too late for any transfers/appeals to another poly". If it is change to pursue another diploma, then it should be change course, not change poly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">well, I know Ngee Ann Poly is less accessible than Singapore Poly, Nanyang Poly and Republic Poly and you everyday have to endure the very tiring journey to school - mainly because there is no direct MRT connection and you have to alight halfway (at Clementi) and take bus to school, and thereafter, you still have to climb steep slopes and walk another distance to the school your course is in. but do remember you are not the only one who has to go through such a tiring daily routine, twice a day. in fact, there are many many people who had went through the same routine as you are going through now, and they had already made it through and graduated.</span></p>
              <p>please know that you are studying for the diploma, not for the polytechnic name to be associated to you. actually, it does not matter which polytechnic you are in. ultimately, what matters is what diploma you have. because when you go out to work next time, the employers will look at what qualifications you have, not really which school you go to and not even which class you were in; they only care about your qualifications, which in this context is the diploma that you will be awarded after you completed the course.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">Well.. If you say you have <strong>no interest</strong> in your current course. Then here are some things for you to think about..</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">1) Why did I first choose to enter this course?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">— Is it because there's no choice? Like you didn’t score well of your O’levels and didn’t have much option.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">(If this is the case. I would strongly encourage you to just stay in your course, aim to score it well and just graduate with the certificate. As the chances of you being able to get into your </span><strong style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">real desired course</strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> is </span><strong style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">low.</strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;"> And the reason why I said ‘aim to score well’ is because if your GPA you get by the time you graduate is at least a 3.6 and above. You might be able to change your field of studies in univesity.)</span></p>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;"> — Or is it because you just blindly follow your friend decision to enter the course?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">2) What are my interest?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">— </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">List down your interest in the order of most liked — least liked interest. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">— </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">From your list, start to research about the course related to your interest. Things like...</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">Cut of point for the course</li>
              <li style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">Career aspect when you graduate</li>
              <li style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">If you have friends who are in that particular course itself, it would be good to ask them about the course as well. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small; line-height: normal;">* If initially you entered your course as you didn't have much courses to go. Then you could research the list of courses avaliable in university, then aim to acheive that GPA required to enter that course in uni. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">3) Is my parents able to support me financially for another year of poly?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small; line-height: normal;">** But anyway the chances of getting admitted through DAE is low when you're already in poly. As if you think about it logically, if everyone would to be like you wanting to change course 'every year' then there wouldnt be enough space left for the generation of people after you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small; line-height: normal;">*** I do know of friends who manage to transfer course within the same school though. So you can try your luck on transfer if you really want to. </span></p>

              <p>yes im aware of that. However even if I stay in my course, I will be failing my exams too (i have been failing my short tests which affects my final grade so I think I'll be failing the major ones too). Hence, I don't know whether to stay on or just withdraw and try my luck next year</p>

              <p>I'm number 2... my decision on my course was pretty rashly made because I was influenced by others on how good my current course is and i just go with the flow without thinking of what i want to do in the future. Now that I know what I want, I can't change my course yet. I want to do events next time, and I'm currently in optometry which totally has no relevance. I have been working throughout my holidays, so I didn't have a problem switching my life back to studies. Poly activities won't affect me since I have none currently. As for my reason for writing "it's too late to transfer to any transfers/appeals to another poly" is because even if I appeal in NP, my appeal will not be successful because of the O level cut off for the course that I want is 10 and my R4 score is a 15, hence it's impossible for me to transfer to my desired course. </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">Well.. If you say you have <strong>no interest</strong> in your
                  current course. Then here are some things for you to think
                  about..</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">1) Why did I first choose to enter this course?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">— Is it because there's no choice? Like you didn’t score well of
                  your O’levels and didn’t have much option.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">(If
                  this is the case. I would strongly encourage you to just stay in
                  your course, aim to score it well and just graduate with the
                  certificate. As the chances of you being able to get into
                  your</span> <strong style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">real
                  desired course</strong> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">is</span> <strong style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">low.</strong> <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;">And
                  the reason why I said ‘aim to score well’ is because if your GPA
                  you get by the time you graduate is at least a 3.6 and above. You
                  might be able to change your field of studies in
                  univesity.)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;"> — Or is it because you just blindly follow your friend
                  decision to enter the course?</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">2) What are my interest?</p>

                  your list, start to research about the course related to your

              <li style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;">If
                  you have friends who are in that particular course itself, it would
                  be good to ask them about the course as well. </li>

                  If initially you entered your course as you didn't have much
                  courses to go. Then you could research the list of courses
                  avaliable in university, then aim to acheive that GPA required to
                  enter that course in uni. </span></p>

                  But anyway the chances of getting admitted through DAE is low when
                  you're already in poly. As if you think about it logically, if
                  everyone would to be like you wanting to change course 'every year'
                  then there wouldnt be enough space left for the generation of
                  people after you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: small; line-height: normal;">***
                  I do know of friends who manage to transfer course within the same
                  school though. So you can try your luck on transfer if you really
                  want to. </span></p>

              <p>I'm in optometry because I listened to the others saying that optometry has good prospects and so I blindly changed my choices and eventually got into the course. I scored a L1R4 of 15.. there were many choices for me. I'm determined to do hospitality &amp; resort management if I ever have the chance of getting into this course. I want to score well in my current course too, but after i tried to study for the quizzes and test, I realised I'm not up for a triple science course and I didn't have any bio background back in secondary school (optometry requires loads of bio). Maybe I should try and do my common test and see how much I can achieve. I don't expect my GPA to be good too since the year 2 modules and harder than the year 1's and I'm already struggling to manage the modules. Chances in DAE are low, and I'm pretty afraid that I wouldn't get another chance to be in poly once I withdraw. So now I'm stucked. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Perhaps, you need to change your mindset.. :) I know its hard, but everything's in the state of your mind. If you keep telling yourself that you want to withdraw from your course, then certainly you will feel a sense of dislike whenever you attend lectures/tutorials. I feel that its not worth it to withdraw now and wait for another year, because of all the time wasted. Why don't you continue first, get a diploma and pursue your favourite course next time in uni?</p></div>
