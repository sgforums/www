The O level results are coming out around january 2016 and i know for sure i will do very badly except for english which has always been my strongest subject. As for the year 2016 i intend to retake o levels as a private candidate again but this time i will give it my all. My concern is that i will be turning 19 in 2016 and if i was eligible to enter into a jc i would be 20 in 2017 (i'm afriad once i enter jc it would be difficult to make friends due to the age disparity). BTW my subject combination for L1R5 would be english,chinese,E math,combined science,combined humanities and literature. i know if i put in the effort i would be able to enter into jcs like PJC,JJC,YJC and IJC.. i know these jcs are just average jcs but at least i will be able to do my A levels in a government school with supervision. Taking private A levels as a private candidate is not an option as my family definitely do not have the funds. My dream is to become an english teacher and my planned route is retake o levels(19 years old)&gt;jc(20-21 years old)&gt;NS(22-23 years old)&gt;NUS/NTU.. i would apprieciate any and all advice given.</span></p></div>

              Even if you do badly in your SPA, you can always make up for it with your theory papers, as grades (including A) are awarded based on your total score (ie. SPA + P1 + P2 + P3). Of course, the worse you do for your SPA, the more perfect your theory papers need to be. And there's always the bell-curve to contend with.

              <p><br> Even if you do badly in your SPA, you can always make up for it
              with your theory papers, as grades (including A) are awarded based

              you do for your SPA, the more perfect your theory papers need to
              be. And there's always the bell-curve to contend with.</p>

              Anything is possible. You just gotta do your best. That's all you can do. And come for tuition if you're worried about your theory papers.

              Quit worrying about SPA. Many students also screw up their SPA (many without realizing it), and they can still get overall A grade. Just do your best for the theory papers, a near-perfect 90%+ score if possible, to pull up your overall score to an A grade.
