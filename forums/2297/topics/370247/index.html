              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  This is a nice article for us to know that a genius comes about, not by accident, by means of focused work, passion to excel and the availability of supportive environment and important mentors.</p>
              <p>  Some interesting bits:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>"But it isn't magic, and it isn't born. It happens because some critical things line up so that a person of good intelligence can put in the sustained, focused effort it takes to achieve extraordinary mastery. These people don't necessarily have an especially high IQ, but they almost always have very supportive environments, and they almost always have important mentors. And the one thing they always have is this incredible investment of effort."<br></li>
              <li>As cellist Yo-Yo Ma once said, the most proficient and renowned musicians are not necessarily those who outshone everyone as youths, but rather those who had "fire in the belly".<br></li>
              <li>This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach. Every single person in the study took at least a decade of hard study or practice to achieve international recognition. Olympic swimmers trained for an average of 15 years before making the team; the best concert pianists took 15 years to earn international recognition. Top researchers, sculptors and mathematicians put in similar amounts of time.<br></li>
              <li>The same even goes for those few who seem born with supreme talent. Mozart was playing the violin at 3 years of age and received expert, focused instruction from the start. He was precocious, writing symphonies at age 7, but he didn't produce the work that made him a giant until his teens. The same is true for Tiger Woods. He seems magical on the golf course, but he was swinging a golf club before he could walk, got great instruction and practised constantly from boyhood, and even today outworks all his rivals. His genius has been laboriously constructed.<br></li>
              <li>Finally, most retrospective studies, including Bloom's, have found that almost all high achievers were blessed with at least one crucial mentor as they neared maturity. When Subotnik looked at music students at New York's elite Juilliard School and winners of the high-school-level Westinghouse Science Talent Search, he found that the Juilliard students generally realised their potential more fully because they had one-on-one relationships with mentors who prepared them for the challenges they would face after their studies ended.</li>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  A quick summary about becoming a genius:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Put in focused work and practise conscientiously to master something.<br></li>
              <li>Develop a strong passion.<br></li>
              <li>Look out for supportive environments and important mentors.<br></li>
              <li>Develop cognitive skills, like chunking and storing strategic bits of information in working memory.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>  To rise to the top, one really needs to pump oneself up.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
