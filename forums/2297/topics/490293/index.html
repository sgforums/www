              <p>Hi guys I m new to SG fourm btw, i want to ask a question regarding about choosing subject combinations. The problem is that i dk what career pathways that i m interested. I think is too young to decide which subject to take. </p>
              <p>My 1st question : If i dont know what course in poly/jc i want to take futher down the road which science subject should i take? - Biology with chemistry OR Physics with Chemistry. I personally prefer Biology to Physics tho.... But i dont want to be a doctor,scientist or other stuff related to these topic. LOL. My seniors say choose the subject u like the most. But i want to play safe. Bio or phy which one offers more courses?. And which courses u cant choose if u take bio.</p>
              <p>2nd Question: POA,D&amp;T,FN,ART which should i take also? i may take poa next year tho but what does other subjects has to offer? My exam just ended and we are required to choose these subjects. I don't really know which i want to take..... But i know what i choose will have an impact on my life next time. Any suggestions?</p>

              <p>Firstly,</p>
              <p>Biology is about health science, Physics is about engineering science, while Chemistry is about life science.</p>
              <p>Next time you want to save lives or fix machines?</p>
              <p>If you want to save lives, take Biology.</p>
              <p>If you want to fix machines, take Physics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>POA is exam-based, while D&amp;T, F&amp;N and Art are project-based. My advise is to choose the subject that is the most easy to score.</p>
              <p>Contrary to popular belief, D&amp;T is not a prerequisite for engineering courses in Polytechnic, as there is this module called "Introduction to Engineering" which will teach all the skills (eg. Soldering) required for the engineering course - if you want to fix machines.</p>
              <p>I am not promoting any subject, but I feel that if these are the only subjects you can choose, you may want to take POA.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Science (Phy/Chem) and POA will be the most practical option if u ask me. I take these two subjects and trust me, they are pretty managable although POA will be abit hard to grasp at first as it is a new subject unlike F&amp;N, D&amp;T and Art which you would have taken this year or when you were in sec 1. But keep in mind that If you're thinking of going to a JC none of the subjects you listed above would be very useful as without Amaths or pure sciences you most likely only can go arts stream in JC. All in all, I would say choose your subjects based on your interests and follow your heart:)</p></div>

              <p>Look at how you are performing in the secondary two exams. For a better picture, look at only the exam results of SA2 and SA1 (for subjects not taken in semester two), not the combined results.</p>
              <p>I'm sure your school has set requirements for some subjects.</p>
              <p>Young people like you may not understand it now, but eventually all will appreciate that there is a cut-off.</p>
              <p>Because some subjects are really only for the top secondary two students. If you just nice can meet the mark, either exactly at cut-off or within five to ten marks from cut-off, you may want to avoid that subject.</p>
              <p>The only exception is Additional Mathematics. Even if your secondary two maths is around 70 or around 65, please choose Additional Mathematics. A maths very important. Must take. Anyway, some schools is every sec three express student take A maths, regardless of their sec two maths results. If you can qualify to take A maths, take A maths. If not, appeal to the school, ask your MP for help, whatever. No matter what, must take A maths.</p>
              <p>Whereas for Geography, be it pure or combined, this is only for top students. I do not know about your school, but some schools set their cut-off for geography very high (around 70). Because unfortunately, lower sec geography is nothing compared to O lvl geography. I myself took geog for O lvls last time, and I can tell you, it is very hard. If your sec two geography not 80 (eighty) and above, you better take another humanities subject.</p>
              <p>After all, it's the L1R5 and the L1R4 that matters.</p>
              <p>Choose the subjects which you know you will do very well in them.</p>
              <p>With regards to your question on whether to take Biology or Physics, look at your exam results. If I am not wrong, secondary one science is biology only.</p>
              <p>You may want to see your SA2 exam results for secondary one science, if it is biology. Compare that with your SA2 exam results for Physics (the total score for Physics paper one and two). You may want to choose the subject that has the higher score.</p>

              <p>My phy and bio everytime top 1 in class ... u see i both do very well. I prefer Bio then physics. i prefer memorizing details then caculating using formula. Thus i prefer bio more but then again, I not interested in saving lives. I may be into architecture related courses. But i dislike physics. So what to choose? Physics or bio? I nvr study for bio still get top. For physics need study to ensure that i get 1st in class.....</p>
              <p>History and geog also both top 1. But i hate history to the max. History makes me sick.</p>
              <p>U said ''<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">POA is exam-based, while D&amp;T, F&amp;N and Art are project-based'''. I dislike ART F&amp;N and D&amp;T they are not </span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">practical ..... Not sure about POA which is accounting. My art very cmi, even if u go ART next year gg liao. Same for D&amp;T if u dk how draw or use machine u are done for D&amp;T.Not sure for POA tell me more information about it guys. </span></span></p>
              <p>SO u mean that A maths is super important? I hate e maths for what i go take a maths .. But then again i get grade 2 for maths..</p>
              <p>A maths is very different from E maths tho. I seen the workbooks and textbooks for a maths. That bothers me alot.</p>

              <p>My phy and bio everytime top 1 in class ... u see i both do very
                      well. I prefer Bio then physics. i prefer memorizing details then
                      caculating using formula. Thus i prefer bio more but then again, I
                      not interested in saving lives. I may be into architecture
                      related courses. But i dislike physics. So what to choose? Physics
                      or bio? I nvr study for bio still get top. For physics need study
                      to ensure that i get 1st in class.....</p>
              <p>History and geog also both top 1. But i hate history to the max.
                      History makes me sick.</p>
              <p>U said ''<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">POA
                      is exam-based, while D&amp;T, F&amp;N and Art are project-based'''.
                      I dislike ART F&amp;N and D&amp;T they are
                      not </span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">practical ..... Not
                      sure about POA which is accounting. My art very cmi, even if u go
                      ART next year gg liao. Same for D&amp;T if u dk how draw or use
                      machine u are done for D&amp;T.<strong>Not sure for POA tell me more
                      information about it guys. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>SO u mean that A maths is super important? I hate e maths for
                      what i go take a maths .. But then again i get grade 2 for
                      maths..</p>
              <p>A maths is very different from E maths tho. I seen the workbooks
                      and textbooks for a maths. That bothers me alot.</p>

              <p>POA is very theory based and there is alot of memorizing involved. Can be quite taxing at times lah but easy to pass nonetheless. Can't speak for Amath as I don't take that subject but from my friends who take it, they say its pretty difficult and the failing rate for that subject is quite high as compared to POA in my level,  but I'm not discouraging you to take Amath though. Amaths is important if you're aiming to study engineering or science related courses after O levels, or so what my teacher says lah. You say you're interested in architecture related courses, so I think it's fine if you don't take Amaths or physics but taking D&amp;T and may be quite useful though. </p>
              <p>Honestly, I would say taking Physics is more beneficial as you can apply what you learn in physics to other subjects too such as chem and emath. Chapters such as kinetic particle theory u will also learn in chem. Standard form and distance-time graphs will also be covered in emath that you would have already learnt in physics. So I think phy more useful than bio and physics not really that hard actually, you just need logic and common sense to do well. Just my 2-cents worth.</p>

              <p>E-maths can easily get one hundred marks.</p>
              <p>A-maths is then where the hard part is. Nonetheless, logarithm, trigonometry, differentiation and integration if you got practice, they are manageable.</p>
              <p>Here, I would like to recommend a textbook brand, called "Shing Lee".</p>
              <p>Whereas for assesments, your school worksheets are good enough. Do all questions. When have doubts, ask your maths teacher.</p>

              <p>Back then when i was in sec three, during the mid year exams, I remember that time around half of my geography class get single digit out of fifty for geography. This is how hard geography is. </p>
              <p>I have been though it before. I know how scary it is. That is why, I say that you should only choose geography if your sec two geography is more than seventy percent. It is really a hard subject that is not for everyone.</p>
