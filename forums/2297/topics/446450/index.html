              <p>hi guys.i am facing a dillemma now currently as i have realised that i have made the wrong choice to enter my course and now am stuck with leaving the course or to stay in it.</p>
              <p>i am a 1st yr student going 2nd currently enrolled in a chemical engineering course in a good poly.I realise that as time goes by,i realise that i could not cope with the rigours of the course.My 1 semester results was 2.76 and i hoped that i could improve to a 3 for this sem,at the least.Much as i tried,my results went into the other direction and i am very scared that i could not get a 3 for my gpa, as there is a dip-plus program in my sch that allows ppl having a gpa of 3 to enter and earn certificates in various subjects,eg:maths,chemistry,business and so on.I wated to enter the program as i wanted to do maths in university.</p>
              <p>My O level results is as follows..</p>
              <p>EL-B3</p>
              <p>CL-A1</p>
              <p>HCL-C6</p>
              <p>E Math-B3</p>
              <p>A Math-B4</p>
              <p>Physics-C6</p>
              <p>Chemistry-C6</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities-A2</p>
              <p>CCA-A2</p>
              <p>L1R2B2(business):11(after Cut off)</p>
              <p>L1R2B2(science and design):13(after cut off)</p>
              <p>L1R5-15(after cut off)</p>
              <p>So using the above results,can i say that coming to this course is a completely wrong choice?And if yes, what are some of the courses that i can enter into?I have no interest in business courses so that is totally out..</p>
              <p>Or should I transfer to a junior college?I have recently realised that since my sciences in o levels are weak,i should have gotten into a jc instead.The trouble is,my ideal combination is not offered by many jcs, and only yishun jc has it.I have heard ppl saying that since its a 20 pointer jc,it will be a waste for me to enter YJC.</p>
              <p>My ideal subject combination is:H2 math,H2 chemistry,H2 history and either H1 China Studies or H1 General Studies in Chinese.</p>
              <p>i need ur opinion in this combination.is it good or bad?btw i dun want to take econs cos i dun like them..</p>
              <p>thanks..</p>

              <p>I'm not gonna directly address your question, ie. I'm not gonna tell you what to do.</p>
              <p>But yesterday on another forum, someone asked about Chem Engineering course in the polys. And this is what I had to say :</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A few years ago I had a TP Chem Eng tuition student. The content level of polys' Chem Eng is the same level as JCs' H2 Chem + H2 Phys + H2 Math. All engineering courses will always involve lots of maths and physics.<br><br>Chem Eng students will find 'A' level Chem study materials (such as those I recommend on <a href="http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">my website</span></span></a>) relevant and useful for their chem modules.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your ideal JC subject combination has H2 Math and H2 Chem, but not H2 Physics. So presumably your poor semester 1 GPA is due more to your physics-based modules, rather than your Chem-based or Math-based modules? Or do you feel your poor GPA is due to some poly-specific aspect (like what? can you elaborate?) that you're confident you won't encounter in a JC?</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, just know (that in real-life) there isn't a right or wrong answer. Whether you manage to eventually continue onto University and enjoy a successful career, will depend more on your performance from here on out, on either path (staying on, or transferring to a JC), rather than on simply choosing which path to take.</p>

              <p>I would like to just say there is no such thing as a waste in entering a 20 pointer JC. Besides, (it is rumoured, but I believe it is true) YJC stayed at 20 points so as to enable those who wants to go to a JC, but has really lousy aggregates to enter one.</p>
              <p>Also, there are many who got a 7-pointer or 8-pointer for 'O' Levels, went into a 18 to 20 COP JC and still managed to top the school and succeed.</p>
