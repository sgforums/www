              of elements required by the question. for example, I didn't
              introduce myself. :( I just started out with, " I am delighted that
              our school has been chosen ..... "</p>
              <p>Besides that, I failed to mention the 2 students who might be
              involved and i barely organized the day.  </p>
              <p>Do you think there is a probability that would fail my
              functional? Because If i'm not wrong, Lauguage is upon 20 and TF is
              upon 10. </p>
              <p>As for paper 2, summary, i think i did fine but i'm positive i
              didn't hit 15 points. More like, 10.</p>

              <p>I think for situational writing format and addressing the points are the most important. And I don't think failing to introduce urself is a deciding factor for a mark leh. As long as the entire thing has a good flow shd be okay. Mine wasn't kindof odd :/ the summary was really vague - they just asked bout the development of circuses thru time. I omitted the part on animal rights and still too many words leh! And after that anyhow count and bomb the number of words cos no time &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Now... If anyone knows.. What is the highest possible mark for p1 section one ah (free writing). Seems like that is the only thing i can pin my hopes on :(</p>

              <p>I didnt really compare, most of it was just persuading. I barely wrote about organizing the day too.

              <p>The highest mark is 30 but english is so damn subjective. There is no 'perfect' essay. I doubt mine is too.. And one man's meat is one man's poison. Different teachers can love/hate the same essay!</p>
              <p>Comprehension was horrible for me too. Lotsa careless mistakes. I think optimum and the one you wrote for beset are quite close. Depends on how strict the marker is. Angrily is kinda off. I wrote vehemently :/ Most people wrote strongly which should be correct.</p>

              <p>Yeah. Anne and John completely demoralized us totally. The name Anne and John can never be the same to me again. :? hahaha</p>
              <p>And i agree to English being subjective too. Examinations are 50% luck and 50% effort. Take Humanities for example. We can only let fate decide what the marker favour. </p>
              <p>I don't know whether to say the comprehension was easy or not. I can only determine that when i get back my results. Oh well, thanks for making me feel a tad bit better! :) All the best for your Maths paper tomorrow! </p>

              <p>I have never encountered the need to state the time before. Hence, maybe this year, the markers would be more lenient when marking the situational writing i guess. </p>
