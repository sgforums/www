              <p>Hey, I'm new to the forum and I really hope someone is able to help me out with this.</p>
              <p>I graduated with a diploma in Business admin earlier on this year and I got accepted into NTU's new course, public policy and global affairs (4 years, direct honors). I also got accepted by SIM-UOL accounting &amp; finance course. I chose the latter since it would allow me to graduate within two years (direct honors), that is if I were to pass my bridging exams. </p>
              <p>I've been having second thoughts about sim degrees after reading through forums about employers preferring to hire local graduates instead, some even preferring to hire second class honor degrees from local uni as compared to first class honor degrees in SIM etc. My lecturer told me it would be better if I were to transfer out of sim and apply for NTU again. </p>
              <p>Should I just stick to SIM, aim for first class honors, and apply for masters? Or should I transfer out and try to apply to NTU again next year?</p>

              <p>I am fine with both actually but I'm weaker with maths and figures as compared to writing. I thought PPGA sounded interesting cause I've always been interested in knowing about history and political matters. It's just that I've never specialized in this area before and I am afraid I might not be able to take the course and drop out halfway since it's a four years thing. I heard a lot about people being unable to take the stress in local universities and transferred out to private universities instead. :/</p>
              <p>Is getting a SIM-UOL degree really that disadvantageous? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm also afraid of getting scolded if I were to change my mind because that would mean waste of money and time. </p>

              is yr poly results gd? often new course like such took in mediocre students to hit the head count so the course can commence n I doubt u 1 2 be a white mouse...its not worthwhile to enroll into a course just for knowing about history and political matters where u can always do yr own read up...if I were u, I would chop chop finished the sim course, work hard for  2 yrs, save some money then take the nus mba which is only 1 to 2 yrs..within 6 yrs, u will have a b.deg, master n work exp under yr belt...
              btw asking question like this is rather insulting to the lecturers at sim, obviously they will tell u to go...
              don't worry abt the syllabus, its not tat heavy, I believed with some efforts u can at least attain a 2nd upper.

              <p>I am just wondering if the NTU course is very arts like and not so related to business. Arts degree holders may have some problems finding jobs intially.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not easy to find a job with history like subjects, especially with the downturn in our economy. Or is the NTU course related to politics? Are you aiming for public office?</p>
              <p>SIM grads may earn less than NTU grads, but it is where your passion lies.</p>
              <p>My relative grad from business in SIM, and she said her starting pay was real low.</p>
              <p>I have no easy answers.</p>
              <p>You need to find out whether the SIM degree is more marketable than the NTU one.</p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I don't really know what I want to do when I'm finished with school actually. I'll work hard for at least second upper class in SIM but I think it'll be much harder to get NUS master? </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I didn't mean to insult the sim lecturers because my lecturer was the one who told me that on his own. Plus, I don't really think that is an insult to them because it's two different matters? :/</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">PPGA is under the school of social science so I guess it should be classified under arts? I've been told that graduates can look for jobs in both public and private sectors, including banks, but I guess the most ideal job prospect would be a civil servant.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">--</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">After thinking it through, I thought maybe I should just give up the whole idea and wake up to the fact that I'm already in SIM. The starting pay will no doubt be much lower but I guess that's one of the many cons to graduating earlier? The earlier I graduate, the faster I can work and provide support to my family. My parents would be against the idea of dropping out of SIM and wasting their money anyway. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">One thing for sure. I wish SIM UOL would reduce and improve their intake of students instead of taking every student which comes their way, including 2 pointers. That's probably one of the reasons why employers prefer to hire local uni graduates. The local unis have strict entry requirements and they take in only the best available.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">SIM UOL is just keen on having more students and making more money, which really shouldn't be the way. </span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>I'm not generalizing all SIM UOL students. In fact, I know there are many who did much better in their studies but end up in SIM just because they're unable to secure a place for business related courses in the local unis. It's just that, the difference in treatment between a local and private graduate is simply too stark. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>
