              to calculate exactly the path of a projectile under gravity and
              subject to air resistance.<br> <br>   Shouryya, who lives in Dresden, eastern Germany, came up
              with the solutions to this and a second mathematical riddle while
              working on a school project.<br> <br>   He is being hailed as a genius in the German press, but
              attributes his achievement to "curiosity and schoolboy
              naivety".<br> <br>   "When it was explained to us that the problems had no

              Research Foundation, which gave him the award.<br> <br>   A keen cricketer, Shouryya cites his father as his
