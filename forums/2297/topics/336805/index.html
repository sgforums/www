              <p>My answer is A but the book's answer is B something wrong? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your answer A is correct.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Why does the concentration of dissolved lactic acid increase?</p>
              <p>My answer is C and the book's answer is D &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because anaerobic respiration (in prolonged period of exercise) produces lactic acid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1999</p>

              <p>My answer is B and the book is C. No idea on this. o.o &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fertilization. Because only at fertilization, will the actual sperm be identified. Some sperms carry X chromosome, some carry Y chromosome. Eggs always carry X chromosome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>A  growing all the plants from seeds from one parent plant</p>

              <p>C  growing all the plant at the same temperature</p>
              <p>D  growing all the plants in the same light intensity</p>
              <p>Why is the answer B instead of A? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seeds are the result of sexual reproduction and fertilization. Even self-fertilization involves genetic recombination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2001</p>
              <p>5) Where is urea produced?</p>
              <p>A bladder</p>
              <p>B blood cells</p>
              <p>C kidney</p>
              <p>D liver</p>
              <p>My answer is D but the answer is C o.o &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Liver beaks down excess amino acids to ammonia, which is converted to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys as urine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>B amylase-------------- starch</p>
              <p>C starch-------------- amylase</p>
              <p>D starch--------------- maltose</p>
              <p>My answer is C but the book's answer is B. I thought the enzyme is the 'lock' as it stays unchanged throughtout the reaction????</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This is one part of the 'O' level syllabus that is dumb. The "key" and "lock" are simply models, and only the SPECIFICITY of the model makes sense. One can argue either way for which is the key and which is the lock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>They do not need chlorophyll, since there is no light to be absorbed.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My answer is B but the book's is A. Need some help.. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1 &amp; 3. Large surface area increase water loss, but bo pian, because large surface area allows greater surface area to capture more light and absorb more carbon dioxide, both important for photosynthesis.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So there is one question in 2002,</p>
              <p>When is the secretion of insulin increased?</p>
              <p>A after eating a chocolate cookie</p>
              <p>B at the start of pregnancy</p>
              <p>C just before the release of sperms</p>
              <p>D when a person is angry</p>
              <p>The answer is A but is D another possible answer?</p>
              <p>Angry--- more adrenaline--- increase blood glucose concentration--- increased secretion of insulin</p>
              <p>And also how do you know if the chocolate cookie contain a lot of glucose?</p>

              <p>It's common sense chocolate is sweet, thus contains a lot of glucose. You really need a lot of common sense in Science subjects instead of pure memorising, from my experience, that is.</p>

              <p>Unlikely. Your cells are using glucose up at the same time as well, so it somehow evens out.</p>
              <p>Moreover, your "angry" has to caused by some fight-or-flight situation (a gang of guys grabbing your gf). So it is not applicable to all circumstances.</p>

              <p><br>You didn't understand my sentence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Liver beaks down excess amino acids to ammonia, which is converted to urea, which is excreted by the kidneys as urine. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yes, from my sentence, it's obvious that it's the liver which "produces" urea. It's only "excreted" by the kidneys. "Excretion" does not equal "production".</p>

              <p>When is the secretion of insulin increased?</p>

              <p>Angry--- more adrenaline--- increase blood glucose concentration--- increased secretion of insulin</p>
              <p>And also how do you know if the chocolate cookie contain a lot of glucose? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The most DIRECT answer is eating a cookie, which as <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/245250">Garrick_3658</a> pointed out, is obviously high in sugar. Getting angry only directly secretes adrenaline (and then, even if you're angry enough to want to physically fight someone), and only subsequently after some time, insulin would be secreted as a response to the elevated glucose levels as a result of the adrenaline secretion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So always choose the best or most direct answer to the question.</p>

              <p>Always remember, trust your judgment, those publishers are humans too (noob ones, I bet I can outrank them in terms of O lvl syllabus), so they make (stupid) mistakes sometimes (actually often, but I'll try to be nice).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next thing to remember for lock and key, the <strong>substrate always goes to find the enzyme</strong>. So how do you unlock a lock (no pun)? You <strong>use a key to fit the lock</strong>. The <strong>key finds the lock, just like how the substrate finds the enzyme</strong>.</p>
              <p>The answer is C. I cross-referenced from two textbooks.</p>

              <p>Then I have one thing to say, YOUR SCHOOL ROCKS.</p>
              <p>My school bought the BInsights, until I found out from my
              teacher that the other better book is BMatters. Weird she didn't
              suggest to the HOD of Science in the first place.</p>
              <p>I mean which TYS? Which publisher?</p>
              <p>BTW the TYS don't take answers from Cambridge, they just assumed
              the right answers. You can fly to London and try to hack the UCLES
              security of the answers though.</p>

              <p>i agree, the publishers suck. They can publish the same<strong> WRONG </strong>answers thrice in 3 editions. Luckily i clarified with my teacher</p>

              <p>Both of them can't do it independently. Adrenaline requires glycogen, and glycogen requires glucagon. Weird question o.o</p>

              <p>I think it's two days. Since the egg can only survive for two days, and you need the sperm and egg to fuse, you can't have fertilisation occuring without both of them.</p>

              <p>I think it's hair covering skin, since mammals all have hair.</p>
              <p>EDIT: And also because hair is a distinctive trait of all mammals. Birds are warm-blooded too, but they have feathers.</p>
