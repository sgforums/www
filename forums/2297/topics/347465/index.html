              <p>Just thought it will be fun to share these poems about the central science by Mala L. Radhakrishnan with everyone. She's now an assistant professor at Wellesley. I first posted one of her poems in my blog:</p>
              <p>http://takchek.blogspot.com/2005/07/outside-norm-overqualifiedunderpaid.html</p>
              <p>from here:</p>
              <p>http://www.technologyreview.com/article/14688/page4/</p>
              <p><strong>Amalgam in the Middle By Mala L. Radhakrishnan</strong></p>
              <p>Silicon was faithfully teased each day<br>In school when atoms would line up to play:<br>Metals in one line, nons in the next,<br>But which line should it join? All were perplexed.</p>
              <p>Like a metal, it was shiny,<br>But its conductivity was tiny.<br>Its band gap was too far from little,<br>And unlike metals 'twas rather brittle.</p>
              <p>It clutched electrons way too tightly,<br>So metals teased it daily and nightly.<br>Yet nons would also jeer and nettle,<br>"You dress and look just like a metal!"</p>
              <p>What pain since it did not conform!<br>No box for it to check on forms.<br>Few atoms could know the lonely void<br>That it knew as a "metalloid."</p>
              <p>But sili did not yet know 'twas able<br>To be popular with the rest of the table.<br>Its half-filled shell did place it where<br>It had some four electrons to share.</p>
              <p>While greedy nonmetals weren't willing to spare<br>And metals were willing to give anywhere,<br>Sili's electrons were things to be earned,<br>But they bonded with skill that couldn't be learned.</p>
              <p>Once other elements saw this fact,<br>Moles of them came 'round to react.<br>O2 was the first to ask it on dates,<br>And others joined in to make silicates.</p>
              <p>The former outcast whose hopes had been bust<br>Now was key in forming Earth's crust!<br>The pariah that had been given the hand<br>Was now in every grain of sand.</p>
              <p>Soon, silicon was lionized;<br>Its band gap was of perfect size<br>To dope with nearby brothers and sisters<br>And make computers from transistors.</p>
              <p>As if its utility has not yet impressed us,<br>It's also in quartz and glass and asbestos!<br>And silicon's used in chemical plants<br>To make lubricants and breast implants.</p>
              <p>Sili, its fourteen electrons so strong,<br>Proved all of its doubtful peers to be wrong<br>When it managed to move all the way out to Cali<br>And founded its very own aptly named valley.</p>
              <p>The ugly duckling of the table,<br>Silicon simply couldn't be labeled.<br>So if you feel you don't fit in,<br>Think of silicon and don't give in.</p>

              <h5>The Radioactive Dating Game</h5>
              <p>By <em>Mala L. Radhakrishnan</em></p>
              <p>I used to sleep 'til my electrons would drool<br>At P-32 element-ary school.<br>The things we were taught were just totally boring.<br>A <em>mole</em> of us atoms would always be snoring.</p>
              <p>But one thing I learned there I've kept to this day:<br>"Soon, my students you'll beta decay<br>To become more mature and to capture the label<br>Of "S-32", and then you'll be stable.</p>
              <p>And when that time comes you will celebrate<br>'Cause you will be ready to graduate.<br>So look around now, and count every peer.<br>Today there's a <em>mole</em>, but you'll soon disappear."</p>
              <p>So I watched as my friends around me decayed.<br>I felt left behind, slow and dismayed.<br>Abandoned by those who were thought to be deft.<br>In two weeks there was but half us of left.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile I'd hoped to impress my young lass<br>But was now in the bottom half of the class.<br>I spent all my class time planning to court her,<br>But remained, two weeks more, in the leftover quarter.</p>
              <p>By two weeks more yet, and I still hadn't parted.<br>Now six weeks had passed since this challenge first started.<br>What was my problem? I kept losing faith.<br>The fraction of atoms left was one-eighth.</p>
              <p>Another two weeks and my hope for love waned.<br>One sixteenth of a <em>mole</em> of us atoms remained.<br>My lass had now probably found a new mate.<br>By the time I escaped here, it would be too late.</p>
              <p>So I studied the past eight weeks with great courage.<br>And suddenly a pattern started to emerge.<br>I realized, from evidence existential<br>That the decay of the class size was exponential.</p>
              <p>See, every time two weeks came and then went,<br>The class size went down by fifty percent.<br>'Twas one <em>mole</em> times e to the minus kt,<br>Where k was ln 2 over 2 weeks, you see.</p>
              <p>And "t" was the time in units of weeks<br>Since the teacher that lesson one fine day did speak.<br>This equation did serve as a useful tool;<br>I could predict, at time t, the number in school.</p>
              <p>But then it happened - I had my decay!<br>I was S-32, and I liked it that way.<br>Success carried with it the sweetest aroma,<br>My electrons excited as I got my diploma,</p>
              <p>Which oddly contained a most curious addition.<br>It read: "You've earned honors and recognition<br>For insightfully doing the mental athletics<br>Of uncovering the inherent first-order kinetics."</p>
              <p>When my love saw this honor she screamed out loud,<br>"Oh, my brilliant darling, of you I'm so proud!<br>Your wit has won over my heart in a snap.<br>Let's let our orbitals overlap!"</p>
              <p>So the one thing I learned from that school, 'twas the worst,<br>Is 'tis not about who's quick or who finishes first.<br>Everyone matures at different rates.<br>(But those who know learn chemistry will always get dates!)</p>

              <p><strong>Poem: Party of 5.55 * 10<sup>1</sup> mol/L</strong></p>
              <p>The water house had a party one night<br>With three different compounds they chose to invite.<br>Hexane and sugar and salt were the three<br>Who were kindly requested to RSVP.<br><br>All three on the guest list were pleasantly stunned<br>To be asked to the luxury beaker of fun.<br>They said yes and asked if alcohol was permissible.<br>Of course, said the water, 'cause we are both miscible.<br><br>The sugars came first in a big silver spoon,<br>A bunch of sweet friends who had come just to swoon<br>Over H2O guys who made their spines tingle.<br>As soon as they got there they split up to mingle.<br><br>Soon they were uniformly spread all throughout,<br>Surrounded by waters who'd dance and shout,<br>You're so nice and polar - of you we're quite fond.<br>Let's have a good time as we hydrogen bond!<br><br>Their H's and O's were dangerously close;<br>The entropy of the universe rose.<br>Needless to say, amid all the men,<br>The sugars didn't find each other again.<br><br>Next came the salts who were in for a ride - <br>Married couples of sodium and chloride.<br>The current crowd made each question its mate<br>And the salts began to dissociate.<br><br>The waters surrounded the split apart ions<br>As if they were outfits divorcees could try on.<br>Their hydrogens pointed at negative chlorides<br>While oxygens stood by the sodium's sides.<br><br>What was the cause of each sudden divorce?<br>Well, entropy was the main driving force.<br>As the night went along and the dating evolved,<br>Both sugar and salt were completely dissolved.<br><br>The last bunch to come was the hexane crowd.<br>They weren't expecting a party this loud.<br>The bonding and moshing and lust made them shout,<br>This is not what chemistry's about!<br><br>They huddled together to avoid the hysteria,<br>Minimizing their contact surface area.<br>The waters were too busy H-bonding to care,<br>To give up these bonds for some oil's not fair.<br><br>So to their own kinds were such compounds loyal.<br>Polar liked polar and didn't like oil.<br>The two didn't mix, but this we expect;<br>It's called the hydrophobic effect.<br><br>Unfortunately, society's a lot like chem.<br>People hang out with others like them.<br>By fighting our ignorance this issue we'd solve,<br>And most of our problems would simply dissolve.</p>

              <p><strong>Poem: Ethanol, my children!</strong><br><br>Edward Ethanol had nothing to fear<br>As he floated around in that bottle of beer.<br>The water was cool, and nowhere in town<br>Were there enzymes that could ever break him down.<br>His two carbons free, his hydrogens strong,<br>His dangling -OH sang a peaceful song.<br>His life was one of bliss and elation,<br>Thanks to a process we call fermentation.<br>But one day the cap on his world had been popped;<br>The bottle was almost entirely flip-flopped.<br>He fell down a passage and started to shiver<br>When he saw himself headed straight for a liver!<br>A sign read: All alcohols, please be advised,<br>Beyond this point you'll be oxidized.<br>Soon he was looking right in the face<br>Of alcohol dehydrogenase.<br>The enzyme cut off his hydrogen pair,<br>And Ed shouted out, Now, that's just not fair.<br>You may have made acetaldehyde,<br>But if I were you, I would run and hide!<br>A second enzyme was to speed up the rate<br>Of turning Edward to acetate.<br>But, luckily, Edward saw a sign:<br>The enzyme is busy. Please wait in line.<br>It turned out the beer had too many vandals;<br>There was more aldehyde than this enzyme could handle.<br>So Edward now had some time to be free,<br>And he began to go on his vengeful spree.<br>He sailed through the blood and pillaged and plundered.<br>The helpless victims hopelessly wondered<br>Why cells around them started to die<br>While the overworked enzymes started to cry.<br>At the end of the day, Ed claimed he had won.<br>He wreaked tons of havoc and even had fun.<br>All of this destruction was simply to say,<br>Cut off my hydrogens and you'll have to pay!</p>

              <p><strong>Poem: Organic matchmaker</strong><br><br>I'd really given it all that I had,<br>Flirted at bars, wrote a personal ad.<br>But every molecule I would encounter<br>Seemed wrong for me once I had learned all about her.<br>Some looked attractive, happy, able,<br>But upon reacting we'd soon be unstable.<br>Every time a reaction would start,<br>Thermodynamics soon pushed us apart.<br>But I knew there was one right fish in that sea,<br>Someone who'd surely react with me,<br>Proceeding forward spontaneously<br>With a highly negative delta G.<br>But finding that someone? My odds were pathetic.<br>So the issue I faced was mainly kinetic;<br>'Twas like two lovers apart, in seclusion,<br>And forced to meet by random diffusion.<br>Yet even they wouldn't have it as rough.<br>With us, meeting was just not enough,<br>Since we had the added obligation<br>To collide with proper orientation.<br>And oh, how I longed for reactive involvement,<br>So lonely, surrounded by aqueous solvent.<br>Then one day - 'twas no way that I could mistake her - <br>Along came my magical matchmaker.<br>A monstrous enzyme whose active site<br>Could hold two molecules nice and tight<br>Like a loveseat; we'd perfectly fit, in fact,<br>Positioned just right to quickly react.<br>The enzyme was meant just for me and my match,<br>To her both my partner and I could attach,<br>And she helped me react with my ultimate mate<br>By stabilizing our transition state.<br>Said she, Mine's the best occupation;<br>Reducing energies of activation.<br>And then, she said, Thanks. 'Twas fun.<br>My job as your catalyst has now been done.<br>So if you're out to react with a purpose,<br>Try the enzyme dating service.<br>'Tis true that I found mine by accident;<br>She came, she helped and back she went.<br>But maybe an enzyme can help you too,<br>Can help you meet the one for you,<br>Creating a setting fit for a kiss,<br>Resulting in thermodynamic bliss!</p>
