              <p>I tend to be quite careless too. Like mistyping an extra digit or omitting certain calculator values by pressing the keys too quickly..</p>
              <p>What i have been doing to prevent such silly mistakes from occuring would be to look at my calculator screen and check the input values for just a second more to double confirm that they are correct  (only takes a second more.. which can be potentially valuable and time saving .. if you are prone to such mistakes)</p>
              <p>This ensures that if i do get a wrong answer, it is not a calculation mistake but a fundermentals mistake.. which i would then go back to the paper and check my formulas, correct it ..</p>

              <p>Hi donkhead333,</p>
              <p>  It is good that you already make a note of the specific errors you tend to make. Just remind yourself consciously when you are doing the questions that you should look out for them.</p>
              <p>  If you are already applying correct methods to solve problems, you are not weak, foundationally speaking. Stop thinking about your lack of competency because that will affect your ability to improve and excel further due to the conditioning of the mind.</p>

              <p>Do your work systematically.</p>
              <p>Write down the formula first before actually using the formula. That way you rely less on mental work and will have a lower tendency to make mistakes. For example, don't just write</p>
              <p><strong>F = 2 * 5 = 10 ms-2<br></strong></p>
              <p>Instead, write</p>
              <p><strong>F = ma = 2*5 = 10 ms-2</strong></p>
              <p>I also always tell my students to write down a statement beforehand to show what they are doing. For example:</p>
              <p><strong>2+ 2 = 5 </strong></p>
              <p>This will net you zero marks because no one knows what you're doing. On the other hand,</p>
              <p><strong>Length of section AB = 2 + 2 = 5 m</strong></p>
              <p>This will still get you partial marks (even though the arithmetic is wrong) because the examiner knows what you're trying to drive at.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>you will also need to have quick check methods to ensure you are correct.</p>
              <p>Some personal tips to share that I share with all my students.</p>
              <p>1) WRITE CLEARLY. There are times where because of untidy handwriting, the student misinterprets his/her workings. Do not get into this category.</p>
              <p>2) Cross product, i.e. <strong>a</strong> x <strong>b </strong>=<strong> c</strong>. Carelessness can be avoided if you simply take <strong>a.c</strong> and <strong>b.</strong><strong>c</strong>  and ensure both are zero.</p>
              <p>3) Definite Integral. Check using GC!!! When questions ask for exact values or "without using a graphic calculator", it does not mean you cannot use GC to verify!   All the more it hints you to use the GC to verify your answer!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are some that comes to my head at the moment... Will update when more comes in.</p>

              <p>In addition to checking, you could also try practising more of similar papers over and over again.</p>
              <p>For some people, once they get use to writing the same equations and going through the similar procedures again and again, they will be able to detect/feel something is wrong whenever they did something incorrectly, even if they are going at optimal speed.</p>

              <p>No, you do not get the my point.</p>
              <p>You should never read your solution for checking.</p>
              <p>Example, after substituting a value, you realise there should be a mistake somewhere in your working. DO NOT GO BACK AND READ YOUR SOLUTION, most of the times it is just a waste of time as very few ppl are capable of locating the mistake in a few minutes. The best way, is to IGNORE/COVER the flawed working and re-do it on the next page, most likely your 2nd round answer will be different and correct (if you make the same mistake again, the mistake is no longer a 'careless' mistake, it has something to do with your foundation)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Here are some specific instances of mistakes I have seen.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
              <p>  y^2 = x^2 - a^2</p>
              <p>  =&gt; y = x - a [incorrect simplification].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
              <p>  Sketch the solution curve for x &gt; 0.</p>
              <p>  The student then draws the curve for all values of x [incorrect domain].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
              <p>  Given X ~ N(a, b), Y ~ N(c, d),</p>
              <p>  the student then computes Var(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 - 2Y) as</p>
              <p>  3b - 4d or 3b + 2d [incorrect application of the variance result].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
              <p>  To find P(X &gt; a), the student uses continuity correction and writes it as</p>
              <p>  P(X &gt; a - 0.5) [incorrect continuity correction value].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
              <p>  To find the integral of (cos x)^3 with respect to x, the student writes</p>
              <p>  (1/4) (cos x)^4</p>
              <p>  or</p>
              <p>  (cos x)^4 / (-4 sin x) [incorrect application of the integration result].</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  More examples for students' reference :)</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 6:</strong></p>
              <p>  Find the set of values of x for which a certain inequality is to be solved.</p>
              <p>  The student writes the answer as x &gt; a [not meeting the question's requirement].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 7:</strong></p>
              <p>  Suppose the result to be shown by induction is</p>
              <p>  sum {r = 1 to n} (r + 1) / (2^r) = 3 - (n + 3)(1/2)^n</p>
              <p>  and the student is attempting to prove that a proposition is true for n = k + 1.</p>
              <p>  He writes</p>
              <p>  sum {r = 1 to k + 1} (r + 1)/(2^r)</p>
              <p>  = 3 - (k + 3)(1/2)^k + (k + 2) / (2^(k + 1))</p>
              <p>  = 3 - (1/2)^k [ (k + 3) + (k + 2)/2 ],</p>
              <p>  thereby making the negative sign error.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 8:</strong></p>
              <p>  The function f is defined by f : x -&gt; ..., x &lt; a.</p>
              <p>  The student is asked to find the inverse of f in a similar form and writes his answer as</p>
              <p>  f(x) = ... [not meeting the question's requirement].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 9:</strong></p>
              <p>  A question about vectors asks the student to find the coordinates of the point F which is the foot of a perpendicular of a point to the plane. He writes the answer in column vector form [not meeting the question's requirement].</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 10: </strong></p>
              <p>  Refer to Q8 in 2010 H2 Maths exam paper 2. The student goes on to find the number of ways, rather than giving the answer as a probability.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  3rd part posting about common mistakes.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 11:</strong></p>
              <p>  The student is asked to sketch the curve y = (x + 4) / (x(x + 3)).</p>
              <p>  Referring to the GC and sketching the graph, he misses out the minimum turning point on the negative x-axis, because it is not obvious from the calculator.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 12:</strong></p>
              <p>  Refer to Q11 in 2010 H2 Maths exam paper 1. The student sketches the curve with GC using the parametric equations and misses out one branch of the curve as well as the oblique asymptotes.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 13:</strong></p>
              <p>  Find the probability that their average mass will lie within 60 kg from 100 kg.</p>
              <p>  The student proceeds to find</p>
              <p>  P(60 &lt;= X-bar &lt;= 100),</p>
              <p>  as a result of wrongly interpreting the information.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Example 14:</strong></p>
              <p>  The mean daily sales over a period of 12 days is found to be 129.5 with variance 172, the student is asked to carry out a hypothesis test.</p>
              <p>  He then mistakes 172 to be the population variance or s^2 when it is referring to a sample variance.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi donkhead333,</p>
              <p>  "from 100" - We take 100 as the reference value.</p>
              <p>  "within 60" - Add 60 to the reference value gives us the upper limit 160. Take away 60 from the reference value gives us the lower limit 40.</p>
              <p>  Thus we obtain a range of values between 40 and 160.</p>
              <p>  In N08/P2/Q1(iv), we encounter a similar type of phrasing:</p>
              <p>  ...for which the value of g(x) is within +/-0.5 of the value of f(x).</p>
              <p>  It is thus important to know how to interpret this information correctly :)</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Thanks eagle for your encouragement :)</p>
              <p>  I made this mistake in this question about transformation on one occasion. Given the graph of y = f(2x), one is asked to sketch the graph of y = f(2x - 4). I simply took it as a translation of 4 units to the right when it should have been a translation of 2 units to the right.</p>
              <p>  Thus one should ask what substitution should x be made to decide on the correction transformation. In the example, x is substituted with x - 2 to obtain f(2x - 4) from f(2x).</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
