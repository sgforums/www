              <p>Hi guys ! So I've just completed my Os and now I've been posted to SAJC through DSA and I need to know what subjects to take . I want to get into the science stream there and so I've been asking around and it seems like PCMe is the norm when It comes to science stream subject combinations . I just need some advice about my subjects  </p>
              <p>firstly : Should I take physics or bio ? Everyone who I've spoken to has told me to take physics cause with it I will qualify for more courses in Uni and thus it gives me an advantage as compared to if I take bio instead . I don't really know what i want to do in Uni yet but I'm looking at chemical engineering or pharmaceutical. I got an A1 for bio and an A2 for physics .</p>
              <p>secondly : should I take economics or geography ? Economics will be something entirely new to me as I have had absolutely no exposure to it in secondary school. My geography in secondary school has always been good and I got an A1 for combined humans so what do you think ? </p>
              <p>Just a little bit of additional info , my L1R5 raw is 8 and I also stay very far away from school . I stay in Boon Lay ( my parents made me DSA to SAJC ) so I'm gonna have to travel quite a lot . </p>
              <p>Also , is there any reference books you all would recommend that I could use to study ? Thought I haven't really confirmed my subjects but I know I'm definitely going to take chemistry so maybe you could recommend something to help me with that ? And also some tips to help me deal with JC life and not fail . Thank you :) </p>

              <p>As former JC Lecturer I would advise you the following:</p>
              <p>1) If is Pharmacy then biology would be helpful, if is Chemical engineering then probably physics.</p>
              <p>2) I would recommend you go with Geography. If you are interested in Economics you can take an introduction module in university. Having background knowledge would put you in a safer position to tackle the subject.</p>
              <p>3) If you cannot decide between physics and biology then go based on your interest. This is not always true but I feel that having physics can be helpful to A level Mathematics. My students from biology tend to be not as strong. This is not a fact but just based on my experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In general reference books are not complusory for JC as schools have their own lecture notes. It is best you ask your JC tutors for advise. There may be a little "conflict" if the book is not based on Singapore education and the way of answering is different from what your school accepts. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To survive well, the key idea is being consistent in making sure your school work is done and don't fall into the situation too much time is spent in other areas such as CCAs, etc. You should strike a balance, and ask questions whenever in doubt instead of accumulating.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>JC life is really more hectic than Secondary school, pace of learning is also faster.</p>
