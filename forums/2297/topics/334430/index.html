Around 200 words.<br>Second paragraph then i state my stand on young people prefer internet.(250 words)<br>Last paragraph is the conclusion where i repeat my stand again.<br><br>After the exam, my friend told me that it is important to make your stand on the first paragraph. and if you didn't do it, the marker will failed you. &gt;.&lt; is it true that i really screw up my paper one? <br><br>Also on paper 1 section two, it is about a report to your principal of an outing in singapore. But a few of my friend screw up and wrote about going oversea. So does that mean they will get 0 on it? or the market will just deduct some marks?<br><br>Thanks for reading... :(</p></div>

              <p>Yup true, but there was once for my school's paper I think last year, the question was about "What do you think about single session schools?" but one person answered it as "What do you think about single sex schools?" and she passed 15/30. Not too sure if it's my school or what.. yup. Guess ts's friends have to pray hard it won't pull their entire english grade too low.</p>

              <p>i think u just screwed that paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let's see,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st para: intro. no stand.</p>
              <p>2nd para: stand and 1st argument</p>
              <p>3rd para: conclusion</p>
              <p>so are you saying that you only had 1 argument for the entire essay?</p>
              <p>and given that your essay is less than 500 words, i don't think you have made substantial arguments to convince the marker about your stand.</p>
              <p>i think you need to have at least 2 arguments to pass. it is a must to show both sides of the argument.</p>
              <p>and as for your friend, they will fail. at most some sympathy marks.</p>
              <p> cos they are not answering the question at all, and for that, they may as well not do the paper.  understanding of the question also accounts for some language marks too</p>

Coz is like 4 full pages (without leave lines) and 6 lines on the 5th page. Think write too much liao. Coz I give my stand on all 3 options but in the end still say internet is my choice.</p>
