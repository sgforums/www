              <p>H1 or H2 Econs? Opinions pls. I heard the amt of content for h1 is more than double of h2 but i only want to take 3H2s and 1H1and Id rather take H2 phy,chem &amp; math.</p>
              <p>Also, i heard of a lot of ppl struggling with econs and so i would like to know what subject econs is most similar with so that i would have a certain measure of its difficulty for me.</p>
              <p>How is econs similar to geography? I know ppl say it requires different skills and approach so its different but I want to know how similar is it in terms of memorizing and learning. I know ppl say all humans have the same amt of memorizing but it lit seemed easier than geog for me and so with ur opinions i want to see if it fits my style of memorizing.</p>
              <p>I would like to know more abt the difficulty of h2 physics. My phy was A2 and bio B3(pure). I feel that i spent more time studying for bio during o levels because of the mugging but still got better for phy. My friend said that phy is rlly tough compared to bio, bio just mug all the way plus a bit of application.</p>

              <p><br>What kind of H1 subject has 2x the content of it's H2 version? The rationale for naming H1 and H2 is to reflect the amount of content : H2 = 2 x H1.</p>
              <p>If you're like 90% of humans on this planet, then you're either more physics inclined, or your're more bio inclined (just like 90% of humans either prefer cats or dogs, few humans love or hate both equally). In other words, it's already in your DNA (or soul karma, whichever concept you prefer). It's unwise to choose based on what others say which is 'easier' for themselves, coz born biologists find biology naturally easier than physics, while born physicists find physics naturally easier than biology.</p>
              <p>So don't listen to other pple, but decide for yourself. Two things you should take note :</p>
              <p>#1 - Uni course prerequisites :</p>
              <p><img src="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/NUS_ALevels_Prerequisites.jpg" alt="" width="959" height="1575"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 - H2 Bio has more content to memorize than H2 Phys + H2 Chem <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">combined</span></strong>. I'm <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> exaggerating. Be warned.</p>

              <p><br>It doesn't matter whether you take Econs at H2 or H1 (ie. 4H2s or 3H2+1H1). But Physics and Chemistry must <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span></strong> be taken at H2, or it may ruin your life (eg. after A levels, you realize you wanna do Chem Engineering or some similar profession, for the rest of your life, but if you foolishly downgraded either your Phys or Chem to H1, you've screwed the rest of your life).</p>
