              <p>Hi, I have some organic chem questions to ask. But before that, does anyone know if there is any good organic chemistry guides that can assist me greatly in the area of isomers, geometric isomers (eg cis-trans), optical isomers etc? I found that I am really really bad in structural formula and stuff, esp when they give a complicated long formula and I am asked to draw out the structural formula and possible isomers. I always skip these questions in exams because I am not confident of organic chem but now I know their importance in the A lvl syllabus.</p>
              <p>1.Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid in human diet</p>
              <p>CH3(CH2)4CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)7CO2H</p>
              <p>In linoleic acid, both double bonds are in the cis config. (what does it mean by this statement? lol. this is just how lousy i am in this) Representing the formula by the abbreviated structure A-CH=CHCH2CH=CH-B , draw the displayed formula of linoleic acid and the other possible cis trans isomers with this structure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 Geraniol is an alcohol used in perfumery.</p>
              <p>(CH3)2C=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCH2OH</p>
              <p>On oxidation of genraniol with hot acidifiedKMnO4(aq), 3 products are initially obtained</p>
              <p>P C3H6O</p>
              <p>Q C5H8O3</p>
              <p>R C2H2O4</p>
              <p>(i) geraniol has 2 double bonds. how many cis trans isomers are possible for geraniol?</p>
              <p>ii draw the structural formula of P Q and R</p>
              <p>iii continue heating with acidified KMnO4 (aq) causes R to be oxidized further according to the following equation</p>
              <p>C2H2O4 - 2e-  -&gt; 2CO2  +2H+</p>
              <p>Make use of the data booklet to construct a balanced equation for the reaction betwen R and acidified KMnO4(aq).</p>
              <p>I largely understand the organic chem concepts besides those isomers questions. But because I have difficulties doing the isomers part, I often cant proceed to subsequent parts of the question, so pardon me for the long post. Thanks.</p>

              <p>For a list of recommended books to help with H2 Chemistry (particularly Organic Chemistry), see my webpage here :</p>
              <p><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q1. Draw the cis-cis, cis-trans, trans-cis and trans-trans configurations. Because this is an online forum, it's difficult to show you (go Wikipedia and search for "geometric isomerism"). Your school teacher or tuition teacher could show you easily (ie. getting help from an online forum can't replace the help of a teacher or tuition teacher).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2(i) 2^2 = 4 geometric isomers</p>
              <p>(ii) P is CH3COCH3, Q is HOOCCH2CH2COCH3, R is HOOCCOOH.</p>
              <p>(iii) MnO4- is reduced to Mn2+, while ethandioc acid is oxidized to CO2. Ensure the no. of electrons lost in the oxidation half-equation is the same as the no. of electrons gained in the reduction half-equation, then add up LHS + LHS, and RHS + RHS, to get your balanced redox equation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You're already in Yr2, and your OC obviously needs a lot of urgent catching up to do. In addition to buying a good OC book (see my recommended list), you should seek out your school teachers for more consultation sessions and/or get yourself a good tuition teacher, and/or enter into a study group with schoolmates who're good in their chemistry and are willing to help you out.</p>

              <p>A classic text on organic chemistry is the one by Morrison and Boyd.  The title is "Organic Chemistry" and the last edition is the 6th.  It even came with a student's guide, which many of us bought.  This was the text used in many courses at NUS in the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
