              i think the post messed up 
              
              original post:
              Oh ok thanks for the help eagle! I have some magnetism questions hope u dont mind
                          
              how will the magnetic field look like when a bar magnet is placed on a iron wall? The north and south pole are in contact with the iron wall. I know that that bar magnet will be attracted so I know that a north and south pole will form. However, I'm not sure how it will look like. I would greatly appreciate it if u could explain this to me with a diagram.
                          
              Also, I'm not very sure because the north and south pole are made up and since they have the same properties, the founder of magnets can name the poles anyway they want (meaning a north can be a south and vice versa). I know that due to permeability, the magnetic field will tend into the material with a higher permeability. but as mentioned the north can be a south and vice versa, so im very confused on this part. 
              
              thanks so much for the help!

              <p><br>Oh ok thanks for the help eagle! I have some magnetism questions hope u dont mind</p>
              <p>1) how will the magnetic field look like when a bar magnet is placed on a iron wall? The north and south pole are in contact with the iron wall. I know that that bar magnet will be attracted so I know that a north and south pole will form. However, I'm not sure how it will look like. I would greatly appreciate it if u could explain this to me with a diagram.</p>
              <p> Also, I'm not very sure because the north and south pole are chosen to be that way and since they have the same properties, the founder of magnets can name the poles any way (north can be a south and south a north). So I'm not sure how to draw it.i know that magnetic field will rather go through a material with a higher magnetic permeability, but then as previously mentioned a south can be a north and so on. so when i place a magnet on a iron wall, im not sure if the north pole's magnetic field will pass through the iron first. so im very very confused here.</p>
              <p>2) why when magnetic shielding occurs, the iron bar (for eg) is also being induced so eg a north pole is placed in front of the iron bar which is perpenticular to the bar magnet's north pole. when this happens two south poles will be induced in the middle and 2 north poles at the two end. but when we draw this out, we only draw the magnetic field by the magnet. but wouldnt there be the magnetic field of the iron bar itself when it is induced? so why wont anything be attracted at the bottom (opposite side of the iron bar) since i think that there will be its own magnetic field? thanks so much for the help!</p>

              <p>You mentioned about definitions. That is right. For magnetic field lines, it is also defined as field lines exiting from a north pole and moving towards a south pole. By convention, magnetic field lines are always in closed loops. As you move towards uni studies, you will see closed loop integrals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't draw out the diagram now, but when magnets touch iron bars, what will happen is that the iron bar becomes a temporary or induced magnet. Basically, the field lines of the magnet will be concentrated and aligned along the iron bar all the way to it's end poles. The field lines will then exit the bar and move all the way back to the magnet.</p>
              <p>A website with some graphics can be found here, but it might be too advanced for O levels.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't understand your 2nd question. Would be good if you have a diagram. Basically, what you are describing is similar to a magnetic monopole, or so I think. Tradtionally, there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of magnetic monopole</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole</a></p>
              <p>However, in recent years, researchers have observed the existence of such monopoles</p>

              <p>Magnetic monopoles are however out of O level, A level and first year uni physics syllabus.</p>

              Hi sorry for jumping back, when incorrect wire is used, then R will increase. But then since v=ri, then won't I decrease. So when p=vi or I^2r then won't they be the same? Thankd

              Then how does the thickness of a wire cause more heat to be produced? Thanks for the help! Since R increases, but V=RI and I will reduce, so P=VI won't P be reduced n P=I2R and P=V2/R.

              <p><br>He said, "My physics tutor is injured (<em>internal injury, vomitting blood, may never recover</em>) so he’s unable to teach me now. N my school teacher is very bad to me (<em>always fleeing from me in terror whenever I want to ask her my incessant questions</em>)".</p>
              <p>It's good to be a deep, critical thinker and have the passion to go beyond the syllabus.

              <p>What you need (in addition to doing self-research and self-learning through Wikipedia and other reliable websites, for 'A' level Chemistry use <a href="http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#H2_Planning_and_other_goodies">Rod Beavon, Jim Clarke and Doc Brown</a>), you probably need to change your private tutors to new ones who can better satisfy your academic needs, than your current tutors (which you've personal problems with, as you indicated in your private message).</p>
              <p>Anyway, for the record, I won't be replying to any of <a href="/users/284407">StudentQns</a>' O level Chem questions (I don't wish to enable such an unfeasible learning approach); and when he gets to A levels in 2 years time, I still may not reply his A level Chem questions, depending on whether I observe any changes in his approach to this matter.</p>

              Thanks ultimaonline, that's why I think that its a curse to be so curious. As forg eagle, thanks for all the help and patience with me, I know that I'm a real bother. 
              
              As for my physics question, I'm unsure how a thinner or thicker sure will affect the amount of heat being produced. Since V=RI, and V is constant. Since R increase, so I should decrease so that they will multiply to get same value of V. So when I use the power formula P=VI, I don't see a increase in power. If 100V=100ohmx1A, then power is 100W. But when I increase R to 200ohm I becomes 0.5A so power becomes 50W. So does this mean with higher resistance (thinner wires) less heat is produced?
              
              Thanks for the help. I feel that this is a part of the syllabus so I'm asking you this question. Thanks a lot for all the help!

              <p>In the past, when my teachers see me, the first thing they do is to turn back and walk fast fast to avoid me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Just like what UltimaOnline said, I would acutally do self study and research on my own and try to digest it myself. The process of self-learning is kinda enjoyable for me. Over time, I develop this habit to only approach my teachers for help when there is a very challenging question that I'm dying to know the solution or a particular concept which are fit for serious discussion.</p>

              <p>Thanks ultimaonline, that’s why I think that its a curse to be
              so curious. As forg eagle, thanks for all the help and patience
              with me, I know that I’m a real bother.</p>
              <p>As for my physics question, I’m unsure how a thinner or thicker
              sure will affect the amount of heat being produced. Since V=RI, and
              V is constant. Since R increase, so I should decrease so that they
              will multiply to get same value of V. So when I use the power
              formula P=VI, I don’t see a increase in power. If 100V=100ohmx1A,
              then power is 100W. But when I increase R to 200ohm I becomes 0.5A
              so power becomes 50W. So does this mean with higher resistance
              (thinner wires) less heat is produced?</p>
              <p>Thanks for the help. I feel that this is a part of the syllabus
              so I’m asking you this question. Thanks a lot for all the help!</p>

              <p>Hi, let me show you some values</p>
              <p>Let</p>
              <p>V = 100V<br>I = 1 A<br>Hence, R = 100 ohms</p>
              <p>P = VI = 100W<br>P = V^2 / R = 100^2 / 100 = 100 ohms<br>P = I^2 R = 1^2 * 100 = 100 ohms</p>
              <p>If R increases to 200 ohms, V = 100V and I = 0.5A,</p>
              <p>P = VI = 50W<br> P = V^2 / R = 100^2 / 200 = 50 ohms<br> P = I^2 R = 0.5^2 * 200 = 50 ohms</p>
              <p>So yes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for a constant voltage</strong></span>, higher resistance will lead to lesser power being dissipated.</p>

              <p>In the past, when my teachers see me, the first thing they do is
              to turn back and walk fast fast to avoid me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Just like what UltimaOnline said, I
              would acutally do self study and research on my own and try to
              digest it myself. The process of self-learning is kinda enjoyable
              for me. Over time, I develop this habit to only approach my
              teachers for help when there is a very challenging question that
              I'm dying to know the solution or a particular concept which
              are fit for serious discussion.</p>
              <p>When you're doing your work, it's good to take out a piece of
              paper and list down</p>
              <ol>
              <li>What you know (the stuffs that you know on a topic)</li>
              <li>What you don't know (the stuffs that you're unsure of)</li>
              <li>What you need to find out (the stuffs that you need more
              research to answer your problems).</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember once I was told by my facilitator that "whatever
              questions that you will be asking, most likely this question has
              been answered by somebody else. It's the matter whether if you
              could find the answer on the internet." It's true, I always
              remember this and hence the quote "Google is your best friend". I
              say "Youtube" is my buddy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I always tell people there was once in JC, there was this maths question I think for 3 days before finally solving it while I was brushing teeth in the morning.</p>
              <p>Maybe because my ego was too high, I always believed that if I couldn't solve, my friends couldn't too, so there was no point asking them <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Oh so when they say more resistance, the current must be constant and voltage can change. Thanks for the help eagle and patience with me. But in a home circuit, isn't voltage fixed? Thanks for the help!

              <p>V = IR always apply.</p>
              <p>Questions may want to keep 1 of the 3 variables constant for students to solve it directly. That's about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>And yes, home circuits as well as batteries have fixed voltages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could go deeper and deeper as I'm trained in electrical engineering. But the questions you are asking now borders upon how exam questions are set, and that is more an art than a science :)</p>
