              <p>Shit. I really expected triple A1 for Emaths, Amaths and Literature. Stupid bell curve.</p>
              <p>Amazing how English got A1 with 40/40 for oral, but less than 13/25 for summary.</p>
              <p>No clue how I got B4 for Combined Humanities. I left both Social Studies Essays blank as I only studied Venice.<br><br>I failed both maths and both sciences in prelims .. So I guess 13 points with B3 and B4 for pure sciences is alright, I just started last-minute mugging a little late.</p>
              <p>I lol-ed when I got B3 for music. I've been getting straight B3s since I started.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So .. I can't go ACJC, I can't go CJC.</p>
              <p>According to the JAE booklet, 2009's ACJC cut-off was 6/7, and CJC was 10/11.</p>

              <p>Recommended:<br>1st: SP<br>2nd: NYP<br>3rd: NP<br><br>Put in NP as well. If its a point of two sometimes you might get in after deducting your CCA points and also it depends on this year's demand for the course in that school. The COP for this year may be higher and also might be lower. 12 doesnt compromise a guarantee to SP but neither does it guarantee you wun get in to a school with cut-off point that is lower, say 11. <br><br>You can try alternatives like Banking and Finance, Business Studies courses. Its in the same section of the grey booklet. =)</p>

              <p>How do you rate these three JCs as against the results ? </p>

              <p>Actually, 13 units is the maximum, as it is the heaviest workload a student can take under the revised A levels curriculum.</p>
              <p>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/413513/1/.html</p>
              <p>http://www.rjc.edu.sg/new/news.asp?p=5&amp;s=&amp;order=</p>
              <p>As for the exact combination, I believe that 12 unit takers usually make up for the extra 2 units by taking on extra H3 subjects.</p>
              <p>H3 subjects are recommended to students who have proven themselves capable throughout the year, which is usually around August - October.</p>
              <p>Taking on an extra H2 subject is not possible since the prescribed combination during registration for JC1 is 7/8 units of study excluding 3 units from GP,PW, and mother tongue.</p>
              <p>Hence, a 13 unit combination would be</p>
              <p>H1 GP, PW, MTL - 3 units</p>
              <p>4x H2 - 8 units</p>
              <p>2 H3 - 2 units</p>
              <p>If a student was to take on an extra H1/H2 subject during the course of study, I can only imagine the pressure of having to go through the topics covered earlier on alone.</p>
              <p>I doubt any school would allow that.</p>

              <p>Share my experience with you all:</p>
              <p>As I am current RP Year 2 student, I would like to encourage you all to join my school (regardless of through JAE or DAE) I am currently taking Materials Science, taking average 4 modules per week and perm sem.</p>
              <p>How did I enter RP? I was awkard to say that I get L1R4 26 (after minusing 2 CCA points) I failed my English (D7), humanities (Geo + SS) E8, MT (B3), SCI (phy + Bio) D7 &amp; Maths (B3) Honestly speaking, Maths &amp; MT saved my day. So, I could not go any poly through JAE but was asked to go for Higeher NITEC. For DAE, I applied courses available (26 pointer course) in all polys (except NP), but failed. Only RP was my only course to go poly (through DAE).</p>
              <p>For JAE, I was selected to take accountacy at Bishan ITE. But after received SMS that I successfully appeal to go RP through DAE, I was delighted and promised myself to work more harder. And I was asked to withdraw money (school fee) for Higher NITEC. And RP helped me choose Diploma in Materials Science.</p>
              <p>Must thank RP to save my life, and continue pursuing my own interest. For my course, D7 for English was enough.</p>
              <p>Tell you, RP is more easier to cope compared to the other polys. Reasons:<br>1. Problem-based learning with building of teamwork<br>2. Open book UT (but to know how to apply concepts to attempt questions)<br>3. After lesson need to do RJ, no need to do home assignments as worksheets/homework are all done in school</p>
              <p>For Year 1, I spent too much on IG, so I flopped in the UTs (Cognitive, Culture, communication, entreprising) as I did not tend to study on the eve of UTs. Year 1 consisted on general modules (which some will be unreleated to by DMTS module but is useful in future.) Furthermore, the weightable of UT is same as daily grade. At the end, I got 2.35.</p>
              <p>But for year 2, I quitted my own IG. Since arrival of new principal (former TP principal) the weightage of UT increased, did not concentrate too much on daily grades as I know the importance of getting a decent GPA. Secondly, I needed to understand better about my core modules (which are related to mycourse) as I know it will be difficult to cope than Year 1. if I still continue to pursue IG, my grade will be from bad to worse as I do not have time to memorise, familiarise  and know the concepts better. So, I decided to chiong both by having time management to cope with them. Furthermore, I needed to have tine to revise and retake 'O' Level (1st time taking pure physics) for the sake of getting a diploma certificate. (as being asked in the regulation form after signing it.) So, during year 2 sem 1 (include Year 1), I got 2.38, a slight improve. So, I am on the verge of finishing sem 2.</p>
              <p>Trust me, RP can find your ownself and know your career well =)</p>
              <p>By that, you can attend IEP (Industrial Enrollment programe) by signing it in Year 2.</p>
              <p>To conclude, Year 1 (Strongly encourages) needs to finish CE points by attending talk, Year 2 needs to finish professional profiling, Year 3 needs to finish either FYP or IEP as they are counted in 3 of 30 modules needed to pass in order to graduate and get a diploma certificate. Before going to Year 3, I can sense that it will be a tough year as needs to finish both IEP and works at the same time.</p>
              <p>Add-on: I need to retake 'O' Level for second time (better to do so) as one of criterias needed to get cert. Haiyah!!! If really, surely cannot cope with Year 3 modules and 'O' Level Science. (liang bai ju shang)</p>
