              <p>Functions was in H1 syllabus, but it has been taken out, I think in 2010.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, H1 pure maths section is a watered down version of O level A maths, and the stats section is similar to H2 maths stats section, without possion distribution, t-distribution, probability and P&amp;C.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  The concept of functions is expected, like when one is asked to sketch the graph of y = f(x).</p>
              <p>  Probability is included in the statistics section.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>thank you =) </p>
              <p>so can i assume that fuctions is only that at the very minimum without having to know horizontal line test and domian range thing? :x</p>
              <p>also, can i say that amaths take up a large proprtion of h1 maths (and lesser h2 content) and would be much easier to score than h2 maths? as my maths is not those very strong type, got B3 for amaths..</p>
              <p>furthermore,is stats easy to understand? as i believe stats should be an easier component, just that we are required to be very careful in doing stats? :x</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Additional mathematics content is repeated in the pure mathematics section of H1 maths paper (35%).</p>
              <p>  Statistics questions (weightage 60%) are not necessarily easier, for there are years in which they are more difficult than H2 maths statistics questions.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>The decision to take H1 or H2 maths should not be solely dependent on whether it is easier.</p>
              <p>It should also be dependent on the university course you are planning to enter after JC. You will need to check that the university course you are aiming for does not require H2 maths as a pre-requisite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The biggest difference in syllabus between H1 and H2 is in the pure maths section. The stats syllabus between the two are largely similar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, getting B3 for A maths doesn't mean you will do badly for H2 maths. I have had students who did not do A maths at all, and still getting As or Bs for H2 maths, and I believe I will have one or two more such students this year. So don't look down before you even start ;)</p>

              <p>Basically the difference, as pointed out, is in the Pure Maths section</p>
              <p>In fact, H1 Maths Stats section may be harder in some years than H2 Maths</p>
              <p>One example: For H1, there is a lot of explanation type of questions , like explain what is the meaning of unbiased estimator of population variance (the full one is if A is an estimator of variance of population B, A is an unbiased estimator if E(A) equals to sigma squared) (????? to me as a H2 student as we do more calculation and less explanation generally in A levels - exception 2012 H2 Maths Paper).</p>
              <p>For the issue of B3 in A maths, I am a person in Sec 3 my A maths is F9, after a lot of pushing I finally managed to get an A1 for my O levels, however, my prelims in school for H2 maths is an A thankfully. Hope my experience can tell you that A maths, although absolutely important as a stepping stone, but is not all for H2 maths. Topics that you must master from A maths are Partial fractions by CUR (As you won't have time to expand all and compare coefficients), differentiation and integration as well as maybe indices, surds and logarithms. Recently the ability to prove trigo identities is key as recent A level papers (e.g. 2011 P1 on Mathematical Induction and 2012 P1 last question part (iv)) and also your sine / cosine rule (in E maths)</p>
              <p>Most if not all courses in Uni requires H2 maths exceptions are law, FASS as well as business , education (arts), sports science - NTU and etc so decide carefully ... </p>

              <p>The current H1 Maths syllabus ie Paper 8864 is with effect from the year 2010.</p>
              <p>Before that, the H1 syallbus was Paper 8863.</p>
              <p>The ten years series have not taken out the outdated topics and parts.</p>
              <p>Please refer to my earlier post on the difference between H1 8864 Paper and H1 8863 Paper</p>

              <p>PS : I hold the same view as the forumers posted in this thread ie H1 Maths is very easy to study and score well especially if you have done the "O" level Add Maths.</p>
              <p>Though H1 Maths is easy to study and score an A, you need to consider carefully whether to take H1 or H2 Maths. H2 Maths is required in many university courses.</p>
              <p>H2 Maths will be more difficult to score an A and it will require much more effort and time to study ie you need to weigh the pros and cons and taking into consideration of the time and effort needed to study for your other subjects ie GP, project works, other H2 subjects, CCA etc too.</p>
