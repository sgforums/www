              <p>There are many factors parents and students consider when choosing a
                      effective private tutor. Some considerations can include age, sex,
                      experience, qualifications, reputation/track record, budget, etc.<br><br>Given
                      that there are many tutors around,
                      how then could you as a tutor stand out? I shall share a few factors
                      which I think is important.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) Passionate and knowledgeable in the subject you are teaching</span></span><br><br>This
                      is an important criteria that you must fulfill. Other than previous
                      grades in school, a good tutor has to demonstrate a good track record,
                      and be able to make references to the why and how of tackling the
                      concept or question.<br><br>Most importantly, a good tutor must be able
                      to put seemingly difficult concepts into simple terms, making sure that
                      the student can absorb and assimilate the details.<br><br><br>Passion
                      is also important because a good tutor must want to impart his skills,
                      knowledge as well as passion to his/her students. He/she must want to
                      target for full marks, and not just sufficiently high grades, for
                      his/her students.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) Active tutoring</span></span><br><br>There
                      are tutors who are tutoring passively. That means, they sit around and
                      watch the students do their homework/schoolwork. There are tutors who
                      simply tell the students to try and try again, without offering much
                      active help. In my opinion, this is clearly a waste of money by the
                      student. Why pay so much to employ a guardian to watch over you do your
                      own work?<br><br>Active tutors take the initiative to provide notes and
                      questions to their students, and teach in such a way that it helps the
                      students think, comprehend, analyse, and understand concepts and
                      questions. They repeat this process again and again. They train the
                      student to grasp concepts, to utilise effectively every tool in their
                      hands (calculators, rulers, etc) and to make full use of exam
                      strategies to reduce their careless mistakes or take advantage of the
                      structure in which questions are set.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) Motivating</span></span><br><br>This
                      is to me the most important factor to be present in a good tutor. To do
                      so, tutors have to be able to build good rapport with their students.
                      They have to create the hunger, the want, the confidence to score in
                      their students.<br><br>Many a times, I have come across students who
                      are desperate, dejected and totally low in confidence. They seeked
                      tuition from me as a last resort, as if I'm a miracle pill to at least
                      help them pass a subject. And luckily for them, I managed to instill
                      more confidence in everyone of them, give them hope, and finally, they
                      achieve a grade that is way better than a pass.<br><br>There are also
                      students who have totally no idea why they should study a particular
                      subject. I have this student who plans to go into game design, and
                      cannot think of any reason to study and do well in physics, other than
                      to make the grade. That unmotivation remains, until I explained how
                      mechanics and physics are also required in games, and went into some
                      details on how the programmer needs basic knowledge in these aspects in
                      physics to create a realistic game.<br><br>There are many more stories,
                      but I would have to stop. In short, a good tutor will be able to help
                      students break out of their rut and work hard for their goals.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4) Responsibility</span></span><br><br>A good tutor will take responsibility for all of his/her students. Being responsible as a tutor means<br>i) willing and want to take the student all the way to the end of the year<br>ii)
                      do not teach the wrong things. When unsure, state so, and do extensive
                      research before teaching the student the correct things. It is a
                      hideous sin to make the student unlearn wrong things.<br>iii) ensure that the student improve in grades</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To your success :D</p>

              <p>If it's good results of the tutor, there are many around... And
              good results doesn't mean good teaching</p>
              <p>If it's results of the students, i.e. track record, many tutors
              have it as well.</p>
              <p>My point is just sharing some additional info and things to look
              out for that can make those who aspire to be tutors to stand out,

              <p>Track record is the most important. The rest is jsut bull. of course that doesn't mean to say that it doesn't help with the advertising.</p>
              <p>So if you're talking about advertising, then there's also packaging and acting to look commited etc. But end of the day, it's still the track records that's most important. Only when these are equal will they look at anything else (apart from the sex that is out of our hands)</p>
