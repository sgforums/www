              <p> </p>
              <p>Check out the entry requirement. Maths just practice TYS. Keep doing and doing until you sick and tired of it.</p>
              <p>Last time i take 'O' level, i only start to study 2 weeks before. Everyday practice maths TYS and science becoz these 2 are my weakest.</p>
              <p>In the end, maths get C6, just nice to go engineering.</p>

              <p>PedoBear: actually you have a good point, but no matter what, i will still take engineering.. i have many reasons for taking up that course and its my personal interest</p>

              <p>Nope, im not engineer. Doesn't mean you study engineering means you will become engineer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I am not trying to put you off, but i want to warn you about civil engineering. Civil engineering is really not a stroll in the park. You need do alot of drawing, both hand sketch as well as computer drawing ( They call it Autocad all engineering students surely know this ). You need to study about buidlings,bricks etc etc. You need to memorise them. Basically alot of theory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then again, if this is really what you want, go ahead you have my support. If you really have the passion for this, you will clear all these easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh ya, don't worry about engineering maths la. If uncle like me can do well, you surely can. Just listen and you will realise engineering maths and O level maths is 2 different thing.</p>

              <p>Engineering maths is farking easy on its own, but when you need to apply it to statics, and mechanics like in the superposition theory, then the fun begins.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, the above only applies mainly to mechanical and electrical engineering. Civil engineering uses maths in a totally different way. Mainly, I don't really know. Probably statistics?</p>

              <p>I am a mechanical engineer by practice, and I can tell you the real job of an engineer is dirty, low pay, irregular hours, and no work life balance. Those engineers you see sit in front of a desk the whole farking day are just namesake, or they are just there because they finished their tour of duty because they are older, injured, or no longer physically fit enough to undertake their actual duties.</p>
              <p>If I had kids, I wouldn't want them to be engineers, I would prefer they be doctors, lawyers, or bankers, maybe property agents like my friends who earn over 30k a month, and change sports cars like I change my underwear.</p>

              <p>Noel, I want to add on to what ditzy say. Begin an engineer is really not easy. Lets just say, you and another friend la. Your friend study buisness while you study engineering.</p>
              <p>Once you all graduate, you go and become engineer. Your friend is those office desk boy.</p>
              <p>You all take the same pay, but you work longer hours. Then everyday he go to work, nice nice office wear with perfume wah stylo milo. then you t-shirt, jeans and safety shoe.</p>
              <p>After work, your friend take mrt, nice nice still got perfume smell but you take mrt, dirty smelly.</p>
              <p>Your friend always in air con while you always in the hot sun.</p>
              <p>Being engineer good meh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But since you say you really want to become engineer, then go ahead. I hope to see you having the passion and the sense of the satisfactory when you build roads, expressway, shopping centre for people.</p>
              <p>Then next time you can tell your gf, father mother, " Hey i was the one engineer tat build this road, building, expressway etc etc..."</p>
