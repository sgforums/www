              <p><strong>1) Psychology cutoff is low, and it gonna be fun.</strong><br> <br> <strong>Ans:</strong> This is the number one myth. You aren't a full fledge
                  psychologist without a master degree. You will end up as a school
                  councellor perhaps. Also, studying psychology is just like studying
                  bio, its not fun. Its all about purely memorizing framework structure,
                  psychological symptoms.</p>

              imho, the JC route will get u into Uni easier than Poly.
              However, u nd to ask urself, do u like sub like phy bio chem geo eco and so on? becos tt's some of the sub u nd to choose to do in JC. If you dont mind. go JC then. also, if by any chance u realise u dont like psy anymore, u can still choose other course in uni with whatevr sub combi u have for JC.
              Poly is v diff from JC, its a life much more vibrant, u nd to think what to wear everyday cos evryoneis wearring so "outstanding" and many more. So i feelpoly environment nt v condusive for study as you mix w ppl whose L1R5 is like ard 20? (no offences just my opinion, influence does matter)
              overall i courage u to go JC.
              however, at this stage, its impt tt u seek as many viewpoints from various scources as possible, ask ur teachers or seniors or pm forum moderator. B4 u make ur final decision.
              hope it helps.
              cheers

              <p>JC and poly route are different in some ways.  Like Luodaxia1999 said, do seek your answers from different sources B4 you make your final decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you don't mind all the JC subjects and GP, then can consider JC.  But if you want to get started on studying psychology, then should go Poly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Poly, e.g. TP Psychology Studies, you will learn the content (e.g. social psy, devt psy) and also skills (e.g. research skills) that will help you in studying psychology in uni.  Poly studying is also more hands-on and practical.  You get to experience the concepts through projects and also through interactive activitieis that help us understand better.  The knowlegde and skills also prepare for uni.  That is why there are some universities that are offering diploma psychology students exemptions - from 1 to 2 years, depending on which uni you go to.  Can check out e.g. TP Psychology Studies course for information (<a href="http://www-hss.tp.edu.sg/hss_home/hss_courses/hss_ft_courses/hss_courses_ps/hss_courses_psy_advstand.htm">http://www-hss.tp.edu.sg/hss_home/hss_courses/hss_ft_courses/hss_courses_ps/hss_courses_psy_advstand.htm</a>).</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Pohgamv,</p>
              <p>Just to clarify things, if you intend to enter NUS/NTU to study Psychology, the JC route will be a shorter and quicker one, since exemptions for both fore-mentioned universities are at most one semester only.</p>
              <p>I believe that most of the important points have been kindly listed out by our dear forummers here, thus there is no need for me to add in any further input.</p>

              <p>if you think you can take up the challenge of studying subjects you have no desire to study for, den JC will be the faster route, however you run the risk of not getting there, because if you hate the subjects u study (esp. since no real relevance), den gg, cannot meet the requirement for psychology in uni.</p>
              <p>but if u 8 point means u shld be q good at studying those subj that you dun like =P</p>
              <p>all up to you... it's different means to the same end, maybe in jc u have to be more motivated and really PUSH yourself to study those god-forsaken subj... it's like taking those bitter medicine.</p>
              <p>start with the end in mind! =)</p>
