              <p>Actually for students who are less academically inclined or potenial late bloomers, the preferred and more practical choice is to go for a poly diploma first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These days, if you cannot make it to uni through the JC route, you are more or less screwed and have to either retake your "A"s or go to poly to further your studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the diploma, at least it is a professional cert and can at least tide you through before you decide whether you want to study more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This advice is for the less academically inclined people.  Those who are from the elite schools and straight A students can just follow the normal JC route. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  You may visit websites of JCs and look at their subject combinations via MOE's directory of schools:</p>
              <p>  <a href="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/SIS_DirSvc.asp">http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/SIS_DirSvc.asp</a></p>
              <p>  H2 Computing may not be offered in many schools already, but do check this up on your own. It is a sad fact (for many years) that Computing does not have a sizeable enrolment in the schools that offer it, and there is a high risk that it will be taken off the list of subjects in the near future.</p>
              <p>  Perhaps you need to give feedback to your school about its subject offerings being limiting to those who wish to go to JCs.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>dont go JC, go poly.</p>
              <p>you will really suffer in JC since you dont take any pure sciences AND amaths in sec school.</p>
              <p>i rather you work hard and just get into a course of your choice in poly. even poly courses nowadays are harder to get into nowadays.</p>

              <p>Just like many of the others, I will suggest you take the poly route instead of the JC route.</p>
              <p>Do not think that computing is the same in JC as in Sec school, it is on a whole different level, and is often rated by some as even tougher than the three main science subjects.</p>
              <p>By the way, you might want to list what combination of combined sciences you are taking, and whether you are good in your languages or not.</p>

              <p>If you did't take A Math or any Pure Sciences even, and you want to enter the Science Stream in JC, it's practically impossible. You need A Math to take H2 Math, you would need pure sciences to get into the Science subjects. And the thing is you don't want to take Arts.

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I was somewhat in your position. I took D&amp;T back in O'levels without Amaths. When I moved on to a JC, I took H2 Maths, Physics &amp; Geography with H1 Econs. Picking up H2 maths without A Maths background is really really difficult. The bridge between is totally missing. Although there are certain exceptions where I have seen mates without A Maths background getting an A for H2 in A levels.</p>
              <p>Please do consider your options wisely before you choose.</p>

              <p><br>No lor. 3 years A level course may not be as good as 2 years A level course. First, you tend to relax too much in year 1 and you ended up being complacent too, thinking that you studied for 3 years compared to others' 2 years.</p>
