              <p>As usual the question is, <strong>"Where in life do you want to end up at?".  What is your dream job? Will going to a poly/jc help me in my career path? </strong></p>
              <p>Stress is unfortunately a part and parcel of life. You just need to balance life and schoolwork. </p>

              <p>I will suggest going sec 5 and take the O levels exam.</p>
              <p>This will keep you safe when u decide to enter local universities such as NTU and NUS after poly</p>
              <p>If you read http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html &amp; http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/AY12-13_IGP.pdf , it states: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Please note that in addition to the Polytechnic GPA, the 
                          Singapore-Cambridge O-Level results of polytechnic applicants are also 
                          taken into account for university admissions."</span></p>
              <p>Thus even if u end up in poly, you may have problems entering local uni if you don't have o level results. <br>You can call the respective unis to check if they accept PFP or not.</p>
              <p>Please continue studying after poly, im teaching my friend higher nitec electronics, he says he wants a degree cos the engineers there draw out the circuits, all throw to those with ite qualification go solder.</p>
              <p>For army, if you have a diploma or A level, you will have a chance to be commanders such as sergeants or officers, although they have more reservise cycles.<br>Else, you will be enlisted into a 'standard' batch, or mono intake riflemans(like the SIR unit mentioned). <br>Also, if you have diploma / A level, people will treat u with more respect, it is a stereotype thing, like how people say "those with tattoo is ah beng", all this can't be helped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like what summer hill mentioned, what do you want to be next time? To be honest, when im in sec 4, im also lost, duno what i wanna do. <br><br>At that time, teacher keep asking who wan go poly who wan go jc, keep bringing us go career fair, i dun even know what is the point at that time<br><br>I worked in sim lim square as a computer technician after O levels, some of my friends work in handphone shops, some got pregnant, some entered poly and JC.<br><br>I found my interest and passion in poly, but unfortunately, i didn't know that course which matches my passion existed in poly. It was in poly then i realise O level is quite important, i was lucky i didn't do too bad.<br><br>Now after poly im running a rental business renting out professional sound system for events, and a bit of sound engineering, that is my area of interest. There is a bit of electrical engineering involved, and lots challenges like last minute troubleshooting, equipment failures, power trips, not enough wires, etc.<br><br>So the question now is, what do you like to do next time?<br></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Like what the others have said, it would be good if you have an idea on what you want to do. Personally, I had an interest in IT and managed to get into poly doing that. I then realized I was interested in IT security and had the opportunity to specialize in it in poly. So it really boils down to your interest.</p></div>
