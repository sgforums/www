              <p>I just got back my Sec 3 streaming results a couple of days ago and i was shocked to find out that i was streamed into the worst class in express. Worst of all that class does not offer A maths or pure science. My Year End results were quite good as i got 67.4% for the overall and level ranking of 88/199 and an L1R5 aggregate of 13.</p>
              <p>  I was really wondering why they would actually dump me in such a bad class as i worked very hard for this staying back daily for extra remedial lessons since the starting of the year while my friends are out hanging around going to movies. I think the problem lies with my streaming choices as i did not really consider the outcomes for each classes if i were to choose. My current sec 3 class offers Dnt, Combined bio and physics and E maths. I think my school does their streaming according to the subjects which students excel in. For example another boy from another class got the exact same results as mine, and he actually went to the best class as his maths and sci were As. My maths would be considered average C5-B4, and my science were quite good getting B3, but i could have got an A if i have not missed my biology test which is very very easy to score.</p>
              <p>I have a few queries</p>
              <p>1.Will i be able to get into a good course in poly without A maths or attend a good course in university via JC.</p>
              <p>2. Do you think my appeal will be successful as i already appealed to the principal via mail and from my friends i heard that the success rate is 1 out of 10.</p>
              <p>3. Is my future runined without A maths or any pure science.</p>
              <p>I find my school's streaming system very very unfair as they told me that they would be streaming students according to their lvl ranking. (eg. First 40 get into best class, Nxt 40 2nd best class and so on.) Many of my friends who did so much worser than me actually got into much better classes than me as they excel in maths and sci.</p>

              <p>TS may still stand a chance based on merit... at most cramp 1 or 2 more pax in the class.</p>
              <p>honestly, your sci isnt really that bad to begin with.. maths may be lacking, but it shouldnt stop u from taking a maths unless sec 2 maths fail. no pure sci maybe nvm, but its gonna be harder to survive without a maths, unless your path is directed towards humanities, arts [not including econs], social sciences.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I suggest you must take A maths cos it's very important. Maths are quite important for both jc and poly. Hmm.. however if you plan to go jc, pure sci are obviously much prefered over combined sci. Actually, your results are not that bad...i think you should be able to succeed if you appeal..but i'm not too sure of yr sch's current situation. Most of the people who did not have both amaths and pure sci often ended up in poly though.</p></div>

              <p>1. Define good course. If you are talking about things such as H2 Maths in JC, there are JCs such as YJ and JJ which allow you to take it up. With good results (L1R5 &lt;9) including A1 in E. Maths, appealing to get H2 Maths shouldn't be a problem for most other JCs. For polys, usually they have preparatory programs for those without A.Maths, A.K.A. bridging courses.</p>
              <p>2. Well, if everyone else in those classes which have A.Maths and pure science have really good results in these areas (compared to yours), such as B3 and above for Maths and A1/A2 for science, it is unlikely you can appeal successfully. That is because there is a distinct difference in ability (I am sorry if I sound mean to you here) in terms of your ability and their ability. If you can find a few of your friends who have roughly the same maths and science result as you in those classes (preferably same grades in these two areas), then you can use them to argue your way through (Don't worry, since they are already in the class, they won't be taken out because of you).</p>
              <p>3. Don't worry, you can still do well without A.Maths and Pure Science. However, you will be more restricted in terms of combination available in JC. If you take the poly route, you will be fine, though you will likely have to work harder if you take up a course which have to do with the sciences and math.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Shiningstars</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter which class are you posted to. What matter most is how you use this as a motivational force to improve yourself upon. Best/Worst class does not matter as long as you have the right conviction to do well for your exams. You may not be in the best class, but you can show your future classmates your academic ability.</p>
              <p>Ranking, streaming, etc is all based on meritocracy and mariad factors. It doesn't really matter. First you should recompose yourself, and understand the fact that this is the final decision from the school. Second, prepare well for your starting of school next year.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Answering to your questions.</p>
              <p>1) Yes, you will be able to enter poly without A-maths. You will be able to go University via JC route if your results met the requirement.</p>
              <p>GCE A level maths H1/H2 is 10 times harder than what you will learn in Secondary school. It's aren't worth to get upset over the 1/10 fraction of what you didn't get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Firstly, 1 out of 10. This is baseless "prediction". It is dependant on many factors which includes but not limited to your academic performance, classroom size, resource availability, subject combinations. :) Just do well for the next two years. :) Best Class is just a "title" which holds no much values to me. It is the inner character that matter the most.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) No. When I was in Secondary school, I do not take A-maths and Pure Sciences. This will not affect you so much in life.</p>
              <p>I performed reasonably well throughout the three academic years (I'm NA student). Especially in sciences,  I would score excellence for my combined science. For whole 3 years, I performed consistantly well in my sciences. And now, I am Chemistry educator of 6 years.</p>
              <p>I did not take Pure Science in secondary school, and I only had Sci (Chem/Bio) and now I am doing Biomedical Science in RP. Well, I love Learning Biology in a new meaning way.</p>
              <p>Love learning Biology, Love teaching Chemistry~</p>

              <p>TS, I was in the same situation w you. If I'm not wrong, sec2 streaming is purely based on EMS. Bulls**t like F&amp;N and D&amp;T aren't taken into account at all. I scored badly for maths and science and landed up in the worst class in EXP without A Maths/Pure Sci. By the norm, this subject combi is definitely ok if you are intending to go to poly. It is relatively easier to hit a L1R4 of 10points so as to be admitted into almost any poly course of your choice. However you yourself need to work hard too. 10points is also not extremely easy to get even with a relatively slacker subj comb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I took the JC route and took up the sci stream. I chose H2 physics and H2 maths without any pure sci/amaths background. Sure I struggled a lot but luckily I had my tutors and friends for consultation. I'm promoted to J2 next year with average results like Cs. If you want to take the JC route, you really need to have a lot of discipline. In a way, must "psycho" yourself to think that studying is "fun". Haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not over yet. Sec2 streaming is important but still you are still able to path your way out.</p>

              <p>Do not be disheartened by your inability to get into the Pure Science stream.  To do that you need top grades for your Science and Maths.  If you appeal and hope to be listened to , be sincere.  Are you willing to work really really hard? Sometimes hard work alone is not enough, hope you get what I am trying to say.</p>
              <p>Be prepared to do the following in case your appeal is approved.  At least you ensure you do not get retained in Sec 3 for failing Maths</p>
              <p>1.  Revise the  entire Sec 2 Maths syllabus during this year-end school holidays.   If you can score 80-90% for all the end-of-year Sec Two maths papers, you are a suitable candidate.  If you score between 65%-75% , you may be just able to cope with Elementary Maths.  Additional Maths will be tough for you</p>
              <p>2.  Not all of us are good in Maths.  Why not consider the Humanities stream?  Goh Chok Tong was a Science student but studied Economics at the University.  His classmates went on to be Drs, but he rose to be their Health Minister, and ultimately the PM.  ( Goh was in the Science Stream right until the A Levels. ) </p>
              <p>3. Be prepared to practise Maths everyday for the next 4 years, if you want to do the Science or Maths subjects at the University.  Unless you are a 'natural' ie inclined to doing well in Maths....well you know yourself best.</p>
              <p>4. If you are good in Maths, the science subjects are chicken-feed to you.  Get what i am saying?</p>

              <p>1) Yes if your O level result is good enough. However, a lot of
              courses in poly/uni level require you to have A maths background. A
              math is a must if you want to opt for science stream in JC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Unlikely to be successful. Imagine if they were to let you
              switch class, they have to plan your school timetable all over
              again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) LoL. Depends on what you want to study in time to come, if
              you plan to take arts, nobody will give a sh*t about your A math
              and sciences,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why you insist of getting into the "good" class, since you
              mentioned that your friends with lousy results can make it to
              "good" class, then it is not "good" anymore lolll</p>
