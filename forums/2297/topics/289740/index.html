            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you should open by first defining/explaining what is "capital" punishment.<br><br>For every asserrtion you make, you ought to explain the reason behind your assertion. For example, you claim that capital punishment is the worst form of detterent sentence. Don't just leave it hanging there. Explain the basis of your claim.
