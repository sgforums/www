              <p>Hi everyone.</p>
              <p>I am taking Chemistry h2, maths h2 , econs h2 , and general studies in chinese h1. my problem is that i wanted to take physics h1 but my school don't offer it at j1 level. they only have it in j2.</p>
              <p>the problem with general studies in chinese is that it is gp in chinese. I am not good in written chinese even though i speak good chinese. I got a B3 for Higher chinese o level. Most of the people in my General studies in chinese class (10 people only) got A1. I have the lowest grade there. Everyone is in CLEP  or from China. I am intimidated by this.</p>
              <p>also, the teacher said i will have to do the <span style="line-height: 1.231;">general studies in chinese h1 A LEVELS <strong>this year.  in j1!!!! i'm super scared about this. </strong>One year is definitey not enough to improve my chinese. I'm scared i'll get a D or E. </span></p>
              <p>statistics show that the gsc in my school always get below national average. One year got only 2 people get A, another year got 1 person get A , and got one year 60% get A. Its damn inconsistent, which makes me worried.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the only good thing about general studies in chinese is that its one year course, next year no need study...BUT I'M SUPER WORRIED AABOUT A LEVEL THIS YEAR!!!!!</p>
              <p>I want to transfer to do h2 physics. But i'm scared I cannot cope cuz i'lll be taking 4h2s.....i want to take 3h2 and 1h1, but my school got no h1 physics. I am not very talented in physics...but planning to get tuition though..</p>
              <p>what should i do??? H1 gsc or H2 physics????</p>

              <p>there are also a few more things that you may want to consider if you want to take h1 gsc</p>
              <p>- you are taking h1 project work in j1 also. in your 2nd semester you probably be busy rushing through project work and there is also your promotional exam to worry about. the h1 gsc exam should be very near the project work's open presentation date (you should check about that). besides, you might have other commitments like your cca in the 1st year.</p>
              <p>- are you allowed to retake h1 gsc in year 2? if you can, do u think u can cope it with other subjects in year 2?</p>
              <p>if you want to take h2 physics </p>
              <p>- you may want to find out more about what it's about. e.g google the syllabus</p>
              <p>-you have almost 2 years to prepare for a lvls. i may have failed it the promos but i could concentrate later in j2 and make huge improvements. it may not apply to you though..</p>
              <p>- quantum physics is fun for me. so overall i personally recommend you to take h2 physics instead =)</p>

              For biasness, I would take h2 physics, more fun than h1 GSC lol.
              
              But then, nonsense over, I going to tell you my opinion.
              
              Don't be intimdiated about the students in your class. I shall use myself as an example.
              
              I come from a quite bottom rank JC. I take H2 chem for A levels. In my class, most are from pure chem, grades range from B3 to A1. What about me? I took combined chem/bio in O levels, and scored a B3. Yes B3, it's not an A1, and I'm taking h2 chem! 
              
              I worked hard for H2 chem. So I just got back my A levels result this year. I got B for h2 chem. Yes it's a bit disappointing that I didn't get A. Now you ask me how others fare? I tell you the truth, most got C and below. 
              
              What happened? The truth surfaced. Still rmb I say I come frmo a quite bottom rank JC? Here's my observation. If you worked hard, you will do better than those who don't. How hard? That determines on your drive in doing well. 
              
              Why in one year there is 60% A? Maybe that year your school's prelim spotted similar qn in A levels? But then, it's H1 GSC and not h1 econs. It's more likely that in that year, the 10 students WORKED HARD. 
              
              Statistics show data, but it does not explain why % differs every year. 
              
              You already say H1 GSC is tested this year. Use this as an adventage. Concentrate on your H1 GSC &amp; H1 PW (Which depends on your group) a lot more than other subjects. Just make sure your other subjects are at passing range. Pay attention in lectures :). 
              
              If you truly like h1 GSC, don't let other students in your class or the statistics intimidate you. To me, if you worked damn hard, a B grade is more or less guranteed. 
              
              On the other hand, like what the above person said, if you do not know what h2 physics is about/do not like physics in O levels, DO NOT TAKE H2 PHYSICS. 
              
              Do reply us about ur decision :)
