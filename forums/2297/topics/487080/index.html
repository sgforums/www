              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">  There has been increasing awareness but I guess there's still a form of stigma with regard to pursue for these professions which are often deemed as unconventional or under-appreciated, and difficult to "succeed" in Singapore. The nature of Singapore's economic function further discourages and limits the proliferation of such. Before making changes to the education system, the mindset and the goal of the nation has to change first.</span></p>

              <p>The SG system has always been receiving a lot of flak for only raising a generation of very good test takers. And it's true, because when you go on to uni, you realize you don't even use half of what you learnt once you specialize. And then when you go out and work, you realize you don't even use 95% of what you learnt in uni...</p>
              <p>Problem is, no one's found a better way to efficiently teach a whole population of students than standardized education. Ideally you want to be able to cater to each student's unique passions and strengths like the OP said, but that requires targeted teaching for each student. Perhaps the closest you can get to that is home schooling, which is still rare in SG.</p>
              <p>And even when schools try to reduce emphasis on exam grades, it's the parents who freak out. Just look at when they say they want to do away with PSLE, many of the parents are the ones who say they need it ugh.</p>
