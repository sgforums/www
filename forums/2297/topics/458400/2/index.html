You'd never get a good grade throughout your whole JC life but you could still do well in As. It really depends on your tenacity etc. As for me, I went to NYP to study a science-related course. As such, you may want to consider going to the poly if you want to take on a different route for a refreshing start.

              <p>Hey Amenamy,</p>
              <p>Coming from the perspective of someone who went through the IB system (similar to the 'A' level programme you take in JC,<strong> I feel that it really depends on what you like to study and learn.</strong> This answer sounds vague but let me share my experiences and thoughts to help you better understand.</p>
              <p>The JC system is really academically rigorous. Like math, economics, biology, literature, english, etc. <strong>Good if you want to improve your general skillsets and if you want to be the next doctor, lawyer, engineer, investment banker, accountant and the other professions. </strong>I highly recommend you to take the JC route if you are passionate about the above occupations. With that said, some of these JC kids seem to be 'smarter' and get university degrees and get high paying jobs in MNC's, whatever.</p>
              <p>That said, if I were to reflect back on the moment of choice whether I should have gone to a polytechnic or not, I would have chosen polytechnic IF I already had something I was clearly passionate about in my mind like aerospace engineering. <strong>Once you exit from polytechnic with a diploma, you get a specific skillset</strong>. I work in printing firm with an 'A' level degree and not having any specialized skills. My fellow colleague who is a designer is able to do web design, t-shirt design, use Photoshop like a pro, take photos and videos with skill and man, I wish I had those skills. I wish I had someone to mentor me during my course of study to do that! Of course, you can argue that I could have just learnt Photoshop in my spare time. But when you're mugging your ass off for the subjects, it will take extra discipline for you to find time to do things you like. </p>
              <p>My point is that <strong>poly students, imo, are better equipped with industry-needed knowledge and skills. </strong>Like practical skills. Some JC kids just study their ass off just because the world is doing it. They feel safe that they are getting their A's when they don't really know what they want. They just follow the crowd. I would think that poly students are different.</p>
              <p>In fact, it doesn't matter where you come from (as lame and cliche as it sounds). I have a friend who is a poly dropout who is starting up his own business. Heck, even if you are from ITE, you can be successful if you have the desire to be. I'm in NUS now, and I know some people who are just drifting in life not knowing what they want. It doesn't matter which path you take as long as you know your goal. And get a mentor. So... <strong>for me, the final verdict is it doesn't matter.</strong></p>
              <p>Anyway, check out my website - www.goteambim.com</p>
              <p>Cheers bro,<br>Edward</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>depends on whether you know what you want in life. if you have a goal and you are self-driven, poly is the way to go IMO. I came from poly and i worked very hard to get into uni. though jc has greater advantage in terms of theory. ESP if you want to be engineer, or you going into subjects that are very theory based such as engineering, physics, chemistry etc... you have to understand that if you are a poly student and you may not be as quick in understanding in theory like them. Poly is very much spoonfeeding and it is really up to you to drive yourself and learn more on yourself. But i totally loved the freedom poly has given me. do take into the consideration on the fact that if you want to go university through poly, you really have to work extra harder to achieve good gpa. and it wud be better if your course in poly can be sth related to where you are going in uni. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Choose wisely and don't regret at all. Make wise and known decisions.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p></div>

I have reasons for wanting to go both.<br><br>Poly<br>1) I know exactly what course I want, Engineering with minor in business, only available at ngee ann poly.<br>2) More relevant to real life work<br>3) Nicer campus<br>4) More lax environment (I not very good with stress)<br>5) Generally better atmosphere<br><br>JC<br>1) Even though I don't like it, I do better in academic things than hands on<br>2) More 'student feel'<br>3) I cfm plus chop want to go uni<br>4) Everyone telling me go JC<br>5) 2 years, shorter than 3 years in poly<br><br>So I really dunno what to do.

It's probably normal that now you are undecided because of the influence of judgement from people around you. I would say at this very moment, you are probably in a dilemma and fearful of making a wrong decision, but then again, at your current age, it's also time to explore what you really want because only when you are exposed to that environment, you would eventually adapt to it and slowly come to a realization of your want or don't want. Eventually, whatever you pick up whether from JC or from Poly will always stay with you.</p></div>

              <div class="postbody">Wow the "O" Level results seem to be out already today. So did any of you guys here took it last year?<br><br><br>From what i rmb JC mainly deals in academic work like written exams so if you are someone 
              who does very well in studying, then the A Levels might be for you! However, for Poly the grades are splitted into acdemic and project based grading where about half or 60% of your scores come from written exams and the rest from projects. (the percentage might vary for different modules and schools). So good luck if have a team full of slackers! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></div>
              <div class="postbody"><br></div>
              <div class="postbody">Also, JC students do have a much higher chance of getting into NUS, NTU and
               SMU then all the Poly students. A lesson that i learnt when jumping from JC to Poly.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"> Imagine all your ex JC classmates all preparing for Uni after the "A" Levels and you are still stuck in Poly.

              <div class="postbody"><br>However, one disadvantage of JC is that you would have to work very very hard all the way throughout the two 
              years year as it is REALLY much harder then "O" Levels. Also do not worry if you do get retain as I have friends who got retain and still got into NUS,NTU or SMU. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif">  The key thing is to WORK HARD! hahaha. <br></div>

              <p>Hi. Good afternoon. </p>
              <p>I took my O levels in 2012 and went to Millennia Institute in 2013 through last year's JAE. At the end of year 1, I only passed one H2 and two H1 subjects and was asked to retain another year at Millennia Institute. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The teachers at Millennia Institute told me that actually, given my performance(passing 2 H1 and 1 H2 subjects) at the end of last year, I can be advanced to year 2 this year but because they believe in me, and I said myself that I want to go to local university, they decided to retain me in year 1 this year.</span></p>
              <p>I regretted not appealing to advance to year 2 this year. After all, even if I get the momentum right only in March this year, I can start together with my peers now at secondary school who would go to Junior College and start their the A  levels in March. Besides, I have been waiting to get to Year 2 so that I can attend tuition at tuition centres (that only cater to JC curriculum). Somehow, Millennia Institute never asked me about these plans and MI refused to see the potential of me doing well in Year 2. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I have peers who got the same kind of results (some worse than me) and were also 'retained' last year. They appealed to be advanced to Year 2 this year and all of their appeals were accepted. I regretted not appealing to advance to Year 2 this year.</span></p>
              <p>Last week, I went back to Millennia Institute for the first time to attend the school's programme for Year 1 retainees. During the programme, we retainees were reminded about Millennia Institute's percentage of Year 3 students going to Local Universities after their A levels: Statistics show that on average, only ~30% of Year 3 students make it to Local Universities. We were asked to re-consider other options, besides Millennia Institute, and were told that we can apply to schools this week during the this year's JAE (which ends on Friday). I<span style="line-height: 1.231;">am sure the teachers who said this were referring to us as a whole, as there are people who do not have the heart to be in Millennia Institute but stayed on because they may not be aware of other options. Nonetheless, the 30% average of Year 3 students going to Local Univerisities shocked me.</span></p>
              <p>Right now, I am doubting that Millennia Institute is the right option for me to get to the Local Universities. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am thinking of changing school as elsewhere seems to have better prospectives, of having a larger percentage of students going to Local Universities. Besides, the life elsewhere seems to be easier than life in Millennia Institute. Maybe Millennia Institute is just not my cup of tea. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I have already wasted last year and I do not want to waste anymore time. I intend to take this opportunity to apply to Polytechnic courses through the JAE that is now on. </span></p>
              <p>However, there is this thing in Polytechnic that has deterred me from choosing the Polytechnic route and discouraged my parents from allowing me to go to Polytechnic, which is why I am now in Millennia Institute: Peer evaluation.</p>
              <p>I am diagnosed with Autism and I took my O levels as a Special Needs candidate in 2013. I am worried (my parents are even more worried) that Peer evaluation would be at my disadvantage when I go to Polytechnic. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am worried that I may end up being sabotaged by my group mates, if I go to Polytechnic. Even if I actively contribute correct effort to the project, or even do the entire project myself while the rest slack, my group mates may sabo me in peer evaluation and cause me to lose out. This is the reason why my parents refused to let me go to Polytechnic, which I also agree after I know about it. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, I went to Millennia Institute, but I could not catch-up with my peers and had to retain this year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This year's JAE is now on until friday. I am thinking of changing to Polytechnic because the chances of going to Polytechnic is higher and life at Polytechnic seems easier. Yet, similar to last year, I am held back because of my Autism condition.</span></p>
              <p>Should I stay on as a Year 1 retainee in Millennia Institute, or should I go ahead and change to Polytechnic?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">On the positive side, Polytechnic school fees, although expensive($600 per semester), is lower than the school fees for University, including most Local University courses. Besides, the promotion at Polytechnic, based on what I see at my peer's facebook profile, is done every semester, instead of Yearly in Millennia Institute and Junior College. Even if I failed a promotion exercise in Polytechnic, the money and time wasted are both less than if I fail a promotion exercise in Millennia Institute/Junior College. Nonetheless, this is the positive side at last resort, </span><em style="line-height: 1.231;">when there is nothing else to be glad about</em><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. Nobody wants to stayback and Everyone wants to have a smooth road in Education. Likewise, I also want to have a smooth journey in Polytechnic, get a good Poly. score upon Poly. graduation and go to a good course in Local University.</span></p>
              <p>The real positive side if I go to Polytechnic, would be that Polytechnic is similar to University and the working environment outside. Even if I fail a semester in Polytechnic because of Peer evaluation, the costs is.... (well, this is at last resort, and I have already wrote about it just now).</p>
              <p>Even if I continue my studies in Millennia Institute, I would still have to go to University eventually, where the environment would be just as realistic as in Polytechnic. So why not deal with it now, rather than avoid it and have to deal with it later?</p>
              <p>I am trying to use the real positive side to convince myself and my parents that it is safe for me to go to Polytechnic, despite my diagnosed condition. </p>
              <p>Honestly, my heart has never really settled down in Millennia Institute. All along, my interest has been on some Polytechnic courses but because of the Autism condition I have, (my parents and) I am(are) deterred from going to Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>I have been forcing myself to settle down here, which worked towards the last exam last year, before I was told that I had to retain this year. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">If staying on in Millennia Institute is the only choice for me, I will accept fate and let my heart settle down in Millennia Institute, to concentrate on studying in Millennia Institute.</span></p>
              <p>Should I stay on in Millennia Institute, or should I go to Polytechnic? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Am I right to have that mindset, to convince myself and my loved ones that I should go to Polytechnic?</span></p>
              <p>Please tell me your opinions, on whether or not I should stay on in Millennia Institute, or apply to Polytechnic. Thank you.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Your decision, whatever it may be, will likely have a tremendous impact on the rest of your life, so it's only right that you make your own decision for yourself, and not be unduly influenced by other people's opinions (no matter how well meaning).</p>
              <p>So I'm not here to tell you to stay in MI or go to Poly. I'm here to give you an additional suggestion that you can take up, whether you're in MI or in Poly : simultaneously take A levels as a private candidate while you continue studying in MI, or simultaneously take A levels as a private candidate while you transfer over to a Polytechnic and start your studies there.</p>
              <p>The brilliance of my suggestion, is that it potentially saves you time because you can do this simultaneously while studying in MI or in Poly. Of course, to pull it off successfully, you need self-discipline, self-motivation, and good time management. And you have to be street smart about handling your absence from your MI or Poly during your private A level exam period. And you also have to do your homework and check with the Universities, on criteria or prerequisites when applying to your intended Uni course (eg. how will your lack of PW be calculated in, or if they will use your PW grade in MI, etc). But the potential benefit (if you succeed) is that you have more options open to you (compared to MI alone, or Poly alone). For instance, if you do decently well in the 2014 private A levels, you might then be able to do very well in the 2015 private A levels, and save 1 year (compared to graduating from MI in 2016, which would be the case if you're retained in MI Yr 1 in 2014).</p>
              <p>So this is just my humble but brilliant (oxymoron deliberate) suggestion. It's up to you to take it up. But between MI and Poly (ie. your original dilemma), you really gotta decide for yourself. You already know the details of your situation and the pros vs cons of your dilemma, as well as or even better than anyone else here, so heed your own advice, and live life with no regrets (no matter how you decide).</p>
