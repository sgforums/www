"Dear Examiner/Marker Sir/Mdm, I regret to inform that the question has failed to unambiguously state whether the contraction of gases referred to the product gases or the reactant gases. As such, I am left with no choice but to provide alternative workings and answers below. On the left below, I assume contraction of product gases. On the right below, I assume contraction of reactant gases. Thank you very much Sir/Mdm, for your kind understanding in this critical matter."</p>

              <p>WhySoSerious28 asked me :<br><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I noticed that you are a former school lecturer-thats cool. Mind sharing why you left the teaching service? &lt;&lt;&lt;</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ho ho ho! The million dollar question. If I had a dollar for every time I was asked this question... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>But seriously, while I could go on and on about the frustrations of being within the system and how I resolutely reject to be part of a flawed education mechanism that I feel does not augur well for future generations and the well being of humanity; but essentially and ultimately these are only a part of my list of dozens of reasons why I resigned - in nature some more personal, some more professional, some more ideological, some more practical, and so on. And they (these multiple reasons) would *ALL* be true, relevant and contributive (only to differing extents or in differing ways) to my ultimate decision to resign from the MOE teaching service.</p>
              <p>I certainly do not regret joining MOE when I did (and still would have done so given the chance to do it all over again), just as I recognize the crucial timeliness, opportuneness and congruousness of resigning and leaving the system exactly when I did. (Perhaps exactly why I left *when* I did, involves a more specific set of reasons, more personal in nature, than the dozens of reasons why leave at all; or to be precise why I knew it was only a matter of time that I inevitably leave).<br> <br>Am I bitter about the education system or anti-MOE? Not at all, and quite the contrary. I do sincerely and heartily encourage students interested in a teaching career or joining the MOE teaching profession, to give it their best shot to do so. In fact, I'm hoping to see more young people with a sincere passion in teaching and in helping others learn (prerequisites for being a good teacher, whether as a private tutor, or as an MOE teacher), choose teaching as a career over say, the financial sector.</p>
              <p>(We shall refraining from hijacking and digressing this thread into an intellectual (and forseeably) emotional discussion over which group of people contribute significantly more to the betterment, progress and advancement of humanity - the finance / economics / bankers / business admins / stock-market / wall-street, versus scientists / researchers / engineers / doctors; and how motivated by material and financial greed, we see an increasing trend (notably in Singapore, but also worldwide including UK and USA) of technological-to-finance brain drain whereby the top scholars and brightest sparks of the next generation are in increasing numbers choosing the banking &amp; finance sector, over the science &amp; technology sector, reflected by way of an increasing disparity in popularity of University degrees, pursued careers and long-term focus. Like I said, we'll not go there.)</p>
              <p>So to all of you young folks out there who have a genuine passion for particular academic subjects (eg. Chemistry) *and* a genuine passion for teaching and helping others learn, do give due thought and consideration to a teaching career as an MOE teacher.</p>
              <p>If, like myself, you find your professional life as an education officer inside MOE to be incompatible (in principle or in practice or in any irreconciliable fashion) to your own personal objectives or values in life, then fret not (for your rice bowl or bread &amp; butter), because (on the mandatory assumption that you're a genuinely effective teacher/tutor, of course) giving private tuition to students in today's merciless education system (and unforgiving paper chase societal dogma) in Singapore, will always remain a beneficial and ethical service, and one in which you can (reasonably) reliably find feasible employment, with a bonus of having the personal fulfillment of being self-directed (as your own boss).</p>

              <p>How to determine limiting reactant :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Compare Experiment Mole Ratio (of 1st reactant to 2nd reactant) versus Equation Mole Ratio (of 1st reactant to 2nd reactant). Eg. hydrogen:oxygen (experiement) versus hydrogen:oxygen (equation).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Having calculated numerical values for the two ratios (eg. 4.5 vs 4.3), write the inequality sign between them (eg. 4.5 &gt; 4.3).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Highlight (eg. circle) the name of the numerator reactant (eg. "hydrogen"), for both experiment and equation mole ratios.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Interpret your findings, eg. "The hydrogen we have in the experiment is greater than the hydrogen we need in the equation, hence hydrogen is the excess reactant and therefore oxygen is the limiting reactant".</p>

              <p>Let coefficient of H2O be x.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NO2 + xH2O ---&gt; N2O + HNO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then coefficient of HNO3 becomes 2x.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NO2 + xH2O ---&gt; N2O + 2xHNO3</p>

              <p>NO2 + xH2O ---&gt; yN2O + 2xHNO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then coefficient of NO2 becomes 2x+2y.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(2x+2y)NO2 + xH2O ---&gt; yN2O + 2xHNO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at oxygen, we have :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2(2x+2y) + x = y + 6x</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simplifying, we get :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>x = 3y</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that x is the larger value here, and y the smaller value.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, let y be the smallest possible integer, ie. 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consequently, y = 1, x = 3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Substituting these values, we obtain the balaced equation :</p>
              <p>(8)NO2 + (3)H2O ---&gt; (1)N2O + (6)HNO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the systematic way of balancing equations that I teach to my students. I always remind my students, "Algebra is your friend who is here to make your life easier, so use it whenever you can in Chemistry calculations!"</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soln :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I spotted an error in the question, which makes it impossible to do the question correctly. Common sense dictates that the Ka value for the monohydrogen carbonate ion should be smaller (ie. weaker acid) than the Ka value for dihydrogen carbonate aka carbonic acid (obviously a stronger acid).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 25 deg C, the correct Ka values should be 4.2 x 10^-7 for carbonic acid, and 4.8 x 10^-11 for the monohydrogen carbonate acid. The correct Kb values should hence be 2.4 x 10^-8 for the monohydrogen carbonate base, and 2.1 x 10^-4 for the carbonate ion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 25 deg C, the Ka value for phenol should be 1.3 x 10^-10, and the Kb value for phenoxide ion is 7.7 x 10^-5.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that the strongest acid is carbonic acid, then phenol, then monohydrogen carbonate ion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that the strongest base is carbonate ion, then phenoxide ion, then monohydrogen carbonate ion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on the dilution effect,</p>
              <p>the new molarity of carbonate ions would be 0.5 mol/dm3.</p>
              <p>the new molarity of phenol would be 0.3565 mol/dm3. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine hypothetically that, disregarding Ka value (for the sake of explaining an important concept here), ALL of the acidic protons from phenol (the only significant source of acidic protons) were dissociated into solution; we would have 0.3565 mol/dm3 of protons that would be snatched up by two competing bases - 0.5 mol of carbonate ions (from strong electrolyte aqueous sodium carbonate) and 0.3565 mol of phenoxide ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since carbonate ions are stronger bases than phenoxide ions, all of the acidic protons would be snatched by the carbonate ions to form monohydrogen carbonate ions (which being a weaker acid than phenol, would not transfer protons over to the phenoxide ions to form phenol). In fact, there would still be 0.5 - 0.3565 = 0.1435 mol of carbonate ions present, that are stronger bases than the 0.3565 mol of phenoxide ions present.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That being the case (the fact that there is still a significant percentage of carbonate ions (the strongest base of the 3 species) that are still unprotonated), you would certainly not expect any of the monohydrogen carbonate ions to have the opportunity to be protonated to form dihydrogen carbonate aka carbonic acid, which is our only hope of obtaining / releasing from solution carbon dioxide guess. </p>

              <p>'O' &amp; 'A' Level Qn.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Describe and explain how the QA test for nitrate(V) anion works.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Adding aluminium (or zinc) reduces nitrate(V) anion to ammonium cation. (Prove this to yourself by checking the oxidation state of nitrogen in these ions.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NO3- + 10H+ + 8e- --&gt; NH4+ + 3H2O   (standard reduction potential = +0.87V)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hydroxide ion (from aqueous sodium hydroxide added) then combines with the ammonium ion in an equilibirum reaction as follows :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NH4+(aq) + OH-(aq) &lt;---&gt; NH3(aq) + H2O(l)</p>
              <p>NH3(aq) &lt;---&gt; NH3(g)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ammonia gas liberated turns moist red litmus paper blue. The process is the direct opposite of the above - ammonia undergoes hydrolysis ("moist" litmust) to produce OH- ions, which are responsible for turning red litmus paper blue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heating provides activation energy to overcome the hydrogen bonding to allow aqueous ammonia to vapourize into gaseous ammonia.<br> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Qn : Explain why it is necessary to acidify aqueous silver(I) nitrate(V), AgNO3(aq), before testing a solution for chloride ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans : There are 2 reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, to avoid false positive ppt formed, from any carbonate ion that might be present. All carbonates are insoluble (ie. they form ppts) except Na+, K+, NH4+. Adding acid will protonate any carbonate ions present, removing them from solution in the form of CO2(g). Hence if a ppt is still formed, it has to be silver chloride.</p>
              <p>2H+(aq) + CO3 2-(aq) --&gt; H2CO3(aq) --&gt; CO2(g) + H2O(l)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, to avoid false positive ppt formed, from any hydroxide ion that might be present. Hydroxide ions will combine with silver ions, to form silver(I) oxide, a brown ppt. (To balance the equation that forms this ppt, add water molecules on RHS). Adding acid will remove any hydroxide ions present, forming water. Hence if a ppt is still formed, it has to be silver chloride.</p>

              <p>For (electron orbital) hybridization (eg. sp, sp2, sp3, etc), look at the electron geometry, rather than the molecular geometry. If you don't know the difference between the 2, here's an example : the electron and molecular geometries of the tetrachloromonoiodide ion ICl4-, is octahedral and square planar respectively. The negative formal charge lies on the central iodine atom.</p>

              <p>Q1) What is the correct order for the enthaply of combustion from the least exothermic to the most exothermic?</p>
              <p>But-1-ene, trans-but-2-ene, cis-but-2-ene</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggestion :</p>
              <p>The larger the magnitude difference between the stability of reactants and products, the more exothermic (or endothermic) the reaction.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself which is more stable, trans or cis isomer? Cis isomers have bulky side chains which suffer from steric or van der Waals repulsion. You should be aware that healthy cis-fatty acids are altered to form toxic, cancer-causing trans-fatty acids when foods are cooked, worst of all deep fried (google Aajonus Vonderplanitz for more info on diet and health). And the position of the double bond in alkenes, relates directly to stability of the alkene : electron donating alkyl groups stabilize the double bond in alkenes. So does but-1-ene have more alkyl groups next to the C=C, or does the cis/trans isomers of but-2-ene?</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p>Q2) Ethanal reacts with CN- from HCN in the presence of a weak base.</p>
              <p>In a similar reaction, -CH2COCH3 ions are generated when CH3COCH3 reacts with a strong base. Which one of the following compounds is the product when ethanal reacts with -CH2COCH3?</p>
              <p>A. CH3CH(OH)CH2COCH3                     B (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CHO</p>
              <p>C (CH3)2C(CHO)CH2OH                         D (CH3)2C(OH)COCH3</p>
              <p>Suggestion :</p>
              <p>The carbanion nucleophile generated attacks the delta-positive carbonyl carbon in an nucleophilic addition reaction. Draw the Kekule structures and mechanism to figure out which option is the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3)  Which of the following processes are both the enthalpy change H and S are positive.</p>
              <p>A C2H4(g) + H2(g) --&gt;C2H6(g)</p>
              <p>B H2O(s) ---&gt; H2O(g)</p>
              <p>C H2O2(l) --&gt;H2O(l) + 1/2O2(g)</p>
              <p>D NH4NO3 (s) + aq --&gt; NH4+(aq) + NO3-(aq)</p>
              <p>Suggestion :</p>
              <p>Entropy - Compare LHS vs RHS. Gases have highest degree of disorderliness, followed by aqueous, lastly solid. When both sides have the same state, compare no. of moles.</p>
              <p>Enthalpy - For some reactions, use the Data Booklet bond enthalpies/energies data to determine endo or exo. For others, like (B), changing of state, is pretty obvious whether endo or exo. For others, like (D), you should know that by Hess Law, Solution enthaply = (endothermic) Lattice Dissociation enthalpy + (exothermic) Hydration enthalpy (which is the ion-dipole interactions between polar water molecule and the cations &amp; anions).</p>
              <p>[Updated 20 Sept 08 : Regarding option 4 (dissolving or solution of ammonium nitrate into water).</p>
              <p>This is a well known endothermic reaction (ie. your hand feels cold when holding the test tube containing the reaction mixture).</p>
              <p>What about entropy change? This is trickier than at first glance.</p>
              <p>Entropy would both increase and decrease (there will be of course either a net increase or decrease, overall) for the following reasons :</p>
              <p>1) Entropy would be expected to increase because solid state to aqueous state involves an obvious increase in disorderliness.</p>
              <p>2) Entropy would be expected to decrease because of ion-dipole interactions between water molecules and cations &amp; anions (charge density and hence ion-dipole interactions is always higher &amp; stronger for cations than anions, do you know why?). Disorderly water molecules now arrange themselves in an orderly fashion around the ions, particularly those of high charge density (eg. Al3+, Fe3+). For the NH4+ ion, each H atom is capable of forming extra strong (since the positive formal charge on N is strongly electron withdrawing by induction) hydrogen bonds with the solvent water molecules, decreasing entropy.</p>
              <p>3) Entropy would also be expected to decrease slightly because of a lowered temperature (due to the reaction being endothermic), and hence less kinetic energy results in less disorderliness of all species present, ions and molecules.</p>
              <p>Overall, entropy entropy change would have to take into consideration both the simultaneous increase and decrease in entropy (as discussed above).</p>
              <p>But because we know all nitrate(V) compounds and all ammonium compounds are soluble (which means of course, ammonium nitrate is certainly soluble!), meaning that the solution (dissolving) is a feasible &amp; spontaneous process, so by Gibbs Free Energy formula (delta G = delta H - T delta S), we surmise that the entropy change must be positive (ie. favourable) and large enough to overcome the unfavourable (endothermic) enthalpy change.</p>
              <p>Hence, both options B and D are correct.<br>  </p>
              <p>Q4) The reaction between X and Y is given as 2X + 2Y --&gt; 2XY. The mechanism of the reaction is as shown below:</p>
              <p>2X &lt;---&gt; X2</p>
              <p>X2 + Y --&gt; XY + X(radical)    slow</p>
              <p>X(radical) + Y --&gt; XY</p>
              <p>Which of the following statement is true?</p>
              <p>1. Doubling the concentration of X doubles the rate of reaction</p>
              <p>2. Doubling the concentration of X and Y increases the rate of reaction by 8 times</p>
              <p>3. The overall order of the reaction is 3.</p>
              <p>Suggestion :</p>
              <p>- The slow step is the rate determining step in which the stoichiometry of the elementary equation will reveal the order of the reaction with regards to the reactants. (note that you can't use stoichiometry for overall equation to determine order of reaction, you can only use stoichiometry on the rate determining elementary equation to determine order of reaction).</p>
              <p>- The formation of the free radical is usually the slow step, and the subsequent reaction of the free radical is the extremely fast step, because free radicals are highly unstable and thus highly reactive.</p>
              <p>- If the rate determining step involves intermediates (eg. X2), we have to substitute another expression for X2 into the rate equation, because we do not want intermediates as part of the rate equation. From the 1st step (the association of two X atoms to form an X2 molecule), we obtain the expression k1[X]^2 = k2[X2] ==&gt; [X]^2 = [X2](k2)/(k1). Substituting this expression into the rate equation of Rate = k3 [X2] [Y], we obtain the final rate equation of Rate = k [X]^2 [Y]. In other words, the reaction is 2nd order in X and 1st order in Y.</p>

              <p>Q5) Which of the following are species of electrophilies?</p>
              <p>1. Br2, NO2+</p>
              <p>2. AlCl3, HNO3</p>
              <p>3. Na+, (CH3)C+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggestions :</p>
              <p>Electrophiles are formal positive or partial positive charged species that invite attack by nucleophiles (species that have at least one available lone pair for donation). As for diatomic molecules like Br2, there can be instantaneous or induced dipoles that cause a shift in electron density between the atoms, resulting in a delta-positive or delta-negative, the delta-positive functioning as an electrophile to be attacked by nucleophiles such as the pi-bond of an alkene.</p>
              <p>Note that electrophiles must have energetically accessible orbitals for attack by nucleophiles. For instance, NH4+ is not an electrophile because being in Period 2, nitrogen does not have empty d orbitals to expand its octet, thus it cannot be attacked by nucleophiles, even if it has a positive formal charge on the nitrogen.</p>
              <p>That being said, there can be instances where resonance will result in energetically accessible orbitals being freed up in an electrophile to enable nucleophilic attack. For instance, draw the Kekule structure of NO2+. Initially, the main resonance contributor (ie. the main Kekule structure) is O=N+=O, two double bonded oxygens with a central positive formal charged nitrogen. Although N is in Period 2 and cannot expand its octet, when the nucleophile (eg. pi-electrons of benzene ring) attacks the N, one of the pi-bonds between N and O will shift over to become a lone pair on O, resulting in a negative formal charge on that O. The final NO2 attached to the benzene ring (for instance, if this was an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction), has 2 formal charges which cancel out : a +ve formal charge on N (because it only has 4 valence electrons from 4 bond pairs, but it is in group V; but note that it certainly has a stable octet), and a -ve formal charge on one of the Os.</p>
              <p>Futher comments on this Qn :</p>
              <p>1. Br2, NO2+</p>
              <p>2. AlCl3, HNO3</p>
              <p>3. Na+, (CH3)C+</p>
              <p>Br2, NO2+, (CH3)C+ are hence functional electrophiles as explained above. AlCl3 functions as an Lewis acid by accepting an electron pair from a nucleophile (since the Al does not yet have a stable octet in AlCl3, and is willing to accept an electron pair from a Cl2 molecule, forming -AlCl4 and a Cl+ electrophile). The Kekule structure of HNO3 has a negative formal charge on the O, and a positive formal charge on the N. However, HNO3 or nitric acid, functions as an acid (proton donor) or a base (proton acceptor, in the case of reacting with sulfuric acid in the nitrating mixture), an also as a strong oxidizing agent (eg. with Bart Simpson adding ethanol to nitric acid), but not so much as either a nucleophile or an electrophile (note that it has both a positive and a negative formal charge side by side on the N and O, which repels incoming electrophiles and nucleophiles respectively. Moreover, if HNO3 were to behave as an electrophile, and a nucleophile successfully attacks the positive formal charged N, to avoid violating the octet rule, one of the pi-bonds with oxygen will have to become a lone pair on the oxygen, resulting in a species with too many negative formal charges to be stable; bearing in mind that being a strong acid, the acidic proton would also dissociate resulting in yet another negative formal charge for yet another O in the species, which is too unstable). </p>
              <p>As for Na+, it has neither the inclination nor tendency to accept electron pairs - Na desperately wants to be oxidized to Na+ (enegretically stable octet), which will resist efforts to be reduced back to Na.</p>
              <p>A carbocation has 3 bond pairs and 0 lone pairs, it certainly functions well as an electrophile. And the 3 methyl groups are electron donating by induction, stabilizing somewhat the carbocation allowing it to exist long enough as an electrophile species.</p>
              <p> <br>Q6) Manganese (IV) oxide acts as a catalyst in the decomposition of H2O2 to O2. What alteration to the original experimental conditions would increase the volume of O2 produced over time?</p>
              <p>1. adding more H2O2</p>
              <p>2. lowering the temperature</p>
              <p>3. adding more H2O</p>
              <p>Suggestion :</p>
              <p>Adding more H2O2 reactant would obviously result in more O2 product over (a long period of) time.</p>
              <p>The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is exothermic (determine this using bond enthalpies in Data Booklet), so heat is regarded as a product; hence lowering the temperature (ie. reducing the availability of a product) will result in position of equilibirum to be shifted to the RHS, product favoured reaction, so more O2 will be produced at equilibrium, assuming this is an equilibrium reaction.</p>
              <p>But is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide an equilibrium reaction? One of the products, O2, is gaseous, which means that it will leave the reaction mixture, and hence pull over the position of equilibrium completely to the RHS. Hence decomposition of H2O2 is certainly *not* an equilibrium reaction. Hence, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide would be complete (after a long period of time) anyway, and hence lowering temperature does not make a difference (over a long period of time).</p>
              <p>Adding more water does two things - increases molarity of product water, and dilutes molarity of reactant hydrogen peroxide. In regard to kinetics, you'd expect lowerig molarity of reactant would result in a slower rate of O2 produced. And again, assuming it is an equilibirum reaction, you'd expect increasing molarity of RHS product would shift position of equilibriuim to the LHS, resulting in less O2 produced. But because the gaseous product O2 pulls the position of equilibrium completely to the RHS, hence over a long period of time, adding water doesn't affect the final volume of O2 produced (apart from having an additionally small percentage of oxygen gas dissolving into a greater quantity of water).</p>
