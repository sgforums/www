              <p>"If carbon emissions are not cut by 25 percent to 40 percent by the year 2020, higher ocean temperatures could kill off vast marine ecosystems and half the fish in them, according to the WWF." - Straits Times 14 May 09</p>

              <p>Explain why increasing ocean temperatures (eg. from 20 deg C to 25 deg C; nowhere near denaturation temperatures for enzymes yet) will kill off corals and fishes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solubility of dissolved oxygen decreases significantly with temperature. Gaseous oxygen has more energy than aqueous (dissolved) oxygen. The forward reaction for O2(aq) to O2(g) is endothermic. Hence increasing temperature pulls the position of equilibrium even further over to the right (in the first place, oxygen is rather insoluble in water because it is non-polar, and it doesn't ionise in water either, hence remains largely insoluble. Elitist/snobbish water would rather hydrogen bond with itself (ie. other water molecules), than bother with weaker permanent dipole - induced dipole interactions with oxygen. "It's beneath our social class." "Not a profitable/worthy thermodynamic investment.").</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Increasing temperature provides increased kinetic energy to the aqueous oxygen molecules, to overcome the weak permanent dipole - induced dipole interactions between the non-polar oxygen molecules and the polar water molecules. The increased kinetic energy of the oxygen molecules, results in dissolved oxygen molecules escaping from the warmed ocean waters as oxygen gas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the reason why boiling water removes dissolved oxygen gas, and why fishes put in boiled water will die of oxygen deprivation. When you boil water, the bubbles of gas you see, are not merely dissolved oxygen, but all dissolved gases, including (especially near boiling point), primarily water vapour itself, H2O(g).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There is one other interesting point to note in this discussion, a biological one. Fish, being cold blooded, will have their metabolism (ie. biochemical reactions in the body, invariably involving enzymes) increase accordingly with the temperature of the ambient water. The speedup of metabolism caused by global warming of the oceans, increases the fishes' need for oxygen, at the same time that the supply of dissolved oxygen decreases because of its lower solubility in heated water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The decreased solubility and (hence) availability of dissolved oxygen for aquatic flora and fauna as a result of heated water and their consequent death, dwindling population and species extinction (eg. from global warming, from dumped waste water used for cooling in electric/nuclear power stations, etc), is known as thermal pollution.</p>

              <p>In kinetics, a reaction's rate constant is called a constant, because it doesn't change as long as temperature doesn't change. Yet, when you add a catalyst, at that same temperature, the rate of reaction increases, implying that rate constant changes. Explain this seeming paradox.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p>The rate constant for the uncatalyzed reaction indeed does not change, as long as temperature remains unchanged. However, in the presence of a catalyst, the reaction goes by a different pathway altogether, and is hence regarded as a completely different reaction, with a completely different (and larger) rate constant at any given temperature. Notice also that the rate law or rate equation for the catalyzed reaction includes the concentration of the catalyst in it, in addition to having a different rate constant. </p>

              <p>May I know if the reaction between Na3N and HCl produces NH3 and NaCl? It looks like it but in my question, they said that the reaction produces solution S. And S, when boiled with NaOH, gives a gas G which turns damp litmus from red to blue.</p>

              <p>Name the salt present in S that reacts with aq NaOH to form gas G. I think it is the NO3- ions since this test is for presence of NO3- ions. But the products don't seem to have any compound that has the ion. Thanks.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the things that I have enjoyed on this trip is doing the cooking. I really like to cook, both for the fun of making things that taste good and for the science involved. We went into Whangarei to get groceries, and while we were shopping, I noticed some dented cans. That gave me the idea for this week's experiment. Why is it a bad idea to buy dented cans? Because they don't look as nice? Because some of the food inside might be dented too? To find out, you will need:</p>
              <p>a penny or other copper coin <br>some aluminum foil <br>some catsup <br>a plate or saucer</p>
              <p>Tear a strip of foil about an inch wide and 3 inches long. Place it on a plate. Put the penny on one end of the strip. Squirt a blob of catsup on top of the penny and then fold the other end of the foil over, so that it squishes into the catsup. Crease the fold enough so that it will stay in place. This should give you sort of a foil and penny sandwich. Looking from the side, you should have foil on the bottom, with a penny on top of that, then catsup and then the other end of the foil. Set the plate in a warm place where it will not be disturbed.</p>
              <p>The next day, rinse the catsup off the foil and examine it carefully. In the area where it was touching the catsup, it is full of holes! Oh no! If catsup does that to aluminum foil, think what it is doing to my stomach! I can never eat French fries again!</p>
              <p>Yes, the catsup does contain acid. ACID!!!! Don't get too excited. The acid is vinegar. Read the label and you will see. How did vinegar do that? Well, the acid is not responsible, or at least, not directly. The culprit is electricity.</p>
              <p>Electricity? I did not tell you to plug it into the wall. DON'T DO THAT!!! It would be very dangerous, and besides, you don't need to. This experiment makes its own electricity. The copper penny and the aluminum foil, connected by a conducting solution (catsup) form an electric cell, which will produce about 1/2 of a volt of electricity. You can't light a light with it, as the amperage is very small, but it does produce an electric current. If you cut through the foil strip in the center and connect a probe from a volt meter to each piece of foil, you should be able to measure about 1/2 of a volt.</p>
              <p>In the process of producing the electric current, the penny is stealing electrons (tiny, negatively charged pieces of atoms) from the aluminum. This changes the aluminum and lets it dissolve in the acid in the catsup.</p>
              <p>OK, so now we know how to dissolve holes in aluminum, but what does that have to do with dented cans. Cans are made of steel. The problem with steel is that it rusts when it comes in contact with water and oxygen. Since most of the foods that we put into cans are wet, they would quickly rust the can. To solve this, the steel cans were plated. That means that the inside was covered with a thin coating of the metal tin. Tin is not strong enough to make a good can, but it does not rust. The tin coating on the inside keeps the can from rusting and the steel give the can its strength.</p>
              <p>If a can is dented, the tin layer can be cracked, letting the liquid come in contact with the steel. Now you have two metals (steel and tin) in contact with a conducting solution (the liquid in the can). The can of food begins to produce electricity. It also starts to oxidize (rust) the metal in the can, producing a hole and letting the food inside spoil. That is why we don't buy dented cans.</p>

              <p>State and explain the effect of adding a salt (eg. sodium chloride) on the freezing and boiling points of water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p>Adding salt depresses (decreases) the freezing point, and elevates (increases) the boiling point. The presence of cations and anions presents electrostatic (ion-dipole) interactions with the polar water molecules, hence</p>

              <p>(ii) increasing the cohesion of water molecules (as a result of attractive ion-dipole interactions between ions and water molecules), thus requiring a higher temperature to boil (since boiling refers to overcoming the intermolecular attractive forces (hydrogen bonds) between water molecules for them to be far apart in the gaseous state).</p>

              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p>Electron geometry is trigonal planar, molecular geometry is bent/v-shape/non-linear. In other words, the central N atom has 1 lone pair and 2 electron charge clouds (1 double bond and 1 single bond).</p>

              <p>A common mistake made by students/candidates is to state the molecular geometry as trigonal planar, because their erroneous Kekule (or dot-&amp;-cross) structure either has an octet-violated N atom, or has at least one formal (hence ionic) charge that is not cancelled out; note however that nitrous acid is an electrically balanced compound. </p>

              <p>2HI(g) --&gt; H2(g) + I2(g)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a sample of HI is decomposed in a sealed container at 25 deg C, and the total pressure of the equilibrium mixture is 1.0 atm, what is the equilibrium partial pressure (in atm) of H2 in the tube?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p>Let y be the initial partial pressure of HI. Let x be the equilibrium partial pressure of H2. Based on info given, write two equations in x and y. Solve for simultaneous equations. You will end up with a quadratic equation in x2. Solve for x. Final answer is 0.4 atm.</p>

              125cm3 of a solution of phosphoric(V) acid were mixed with 75cm3 of 0.25mol/dm3 of barium hydroxide. A 50cm3 aliquot of the resultant mixture required 7.5g of sodium carbonate for exact neutralization, in which a gas was produced.
                                                  
              (a) Calculate the volume of the gas produced, at (i) r.t.p, and at (ii) s.t.p.
              
              (b) Describe and explain (with equations) how the identity of this gas may be ascertained.
              
              (c) By calculating the molarity of phosphoric(V) acid used, calculate the sample mass of solid phosphoric(V) acid that needs to be dissolved in 125cm3 of pure water to prepare this molarity.
              
              (d) Draw the structural formulae for (i) phosphoric(V) acid, (ii) barium hydroxide, and (iii) sodium carbonate. 
              
              
              Answers :
              (c) The sample mass of solid phosphoric(V) acid that needs to be dissolved is 19.7g (to 3 significant figures).
              Note : getting (c) correct means you already have parts (a) and (b) correct. Check Wikipedia for (d).

              'A' Level Qn.
                                                  
                                -----------------------------------
                                With reference to the data booklet  predict and describe the observations when FeCl3 (aq) is added to the following solutions. In each case, calculate the electromotive force or standard cell potential and write balanced redox equations.
                                i) Mn2(SO4)3
                                ii) CuI
                                How am I supposed to know what will happen? Help needed thanks!
                                -----------------------------------
              
                                                  
                                Standard Cell Potential = Standard Reduction Potential at Cathode + Standard Oxidation Potential at Anode.
                                                  
                                If the cell potential is positive, then the redox reaction is feasible, and the current will flow (for galvanic/voltaic cells).
                                                  
                                                  
                                Note that for a standard solution of FeCl3 (for this question asked),
                                Standard Reduction potential for Fe3+ to Fe2+ is + 0.77V
                                Standard Oxidation potential for 2Cl- to Cl2 is - 1.36V
                                                  
                                                                    
                                For experiment (i)
                                Standard Reduction potential for Mn3+ to Mn2+ is + 1.49V
                                Standard Reduction potential for SO4 2- to SO2 is + 0.17V
                                Standard Oxidation potential for 2SO4 2- to S2O8 2- is - 2.01V
                                Conclusion :
                                Under standard conditions, Redox reaction between Mn3+ and Cl- (to produce Mn2+ and Cl2) is feasible.
                                                                    
                                                  
                                For experiment (ii)
                                Standard Reduction potential for Cu+ to Cu is + 0.52V
                                Standard Oxidation potential for Cu+ to Cu2+ is - 0.15V
                                Standard Oxidation potential for 2I- to I2 is - 0.54V
                                Conclusion :
                                Under standard conditions, Redox reaction between Fe3+ and both Cu+ and I- (to produce Fe2+, Cu2+ and I2) is feasible.
                                                                    
                                                                    
                                (Note : there are of course other species to consider as possible products of additional possible redox reactions, but unless the exam question specifies the redox potentials for such, otherwise based on the Data Booklet given in the exams, the above are the only directly relevant considerations).
