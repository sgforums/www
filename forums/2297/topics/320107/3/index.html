              <p> </p>
              <p>How is it that transition metals can function as catalysts?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transition metals and their compounds function as catalysts either because of their capacity for variable oxidation states (hence allowing them to readily transfer electrons; this provides an alternative pathway with lower activation energy (as compared to the uncatalyzed pathway), hence increasing the rate of reaction) which is usually the modality of homogenous catalysts; or because of their capacity to adsorb/adsorp other substances (specifically, the reactants) on to their surface, and activate them in the process (transition metals have partially filled d-orbitals and hence can have different number of bonds, and can bond to a wide variety of ions and molecules; and so the catalyst can form temporary bonds with the reactant molecules, which weakens the remaning bonds within the reactant molecules (eg. from double to single bonds), eventually causing them to dissociate into highly reactive atoms, and/or by holding the reactant molecules in closer proximity with each other on the catalyst surface as compared to in free gaseous state, all of which lowers activation energy as well as increasing surface area concentration of reactants available for reaction), which is usually the modality of heterogenous catalysts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A case of the former (homogenous catalyst; partially filled d-orbitals with capacity for variable oxidation states) would be the redox reaction (catalyzed by Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions) between peroxydisulphate(VI) ions S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and iodide ions I-; to generate sulfate(VI) ions SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and iodine molecules I<sub>2</sub>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall Redox : 2I- + S2O8 2- --&gt; I2 + 2SO4 2-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Step 1 : S2O8 2- + 2e- &lt;---&gt; 2SO4 2-</p>
              <p>Reduction potential = +2.01V</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Step 2 : Fe3+ + e- &lt;---&gt; Fe2+</p>
              <p>Reduction potential = +0.77V</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Step 3 : I2 + 2e- &lt;---&gt; 2I-</p>
              <p>Reduction potential = +0.54V</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The uncatalyzed reaction (steps 1 and 3) is energetically feasible (according to redox potential values); however, the reaction is slow because the negatively charged S2O8 2- and I- anions repel each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the presence of Fe2+/Fe3+ ions, a alternative pathway (that is also energetically feasible, but in addition) with much lower activation energy (since the reactants are oppositely charged ions), and with a much faster rate of reaction, can now occur :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>S2O8 2- + 2Fe2+ --&gt; 2SO4 2- + 2Fe3+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2Fe3+ + 2I- --&gt; I2 + 2Fe2+</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two examples of the latter (heterogenous catalyst) would be nickel acting as a catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction between ethene and hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst; as well as iron acting a catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia in the Haber process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For heterogenous solid metal catalysts in the hydrogenation reaction of alkenes, the mechanism is as follows :</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Binding of the unsaturated bond (ie. adsorbtion/adsorption)</li>
              <li>hydrogen dissociation into atomic hydrogen onto the catalyst </li>
              <li>Addition of one atom of hydrogen</li>
              <li>Addition of the second atom</li>
              <li>Alkane leaves the surface of the nickel catalyst</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A similar mechanism occurs for the Haber process :</p>
              <p>First the H2 and N2 molecules form temporary bonds with the surface of the iron catalyst (ie. adsorbtion/adsorption); this interaction with the catalyst weakens the covalent bonds within the molecules and eventually causing the H2 and N2 molecules to dissociate into atomic hydrogen and nitrogen; which are highly reactive, and rapidly combine with each other to form NH3 molecules, which then leave the surface of the iron catalyst.</p>

              <p>hydrogen iodide, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arrange (and explain your arrangement) the above 4 hydrogen halides according to</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a) their boiling points, from lowest to highest</p>
              <p>b) their acidity when dissolved in water, from strongest to weakest</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lowest to the highest boiling points :</p>
              <p>Hydrogen chloride (-85.1°C) , hydrogen bromide (–66.38°C), hydrogen iodide (–35.36 °C), hydrogen fluoride (19.54 °C).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hydrogen fluoride has the highest boiling point due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules (fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table, hence is capable of the strongest hydrogen bonding).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From hydrogen chloride down the Group to hydrogen iodide, the boiling points increase due to the increasing numbers of electrons in the molecules that in turn leads to an increase in the frequency and strength of (induced dipole - induced dipole) van der Waals forces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This is because the bond energies for the hydrogen halides further down the group are lower, so they dissociate more easily (see Data booklet values below). Furthermore, the conjugate base halide ions increase in stability down the Group, due to the negative charge being spread out over a larger ionic radius (directly related to number of electron shells).</p>

              <p>Qn. In another separate experiment, a new alkane F, C6H14, was produced. When reacted with bromine under ultraviolet light, F produced <strong>only two</strong> isomeric monobromo compounds G and H, with the formula C6H13Br. Compound H was chiral. Suggest the structures of F, G and H, explaining your reasoning.</p>

              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only C6H14 alkane that when monobrominated would yield only 2 isomers one of which is a chiral compound, is 2,3-dimethylbutane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that 2,3-dimethylbutane has a mirror plane of symmetry. Substituting away H on the 4 terminal C atoms (1st, 4th, 2 methyl and 3 methyl carbons) are equivalent. That leaves the 2nd and 3rd C atoms, which are also equivalent thanks to this mirror plane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To obtain the chiral compound, substitute away H on (any of the 4) terminal carbons. The 2nd (or 3rd) C atom would then be the chiral carbon.</p>

              <p>Explain how chlorine has a bleaching effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did you know...</p>
              <p>The bleaching effect of chlorine, is actually due to the hypochlorous acid (formed when chlorine reacts with water), rather than the chlorine itself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bleaching effect is really a result of oxidation; and hypochlorous acid is a stronger oxidizing agent than chlorine itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Household bleach is the sodium salt of hypochlorous acid, sodium hypochlorite, of which the ClO- ion (hypochlorite ion aka chlorate(I) ion) undergoes disproportionation at higher temperatures to generate Cl- ion (chloride ion) and ClO3- ion (chlorate ion aka chlorate(V) ion) which is an even stronger oxidizing agent (compare the oxidation states of chlorine in Cl2 vs ClO- vs ClO3-).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; How Bleach Works</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryfaqs/f/bleach.htm">http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryfaqs/f/bleach.htm</a></p>
              <p>An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds of a chromophore (part of a molecule that has color). This changes the molecule so that it either has no color or else reflects color outside the visible spectrum.</p>
              <p>A reducing bleach works by changing the double bonds of a chromophore into single bonds. This alters the optical properties of the molecule, making it colorless.</p>
              <p>In addition to chemicals, energy can disrupt chemical bonds to bleach out color. For example, the high energy photons in sunlight (e.g., ultraviolet rays) can disrupt the bonds in chromophores to decolorize them. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

              <p>Many students, as taught by the JCs, do not understand many aspects of Chemistry, they just blindly memorize. As a teacher and tuition teacher, I always I always encourage students to understand the *meaningfulness* behind anything they're required to memorize. Here, students should appreciate the *purpose* of hybridization, and why the mathematical formula to determine hybridization works.</p>
              <p>Consider Ethyne and Ammonia.</p>
              <p><br>1) Ethyne.<br>To minimize electron repulsion, the VSEPR molecular geometry is linear, and the VSEPR electron geometry is also linear (since there are no lone pairs). To achieve linear VSEPR electron geometry, hybridization of C orbitals must be sp (without hybridization, the bond angles would result in significant electron repulsion and an unstable geometry). This leaves 2 p orbitals (s s p p --&gt; s p p p --&gt; sp sp p p) for overlap (with the other C's 2p orbitals) to form the 2 pi bonds (over the sigma bond; hence triple bond between the 2 Cs).<br><br>2) Ammonia.<br>The molecular VSEPR geometry is trigonal pyramidal, but the electron geometry is tetrahedral. Hence hybridization is sp3 (to achieve tetrahedral electron VSEPR geometry, to minimize electron repulsion).<br><br><br>A related question to this :<br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Identify and explain whether PH3 is a stronger or weaker nucleophile and base, as compared to NH3.</strong><br><br>The solution, is to recognize that P is one electron shell larger than N; consequently the electron repulsion (between electron pairs, regardless lone or bond) is less in PH3 as compared to NH3; consequently there is less need and therefore less extent of hybridization of electron orbitals; consequently the bond angles in PH3 are almost orthogonal as compared to (slightly less than, due to greater repulsion between lone pair and bond pairs) tetrahedral bond angles in NH3; which implies that the lone pair in PH3 is largely the s orbital as compared to sp3 orbital in NH3; consequently the s orbital lone pair of PH3 is less available for nucleophilic attack and/or accepting a proton, as compared to NH3.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone posted :<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the major organic product of the reaction of 2,3-Dimethyl-1,3-butadiene with Br2? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution / Comments :</p>
              <p><br>For the mechanism, the first step is nucleophilic attack resulting in electrophilic addition (where the pi bond acts as the nucleophile); the second step is nucleophilic attack resulting in nucleophilic addition (where the Br- (or OH- if aqueous conditions are used) acts as the nucleophilie).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Four points to consider :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) The solvent used matters. With a non-polar, inert solvent, you'll get the addition of bromine only. Using aqueous bromine, you have a competing hydroxide ion nucleophile that will attack the cyclic bromonium carbocation intermediate, in effect adding not just Br, but also OH, across the double bonds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) If we regard the cyclic bromonium ion as a non-cyclic carbocation, (eg. imagine you're adding H-Br instead of Br-Br), then the more stable carbocation would be the one with more electron donating (non-electronegative-substituted) alkyl groups. If both double bonds are added across simultaneously, and based on this argument alone, you would end up with 1,4-dibromo-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-butane.<br> <br>3) However, because oxygen is significantly more electronegative than bromine, the resulting electronic instability of 1,4-dibromo-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-butane (with the two partial +ve Cs being adjacent), may see the emergence of 2 other slightly more stable isomers (at least in regard to the two partial +ve adjacent Cs), 1,3-dibromo-2,4-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-butane and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-butane.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Let's consider sterics. Br is huge, but OH is small. But Br has to be added on first, since the pi-bond acts as a nucleophile (and attacks the +ve charged Br). So the next step of OH- nucleophile attacking the carbocation (or bromonium carbocation), might preferentially add on to the terminal C's, to minimize steric repulsion (or van der Waals repulsion), so this argument tends towards the isomer 2,3-dibromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2,3-dimethyl-butane.</p>
              <p><br>The answer (single major product) isn't directly provided by this post, but hopefully these 4 points above might have possibly helped you understand the processes or considerations involved a little better.</p>

              <p>However, i discovered that there were some reactions such as reduction of zinc oxide and lead(II) oxide which produce CO instead of CO2. I would appreciate if someone could explain. Thanks.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

              <p>I replied :</p>
              <p>Zinc is a relatively (everything's relative... just ask Einstein) reactive metal, which means that it won't be that easy to grab away zinc's girlfriend ("oxygen"). Carbon can grab away oxygen from zinc, but it's harder for carbon monoxide to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carbon : "Eh gimmie ur oxygen gf, or else I call my gang whack u!"</p>
              <p>Zinc Oxide : "Ok ok, I give u face this time... but I'll remember ur face... u be careful..."</p>
              <p>Carbon (now in monoxide form, ie. Carbon monoxide) to Zinc (who has lost his oxygen) : "Muhahaha! Ok, now ur brudder's turn... tell your younger didi zinc oxide to give up his oxygen too!" </p>
              <p>Zinc &amp; his brudder Zinc Oxide : "Oi! U already got one oxygen liao, don't be too greedy hor! Don't see we all quiet quiet good to bully, think we sick kitten izzit! Knn u nvr die b4 izzit, I tell you..."</p>
              <p>Carbon monoxide : "Ok lah! ok lah! Kao peh lah!"</p>

              <p>'O' &amp; 'A' level Qn.</p>
              <p>(inspired by a cold rainy morning on 24 Dec 08)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Qn : Why are rainy days so cold?</p>
              <p>Ans : 3 reasons.</p>
              <p>Firstly, when it rains, there is cloud cover which blocks out the sun (and infra red waves from solar radiation results in heat, or an increase in temperature).</p>
              <p>Secondly, when it rains, the rain is often accompanied by strong winds, or in increase in wind velocities. This enhances the evaporating rate, which brings us the the third reason.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, during and after a rain, the abundance of liquid water in the environment evaporates (a continuous process) to gaseous water into the atmosphere. This is an endothermic process, as energy (in the form of heat) from the environment is absorbed by the liquid water, in order to overcome the strong hydrogen bonding (for 'O' level students, say "intermolecular forces of attraction") between water molecules in close proximity in the liquid state, so that as the water molecules gain sufficient energy and vibration to overcome the hydrogen bonding attractive forces to move further away (from the rest of the water molecules in the liquid state), it is able to locate itself as an individual particle, ie. it is now in the gaseous state, as water vapour.</p>
              <p>This continuous endothermic process of liquid water evaporating draws heat away from the environment, and hence exerts a cooling effect on the environment. (Think of your hand as the thermometer; in an exothermic process such as combustion a.k.a. burning, your hand feels hot, conversely an endothermic process such as water or alcohol on your skin evaporating makes your skin feel cold.) </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; i know that enthalpy change of soln= enthalpy change of hydration - L.E. but how do i represent it in this diagram..?  &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's a lousy formula, which most JC students dogmatically memorize without understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A better formula, which makes obvious sense, and one which would immediately self-explain how to draw the Hess Law energetics cycle diagram, would be :</p>
              <p>Solution Enthalpy = Lattice Dissociation Enthalpy* + Solvation Enthalpy (when the solvent is water, solvation enthalpy is called "Hydration Enthalpy", for obvious reasons).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall (ie. the reason why this formula is superior and intuitive), the 1st step is the endothermic process of investing energy to overcome the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions, in order to produce the gaseous cations and anions. Thereafter, the 2nd step is the exothermic process in which ion-dipole interactions or 'bonds' are formed, between the ions and solvent molecules (which are usually polar water molecules). Hence the formula makes perfect sense, and the Hess Law energetics cycle diagram becomes self-explanatory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(*Lattice Dissociation Enthalpy is endothermic; Lattice (association) Enthalpy is exothermic. Same magnitude, since we're talking about the same process of overcoming-vs-forming a lattice formation, but in reverse to each other.)</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Explain why application of pressure to ice at 0 degree Celsius makes it melt. Why do most other solids not show the same behaviour? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why ice melts under pressure :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Water in solid state exists as a fixed crystalline lattice structure, thanks to hydrogen bonds between water molecules that result in fixed (and precise) geometries with fixed (and precise) hydrogen bond lengths and intermolecular distances. Putting pressure would disrupt such a fixed crystalline lattice structure (that we perceive as a solid state), and hence the chaotic disorderly structure of water that results, is what we perceive as the liquid state.</p>
