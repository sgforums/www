              Not a very tough paper in general.
              For 2a, just writing positive externalities and underestimation of substantial true private benefits(merit good) should suffice? No time to write inequity though
              
              For 2b, i think i didnt really wrote antithesis well. I wrote for thesis how less funds may be diverted towards education and building world class infrastructure instead, which may adversely affect productive capacity etc, leading to some macro goals not be attained. While it may be financed by individuals, individual disposable income falls since they have to pay higher taxes to the government, they can only consume less goods and services etc, material sol is adversely affected. Government may also accumulate national debt etc, more funds need to be paid for debt interest payments to holders of govt bonds
              anti thesis was like how the govt have accumulated substantial reserves due to our strong bop surplus lol
              other than that qn 5 and 6 which i did was pretty alright i guess.

              Qn 5a my point was pretty much expansionary fp to achieve actual growth which fuels inflationary pressure, hurt export price competitiveness and affect bop, while supply sidesuch as research and development can lead to structural unemployment due to occupational immobility 
              5b was straightforward.

              <p>I tink its manageable, but the problem is this is argumentative, so you dont know what cambridge will accept and what they will not accept. </p>
              <p>Q5 was pretty easy except for the fact that they requested you to propose alternative measures SG government can go for and also asked you to analyze EFFECTIVENESS, and not the policy itself, so your entire essay cannot just be talking on status quo (e.g singapore government increase producitivity...) there must at least be 1 or 2 factors on alternative policies and analyze its effectiveness/not effective.</p>
              <p>I would think there are many macro conflicts possible but the major ones are </p>
              <p>1). Growth and price stability</p>
              <p>2). Price stability and BOP</p>
              <p>3). Growth and unemployment</p>
              <p>Q6 was the tricky one because current account can either worsen/improve or remain the same. 6b was the even trickier one because it required you to analyze from the depreciation AND appreciation and to realise that the Singaporean economy now is not doing well, so likely malaysia's currency affect us the most because it is our largest and closest trading partner. You must also explain this clearly. </p>
              <p>As for market failure, part a was easy, but inequity should be more important than imperfect information. Every of such essay should contain an efficiency point and an equity point. However, there shouldn't be much penalisation. </p>
              <p>As for part b, opportunity cost does look easy, though the question is did you manage to substantiate up to 15 marks worth. There would be a need to bring in scarcity, perhaps elaborate on PPC and also why there would be opportunity costs in the first place... </p>

              The reason why i wrote imperfect info for 2a is because healthcare is a merit good, the most obvious source of mkt failure is definitely imperfect info thats why..
              6a just argue both sides i think. It can directly hurt export price competitiveness, and thus worsen bop, but it can also helps to lower your price of imported raw materials etc, lowering your cop and translating into lower price of your exports instead.
              
              for 3b i think there is no need to talk about ppc. The main argument should be about the negative effects i believe, spending less on education lower labour productivity etc.. and about how consumers have to pay higher taxes and so on.. 
              
              well for 6b depreciating against us and china will definitely fuel import price push inflation, since we rely heavily on these countries for our raw materials.. can further link cost of production to investments and how they affect economic growth, kfa,etc
              appreicating against malaysia will lower our domestic cost of living, due to cheap import of food etc

              <p>6a Agreed.</p>
              <p>2a They should accept any 2 points. But imperfect info is similar to positive externality, i think equity is a better point. Efficiency and equity should be present. Equity is very important in healthcare. </p>
              <p>2b Yeah lorh but hard to just write effects for 15 marks bro</p>
              <p>6b isnt as easy because there are multiple countries. I would think malaysia is a bigger trading partner than US/China, if you check out the list Malaysia is the top trading partner. I dont think we import much from USA actually, but more from Malaysia (vegetables etc) and Japan. (remember recently Singapore government going to Hokkaido) </p>
              <p>The hard thing is not on telling them the effects of the appreciation, but how do you determine the "likely effects" as the question requested for. You mentioned one will increase import price push inflation and one will decrease domestic cost of living, so you must judge in the end does it fall or rise?</p>
              <p>Also they requested for an analysis of domestic economy, so you should link to Malaysia being more important so an appreciation of our currency against theirs will lead to a large fall in export, causing AD to fall whereas the other country are smaller trading partners. </p>
              <p>Also you can talk about the fact that if the Singaporean curency is stronger, it could cause malaysian/japanese companies to avoid coming to singapore to set up factories/invest due to the larger start up cost involved as one unit of their foreign currency is converted to fewer units of domestic currency, that is how you link to overall economy not doing as well. </p>
              <p>As for USA and china depreciation, likely we will begin to export more to USA and china since our exports are now cheaper in terms of US dollar and renminbi but because malaysia and japan are our bigger trading partners, its likely the effect of the appreciation is worse than that of the depreciation against us dollar/renminbi. </p>

              <p>but its okay. Only 6b was slightly tricky. I am sure if you got the other questions right, one can still score a 8/9 out of 15 for this question and A is still very possible.</p>

              <p>5 macro goals is correct. That is the safest way of interpretating it but i dont think they need u to talk about all 5 goals. Just the major ones like growth bop and price stability. Some goals might also contradict each other. Lets say u have more import price push inflation but when growth is reduced theres also less dd pull. </p>

              <p>I think the question was asking for the likely effects so an L3 response will definitely require evaluatiom</p>

              <p>For conflicts. No. Because they wanted macroeconomic growth objectives. Allocativr efficiency is micro level</p>

              <p>Likely capped at L1. They cannot give above that no matter how good the arguments if the question was intepretated wrongly. Therefore all the things you said were refering to the wrong country so of course the arguments would become invalid since the sing dollar depreciated against us dollar...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would think they will be extremely vigilant for students who flipped as they probably had set the question thinking many will fall for the trick. </p>

              <p>On the other hand dont worry u can stl score an A if the rest buttresses this mistake.</p>
