            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, <br>This is my last year in sec sch. Sec 5, with 6 subjects: Eng, Emaths, Geog, Combined Sci(Chem,Phys), Humanities(SS,Hist), Amaths. Chinese is B syllabus. I took 3 Olvls subj in 2009 and got C6 for Eng, Geog C5 and Emaths A2. So this year im retaking my Eng and Geog, leaving me with 5 subjects. <br><br>Im thinking of dropping Amaths becos I cant cope with my other remaining subjects. And if i focus too much on Amaths, my others will be pulled down. So since i hav learned Amaths for 2 years plus and failed badly (F9 always), I will consider dropping it so that i will hav enough time for the remaining subjects. Aiming for A1s or 2s for the 4 subject this year and with my A2 emaths from 2009.<br><br>Even without Amaths in the olvls cert, will i be eligible for any Engineering course n poly. And will i be able to cope with Amaths there, since i hav abit of Knowledge of it? Can i hav your views?<br><br>Thanks Very Much =D</p></div>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Engineering covers a lot about calculus, which is part of additional mathematics. It will be useful for you to continue with the subject. Thanks.</p>

              <p>it depends on the type of engineering, most engineering courses include a.math.</p>
              <p>however, if you drop it now, in poly you can take up a bridging module to make up for the lack of a.maths.</p>
              <p>if you really cannot cope with amath now, drop it. </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  If one cannot cope now, it is unlikely that one can cope later. If one is not inclined towards mathematics, perhaps it is good to consider other strengths and think about other courses of study. Thanks.</p>
              <p>P.S.

              <p>Poly admission do not requre Amaths....they just need Emaths for engineering....</p>
              <p>Amaths is important in the sense that topics taught in engineering maths are also in Amaths so U get a headstart if U know it.</p>
              <p>that said...if U really CMI for Amaths....make sure U get F9...not D7 to E8.</p>

              <p>Pls dun drop amaths, i agree with wee_ws, "If one cannot cope now, it is unlikely that one can cope later."<br><br>If u are concern with the marks, let me tell u its quite easy to pass am, just need to know the easy topics.<br><br>your f9 in school exam can be c6 in Os. that was what happen to me.<br>i was certain that i have only about 30 to 40% of the marks but i got a C6 for Os.<br><br>if that can give me a C6 i think you will be able to get a B3 with more hard work. =)<br>properly 50 to 60% of the paper.</p>
              <p>if u put in more effort now you wont need to slog ur guts out when u get into that course, as u aready have the basics.<br><br>it may be taxing now, but i can ensure u if u leave it to when ur in poly, with more things at hand, it will be worse.<br><br>the final decision is urs but i recom. unless u are the hopeless kind that cannot even do the simplest topic like binomial, partical fraction...stick to am.<br><br>jiayou.</p>

              <p>Thx u all so much for ur advices. Im very confused. Im afraid if i carry
               on with amaths, i'll end up with a just pass for it and others on the

              <p>in a very simplified nutshell...engineering maths teaches topics that usually have applications in physics....like the resolving of forces in the x-y axis....</p>

              <p>A maths is not needed to enter poly engineering. You can use Emaths.</p>
              <p>Actually if you want to drop A maths and focus on other subjects, I would agree with you.</p>
              <p>Let me give you an example. My friend O level A maths F9. Come to poly and guess whats his grade for A maths? A.</p>
              <p>I never take A maths in sec school. I came to poly and its my 1st time taking A maths, i got B+ .</p>
              <p>What im trying to tell you is, engineering maths or A maths, will be a breeze for you if you took it before in secondary school.</p>
              <p>Im also trying to tell you, if you put in the effort, you will realise that A maths is actually easier than E maths.</p>

              <p>I am in electrical and electronic engineering course now, going into year two soon.</p>
              <p>Back when i was in sec 2, i failed e maths really badly at around 20-30marks outta 100, and thus was not allowed to take a maths</p>
              <p>In my o levels, my e maths was C5. I have no a maths</p>
              <p>If you are going into engineering, the will be a subject/module called engineering maths, which is actually almost the same thing as A maths.</p>
              <p>Engineering maths in my poly seems to be splitted up into 2-3 parts, in year one i learnt about differentiation, binomial theorem, integration calculus trigo, normal things seen in the sec school a maths textbook.</p>
              <p>Since you got A2 for E maths i think your problem with A maths is that maybe you do not have enough practice, or your teacher is not good at teaching bringing their understanding to you.</p>
              <p>Anyway you took a maths, im sure you find that the concepts are just something built on top of your E maths.</p>
              <p>I heard from my friends who took a maths in sec school, that, engineering maths questions in poly are easier than those that came out in o level a maths.</p>
              <p>Im able to pass Engineering maths in poly, even with my lousy E maths</p>
              <p>Why not just try to get a friend to teach u  a maths again to revise your concepts? Maybe after a few pattern recognition you might just be able to do it? Since your e maths foudation is good</p>

              <p>well intake for engineering course is big, and from my course i think it is quite competitive as yout will find that a lot of foreign talents are very good in maths especially people from myanmar, they are very fast in picking up concepts</p>
              <p>Im not sure if demand in engineering is high or not in sg, i went into engineering because i couldnt get into better course which i wanted</p>
              <p>oh and for my course wwhen we take the maths exam we are given a formula book which contain general formulas, im not sure if it is given in o level a maths exam, but it is of good help.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>GAhhss~ means ill stand no chance to be the elites, usually 1 class consist of how many students e.g hundreds? But its certainly hard to enter a local uni rite? Olvl maths hav 1 formulae sheet given, consisting mainly of trigo and abit differentiation. Everyone is mentioning engineering, tts why i got influence to go there, hav not explore all the course. So the Engineering maths exams is annually? or only in the 1st year of poly?</p></div>
