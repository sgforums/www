              <p>Well.. I want to appeal to transfer to another JC. <br><br>So my question is, Can I appeal to as many JCs as I want?</p>
              <p>or do I have to pick up one and appeal to it?</p>
              <p>My first choice for JAE registration was MJC. So, if I were to appeal to MJC, is there a higher possibilty to be granted than appealing to other JCs? or is the same regardless of the choices you made?</p>
              <p>I got 12 poitns after deduction! Which JCs do you think I can appeal to and be grated?</p>
              <p>My current JC is too far from my house T_T I really have to transfer.</p>
              <p>PLS share your experience and knowledge^^</p>
              <p>and answer my question (:</p>
              <p>And give me any advice!</p>
              <p>Thank you all.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  JCs are extremely well-connected and well-informed, so please do NOT appeal to as many as you wished, for you may end up with no school taking you in, because you are seen to be indecisive and fickle-minded in your appeal. Appeal only to the school you really want to go to and speak to the vice-principal or appeal staff-I/C if need be. Good luck!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>FAQs are standard procedures. Things are not standard in real life. For instance, anything in the FAQs suggest you can change JCs after a few months? Well, I did. After deciding I didn't like AJC, I changed to SAJC in May. All you gotta do is talk to the principal. Of coz, TS you should check the cut off of the JC you would like to appeal to. It should be obvious you dun appeal to JCs such as RJC unless you can contribute in some special ways such as you are Singapore under 16 table tennis champion etc etc. Appeal to JCs whose cut off you meet would be the safest. After all, your problem is distance isn't it? surely at least SRJC,YJC or JJC got one is reasonable nearby no?</p>

              <p>Well it quells my upstart anxiety at least. And before I get warned for derailing topics..., @OP, do this first:</p>
