              hi ultimaonline, is it something like when they say the boiling point of a substance increases when an impurity is placed inside of it. one of the two substance which has the power boiling point by itself will have an increased boiling point? Like water and salt so eventually the range if boiling will be 101-103 degrees. while for solids the melting point of the entire substance is taken in the perspective of the lowest melting point solid.
              
              like so when an alloy is formed it will be less than the melting point of both substance?
              Thanks for the help!

              Hi ultimaonline, I asked these questions as my textbook says that when an impurity urself inside a liquid, the boiling point increases. N in a solid melting point decrease. So I was pondering, if both liquids are placed together how would it affect the boiling point. So from examples I sort of deduced these assumptions. Thanks!

              Yea, I think I should just forget everything I just posted. In a question: methanoic acid has a melting point of 5 degrees. Boiling point of 101degrees. While ethanoic acid has a melting point of 17 degrees and a boiling point of 118 degrees. Substance X has a melting point of 15 degrees while a boiling point of 121 degrees.
              
              My answer: X is ethanoic acid with methanoic acid as an impurity. This is because impurities decrease the melting point as shown when the melting point decreases from 17 to 15 degrees. While an impurity increases the boiling point of substance as shown when rude boiling point increases from 118 to 121 degrees. 
              
              Is this correct? This is just me using the O level stuff. But I think that it would be different in higher levels. Ultimaonline could u check this answer for me using O level standard. Thanks for the help!

              <p>All your questions cannot be adequately addressed at O levels. Cambridge will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> require you to predict, let alone explain, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span></strong> or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span></strong> boiling and melting points are modified by impurities, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">only that they are</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>So in a nutshell, don't try to figure it out at 'O' levels, because it simply can't be done using limited 'O' level knowledge.</p>

              <p>the main reason (at O level) why ethanol and water put together, bp more than 78 degrees (using primary school knowledge) is there is added impurities </p>
              <p>To utimaonline: For A levels, is it the hydrogen bonds in water alone is weaker than the hydrogen bonds formed between water and ethanol (as the donor atom, hydrogen bond and the electronegative atom of the acceptor molecule is more linear than what is in water alone). </p>
              <p>Plus, organic cation is RNH3+ .</p>

              Oh ok thanks :) cos this impurity thing was slightly covered. They say that when impurity added, the melting point increases and boiling point decreases. And could u let me know if my methanoic acid and ethanoic acid question is correct? It was a practise question from the textbook.
              
              As for ultimaonline, get your facts right. this was slightly TAUGHT in SCHOOL. won't it be natural to want to get an answer?
              
              Thanks atomos and sbs!

              <p><br> Yea, I think I should just forget everything I just posted. In a
              question: methanoic acid has a melting point of 5 degrees. Boiling
              point of 101degrees. While ethanoic acid has a melting point of 17
              degrees and a boiling point of 118 degrees. Substance X has a
              melting point of 15 degrees while a boiling point of 121 degrees.
              My answer: X is ethanoic acid with methanoic acid as an impurity.
              This is because impurities decrease the melting point as shown when
              the melting point decreases from 17 to 15 degrees. While an
              impurity increases the boiling point of substance as shown when
              rude boiling point increases from 118 to 121 degrees. Is this
              correct? This is just me using the O level stuff. But I think that
              it would be different in higher levels. Ultimaonline could u check
              this answer for me using O level standard. Thanks for the help!</p>

              Hi, I have a nets question to ask. What is the meaning of soft/hard and strong/weak?

              <p>Pure Metals are soft. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Depend on what type of metals, some can be as some as plasticine. They are soft because they only have single type of metal atoms in them. The atoms arrangement of pure metals are like this B.</p>
              <p><img src="http://spaceflight.esa.int/impress/text/education/Images/Solidification/PhaseDiagrams/Phase_Diagrams_Image_010.png" alt="" width="539" height="345"></p>
              <p>Soft because they atoms layer can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slide over one another easily</span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For alloy, alloy means metal made with two or more elements. The atom structure looked like this (A) and (D). They are hard because atoms <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot slide over one another easily.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For (C), it's alloy, but the second element seems to filled up the spaces between the primary element. This is very weak alloy which will not come out for exams.</p>
              <p>In Exam, you will need to know how to draw (A), (B) and (D).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Strong/weak is use to describe it's strength and weakness. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> If you remember your D&amp;T, you learn about high speed steel and other type of drill bits. High speed steel (black colour) is consider very strong but brittle. Strong because it's able to penetrate metals, brittle is because once it's drop on the floor, chances are the drill bit is rendered useless due to cracks.</p>
              <p>High speed steel is actually an alloy of steel and carbon. Carbon gives it's black signature black colour. The more carbon you put, the stronger the metal gets (visual the two different atoms in an alloy) and it gets brittle (means break easily) when you add more carbons. </p>
              <p>Strong can also be use to describe Aluminium. Aluminium by itself is a very strong metal.</p>

              <p><br>Actually knowing too much high order stuffs can be helpful, but may cause even more confusion as you will not have the basis of these theories and hence , you cannot apperciate them.</p>

              <p>(You can also use k = Ae^(-Ea/RT) for the explanation, Ea decereases, k increases, that's ahrennius (sic) equation which is technically out of A level, but what is the point for knowing such a covoluted example in O level, unless you are in Olympiad, as it will not improve any understanding but just a neater form of explanation)</p>

              Oh ok thanks! Also how do I tell if an ionic compound has a higher melting point than another ionic compound? Like NaCl and MgO I know that MgO has a higher melting point due Mg bring 2+ and O is -2 while Na is +1 and Cl is -1 so the ionic bonds between mg and o is stronger than Na and Cl. As they are more oppositely charged. But then I'm not sure if difficult ones are given like CuCO3 and Na2CO3...

              <p>Thanks for the help!</p>

              <p>True for your NaCl and MgO explanation, (but actually ionic radii matters but that's A level).</p>
              <p>As utimaonline will say for CuCO3  and Na2CO3, it is A level knowledge to tell which has stronger ionic bonds, and in O level, your understanding will simply yield a partial explanation, and hence, that should not be an O level question</p>
              <p>But, I will answer as you are such an inquiring student (you should really take H3 in JC), Ionic bond strength (or lattice energy, i.e. the enthalphy change when 1 mole of an ionic solid is formed from its isolated gaseous ion) is proportionate to (  q+  q- ) / (r+ + r -), hence, Cu is double charge and Na is single charge, LE for CuCO3 is larger than Na2CO3, hence, mp should be higher. BUT WAIT , the anionic cloud of CO3 of CuCO3 may be polarised more due to higher polarising power due to higher charge density of Cu2+ than Na+, hence, causing it to have lower thermal stability, hence, the real answer is debatable even at A levels, but at university, there may be more understanding.</p>
              <p>Morale of story: Such a question will never be asked even in A levels. However, if they do ask, they will give a context and answer according to it.</p>

              Oh ok :)  this was a question gave by my school teacher to challenge all of us. Was pretty scared cos I thought it would come out for o levels.
              
              Thanks so much for the help sbs smrt really appreciate your help! :)
