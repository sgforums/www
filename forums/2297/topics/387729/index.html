              <p>Hi, would appreciate if someone could post me a link/tell me which topics are going to be covered in JC1 H2 biology.</p>
              <p>Tried google, only managed to get a rough idea (microbiology, cellular functions w/e) and marking schemes, but it isn't good enough for me to start reading up on my own.</p>

              <p><br>10x more distinctions? That's probably an exaggeration. Nonetheless, that's good to hear, for the sake of the H2 Bio students in your JC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for why I discourage pple from taking H2 Bio (perhaps to look at it more constructively, I encourage pple to take H2 Chem 1st, then H2 Physics 2, then H2 Bio last).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's nothing personal, no hard feelings really. I'm personally more of a Chem and Bio person more than a Physics person. I do like Bio, and have nothing against it as a subject.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I feel sorry for (the students), is the H2 syllabus in particular, as well as how JCs go about teaching it. True, one can argue the limitations/flaws of how JCs teach, applies to Physics and Chemistry as well. But the damage (to the student), imo, is less severe than for Bio.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't want to go into a detailed critique of the H2 Bio syllabus, and/or why the way JCs teach it is less than ideal. Anyone interested can google it out. I'm far from the only one who feels this way about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, to the most important point (as to why I encourage Chem and Physics over Bio, specifically at 'A' levels), which is essentially about the sake of the student. It is a fact, that in terms of prerequisites for number of University Science courses, H2 Chem and H2 Physics ranks far above H2 Biology, in terms of relevance or importance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, to be fair, there are a few (a minority, to be sure) of Uni courses that favour H2 Bio over H2 Physics, such as Medicine (at least according to a current medical student who posted here a couple weeks ago).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Then, isn't your advice harmful to those students who want to take a course in the Uni which requires H2 Biology, or at least favours it (over H2 Chem or H2 Physics)?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, such courses are a definite minority. More to the point though, I expect students to be cognitive enough, to know what he/she/you want for yourself, in terms of a future career/profession, and therefore what the relevant Uni course is. If you're dead sure you want to study a Uni course which favors Bio over Phys or Chem, then by all means go ahead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice is targeted at the vast majority of students, who will find H2 Chem and H2 Physics far more useful than H2 Bio, when applying for University. Students exempt from this category, should be cognitive enough to know my advice doesn't directly apply to them. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all that's said and done, congrats to those who did/do well in H2 Biology, including for the 2009 'A' level batch (results will be out soon next month).</p>
