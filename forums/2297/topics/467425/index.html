              <p><br>Q1. Write the balanced equation. From sample mass of reactant, find moles of reactant, hence apply stoichiometry to find expected moles of product, then convert to expected sample mass of product. Take actual sample mass of product, divided by expected sample mass 3.0g of product. </p>
              <p>Q2. Find moles of hydrate CuSO4.xH2O in terms of x (ie. sample mass / molar mass). From sample mass of anhydrate, find moles of anhydrate. This is also the number of moles of the hydrate. Equate the two moles (anhydrate as number, hydrate in terms of x) to solve for x.</p>
              <p>Q3. Write the balanced equation for combustion of hydrocarbon, in terms of x and y. 80-50=30cm3 was CO2 (since 2OH- + CO2 --&gt; CO3 2- + H2O). 10cm3 of CxHy generated 30cm3 of CO2, hence x = 3. At rtp, H2O is liquid. Hence the remaining 50cm3 must have been excess O2. Hence you know how much O2 was used up (per 10cm3 of CxHy). Hence, applying stoichiometry of the balanced combustion equation, already knowing x, you can solve for y (since the coefficient of O2 used in the balanced equation is in terms of x and y). </p>
              <p>Q4. For this qn, H2SO4 is considered a strong diprotic acid. From moles of OH- used, you can find moles of H+ in excess. Hence find moles of H+ which reacted (ie. take total moles of H+ from H2SO4, minus away moles of H+ in excess) with the CaCO3, hence apply stoichiometry to calculate moles of CO3 2- (note that CO3 2- is a diprotic base), which is the same as moles of CaCO3. Then convert the moles of sample mass. Take this actual sample mass, divided by actual sample mass 2.0g.</p>
