              <p>I just got my 'N' Levels result and I am only able to go to ITE or repeat.</p>
              <p>I got 21 points and I really wanted to go secondary 5 and then to Poly. But now, it seems that I am unable to do that. I don't know which path to choose now. </p>
              <p>(Before you judge and think that I am stupid or anything else.)</p>
              <p>I didn't have the motivation to study until I met my sister and mother earlier this month. After I met them, I felt that there's more to life and found something worth going further in my life for. But it's too late currently as the results are already out. Now, I am determined to study and go to University but I don't know which path to take. </p>
              <p>Can anybody please advise me to on which path to take?</p>

              <p>how old are you? My advice to you is do really well in ITE.  According to what my lecturer told me in ITE, if you score really well for the first year GPA 4.0 consecutive in all exams or test, higher chances you would be advance to poly. </p>
              <p>I don't know whether theres still these kind of arrangement. No harm checking with your secondary school teachers. Cheers! </p>

              <p>there is no shortcut in life. Frankly speaking, 21 points can't make it to any good courses in ITE, even if there were, there are thousands of thousands students 'fighting' for that place. Therefore your chances of getting in would be extremely low. </p>
              <p>just my two cents, if you are not interested in that course, don't waste your time getting interested. I would say retake N level, make the best of it. Within 3 years(or less) you would be in poly with the course you are interested in. Good luck! </p>

              <p>Since you want to go to sec 5 and enter Poly via O level (which would enable you to opt for more Poly courses), <strong>you should repeat</strong>.</p>
              <p>Rest assured. I doubt the new syllabus would be totally different.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">The change in syllabus was announced to schools last year and from what I heard from my school's HOD, the changes are quite minor. While there are new topics, the content for the other topics may be reduced. You should see it as one of the reasons for continuing to learn<em>(if the syllabus remains the same, you would probably be tired of it and not have interst in learning)</em> and motivate yourself to study harder when you repeat sec 5 next year.</span></p>
              <p>well, I know very little about ITE but I think ITE may be suitable<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if you already have a very clear idea on what you want to be when you grow up</span>.</p>
              <p>If ITE has the related course for the job you want to do when you grow up, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and you know you really want the job</span>,</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>you should go to that ITE course</strong> and study hard, </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">specialise yourself in the occupation that you want to be in.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">go to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">related</span> Polytechnic course ~2 years later. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When you are at the Polytechnic course, you should continue to study hard (harder) and further specialise in the occupation that you want to be in.</span></li>
              <li>Thereafter, if your Polytechnic score is good enough, or if the Polytechnic course allows you direct admission to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">related</span> university course, you can go to the university course to complete your specialisation on the occupation that you want to be in.</li>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>May i share with my newphew's case as a reference to you?</p>
              <p>My nephew repeated and stay back one more year after failing his GCE O level(Sec 5). After 2nd sitting at GCE O level, he passed and managed to go to poly. As a uncle, i am close to him, these are his contributing success factors:-</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1.  Be exam trained</span></p>
              <p>Keep doing ten years series and study less. He has been doing many, many qna in order to be to answer exam qs. Do you find it strange that although we study a lot but sometimes we still not able to answer qs?</p>
              <p>2. Learned from your mistakes</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Maturity grew after one failure and make your stronger to succeed. You must be hunger to desire for success. Without desire and determination, passing any exam will be difficult.</span></p>
              <p>3. Study alone</p>
              <p>Study alone with your mp3 is more effective than group studying. </p>
              <p>4. You are accountable for your results</p>
              <p>Passing exam is a personal journey, teachers, friends and tutors can only help so much, utimately, knowing it is yourself that produce results. Do not blame others for not helping you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pls take the above as reference only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wish you luck</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>If like that then don't go into ITE yet<br>Push hard for 'O' Levels at the same time see what poly courses you interested in.<br><br>Edit: This is my advice/reccomendation only, the decision is of course yours to make</p>
