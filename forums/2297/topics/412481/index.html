            <div class='col-md body'>Hello. Would like to seek advice on future prospects. I am in a JC doing arts stream. I got in by appeal. I have the R5 score of students who were admitted in my JC COP in JAE this year thru affiliation. I realised I kind of pick the wrong combi and I am kind of serious abt retaining after promos. After like doing MYE the inclination was not really correct. And judging from now I think I can pass my H1 Promos with C,Ds. While H2 Math, the only H2 which can pass like D or C oso. Promo oso no moderating. Indeed the criteria is 1H2 pass and 3 Subpass includes GP or H1 equivalent pass. I am really scared if I promote I'll scrape As and land up going abroad cos my foundation in the H2s except Math is very weak. Well I don't meet criteria as I have 2Us even though I have pass the rest. I am scared that principal gonna kick me put because I'm appealed. And If I repeat one year would it be worth. Parents have ruled out poly for sure. They feel I have to stay on in JC.</div>

              <p>Firstly, what is your exact combi, and what combi you will want to take?</p>
              <p>Why do you want to take this other combi instead?</p>
              <p>If it is because you think you will score better in this other combi, then I suggest that you do not switch combi, because most ppl who think this way often find themselves wrong after switching combi.</p>
              <p>I will like to advice you to work harder, but I know well enough that some Arts stuff such as Lit can be quite subjective. Thus, this is why it is important to know your current combi. </p>

              Sorry for the late reply.
              
              Im doing
              H2 Literature, Econs, Maths
              H1 China Studies in English, GP, CL
              
              I really wanna change Literature, as for the entire whole year round, I cant relate or answer any of the questions given. Always get U and always lowest in class. Besides for os i did better in SS History so yeah, i hope to switch to physics
              
              I also wanna change CSE to H1 Physics as I feel that H2 Math can complement it.
