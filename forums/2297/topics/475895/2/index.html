              <p><br>It's true that NO2 is a greenhouse gas, but it's not one of the most common or one of the most damaging greenhouse gases. Acid rain from both HNO3 and H2SO4 (for which NO2 catalyzes the oxidation of SO2 to SO3, which hydrolyzes to H2SO4) is probably a greater concern than global warming, in the context of NO2.</p>

              <p><br>Adding conc H2SO4 in excess would ensure a high yield of the dehydration product, the alkene. But adding it slowly (to keep the temperature low), would still yield a small amount of the alkene. Moreover the question specifies, "what by-products are possible if the temperature is allowed to rise?"</p>
              <p>MCQs are often problematic due to such ambiguity. Every year since 2011, there are always a couple of questions from the A level H2 Chemistry papers (especially P1), that school JC teachers disagree with each other, and/or disagree with Cambridge, on what the most correct answers should be.</p>
              <p>This year 2013, is no exception.</p>

              <p><br>Correct. Even though the reaction conditions are more ideal for generating alkyl halides instead of alkenes, in industrial practice, there's always a mixture of competing reaction pathways, eg. substitution vs elimination. Which is why further separation and purification of the desired products must always be done.</p>

              <p><br>Perhaps your P2 and P3 will pull your overall score up.</p>
              <p>But at the very least, in the worst case scenario, looks like your B grade should be secure. And if you do well for your other subjects, with As and Bs, you should still be able to get into a decent Uni course, eg. Chemistry @ NUS or Chemistry @ NTU. I've heard of students with B for H2 Chem, still successfully getting into Chemistry @ NUS / NTU, as long as their/your overall score is good enough.</p>
              <p>And worst case scenario, you can always retake as a private candidate (it's not as bad as it sounds).</p>
              <p>P.S.<br>Actually it's not that bad, your 28/40 = 70% exactly. You just need to do slighty better than 70% for your SPA, P2 and P3, and it's still possible to get an A grade, which is most likely to be around 73% or so this year. </p>

              <p>Considering the difficulty of all 3 papers, as well as how all the Singapore JCs have primed their students for a super killer paper, it's most likely around 75%. But 73% for A grade is still very possible, and I don't want to overly dishearten the many students who scored between above 70%, but less than 75%. It's actually still possible that Cambridge might still allow an A grade for 71% or 72% this year. Though my final guess is between 73-75%.</p>

              <p>WOAH 80% is insane! I don't know how it can go up that high and how you guys calculate the projected A grade but from what I know(from friends and in this forum), only paper 2 is tough and others are very easy but with lots of carelnessso should it be safe to assume to get an A,candidates should score above 75% for ALL papers except paper 2? If so,it should be something like (0.75 X 65 + 0.7 X 35) = 73.5%.<br>That's like wayyy below 80%,even 75% would be alittle too farfetched. Haha.</p>

              <p><br>SPA is problematic, and to some extent, skewed differently in different JCs, abit akin to PW, but not quite as biased and unfair.</p>
              <p>Still, majority of students score closer to 10% rather than the full 15%, and there are always failures in every JC, even for SPA.</p>
              <p>80% for A grade for H2 Chemistry is not impossible, but not realistic and very unlikely, especially after considering the difficulty level of the 2013 H2 Chem papers, each of which <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">did</span></strong> contain a very fair range of easy, standard, and difficult questions.</p>
              <p>I still stick to my estimate of 73-75% for A grade this year.</p>

              <p><br>Entropy change is linked, but not necessary directly the same, as temperature change. For instance, a reaction could be endothermic, but result in a greater number of species on the RHS (relative to LHS), and so more species = more entropy.</p>
              <p>Since the enthalpy change is endothermic (ie. thermodyanically unfavourable), as evidenced by the fall in temperature, and yet the Gibbs free energy change is negative (ie. thermodyanically favourable), it means that the entropy change must have been sufficiently positive (thermodyanically favourable) and large in magnitude, to have outweighed the thermodyanically unfavourable endothermic enthalpy change, such that the overall Gibbs free energy change was negative and thermodyanically favourable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Electrical conductivity increases from Grp II to Grp III (since more delocalized valence electrons to participate in electrical conductivity) before dropping. Not consistently decreasing.</p>
