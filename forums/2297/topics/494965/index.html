              I recently just graduated from RP with 2.92 GPA in an IT course. I didn't like the course and am hoping to switch course. Am looking to take up Biological Sciences in NTU. I am aware that my course is unrelated to apply to the course I want and thus am hoping to take private a levels to get into uni.
              
              Now, I know my gpa is out of league but hear me out. The only reason why my cumulative gpa is low is cause in year 1 I didn't study, only play. But in year 2 and 3 I bulk up and studied very hard (gpa 3.8 for 2 semesters and a DIST in FYP project). So abit regret also that never go and study when I was younger but what is in the past is in the past right?
              
              So I am thinking of taking private A's (in NS now doing admin job - so a LOT free time) now in hopes of getting into my dream course. Any advice? I also want to know how the grading system is like for alevels and like what is the H1 H2 H3 thing I don't understand. Also I read the NTU website it says got 10th percentile and 90th percentile grades what is that?

              You can google out the answers to all your questions, but I'll address the last one for you : <p>
                  10th percentile and 90th percentile refers to the grades obtained by the bottom 10% and top 10% of A level students who successfully applied for the Uni course last year, respectively.</p><p>
                  If you decide to come for my <a href="http://www.bedokfunlandjc.com/">BedokFunland JC</a> private tuition for A level H2 Chemistry (which may be a prerequisite for your NTU course, depending on the exact College you matriculate under), I'll address any remaining queries you have regarding the A level process in-person.</p><p>
                  Even if you choose to matriculate under a College in which A level Chemistry is optional, but you'll suffer a severe disadvantage if you do not have A level Chemistry, when taking Biochemistry modules, so A level Chemistry is strongly recommended for anyone taking any Science courses in Uni. A level Chemistry is compulsory for applying into Medicine.
              </p><p>
              If you're gonna self-study without going for private tuition, you can post H2 Chemistry questions here if you need help.

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> A levels are quite tough so self study may not work for some students. You need teachers or tutors to teach you.</p>
              <p> You need a PhD in life science to do proper research work in Singapore. If you have a basic degree in life science, it is gonna be quite tough to find suitable jobs.</p>
              <p> There are practical papers in bio and chem in A levels, so you need to find a private school with labs to practise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Another way is to go to MDIS and do their private foundation diploma and degree in biomedical science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can try but there are many hurdles. All the best.</p>
