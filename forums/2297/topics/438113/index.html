              I'm a ex-poly student which means i studied for one year in poly before withdrawing..
              i transferred to JC, i didn't do well and i think i'm gonna retain or consult to leave by the school. I tried to reapply back to poly but they say ex-poly students have very low chance. So i was thinking what to do if the school wants to consult me to leave ....should i register as a private A level candidate for next year or should i apply for SIM??
              i heard that SIM can use O level cert but i also know that O level cert can only be used twice..i used one time for poly and the second time for JC...sooo I'm really lost..what should i do??? help me pls.

              <p>Dear Weelewanka,</p>
              <p>There is a misconception of number of times O level certificate can be use. O Level certificate is a qualification paper that states the level of education you have. There is no limit to how many times the cert can be use.</p>
              <p>You have to choose whether if want you to furthur your studies through the A level route or SIM route. Yes you apply SIM using your O level certificate. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Pardon me for saying this, but if you are not doing well in both JC and poly, what makes you think you will do well in SIM?</p>
              <p>What you should do now is to reflect and think about why you are not able to do well in both the JC and poly setting. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT</span></strong> think of this as your own inability; instead, list out the factors which have been contributing to your poor performance, and consider how you can improve upon them.</p>
              <p>SIM may not be considered a ''good'' institute by many, but that does not negate the fact that it is a tertiary level institute, and will not be largely different from polys.</p>
              <p>Another thing to consider is NS. Since you have left poly once and JC once, you are unlikely to be able to run away from it, especially when you are trying to enter a non-poly tertiary institute now. You should start reflecting and planning ahead now, while you still have some time to do so.</p>

              <p>i think that you should only retake your 'a' levels if you really think that you would have the commitment and drive to study hard in the following year to do extremely well for the exams. otherwise, don't waste your timme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another thing is if you decide to do a your sstudies with a private university, you should think abiut the degree that you want to do first. becausse doing a diploma at sim will entitle you to go direct into doing your degree. whereas you will not be allowed to take your degree strraaight after your diploma if you went to another private school, i.e. kaplan. so i think these are the major concerns when deciding on your next step. </p>
              <p>hope this helps! :)</p>
