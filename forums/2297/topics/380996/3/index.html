              <p>Forbiddensinner, thanks :) It's a good thing to let different opinions out so that students can make more informed choices. Both have their pros and cons.</p>

                                          some people who don't mind spending 1 more yr to get a 1st class or
                                          2nd upper honours.</p>

              <p>Trust me, once you get out to the working world, 1 wasted year can mean missed earnings that could be equivalent to between once to twice the whole 4 years of uni school fees.</p>
              <p>Yet if one were to say earnings are not important, then there's no point to get that FCH right, unless it's purely for education sake? :)</p>

              <p>The 2 yrs in NS definitely made my theoretical knowledge quite

                                          lab in uni was a piece of cake for me as well as most of my poly

              <p>That's interesting. Your science course has probably more lab work than electrical engineering, I believe. But there will be many A level perfect scorers in electrical engineering vying for the As, both in labs and in theoretical work. E.g. for me, some lab reports, I got between 9.5 to 10 upon 10 because I was highly driven to do well for that modules which I like, which was EG1108 (I think) and EE2010 (Systems and Control).</p>
              <p>In fact, my partner (also A levels) was benefitting from what I was doing because she had totally no idea what was going on.</p>
              <p>I guess it depends :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, I have to say that many EE pple will borrow old experimental reports from their seniors in the higher years, then copy and paste with their own results <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So it doesn't really matter in the end...</p>

              <p>A 1st class honours if obtainable is a key to further education opporunities, higher pay etc so i believe there are still people who are willing to sacrifice 1 year for. I won't deny the pay issue but some people might have a more long term goal in mind and will prefer to go slower but have more assurance for their results.</p>
              <p>Chemistry lab is 3hrs in yr 1, 6 hrs each in yr 2/3 so i believe its more different as theres a larger emphasis on lab work. Everyone always try to get senior reports to copy but for my course, they for some stupid reason decided to make the yr 2/3 lab examinable so its no longer just doing a lab report but the understanding of the entire experiment becomes important for that exam which constitutes 50% of the overall grade.</p>

              <p>A 1st class honours if obtainable is a key to further education
              opporunities, higher pay etc so i believe there are still people
              who are willing to sacrifice 1 year for. I won't deny the pay issue
              but some people might have a more long term goal in mind and will
              prefer to go slower but have more assurance for their results.</p>
              <p>Chemistry lab is 3hrs in yr 1, 6 hrs each in yr 2/3 so i believe
              its more different as theres a larger emphasis on lab work.
              Everyone always try to get senior reports to copy but for my
              course, they for some stupid reason decided to make the yr 2/3 lab
              examinable so its no longer just doing a lab report but the
              understanding of the entire experiment becomes important for that
              exam which constitutes 50% of the overall grade.</p>

              <p>when i was in sec sch, i also thought i would maybe like to go poly instead. because everyone tells me that jc life is tough, its hectic, you just mug your life away etc. </p>
              <p>somehow, after much thought, i decided going to a good jc might have more scholarship chances lol. and i still think going into a jc is a better route to aim for scholarships, correct me if im wrong. moreover, people usually adapt to changing lifestyles as they come, hectic or not, it dosent make a difference once you've adapted to that kind of life.</p>
              <p>and so i ended up in a jc. all i can say is...if ure the average type of student with not much aims or whatsoever and want to go jc, try to go into a good one. the studying attitude of the general population in a better jc is vastly different from those in a not as good jc, as you will be more driven(by external factors eg peer pressure) to study for better results in a good jc..</p>
              <p>though i have some friends who scored very well and simply go into a jc thats near their house for convenience's sake and still doing very well. if youre that kinda person either make sure you're very smart, or you're very motivated to do well...</p>

              <p>First thing that you should ask yourself is, what is your ambition in life? What do you have most passion for? What is the future job that you can envision yourself in next time? With that said &amp; done, you work towards that goal.</p>
              <p>And seriously, I don't see what is up with the stupid JC vs Poly debate. As everyone has said, there are its own pros &amp; cons. And don't go to a JC for the sake of recognition, easier entry to Uni or whatever hoohah reason. Just do what you want to do.</p>
              <p>My own personal experience is that I took the JC route, screwed up my A levels. But managed to enter engineering in NTU. And honestly speaking, I'm still wondering if this is my cup of tea. I'm struggling now as I find it hard to catch up with Uni life after a 2 years break due to NS and the accelerated pace of Uni life. Same for my poly friends and other JC friends. We are all trying to find our way around in this 1st year. So ultimately when you hit Uni, everyone is on the same equal plane. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We just find a way to survive!</span> </strong>But in the end, you must have a passion for what you want to do. And even if you realise that you have made the wrong choice, you can always switch. There is never an end to the road for you.</p>

              <p>To TS, yes the lousiest express student can go to JC. Heck even
              normal stream students can go to JC. It is what you do and not where
              you are that decide where you go. I did badly in Sec 2 and decide I want to go JC so I asked to take additional maths independently.</p>
              <p>It is better to ask the school whether you can take additional maths as a school candidate by outside learning or not. As people without AM will be disadvantaged in the L1R5 ( the AM candidates will take most of the EM A1s and A2s) and in JC life.</p>
