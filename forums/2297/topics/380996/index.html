              <p>Question: why must you go to JC, and why must it be VJC?</p>
              <p>If your worth is determined by which tertiary institution you go to, then I don't know what to say, except that the problem really lies with your mentality.</p>
              <p>I know of plenty of poly grads who have made it good. No reason why you can't, so long as you're willing to work for it.</p>
              <p>The 'lousiest express class student' should be thinking about how to make the best of his situation to go on to poly and to succeed using that route.</p>

              <p>why must go JC ? </p>
              <p>because now students face pressure from teacher who tell them that go JC is the best and sure way to have a future, they will tell u that have a degree is better then a dip, and the way if u wan go uni is through JC because there is a higher chance of JC student going UNI then poly students.</p>
              <p>why VJC?  i have no fucking idea.</p>
              <p>btw VJC u bo AM they kick u out even if ur L1R5 is 6 or below.</p>

              <p>teachers will tell their student that those who go poly now earn only  1++k and that their pay rise is ard $50</p>
              <p>HENCE, JC is the way to go cause it can give u a higher chance of going UNi which normally has a higher starting pay of 2k+ and a bigger increasement .</p>

              <p>Absolute rubbish.</p>
              <p>Yes, going via the JC route increases your chances of getting into a University.</p>
              <p>So since I'm aiming for Business, I should go to JC with my L1R5 of 18 and probably get into a crap University course that nobody wants rather than go to a polytechnic with L1R4 of 9 and get into the polytechnic course of my choice.</p>
              <p>Since JC is the "safest route" (LOL), we should all go JC for the bigger "increasement" (its increment) and for the higher starting pay.</p>
              <p>Yes, absolute rubbish.</p>
              <p>JC is certainly the safest route if you have completely no ambition in life or you intend to inherit a lot of wealth from your parents in the near future. That's all.</p>
              <p>Right now, I see that the only reason a person would choose JC over Polytechnic is that he does not want to waste one year of his life away, or that polytechnics do not offer "double diplomas" as NUS and other universities offer "double degrees".</p>
              <p>Polytechnic graduates, open entry to their relevant university courses, have a MUCH easier time in coping with the syllabus, I believe some get to skip one university year (which results in a net loss of 0 years), and polytechnic graduates with a degree is preferable in some sectors to a JC graduate with a degree.</p>
              <p>Public sector and Private sector starting pay and pay increment are very different.<br><br>You also didn't mention job availability and stability.</p>
              <p>You also didn't mention that the course that you want to get into might be the easiest or hardest to get into.</p>
              <p>You also didn't mention that the main reason people choose JC or polytechnic is because they don't know what they want to do later in life yet.</p>
              <p>No idea which teacher told you polytechnic-graduates only have a starting pay of $1000 or whatever, but that teacher is one big idiot.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Yangsilun,</p>
              <p>If you do not offer A. Maths, you will not be able to take up H2 mathematics in VJC. However, you will still be able to take up H1 mathematics.</p>
              <p>Do note that the offering of Mathematics is a must for all VJC students, regardless of whether you are entering the Science Stream or the Arts Stream.</p>

              <p>I have always wanted to study in an engineering course. JC prepared me better for the engineering course in NUS. For a fact, everyone who got first class honours in my year for Elec Engineering was from JC.</p>
              <p>My first two years in uni was a breeze because almost everything was a repeat of A levels... easily scoring As, and this greatly boost up my CAP, providing me with a formidable base to fall back on. Poly grads 'lose' building this base with the easier modules, and have to compete to score in tougher modules. This is to me, the greatest advantage of JC over poly students.</p>
              <p>Poly grads can skip 1 year of study for the correct course, as they are expected to have studied first year uni stuff in poly. But for guys, after 2 years of NS, you would have forgotten most of the stuff, and yet you will be competing to score against JC students who have just learned most of the things and have them fresh and strong in their head.</p>
              <p>The last 2 paragraphs shows that the amount of effort required from poly grads to do as well as a JC student in uni is much higher.</p>

              <p>Super untrue. Poly is much more hands on, whereas for NUS, it's much more theoretical. As a result, poly students will do better at hands on projects. However, such projects are only a small portion of NUS engineering's curriculum.</p>
              <p>Regarding net loss of 0 years, it's also subjective, depending on the course you take.</p>

              <p>Not entirely true as well. It's the same both ways. I know people who do not know what they want to do, yet choose poly because they are scared of the rigours in JC. Yet I have met people who already knew what they want, and they chose JC.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, it's a matter of perceptions on both sides of the camp. But my life experiences tell me otherwise. Both camps will have people who were unsure, and people who were sure.</p>

              <p>I shall share my insights on the engineering route I went through in life via JC. ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have always wanted to study in an engineering course. JC prepared me better for the engineering course in NUS. For a fact, everyone who got first class honours in my year for Elec Engineering was from JC.</p>
              <p>My first two years in uni was a breeze because almost everything was a repeat of A levels... easily scoring As, and this greatly boost up my CAP, providing me with a formidable base to fall back on. Poly grads 'lose' building this base with the easier modules, and have to compete to score in tougher modules. This is to me, the greatest advantage of JC over poly students.</p>
              <p>Poly grads can skip 1 year of study for the correct course, as they are expected to have studied first year uni stuff in poly. But for guys, after 2 years of NS, you would have forgotten most of the stuff, and yet you will be competing to score against JC students who have just learned most of the things and have them fresh and strong in their head.</p>
              <p>The last 2 paragraphs shows that the amount of effort required from poly grads to do as well as a JC student in uni is much higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Super untrue. Poly is much more hands on, whereas for NUS, it's much more theoretical. As a result, poly students will do better at hands on projects. However, such projects are only a small portion of NUS engineering's curriculum.</p>
              <p>Regarding net loss of 0 years, it's also subjective, depending on the course you take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not entirely true as well. It's the same both ways. I know people who do not know what they want to do, yet choose poly because they are scared of the rigours in JC. Yet I have met people who already knew what they want, and they chose JC.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, it's a matter of perceptions on both sides of the camp. But my life experiences tell me otherwise. Both camps will have people who were unsure, and people who were sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Engineering:</p>
              <p>Starting pay for poly grads (guys) is normally between $1.5k to $2.2k<br>Starting pay for uni grads (guys) is normally between $2.4k to $3.8k, depending on your honours.</p>

              <p><br>I can't individually quote selected parts because I'm simply a lazy ass, so here it goes.</p>
              <p>Could it have been coincidence that all the FCH graduates from your time were from a JC?</p>
              <p>To be honest, I think students of your generation (who are now the same age group as you) had a much better mindset than the students of my generation (who are currently students). <br>Thus they knew what they wanted in life mostly, and set their minds to it. My peers are mainly, from what I see (don't call me cynical), mainly made of fail in terms of the right mindset and attitude.</p>
              <p>Regarding the NS Years disrupting your studies and thus causing you to forget whatever you learned in polytechnic, I guess you do have a point.</p>
              <p>But I am very certain that the more popular courses in the polytechnics now, should you apply for a local university with your diploma, result in you either being able to forgo a couple of modules here and there or skipping the first here entirely.</p>
              <p>I don't know exactly which relevant courses I am talking about, but I am very sure they are the more popular ones right now.</p>
              <p>I guess it DOES work both ways, considering some people who score L1R5 of 6 points and know what they want in life still choose to go to a polytechnic, simply because they don't want to "spend another 2 years mugging" (which is one of the reasons why I think my generation has major issues).</p>

              <p><br> I can't individually quote selected parts because I'm simply a lazy
              ass, so here it goes.</p>
              <p>Could it have been coincidence that all the FCH graduates from
              your time were from a JC?</p>
              <p>To be honest, I think students of your generation (who are now
              the same age group as you) had a much better mindset than the
              students of my generation (who are currently students).<br> Thus they knew what they wanted in life mostly, and set their minds
              to it. My peers are mainly, from what I see (don't call me
              cynical), mainly made of fail in terms of the right mindset and
              attitude.</p>
              <p>Regarding the NS Years disrupting your studies and thus causing
              you to forget whatever you learned in polytechnic, I guess you do
              have a point.</p>
              <p>But I am very certain that the more popular courses in the
              polytechnics now, should you apply for a local university with your
              diploma, result in you either being able to forgo a couple of
              modules here and there or skipping the first here entirely.</p>
              <p>I don't know exactly which relevant courses I am talking about,
              but I am very sure they are the more popular ones right now.</p>
              <p>I guess it DOES work both ways, considering some people who
              score L1R5 of 6 points and know what they want in life still choose
              to go to a polytechnic, simply because they don't want to "spend
              another 2 years mugging" (which is one of the reasons why I think
              my generation has major issues).</p>

              <p>Do you think it could be so coincidental out of a thousand plus students in EE alone? I don't think so. I could go back to my year book and look at other engineering disciplines, but I'm lazy to :(</p>
              <p>But from here, we can conclude that the percentage of FCH from JC is definitely much higher. My main guess is because although most of the first year of uni modules can be skipped, not all could be. People like me who planned early would take more modules during the initial 2 years as they would be easier, and concentrate on the tougher ones in the final 2 years. I could even finish up with an industrial attachment and student exchange with ease. Poly grads wouldn't be able to afford the time to do so as they they only 3 years in uni. :(</p>

              <p>Just some minor disagreements with many of the arguements but too many things to quote.</p>
              <p>Eagle, our 'generation' belongs more to the age where everyone who can go to JC will go to JC while its the poorer students that choose to go to poly. You graduated before me and even during my batch, poly was still considered a place that only ppl who cannot go JC choose to go. However nowadays, the trends are increasing for top studens who reject JCs and go to poly so its no longer able to use poly/jc grads of our time to compare to now.</p>
              <p>There are JC students that get the FCH i won't deny esp at your time last year however are u certain that all the bottom students are poly students or are there still a large number of JC students at the bottom as well? Rather than paint a very positive picture and only talking about the top, we should consider the whole picture and see the whole cohort for discussion. Furthermore, how many peoeple can really dream about getting that FCH?</p>
              <p>For salary comarisions, its unfair to compare poly with uni because they are of different standard. If a poly student can ever earn more than a uni grad, there is no reason to go uni already. If you compare JC to poly, a poly can earn 1-2k salary, a JC student pathetic amount.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, alot of poly students choose to go overseas to study as do many JC students. Overseas, poly students can get 1.5-2yrs exemption for almost any course which makes a poly grad graduate even earlier than a JC grad who goes to the same overseas uni. In fact for my poly course, about half or so of the top scorers all chose to go overseas uni to study rather than local uni so its not fair to just judge those who go from poly to local uni as really the best from poly.</p>
