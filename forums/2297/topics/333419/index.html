              <p>Hey all :D Here's some questions that I feel isn't clearly explained in the textbook and so I need your help in a more elaborate and comprehensible way to explain these questions to me, thank you so so so much!</p>
              <p>- DC Motor. We all know to increase the turning effect, we have to</p>
              <p>1) Increase the current supplied.</p>
              <p>2) Insert a soft iron core within the coil.</p>
              <p>3) Increase the number of turns of the coil.</p>
              <p>4) Use a pair of stronger magnets.</p>
              <p>But the thing is, I don't fully understand the theory behind all these. Anyone care to explain?</p>
              <p>- AC Generator. The purpose of the slip rings as it states in the textbook is so that "the alterating induced current in the coil is transferred to the external circuit". So does that mean that without the slip rings,  the induced e.m.f is lost to the surroundings or does it keep 'flowing' throughout the coil? And according to a longman assessment, they stated that the purpose of the slip rings is so as to prevent the coil from entanglement. So what exactly is the correct explanation?</p>
              <p>- Charges. For example, if a positively charged conductor is allowed to come near the left of an neutral object, the electrons in the object will be attracted to the left and the protrons will be repelled away to the right side. Thus, there will be attraction between the conductor and the object but once they touch instantaneously, some of the electrons were transferred to the positive conductor thus causing the object to become positively charged (since it lost some electrons) and repel away from the positive conductor, right? Then why is it for example in crop-spraying it states that the positively charged droplets induces negative charges on the plants as they come closer to the plants, allowing attraction. So, when do I know it's induction or something? And when the droplets reach the plants, does that mean that the plants become negatively charged or positively charged?</p>

              <p><strong>- AC Generator. The purpose of the slip rings as it states in
                                              the textbook is so that "the alterating induced current in the coil
                                              is transferred to the external circuit". So does that mean that
                                              without the slip rings,  the induced e.m.f is lost to the
                                              surroundings or does it keep 'flowing' throughout the coil? And
                                              according to a longman assessment, they stated that the purpose of
                                              the slip rings is so as to prevent the coil from entanglement. So
                                              what exactly is the correct explanation?</strong></p>
              <p>Slip rings ensure that the direction of the induced e.m.f./current flowing in the EXTERNAL circuit changes every half revolution (that is, every 180 degrees turn) to produce an ALTERNATING CURRENT (main purpose of A.C. GENERATOR)</p>
              <p><strong>The purpose of the slip rings as it states in
                                              the textbook is so that "the alterating induced current in the coil
                                              is transferred to the external circuit". So does that mean that
                                              without the slip rings,  the induced e.m.f is lost to the
                                              surroundings or does it keep 'flowing' throughout the coil? </strong>I don't know about this. This is very vague and debatable (induced current flows in the cables).</p>
              <p><strong></strong>The Longman Book is not wrong to say prevention of coil entanglement, because without the slip rings, try to visualise if you were to turn the coil. How would the connecting cables in the EXTERNAL circuit be affected? Or rather, how would the external circuit, on a whole, be affected?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>- Charges. For example, if a positively charged conductor is
                                      allowed to come near the left of an neutral object, the electrons
                                      in the object will be attracted to the left and the protrons will
                                      be repelled away to the right side. Thus, there will be attraction
                                      between the conductor and the object but once they touch
                                      instantaneously, some of the electrons were transferred to the
                                      positive conductor thus causing the object to become positively
                                      charged (since it lost some electrons) and repel away from the
                                      positive conductor, right? Then why is it for example in
                                      crop-spraying it states that the positively charged droplets
                                      induces negative charges on the plants as they come closer to the

                                      that the plants become negatively charged or positively
                                      charged?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the electrons
                                      in the object will be attracted to the left and the protrons will
                                      be repelled away to the right side. </strong>The protons don't move. It is very easy for them to find fault with you if you say that the protons are repelled to the right (although it is not wrong to say so). Just state that electrons are attracted to the left and the protons are LEFT at the right, INDUCING the right side with a positive charge (and vice-versa).</p>
              <p><strong>to become positively
                                      charged. </strong>To be INDUCED with a positive charge (though I can't find any difference, but my teacher emphasised on using this)</p>
              <p><strong>Then why is it for example in
                                      crop-spraying it states that the positively charged droplets

                                      that the plants become negatively charged or positively
                                      charged? </strong>What textbook does your school use? Mind uses the Pearson Longman Physics Insights, 2nd Edition (no sorry, I don't have a scanner). Mine gives an example on Electrostatic Paint Spraying. I think you just have to understand that induction precedes attraction. Induce negative charges on plant --&gt; attraction --&gt; charges between droplets and plant are neutralised (since they come into contact) --&gt; electrically neutral plant.</p>

              <p>Hey! Thanks so much, I think you've been a great help, really! :) My textbook is the Marshall Cavendish Education GCE 'O' Level Physics Matters (which isn't very good in my opinion &gt;&lt;).</p>
              <p>So it means in static electricity, I ALWAYS use the word 'induce' a charge on and adds on that the electrons are attracted and not the protons are repelled? Similarly for paint spraying and crop-spraying, both also inducing charge right? =)</p>

              coil?</strong> I don't know about this. This is very vague and
              debatable (induced current flows in the cables).</p>
              <p>The Longman Book is not wrong to say prevention of coil
              entanglement, because without the slip rings, try to visualise if
              you were to turn the coil. How would the connecting cables in the
              EXTERNAL circuit be affected? Or rather, how would the external
              circuit, on a whole, be affected?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>- Charges. For example, if a positively charged
              conductor is allowed to come near the left of an neutral object,
              the electrons in the object will be attracted to the left and the
              protrons will be repelled away to the right side. Thus, there will
              be attraction between the conductor and the object but once they
              touch instantaneously, some of the electrons were transferred to
              the positive conductor thus causing the object to become positively
              charged (since it lost some electrons) and repel away from the
              positive conductor, right? Then why is it for example in
              crop-spraying it states that the positively charged droplets
              induces negative charges on the plants as they come closer to the
              plants, allowing attraction. So, when do I know it's induction or
              something? And when the droplets reach the plants, does that mean
              that the plants become negatively charged or positively
              charged?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the electrons in the object will be attracted to the
              left and the protrons will be repelled away to the right
              side.</strong> The protons don't move. It is very easy for them to
              find fault with you if you say that the protons are repelled to the
              right (although it is not wrong to say so). Just state that
              electrons are attracted to the left and the protons are LEFT at the
              right, INDUCING the right side with a positive charge (and
              vice-versa).</p>
              <p><strong>to become positively charged.</strong> To be INDUCED
              with a positive charge (though I can't find any difference, but my
              teacher emphasised on using this)</p>
              <p><strong>Then why is it for example in crop-spraying it states
              that the positively charged droplets induces negative charges on
              the plants as they come closer to the plants, allowing attraction.
              So, when do I know it's induction or something? And when the
              droplets reach the plants, does that mean that the plants become
              negatively charged or positively charged?</strong> What textbook
              does your school use? Mind uses the Pearson Longman Physics
              Insights, 2nd Edition (no sorry, I don't have a scanner). Mine
              gives an example on Electrostatic Paint Spraying. I think you just
              have to understand that induction precedes attraction. Induce
              negative charges on plant --&gt; attraction --&gt; charges between
              droplets and plant are neutralised (since they come into contact)
              --&gt; electrically neutral plant.</p>

              <p>Very very well done. You are well on your way to an A1 :D</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>The purpose of the slip rings as it states in the
              textbook is so that "the alterating induced current in the coil is
              transferred to the external circuit". So does that mean that
              without the slip rings,  the induced e.m.f is lost to the
              surroundings or does it keep 'flowing' throughout the
              coil?</strong> I don't know about this. This is very vague and
              debatable (induced current flows in the cables).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Without slip rings, or rather, without a complete circuit, there will be no induced current. Rather, there will be an induced voltage.</p>
              <p>The reason is because of the force on the moving electrons. When wires move in a magnetic view, you can visualise lots of electrons moving in the wire moving in the field as well... Something like that... There will be a force on the electrons to move to one side, and hence creating a potential difference. If it is a complete circuit, these electrons will continue to move in the circuit, resulting in the induced current :D</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks for your reply. :D I didn't know about "The induced force is directly proportional to the magnetic field
                  and current." I guess I haven't learn it? Haha, anyway I was just curious because it's a question in a NGS prelim paper whereby they asked why the turning effect will increase when the number of turns of coil increase and when a stronger magnet is used. <br><br>I guess it's not required as of now, but just wondering. :D Thanks so much!</p>
