              <p>Howdy!</p>
              <p>These days, I found my tutor to be getting more and more inefficient in his work. Whenever I asked a question, he'd try to solve them and when he can''t, he simply says,"Check with your teacher and get back to me."</p>
              <p>I was like speechless. I mean, definitely I'd go check with my teacher. However doesn't he have a responsibility to help me check up on the question as well? Both of us have to play a part in seeking for the answer, isn't it? (though I too have a role to play in my own learning)</p>
              <p>What's more, this teacher once came from prestigious schools. Wondering if I shuld continue having tuition with him. He used to be quite active in helping students with questions(but that was when my friends and I first joined him. Think that's part of his efforts to "keep" us as his students) and would immediately check up questions which he can't solve.</p>
              <p>Kind of irks me to think that I pay money for a service that doesn't even exist.</p>

              <p>Change if you think you still need a tutor to continue.</p>
              <p>Or you can post your questions here. Fellow students, ex-students, tutors, helpful forumers, will help you. Homework Forum at sgforums is one of the most helpful around in Singapore :D</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter whether the teacher is from a pretigious school or not. Being clever or from a good school doesn't mean someone is a good teacher and vice versa.</p>
              <p>Is his behavior just temporary or has it been this way for some time? If its temp, it might be because his busy lately but if its been for sometime, maybe you can just request for a change of tuition teacher since it seems like hes slacking and not that interested to teach anymore.</p>
