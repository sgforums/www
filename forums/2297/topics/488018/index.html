              <i>There are many problems with using international or US based crowdfunding platforms (eg. Singapore money transfers not supported). The Singapore Government should ideally implement a secure Singapore based crowdfunding platform (run by the Government) that Singaporeans can use for cases such as these, to help fellow Singaporeans. Anyone knows how we can help Mr John Low? </i>
                  <br><br><img src="http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/original_images/Apr2015/superdad_tnp.jpg"><br><br>
                  Mr John Low suffers chronic pain from arthritis and rotator cuff disorder - a tear in a tendon in his shoulder.
                  <br><br>
                  But that's the least of his worries, said the father of three.
                  <br><br>
                  His wife, Irene, 47, had a heart operation in 2009 and has end-stage renal failure.
                  <br><br>
                  His eldest child, Cassandra, 21, who is waiting to go to polytechnic, has anaemia.
                  <br><br>
                  Second daughter Celia, 19, is partially deaf and needs a hearing aid. She also has mild intellectual disability and knows just a handful of words like "Papa", "Mama" and "Didi" (Mandarin for younger brother).
                  <br><br>
                  His son, Bernard, 12, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy, and needs round-the-clock care.
                  <br><br>
                  The couple are jobless and rely on the $1,240 a month in financial assistance from the North East Community Development Council Medical social workers help them with the medical expenses, but Mr Low conceded that it is not enough. 
                  <br><br>
                  "If we don't have enough to eat, let the children eat first because they are still young. My wife needs fresh food because of her kidneys. I can eat less. It doesn't matter," he said quietly.

                      MAN RESORTS TO CROWD FUNDING TO PAY OFF DAUGHTERS $69,000 MOE DEBT<br><br>
                      
                      <span style="font-size:14px">Dear Friends,</span><p></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">Our whole family was delighted that our second daughter got through the teaching interview. She was an exemplary student in school and her strongest characteristic is that, she does not give up in all her pursuits.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She got all the relevant teachers and even her PE teacher to write her testimonials in order to support her application to join the teacherâ€™s trainee programme for â€˜Oâ€™ Level students.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">Prior to this, my daughter had already gained entry to one of the diploma courses in the Polytechnic through their Direct Admission exercise, where they base the qualification on the studentâ€™s preliminary examination.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She qualified for health and fitness, event management and nursing courses. If we had a crystal ball, we would not have opted for the teaching course.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">I had always thought of my daughterâ€™s strong determination to overcome all odds to succeed in life would enable her to be successful in any course that she took. This is after seeing her excel in the National Team in Silat (Malay Martial Arts) and doing well in training others to master the skill.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She even cleared her studies in the Polytechnic even though she had never studied chemistry and additional mathematics during her secondary school years.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">Our main intention for her to take up the profession was because of the values she can pass on to her students, if she were to become a teacher eventually.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She proved herself well when she was doing the course at NIE scoring over 3 points for her GPA. The practicum was supposed to be just a formality before she became a teacher.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">Life is known to throw you a curved ball and we were shocked when my daughter did not get through her first practicum despite almost getting a pass for the second observation.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She had to pay $700 to do the second practicum without getting any allowance for it.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">This is very stressful for everyone because it is at the tail-end of the course and the amount to be paid back to MOE is certainly much more compared to if she were to drop out of the course earlier.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">At the second practicum, she had to take it in a different school. It was as though she started from ground zero because the schoolâ€™s culture was different from the previous school.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">She did not go to a higher ranking school so actually she was in a worse position coupled with the mentors having no interest to coach anyone.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">One mentor was furthering her studies during the night and the other mentor had lost all passion for teaching. The other mentor has since left the teaching profession.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">My daughter wanted to do her best at this second practicum but it seemed that nothing was going her way.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">The following is her personal account of what she went through at the second practicum.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">1. I spent sleepless nights to prepare the lesson plan and taken every feedback to improve it and work on it.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">2. I spent a lot of time improving my lesson plans, I did my very best to execute everything I have planned during lesson. Due to the amount of time I spent improvising the lesson plan, it hinder my progress to prepare for my other topics.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">3. I have spared time to participate in preparing for teacherâ€™s day celebration. I choreographed a presentation by the students for the occasion which have taken much of my own time.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">4. I am involved and present in every Judo session and wrote a reflection about what I had observed</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">5. I paid $700+ to redo my practicum and when I explained to Ms June (CT 2). She said that money doesnâ€™t go to them. I was taken back by this reaction and felt lost.</span></p>
                      <span style="font-size:14px">6. Ms Yati (CT 1), she was taking part-time degree studies, she made me felt that I was a burden to her hence, I dared not approach her for help. She too had sleepless nights, her son was falling sick most of that time. I felt stress about it. She did try to share with me about her problems and how she was able to overcome it.</span><p></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">7. She could only spend a certain amount of time with me as she has to complete her own assignments.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">8. Ms June (CT 2) was planning to resign and she did.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">9. I came very early to school at 6am to prepare equipments for students so that I was able to save time and able to carry out my lesson smoothly.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">10. I tried to approach to Ms June (CT 2) for advice and motivation to persevere; she said that if I failed this practicum, I have a diploma to get a stable career and pay the liquidated damages and the numbers will eventually go down.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">11. I have a friend in the same school, sheâ€™s a classmate of mine. She too was teaching the same subject as me. The CTs goes to her and tell her what were my flaws and finding out from her what was wrong with me. My friend would come to me and tell me what they had spoken about me. Why must they do that instead of discussing this with me directly?</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">12. My friend and I, we quarrelled about it because I was unhappy that the CTs went through her instead of facing me. The CTs tried to find out more from her about me whether I am always this emotional. I felt that this situation was as if they were talking behind my back.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">13. This caused me to build a barrier between myself and the CTs. I was clear that I have to work together with them. Due to this incident, I dared not to speak or seek help from anyone.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">14. When my NIE supervisor wanted me to do a reflection, I did and email to her. I never got any reply from her on how I could overcome it.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">15. A week before the moderation, I came to my senses and told the subject head; Ms Mai that I want to put all this behind and forgive my friend, I want to keep moving forward and do my best in the moderation.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">16. I went back home and take every feedback and make amends. The feedback that kept appearing was that there was no link in my PowerPoint slides and in my delivery. I should add more visual so to cater the different learning needs of the students.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">17. I felt the moderation was my only hope that I could prove to them I have not given up. I had searched for hours, videos and clear explanations for the terms which were one of the areas of improvement that I felt I did quite well but still it was not significant enough</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">18. I have done well in NIE as I passed all the modules.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">19. I was late once because of the traffic jam. The rest of the week I reported punctually to work. (unquote)</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">The thing that we feared most has now dawned upon us. My daughter is now slapped hard with a SGD$69,000.00 debt.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">What is worse than this is, the diploma that she received from this course is too specialized for teaching and have no commercial value. This means that she had wasted 4 years of her life pursuing something that cannot be used unless she is a teacher.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">So friends, this is where we as a family are now. We are burdened with a debt of SGD$69,000/-. We cannot afford to pay and have exhausted all avenues for appeal, including to the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. MOE says our daughter has to pay and there is no other alternative.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">We appeal to your good sense to help us in our bad financial times, so that, as a family, we can move on and have closure to this horrendous episode in our lives. No amount is too small for us. We thank everyone for reading and understanding our plight and donating to us.</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">May God bless you all!</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-size:14px">Your humble family of 5!</span></p>

              <p>In general, I felt that it is quite fair. The first part of the article seems to promote her own daughter, heaps of praise which is self exalting in nature. </p>
              <p>In general, all teachers trainee who fails 1st practicum naturally need to take the 2nd one at other schools as usually the practicum school is the perm school for the trainee once he/she graduates, hence, the space needs to be filled urgently and cannot hold further. </p>
              <p>Doing well in NIE modules =/= doing well in teacher training course as the practicum is the most important one (just like if you take a course and fail the FYP, do you think you did well for the course in poly / uni?)</p>
              <p>I think it's like a credit card debt, you enjoy the stipend first and then pay back lor...</p>
              <p>For the 69 k (most prob is 1k/month = 48K + 21k course fees?), it's actually quite fair as MOE did not ask for damages (on compassionate grounds as she failed her course) </p>

              <i>There are many problems with using international or US based crowdfunding platforms (eg. Singapore money transfers not supported). The Singapore Government should ideally implement a secure Singapore based crowdfunding platform (run by the Government) that Singaporeans can use for cases such as these, to help fellow Singaporeans. Anyone knows how we can help Mr John Low? </i>
                  <br><br><img src="http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/original_images/Apr2015/superdad_tnp.jpg"><br><br>
                  Mr John Low suffers chronic pain from arthritis and rotator cuff disorder - a tear in a tendon in his shoulder.
                  <br><br>
                  But that's the least of his worries, said the father of three.
                  <br><br>
                  His wife, Irene, 47, had a heart operation in 2009 and has end-stage renal failure.
                  <br><br>
                  His eldest child, Cassandra, 21, who is waiting to go to polytechnic, has anaemia.
                  <br><br>
                  Second daughter Celia, 19, is partially deaf and needs a hearing aid. She also has mild intellectual disability and knows just a handful of words like "Papa", "Mama" and "Didi" (Mandarin for younger brother).
                  <br><br>
                  His son, Bernard, 12, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy, and needs round-the-clock care.
                  <br><br>
                  The couple are jobless and rely on the $1,240 a month in financial assistance from the North East Community Development Council Medical social workers help them with the medical expenses, but Mr Low conceded that it is not enough. 
                  <br><br>
                  "If we don't have enough to eat, let the children eat first because they are still young. My wife needs fresh food because of her kidneys. I can eat less. It doesn't matter," he said quietly.
