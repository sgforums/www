              Im taking my o's next week and I'm aiming to go to JC .
              I HAVE to take Science course cos the uni that I will be going after JC is a medicine school and only accepts BIO and CHEM . Cos of my ambition . 
              But then I'm now in COMBINED SCIENCES , PHY AND CHEM then how to cope in JC go take H2 chem and H2 Bio ?! And I never take a maths so sure will struggle in JC one .
              So either I take H1 bio or H1 maths .. FYI I maths not v good now . Only like 50 plus .
              Ya , so any of you had such experiences or any suggestions and advice ?
              Would be greatly appreciated !

              Haha I know I do ! I'm aiming for 9 points for L1R5.. 
              Oh dear H2 maths . I hate maths . But thank you for your encouraging words :) 
              H2 bio is Pretty much pure bio . And my teacher said maybe H1 is possible but H2 would be really tough ! Thanks anyway :);)

              <p>You may want to consider saving up before going overseas for medical study.<br>To be frank to you, to get into medicine in NUS, your 'O'-lvl results must be perfect (or next to perfect at the very least) as well, as all the applicants will have perfect 'A'-lvl or equivalent results.</p>
              <p>Just make sure you choose a uni recognised by the local medical board, so you cna practise medicine here next time.</p>

              <p>And nowadays, a near perfect CCA record as well.</p>
              <p>Why would you want to go into medicine? I have a student who is in Chem Olympiad and also vying for a medicine place. I don't want to put a damper, but you need to access your chances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never taking A maths is not much of a problem. I have this student who never took A Maths in JC, went to YJC and took H2 maths, and still came out with an A. Granted, his logarithm was never strong enough even till A levels.</p>
              <p>Not taking Bio at O levels will be the subject that will pose a severe challenge. The JC syllabus itself is extremely tight on time, and to build both H2 Maths from zero A maths and H2 Bio from zero O level Bio is indeed a Herculean task.  ==&gt; So between Dec and Jan is the time for you to pick up on A maths as much as you can if you are really determined. There's no time for slacking at all!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, I believe H1 Bio wouldn't help much in medicine application. Not sure if you really want to go down this road. You really need to consider carefully, including backup plans, because you won't want to end up in a situation of "neither here nor there".</p>

              <p><br>H1 Sciences are completely useless as prerequisites for any Uni science course, let alone Medicine. While NUS and NTU Medicine does not (officially) require H2 Maths (ie. 'A' level Maths), some other (overseas) Medical schools might. And not having H2 Maths might (unofficially) disadvantage your chances, even for NUS and NTU.</p>
              <p>Therefore (assuming you intend to fight all the way for your ambition), your safest bet would be to (fight for the opportunity) to take both H2 Bio and H2 Math. The ideal <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore JC</span></strong> subject combination for applying to Medicine (in any University) is :</p>
              <p>H2 Chemistry, H2 Biology, H2 Mathematics</p>
              <p>Due to the MOE "contrasting subject in JC" policy, NUS and NTU now accept H2 Physics in place of H2 Biology, so two alternative subject combinations, thought less ideal than the one stated above, for applying to Medicine, would be :</p>
              <p>H2 Chemistry, H2 Physics, H2 Mathematics</p>
              <p>H2 Chemistry, H2 Biology, H2 Physics</p>
              <p>Of course, an even more ideal subject combination (than even the 1st one stated above, and is in fact required for some overseas Medical schools), would be :</p>
              <p>H2 Chemistry, H2 Biology, H2 Physics, H2 Mathematics.</p>
              <p>Triple H2 Science + H2 Math (ie. 4 Science H2s, and then there's the contrasting non-science subject, either at H2 or H1 level) in JC, is rare these days (thanks or rather, no thanks, to the "contrasting subject" policy), but a small % of the more capable JC students in the higher tier JCs are still allowed to have this subject combination.</p>

              <p>I'm quite curious.</p>
              <p>Why medicine?</p>
              <p>In fact, interests can be discovered......so it might also be good to step back and see if there's any JC subject combination that still offers the scope.</p>
              <p>PCME is one that I can recommend.</p>

              <p>I observe that some replies here are outdated, here is the truth:</p>
              <p>NUS medicine does not require biology at all, only H2 chemistry is the prerequisite. However, no matter which combi you will be doing in JC, only straight As (meaning AAA of H2, A for H1, A for GP and PW) stand a good chance. If you accidentally score a B somewhere, you will then need to compete with another a few hundreds candidates who score the same as you do for the last few vacancies left. Then H2 biology, H3 subjects and CCA will be taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>Assuming you are aiming at those top JCs(top 5 or 6), their policies are as follows:</p>
              <p>If you did not take A Maths, or failed to obtain a minimum of B3 for it, you WILL NOT be allowed to take H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>If you did not take Biology, or failed to obtain a minimum of A2 for biology(combined), or failed to obtain a minimum of B3 for biology(pure), you WILL NOT be allowed to take H2 Biology.</p>
              <p>You must study Mathsmatics in science stream. This is because Maths is the prerequiste for all Engineering/Science/Business Courses in NUS/NTU. Especially, you may want to know that H2 Maths is the prerequiste for NUS/NTU Engineering Majors but H2 Physics is not.</p>
              <p>Due to contrast-subject policy and maximum AU restriction.</p>
              <p>Students like you are only possible to choose the following combinations:</p>
              <p>a) H2 Maths + H2 Physics + H2 Cheimistry + H2 (an human subject) + H1 GP + PW + at most 1 H3 subject in year 2</p>
              <p>b) H2 Maths + H2 Physics + H2 Chemistry + H1 (an human subject) + H1 GP + PW + 1/2 possible H3 subjects in year 2</p>
              <p>c) Maths+Physics+Chemistry(2 H2 and 1 H1) + H2 (an human subject) + H1 GP + PW +1/2 subjects H3 papers in year 2. However, this will be an odd combi.</p>
