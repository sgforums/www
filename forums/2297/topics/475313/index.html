              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt">Piqued by interest in what private education institutions have to offer, several final-year polytechnic students we interviewed asked a series of questions. To provide the answers, we gathered a panel of experts. They include Mr Leon Choong, Executive Vice-President, Kaplan Singapore; Mr Loh Siew Meng, Managing Director of lnformatics Academy; Mr Chris Lee, Deputy Director, Recruitment of SMF Institute of Higher Learning; and representatives from ACCA Singapore and<br>SAA Global Education Centre.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1. How do the private education institution (PEIs) choose their university partners?</span></span></p>
              <p>As an indicative trend, PEIs generally refer to university ranking guides like the QS World University Rankings. The Sunday Times University Guide and The Guardian University Guide for ranking by faculty. subjects and other factors.</p>
              <p>   The PEIs also refer to overall university rankings, which comprise composite factors like academic reputation. research citations, proportion of international students and international faculty.</p>
              <p>   The PEIs also refer to accreditation by professional bodies and international accreditation agencies like Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, European Quality Improvement System and Association of M BAs. Another key element is the relevance of the programmes offered to industry needs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2. What are the academic standards of the university partners for each PEI and how do they compare to those of our local universities?</span></span></p>
              <p>The PEIs check on the strengths and international rankings of each university partner. In today's global market. the degrees from the university partners are comparable with those from our local universities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3. Where do the lecturers come from and what are their credentials?</span></span></p>
              <p>Most of the lecturers at PEIs have had experience teaching or lecturing in other PEIs or government schools. Some of them are also selected based on their industry experience in the subject area.</p>
              <p>   All lecturers are registered with the Council of Private Education and their qualifications can range from diplomas to doctorates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4. How can I find out the details of the modules of the courses offered by each PEI?</span></span></p>
              <p>They can be found on their individual websites or you can call the institution directly. You can also visit the PEIs and obtain their prospectus.</p>
              <p>   Students can also interact with some PEIs on Facebook.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">5. Are double degrees. double majors. minors offered?</span></span></p>
              <p>Kaplan Singapore offers the largest suite of double major degrees by Murdoch University in Singapore. SMF Institute of Higher Learning offers double major degrees as well. Double major programmes have proven to be very popular among students, both full-time and part-time. These programmes equip graduates with the knowledge in two disciplines, therefore increasing their employability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">6. How long will my study loan be for a course?</span></span></p>
              <p>The duration of the study loan will be dependent on the various bank rules and regulations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">7. What exemptions do polytechnic graduates get when enrolling?</span></span></p>
              <p>Based on the prior learning acquired through their diploma programmes, polytechnic graduates are able to gain direct entry into the second year of many bachelor's degree programmes offered by the university partners of many<br>PEIs.</p>
              <p>   Students can look forward to an average degree completion within a span of 16 to 24 months, allowing them to have a headstart in the job market.</p>
              <p>   Polytechnic graduates majoring in accountancy or business from the polytechnics may be eligible for partial exemptions/advanced standing when enrolling for the ACCA qualification.</p>
              <p>   Holders of fully accredited accounting diplomas from the polytechnics may be able to complete the examinations between 1½  and 2½ years instead oftaking between three and 3½ years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">8. Is it better for mature students to pursue a basic undergraduate programme or one with honours, and why?</span></span></p>
              <p>Between a basic undergraduate course and one with honours, generally honours degree holders will get better salaries.</p>
              <p>   It also depends on the students' preference for degrees from Australian universities or those in the UK.</p>
              <p>   Generally, with British degrees, students will graduate with direct honours, while students of Australian universities have the option of graduating with double majors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">9. What are the benefits of choosing a PEI over a local university?</span></span></p>
              <p>Students at PEIs enjoy an environment that is different and at times more challenging than those in local universities. They also learn to develop independence.</p>
              <p>   Many PEIs offer different and more personalised teaching methods which can also be more creative as students are empowered to eo-create their own activities with the faculty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">10. How are the employment prospects of a degree or other qualification from a PEI compared to a similar qualification from a local university?</span></span></p>
              <p>Private educational institutions often specialise in one or a handful of areas, in contrast with local universities. So students at PEIs can study in more concentrated fields of study, which sometimes means the course can be shorter and students can enter the workforce faster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">11. Which is better, being a part-time student or a full-time one, and why?</span></span></p>
              <p>Being part-time or full-time students depends on a person's commitments. Students who study full-time prefer to spend a more focused duration of time in completing their studies. They are mostly new graduates who prefer to be fully immersed in a more youthful study environment.</p>
              <p>   Most part-time students tend to be working professionals who are juggling their career and studies. Part-time students tend to be more financially independent, older and enjoy interacting with peers who are also in the workforce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">12. Other than the Grade Point Average, what other requirements do students need to meet for courses at PEIs?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For advanced diploma courses, normal entry requirements are as follows:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>A pass or higher grade in the diploma course by the PEI or equivalent.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>A diploma in a cognate subject. Other qualifications or experience which demonstrate that a candidate possesses appropriate knowledge and skills at diploma level may be acceptable.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>Relevant working experience</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>May be required to take bridging modules</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>Meet minimum English proficiency requirements. Students who do not meet the requirements may have to pass English tests conducted by the PEI.</p>
              <p>For undergraduate courses, normal entry requirements are as follows:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>Diploma or advanced diploma (subject to university's approval)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">•</span> </span></span>Minimum English requirements for the course, Students who do not meet the requirements may have to pass English tests conducted by the PEI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">13. What appeal processes are in place if students are unable to meet the requirements to enrol in the course of their choice?</span></span></p>
              <p>Every student is unique, and they are grouped in classes to give as much diversity of perspectives and backgrounds as possible. For students who are keen to study a particular course but have a different level of accomplishment, the programme leaders will conduct an interview and get them into either foundation or bridging programmes.</p>
              <p>   Students can also consider alternative programmes if they are unable to meet the entry requirements. Students who are unable to gain direct admission to a degree programme may enrol in a diploma programme for subsequent matriculation into the degree programmes of their choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">14. How relevant is work experience in pursing higher education, and why?</span></span></p>
              <p>Work experience is more relevant and important for Master's degree programmes as it develops practical knowledge and skills using methodologies that require a high level of participation from every student in the programme. Students are encouraged to have significant work experience to achieve maximum learning outcomes from a Master's degree programme.</p>
              <p>   Students with work experience are also better able to immediately apply their learning, and sharing industry knowledge enriches classroom discussions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">15. What overseas exchange programmes are available and what is the duration?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Students have the opportunity to complete their final year at the home countries of the partner university to gain exposure. The duration of these exchanges is usually between two weeks to a semester.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">16. After obtaining the undergraduate degree, what avenues do the PEIs provide for one to further one's education?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the undergraduate degree, the focus is on employability as well as gaining knowledge and skills. There are the usual Master of Business Administration and other professional courses which deepen specific work skills and knowledge.</p>
              <p>   There are also a range of corporate training courses for companies and individuals who are looking into upgrading their skills in order to improve their career paths or businesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">17. Where do most PEI graduates aspire to go to after graduation?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many PEI graduates work in varied fields, but large numbers of them are found in the private sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">18. Can I reserve a place to pursue a course before enlisting in national service, or do I apply while still serving national service?</span></span></p>
              <p>Higher education is a personal achievement and it is best for students to commit as early as possible, even before enlisting in national service. Many PEIs have online courses. evening classes and even professional certification courses for full-time national servicemen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">19. What opportunities are there for industrial attachments or internships?</span></span></p>
              <p>SAA Global Education offers a Professional Attachment Scheme for ACCA and University of London students. The objective of this scheme is to provide students a chance to experience working life in accounting firms for a period of two months.</p>
              <p>   At SMF Institute of Higher Learning, there are internship opportunities at over 30 companies for Its students with a list of positions in fields such as marketing, communication. events. administration, human resource management. information technology, hospitality and tourism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">20. I am interested in pursuing accountancy or accountancy related studies. What opportunities are there for industrial attachments or internships at the Big 4 and mid-tier accounting firms and other corporate organisations?</span></span></p>
              <p>ACCA Singapore offers the ACCA Internship Programme (AIP) held in collaboration with ACCA Approved Learning Partners as well as ACCA Approved Employers (including the Big 4 and mid-tier accounting firms as well as corporate organisations).</p>
              <p>   The three-month internship period usually begins in January and ends in March every year.</p>

              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">21. I am studying marketing in polytechnic now. Should I continue studying marketing at a PEI or change to another course like business law or accounting to ensure better employability after graduation?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Students are advised to enquire about the recognition of the school's certificates in the market and the progression pathway to ranked universities. lnformatics. for instance, has 30 years of academic achievement and has strong long-term partnerships with good universities.</p>
              <p>   Business law and accounting are more specialised degree programmes than marketing. There are pros and cons for all of the degree programmes. it depends on what future career path one wishes to take.</p>
              <p>   If one wishes to continue with a marketing degree programme, he/she might be considered for exemptions and will have a chance to complete the degree programme in a shorter duration, which will be an added advantage.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><strong>WITH a wide variety of courses available in universities and PEIs here, poly leavers are spoilt for choice with regard to furthering their education.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   But such variety can end up confusing prospective students. and it is essential that they make calm. reasonable and informed choices.</p>
              <p>   Among the most important things prospective students for further education should do is avoid peer pressure, said psychologist Daniel Koh of Insights Mind Centre.</p>
              <p>   "Polytechnic graduates should be aware of their passions in life and follow them since they are less likely to change on impulse. Once (polytechnic) graduates know these goals, that can help pave the way for the choice of the most suitable educational courses.</p>
              <p>   "This does not mean that one cannot change the choices in future, but it just helps narrow the choices to those closest to one's heart."</p>
              <p>   Mr Koh felt that polytechnic graduates could start the ball rolling by first listing their interests and then limiting themselves to one or two that were most achievable.</p>

Kaplan Singapore. said: "Polytechnic graduates should select a PEI that offers their preferred course of study by assessing the reputation of the awarding institution. the duration and structure of the course (how it suits their lifestyle and commitments) and its affordability."</p>
              <p>   A spokesman for TMC Academy said polytehnic graduates should also check out the modules and reputation of the university partners of each PEI before making a choice of where to further their education.</p>
              <p>   "The graduates will be getting a degree awarded by the university, and that is why research on the university ranking, course relevancy and recognition are crucial in deciding on a suitable course. Classification of degrees (e.g. honours or ordinary degrees) is another factor for consideration."</p>
              <p>   Dr Alan Go, academic head and senior lecturer at ERC Institute, said polytechnic graduates should ask three main questions before settling on a PEI for further studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Do you have a burning passion for your career choices?</span></span></p>
              <p>He said: "lt is always much easier to accomplish big things if you love what you do. You may want to be successful at wealth management but if you are not a person, who loves thinking about numbers. dislikes networking and socialising with people. you will not do well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What are your ultimate career objectives?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dr Go said: "Many students who do not have much working experience and are not sure of their career objectives often make decisions to enter a degree programme based on what subjects in their diploma course may be awarded exemptions to the degree programme. Economically. it makes sense as you could save tuition fees but it only works if you are very sure you want to work in the same field or you have already gained a significant career pathway and a degree will value add to your current career. For students who wish to change their career. the right degree programme will allow them to change their career aspiration.</p>
              <p>   "You need a clear vision of where you want to go and how you want to get there. You can start by trying to narrow down your career options by understanding your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and making a list of industries and job titles you would like to have."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Recognise that you need to study</span></span></p>
              <p>Dr Go added that polytechnic graduates should recognise that many factors like family. friends and societal demands. would take time away from their educational pursuits.</p>
              <p>   "When choosing a degree programme, there will also be lots of opinions from others. research reports on which career is most wahted, what degrees are "best," and so on.</p>
              <p>   "Never allow any of these to be your sole decision factors in choosing which degree is right for you. Go find the facts, speak to people who are doing a degree now, attend as many degree preview seminars as you can. seek good advice from non-biased advisors. Do anything to make sure you fully understand the degree programmes or programmes you are passionate about. Do not be pressurized by any sales propositions," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; COLOR: #0070c0; FONT-SIZE: 18pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Choose the school that gives you a well-rounded education experience</span></span></p>
              <p>"Ignore the traditional advice of pursuing a degree programme in a PEI based solely on the brand and size of the school. You may want to examine other areas such as student council activities, entrepreneurship learning, career path counselling activities, internships, scholarships, connections to industries and even job placement possibilities," said Dr Go.</p>
              <p>   Dr Timothy Chan, academic director, SIM Global Education (SIM GE), said polytechnic graduates need to assess their personalities and visit the campuses of the PEIs they are interested in.</p>
              <p>   He said: "A job in communications, the media or hospitality usually requires an outgoing personality. If you are reserved and dislike social gatherings, then perhaps consider courses in subjects like computer programming, logistics or business planning.</p>
              <p>   "Research shows that with a good match between personality and the academic course of study, students are likely to achieve higher grades, stick with the choice of major or specialisation through graduation, and be more satisfied and successful in their careers.</p>
              <p>   "Find out the academic and financial support each PEI provides. A well-established institution has the financial resources to offer bursaries, grants and scholarships to deserving students.</p>
              <p>   "Also find out the international ranking of the university offering the degree programme that you're interested in. Ranking is an accurate indicator of the university's professional standards and quality of teaching.</p>
              <p>   "All things being equal, a jobseeker with credentials from a highly-ranked university is likely more desirable than someone from a lower-ranked university."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 17pt"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">" </span>It is very important to consider all the things that define you as a person like your interests, experience, hobbies, activities and desires. Choose a degree programme that is aligned to your passions and that will lead you to a satisfying career. <span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-SIZE: 17pt"><span style="color: #ff00ff;">"</span></span></span></span></span></p>
