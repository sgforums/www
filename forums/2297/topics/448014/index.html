              <p>Now i am trying to hear from you guys,Can after i pass `N`T level and take `N`A level in private school on 2013? Because i really doesn't like ITE that much...doesn't really mean i hate the school or peoples</p>

              <p>Just go to the normal route.</p>
              <p>My friend goes to 4NT -&gt;  ITE -&gt; NS -&gt; work + private diploma in IT</p>
              <p>If you work hard in ITE, you can still  go to gov poly directly.</p>
              <p>Dont take private O level and waste money. The O level is entirely a whole new level. As a NT student most likely you only know 5% of what an express student know. Impossible to catch up one, unless you are super smart (or ah beng suddenly turn over a green leaf to be a good boy type).</p>

              I agree with Lokey,
              
              Previously, I have same mindset, going for NA before heading to take O level......
              
              ITE has wide range of course to choose from.  Take this as a preparatory course before you proceed to poly route.

              <p>4NT --&gt; 4NA (school)</p>
              <p>If you do well for your 4NT exam, there may be a chance for you to be promoted to 4NA, and subsequently 5NA. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>
              <p>The location of the private school should never be one of your main deciding factor. The main deciding factor would be the financial cost. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> </p>
              <p>If you're taking private, you can try taking 4NA next year, followed by GCE O level the year after. This would be more comfortable pace of learning.</p>
              <p>Not too sure about private school in the East, but I recommend Smart Lab Private Education. Do a google search. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>@<a style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 17px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/160052">syncopation_music</a></p>
              <p>Thank,but i think i am not ready to take `O`level as i have something better else to do in my young days,i rather choose this "`N`T level-`N`A level - `O`level " because i doesn't want to say all day at home just to learn/revised,since that i think that it will make me into a nerd :D</p>

              <p>As i have mention in the first post. I doesn't want to go to ITE simply because i doesn't want to go the long way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok,My mind is decided!!<br>Normal Technical - Normal Academic - O level</p>
              <p>Thank all for your contribution!!</p>
