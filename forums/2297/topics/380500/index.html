              <p>A maths is WAY BETTER than POA.</p>
              <p>Depending on ur interest, if you wanna go for the engineering field, take Phys, if you prefer life sciences take bio.</p>
              <p>Geog and Hist are both alot of memorising but geog requires some understanding to apply the concepts. If you cannot handle evne sec 2 geog, i will seriously advice u not to do upper sec geog.</p>

              <p>Do take amaths.</p>
              <p>It's important for JC and Polytechnic courses.</p>
              <p>Take history + ss.</p>
              <p>There is less content to study, and at least history is a relatively fun and interesting subject to read about.</p>
              <p>Unless you are interested in life sciences, don't bother taking biology.</p>
              <p>Going to medicine course only requires chemistry and one other pure science at H2 level. Thus biology is not important for medicine course. Biology is also the most content-heavy science and is usually offered as the 3rd science in other schools, therefore the bell curve is pretty hard for biology too.</p>

              <p>can you cope with the rigour of physics? if you can, best is to take physics for O levels. since A levels biology does not require a background in O level biology.</p>
              <p>keep your choices open.</p>
              <p>I would recommend you take english, chinese, A math, Physics, chemistry, History and SS, since from wad i see, your geog abit can't make it.</p>

              <p>A maths requires alot of practice. if you are willing to spend enough time practicing, A maths is actually not that hard to master. The reason most people including myself advice you to take A maths is that its very important for your future education journey regardless whether or not its easier. Alot of O's students regret not doing A maths only after their O's and they discover they cannot get the subjects they want in JC etc.</p>
              <p>If ur maths is good, physics shouldn't be too hard. Bio is almost pure memory work so unless you love memorising stuff, bio is not a good choice.</p>

              <p>A level H2 biology DOES require a background in O level biology, unless you're talking about H1 biology. And for all those who think that bio is pure memory work, it is NOT. It requires deep thinking too. That's why there are people who can't cope with bio even though they memorise lots of stuff.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it's not fair at all to compare physics with biology - it's like comparing apples and oranges. Both subjects are so different! For all those who advise others to take up physics because "biology is not important for admission to medicine" [in fact the word should be "required"], it must be mentioned that you do stand a higher chance of getting in if you have taken biology at A level.</p>

              <p>You don't really stand much of a higher chance since medicine is mostly chemistry and i've heard of ppl getting in without biology from A's. Its more important how you fare in the interviews etc and not what you have taken except the required chemistry. Once you have gotten all As, with or without biology, it boils down to how well you can impress the interview panel.</p>
              <p>Of all the 3 sciences, bio is still the most memory intensive.</p>

              <p>You don't really stand much of a higher chance since medicine is mostly chemistry and i've heard of ppl getting in without biology from A's. Its more important how you fare in the interviews etc and not what you have taken except the required chemistry. Once you have gotten all As, with or without biology, it boils down to how well you can impress the interview panel.</p>
              <p>Of all the 3 sciences, bio is still the most memory intensive.</p>

              <p><br>well it does sound fair if you put it that way :) i do agree with what you said, that it doesn't really matter what you took, besides the all-important chemistry. What i really think, though, is that we shouldn't be giving the impression that biology is not important, or that all it requires is purely memory work.</p>

              <p>Hi MissyK,</p>
              <p>I will strongly advise that you take Physics along with A. Maths.</p>
              <p>Physics will be a great help if you decided to enter the engineering field in the future, whereas Biology is not really a must for any degree courses in local universities.</p>
              <p>Although some people may find that POA is easier when compared to A. Maths, A. Maths will be more beneficial to you, especially if you choose to take up H2 Maths in JC/CI.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>There is no subject that is exactly easy and assures an A1 without putting in any effort. Everyone have their strengths and weakness, not everyone will be good at physics neither is everyone going to be good at biology.</p>
              <p>Lower sec science have already expose to you some basic subjects in physics and biology such as electricity etc for physics and transportation in plants etc for bio. U should have a good idea what their contents might be like and make ur own decision.</p>

              <p>That will depend on yourself. </p>
              <p>Physics is tilted towards understanding + calculation, Bio is tilted towards Understanding + Memory Work.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself whether you are better at memory work or calculation. </p>

              <p>A maths requires alot of practice. if you are willing to spend
              enough time practicing, A maths is actually not that hard to
              master. The reason most people including myself advice you to take
              A maths is that its very important for your future education
              journey regardless whether or not its easier. Alot of O's students
              regret not doing A maths only after their O's and they discover
              they cannot get the subjects they want in JC etc.</p>
              <p>If ur maths is good, physics shouldn't be too hard. Bio is
              almost pure memory work so unless you love memorising stuff, bio is
              not a good choice.</p>

              <p>When u go to higher level physics it gets more and more mathematical and you can be prepared to score 10-15 for a uni level physics paper if you don't have your calculator cos the theory part is minimum but almost entirely calculations.</p>

              <p>Comparing someone good in maths and someone poor in maths, which
              will do better in physics and have less problems coping?</p>
              <p>Yes physics has the theory component but if u cannot even handle
              the maths part of it, u can't do well even if you are good in the
              theory.</p>
              <p>When u go to higher level physics it gets more and more
              mathematical and you can be prepared to score 10-15 for a uni level
              physics paper if you don't have your calculator cos the theory part
              is minimum but almost entirely calculations.</p>

              <p>A better combination would be Biology + Chemistry.</p>
              <p>Additional Math is also better as it opens you to the world of
              Calculus. Would be more useful to you when you go into JC, or
              Poly.</p>

              <p>Chem and bio is a very limiting combination so its not really adviced unless anyone is already sure they want to work in the chem or life science industry.</p>
              <p>Without physics, anyone would have problems understanding and going on to do engineering courses which covers a decently large proportion of the available courses in poly/uni.</p>
