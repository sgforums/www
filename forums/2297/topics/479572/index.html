              <p>1) You can take a look at my coursework back in 2008 for an example.<br>    <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/ai6vrwch6y7csd5/sgForums_FNN_Sample.pdf"> <strong>Download F&amp;N Coursework here</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>     * Your subject code is 6087 right? Meaning only one coursework? Last time we have Part A and B</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is the question for this year's coursework? Maybe you can post it here?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I do not mind you copying, but beware of plagarism checks in case your teacher have a copy of my work(cos i posted it online)</p>
              <p>3) If you plan to follow my style, check with your teacher if it is acceptable and how to improve it so that you get more marks. Your teacher is the one giving you the grade, not me, so must check if he/she happy with what you are doing.</p>
              <p>4) Also compare with the marking scheme on seab website:<br>http://seab.gov.sg/oLevel/2014Syllabus/6087_2014.pdf</p>
              <p>5) Don't slack off, after O levels got a lot time to play. You will never regret getting a good O level result, it is a stepping stone to alot of place</p>
              <p>6) English portrayed in my coursework may contain lots of grammatical errors and unconventional sentence structures. Because at 16 years old my english can't quite make it yet</p>

              <p>Majority of the key factors are highlighted in red. <br>Prepare meals: from how u cut the ingredients to cooking<br><br>Cutting of ingredients - How many methods are there? Dicing, artistic carvings, slanted slicings etc etc<br><br>VAriety - What is the defiinition of variety? Many? A lot? More than 3? etc<br><br>Cooking of ingredients - How many methods are there? Double boiling, boiling, stirfry, microwave, baking, stew, dip in egg then fry, steam already then fry, etc etc. <br><br>Varied and interesting results - What are the outcomes when u used the above result? Eg. if u bbq something, the outside will char a little. If you bake a cake, the outside becomes brown because of the sugar? <br>Making it interesting and lots of variety: Steaming + Deep fry + stir fry + bbq + double boiling + etc etc will give many different <span style="color: #ff0000;">texture</span>. <br><br>Nutritious: Means what? many vitamin, got enough fats, water etc</p>
              <p>Sweet: Include sugar in your recipe? But not too much cos bad for health(use the health promotion board table)<br>Savoury:How to make it savoury? Look colourful, smell nice?</p>
              <p>Buffet: Means during the exam u must cook alot? Or only one serving? Must check with your teacher. <br>Usually what dish is served at buffet? Maybe you can take some buffet menu and include in your research, from there choose what u want to cook.</p>
              <p>Priorities for task questions. What is the priorities apart from completing coursework on time, research on key factors, identify research areas. It is to appeal to the teenage audience? Demonstrate many cooking methods?</p>
              <p>Show clear understanding. Means you need to let them know u what they want. They say prepare meals using varied cooking methods, means u cannot just use 1 cooking method. Varied and interesting results means u must make it interesting, cannot just cook maggi noodle put there</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Research</span></p>
              <p>Marking schemes says u need to be:<br>1. very thorough when u research the factor u identified, <br>2. must use many sources, can summarise info, <br>3. interact effectively with relevant information gathered(Maybe they mean u need to compare and contrast, or u can combine two information together to get better result?<br>4. show that what u research is relavent to task question. Means what ever you researched, u must have a way to link it back to the question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Identify all the methods and then research. Eg. carving of food while preparing meals. How it is done.<br>What is boiling, how is boiling done, what result will it yield. <br>WHat is frying, how it it done, what result will it yield, what is pro and cons, will it cause the teenage audience to feel boring? How to improve so that this methods will help you achieve what the question wants.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your help. I got past through my priorities list, but
                  know i don't really know what recipes to choose for my decision

              <p>By right the recipes you chose for your decision making is depended on your research etc etc etc.</p>
              <p>But from the task question, they hint u to choose dishes that can demonstrate a variety of cooking methods. <br><br>The easiest way to do will be cooking a few dish, each with different cooking method, or one of the dish can be prepared by a combination of cooking methods. <br><br>At the same time, all these dish must be nutritious, sweet, savoury, etc to serve at buffet for teenagers.<br><br>When i go eat buffet, i prefer to see dish like <span style="color: #ff0000;">pineapple fried rice</span> instead of normal fried rice. Cos adding pineapple will make it more <span style="color: #ff0000;">colourful</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sweet</span>, pineapple is also <span style="color: #ff0000;">nutritious</span>(your research can add in what nutrients pineapple have). Pine apple fried rice uses the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cooking method of stirfry</span><br><br>Sometimes i also see dish like <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamed sweet and sour fish</span>. Steam is another cooking methods. Sweet and sour will make the dish sweet. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sour helps to make it more appetising</span>, thus making it more <span style="color: #ff0000;">savoury</span>. You can also add in garnish like diced chilli.</p>
              <p>Black pepper chicken. You can buy chicken fillet from NTUC, slice the chicken, coat with flour and egg then <span style="color: #ff0000;">fry </span>it. After frying the chicken, you can <span style="color: #ff0000;">stirfry </span>the chicken in black pepper sauce. This is a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> combination of 2 cooking methods</span>.</p>
              <p>Soup/Stew. Maybe you can cook a stew or soup. Maybe cook the pasar malam fake shark fin soup? This dish can add in many ingredients like minced chicken meat, crab meat, etc. THen add in corn starch to make the texture stickier. And this dish makes use of the method boiling</p>
              <p>Buffet always got dessert. Dessert is mostly <span style="color: #ff0000;">sweet</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">colourful</span>. Maybe you can bake a mini marble cake, or do the colour ful agar agar jelly. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Remember to make it nutritious, maybe add in raisins or cut fruits etc</span>. Must always justify that your recipe is meeting the requirements of the question</p>
              <p>Buffet also got drinks. Maybe you can make your own fruit punch, or orange juice. You can make it more interesting by<span style="color: #ff0000;"> buying a sparkling grape juice, then adding it into your apple juice or orange juice</span>. Then say the texture of the carbonated drink helps to appeal to teenage people. Adding apple juice will also make it nutritious.</p>
