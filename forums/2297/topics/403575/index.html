              <p class="MsoNormal">Hi I sat for the 2009 A Level and obtained the results
                      below:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H2 Chinese Language and Literature: A</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H2 Mathematics: C</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H2 Economics: D</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H1 General Paper: D</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H1 China
                      Study in Chinese: S</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H1 Project Work: B</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">H1 Mother Tongue (O level HCL): A</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="Default">I applied for NTU Chinese (grade profile for 10<sup>th</sup> percentile:
                      CCC/C, with reference to <strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">AY2009-10 Grade Profiles)</span></strong> under discretionary admission (MOE language elective scholarship, awards from
                      writing competitions, published works on newspapers/school publications etc)
                      and was rejected. I appealed and was rejected again.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">Initially I thought I would be accepted, I thought my score is
                      rather close, if not reached their cut off suggested by the grade profile. And
                      that I have been doing consistently well for Chinese throughout my academic
                      route from Primary to JC level, I also have published works, awards, LEP
                      scholarship to back me up. In addition NTU says that admission to courses like
                      Chinese are on “selective basis”, which I presume all those non-academic
                      factors would help.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">But unfortunately the “selective basis” was just to add up all
                      the points of all the subjects of applicants and make a cut once the vacancies
                      are full. I know of people who didn’t take Chinese lit, people who took 3 years
                      of engineering in poly, people who do not like Chinese and can’t even write
                      well but can’t get into other courses except Chinese….etc, got accepted by NTU Chinese.
                      While I have genuine ability and interest but was rejected.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">It’s alright if NTU Chinese wishes to become a dumping ground,
                      but I truly want to enter and study Chinese because I do not know what else I
                      could do except Chinese.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">I was not accepted probably because my H1 China studies (S)
                      pulled my overall score down. NTU says this with regards to entry requirements “At
                      least two passes in subjects at H2 level and attempted General Paper (GP) or
                      Knowledge &amp; Inquiry (KI) in the same sitting” So I wonder if it’s possible
                      to retake my H1 China Studies in 2011? And use that score to replace my S. If
                      successful I will still be able to matriculate in 2012, I am in army right now
                      ORD in Jan 2012. But then I am afraid that by 2012 the competition would be
                      much tougher even if a H1 A I will still not be able to enter base on overall
                      points.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">So I came out with some options:</p>
              <p class="Default">1) Retake H1 China Studies in 2011 (if combination of cert of H1 subject is really     allowed in NTU)</p>
              <p class="Default">2) Retake the whole A level in 2011</p>
              <p class="Default">3) Study Chinese in SIM</p>
              <p class="Default">4) Study Chinese in Ngee Ann Poly</p>
              <p class="Default">5) Study Chinese overseas.</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">Anyway good luck for those who didn't want/like Chinese but went in just to chope a place, and good luck to NTU Chinese department</p>
              <p class="Default"> </p>
              <p class="Default">Advice please.</p>
              <p class="Default"><span> </span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't think retaking is a good option. Perhaps what you can do is to reapply next year, while at the same time you can apply to study chinese overseas e.g. China. In this case, the cert you graduate with would be better than the ones from SIM or Ngee Ann Poly and I suppose the school fees would not be very ex since it's China... I remember reading in the news that this girl went to China to pursue law or sth like that and her annual school fees is around 4000 plus SGD (not sure if i remembered wrongly). All the best!</p></div>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Since you are very interested in doing Chinese Language at university, one way to get around it is to sign up as a Chinese Language teacher with MOE and with the support of MOE, your chances will be much higher in getting into the Bachelor of Arts under NIE in NTU.</p>
              <p>Also, you get a monthly allowance of $950 for 3 years and MOE also pays all your school fees at NTU. The drawback is that you will be bonded for 3 years with MOE.</p>
