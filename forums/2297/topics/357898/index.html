              <p>We did well, at least in my opinion. I didn't think it was actually possible to ace the exams...and I owe it all to the pressure I faced and my desire to out-pace my "bastard" friend who was constantly beating me.</p>

              <p><br>JC are highly paperwork-based, hence I can't say that you will have an exciting life listening to boring lectures and being handed pile after pile of notes and tutorials.</p>
              <p>What you should do is to focus on the long term, working hard for whatever future career that you will want to have. With positive aims, you will find life in JC less stressful.</p>
              <p>If you feel that you are falling behind in the class, don't just give up and hide in one corner or in your own 'little world'. Instead, ask to form study groups with others and work together with them. Don't be embarass to bombard your study-mates with questions, for it will actually also help them out too to respond to study-related questions. If you feel really guilty or bad asking them for help all the time, you can always 'treat' them now and then.</p>
              <p>Since you are already in JC now, there is no point in dropping out so easily. You might as well wait till you get your promotional results and see how you fare before you decide to jump over to poly or not.</p>

              <p>Exams are mostly on questions that you already done before in tutorials and as long as you do your work consciently, you will score 80% easily for your exams. Not to mention A levels exams will be much easier than the exams you are having in your school. Only applicable for science subjects though...</p>

              <p><br>Like someone has said, it's a vicious cycle. For as long as you stay negative, it's unlikely that you'll work hard enough in your tutorials and for your exams. The results will definitely sucks, thus demotivating you further.</p>
              <p>But for as long as you refuse to give up on all the challenges you face, I can assure you things can only get easier. You may think your classmates, or even schoolmates, are mostly more clever than you. But put more efforts into your studies and you may just prove yourself wrong.</p>
              <p>I was from JC too, now serving NS.</p>
              <p>For my mid-year exam in J1, I got U for all my H2 subjects. My percentile (ranking in the school) was barely above 30%. It's not like I'm a playful person who can't be bothered to study. I wanted to do well too, but the lectures are boring and makes me sleep, and I don't understand a thing of what my tutors are saying in classes.</p>
              <p>I worked slightly harder but still, only just barely managed not to get retained in J1. I thought of dropping out of JC but eventually didn't.</p>
              <p>And so I refuse to give in, refuse to give up, and decided to put in my all into my studies. Still, by the block-test in April, I improved little.</p>
              <p>The June holidays came and everything became different. I now had plenty upon plenty of time to study by myself without needing to attend boring lectures and tutorials. I dig out all my lecture notes and studied every single chapter all over again by myself. To me, that works much better than trying to listern to lectures or tutors.</p>
              <p>Painstakingly, I made my own notes and made sure I understand the answer to most of the question in the TYS, doing those particularly difficult questions two to three times.</p>
              <p>Miracle happened, and somehow, from being among the lousiest in my college, I shot up to be the 6th in position of my school and was among the most improved student in the mid-year exams.</p>
              <p>I was so happy, and proud of my achievement that...I somewhat slacken and dropped halfway down during the prelims (on hindsight, the prelim papers set by our school was much tougher than the a'level papers, so I was overly paranoid). Though by that time, I was very kan chiong already and almost literally studied for 14 hours per day for that one month plus until A'levels.</p>
              <p>In the end, I got a very satisfactory results for my A'level, even to my own pleasant surprises. That is coming from someone who has got 3 Us for his first major exam.</p>
              <p>Morale of this long story? You give up, you die.</p>

              <p>JC were some awesome fun times :) come on, you are only in J1, don't be so stressed - there's plenty of times ahead in J2 where the stress gets worse especially if you have to study for common tests and go for trainings and stuff at the same time. If you are finding the lessons boring, maybe it signals that it's not really your subjects of interest - and you can avoid that in uni? but ultimately, even if the subjects are interesting, studying them in any academic context always makes it a little boring - that's just something you get used to. So try to make Jc life a little more exciting for yourself - surround yourself with likeminded buddies, chit chat the time away etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And of course it benefits you to be in a good class! I had this genius friend and I dare say if not for her I wouldn't have scored what I did for the As. She widened my perspectives...I'm always thankful to her for that.</p>

              <p><br>Are you from neighborhood school?</p>
              <p>I am your senior. CG 24/99.</p>
              <p>TJC standard is high. The Teachers teach a lot more things, outside of A level syllabus. If you cannot catch up, I would suggest to you to transfer to TPJC. Then you would have an easier life.</p>
              <p>If you cannot take the stress, I would suggest you go to poly or other JC. My brother also did pretty well in his A level in TPJC.</p>
              <p>You dont really need to fight with smart crowd to get into local Uni.</p>
