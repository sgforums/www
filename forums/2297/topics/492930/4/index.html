              <p>This paper is quite challenging, the level of difficulty is
              almost on par with some of the Prelim Schools exam papers.</p>
              <p>I would say Ultimaonline gauge of difficulty would not be
              accurate. Every single year after taking the A level H2 Chem paper,
              he would say the paper is pretty standard. He is a private tutor,
              who is also an Ex-MOE teacher, with a Bachelor Degree in Science.
              Of course, to him , he would find the paper simple.</p>
              <p>But to us, A level students, our maximum knowledge for Chemistry
              is merely just from the lecture notes and lessons from lecturers,
              which only sufficiently prepare us for the papers. But he has more
              than knowledge in chemistry as he pursued a degree in chemistry, of
              course, he has a unfair advantage over this.</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion, the best estimate of how hard or how easy the
              paper is, is we students. The 2016 cohort, who are taking the paper
              to rate what is the difficulty of paper, by comparing with out
              peers in our JC. Ultimately, we are competing with the cohort in
              the different JC and not a tuition teacher.</p>
              <p>The benchmark of the A grade should not be determined by Pte
              tuition teachers, (I'm fine with school teacher, they know how
              their students fare in A levels). As he himself is doing the paper
              as a pte candidate, then he would find it easy, like a stroll in a
              park, and he will set the same benchmark every year.</p>
              <p>Of course, you could ask him questions about the paper , as it
              serves as a platform for learning, but never ask him about the A
              grade of the paper, he would not know? These are moderations made
              by the examiners, performance of entire JC cohort (30000 students),
              just merely few students of him is highly inaccurate...</p>

              <p>By the way, you just put the words right out of my mouth. You can tell me that the 'A' rate dangles around 70%, give and take 1-3%, but you can't give me a definite value. Unless Cambridge releases an official statement in any form, or there are insiders revealing any of these sensitive information, I doubt we would actually know. We can estimate ten marks gone for a paper but instead lose fifteen due to careless mistakes. We can estimate fifteen marks gone but end up only losing ten marks due to over-estimation. Students can report back to their tutors that they scored around 74% but didn't get an A when they prolly did slightly worse due to miscalculations. It's just as simple as that. I do feel a little (...) when I see statements like that right after a paper: "The A rate is now around 75% because the paper was of a rather decent standard, and this is solely based on paper two alone" and right after paper three, "the A rate has officially risen up to 77% because of the easy standard of paper three!" It just doesn't seem right or accurate at all. I would still choose to think that if you manage to score a 70 and the paper was of a decent/average standard, you still stand your chance of scoring an A. As simple as that.</p>

              <p>I was proposing that the fatty acids are being bonded by hydrogen bonding which is stronger. Triester has more electrons and technically has stronger dispersion forces which outweighs the hydrogen bonding. But it is spherical and compact, hence steric hindrance and reduced surface for dispersion forces to act on. The dispersion forces on Triester is weaker (this dispersion force outweighs h bonding on triester because of steric hindrance) and thus lower melting point?</p>

              <p>Since the question asked you to quote data from data booklet, you should have just copied wholesale and wrote down the e value since they only wanted you to test feasibility of the reaction, but not write down the reaction occuring (there is no reaction anyway) If this was an electrochem cell and they asked you write down the half equations of the reactions occuring at anode and cathode, then yes you use irreversible arrows.</p>
              <p>though i think they wouldn't penalise you if they are lenient on this </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">no2+so2arrow no+so3 should be worth 1 mark and the regeneration another mark. writing that it is a homogeneous catalyst probably gives you the last mark and explaining</span></p>

              <p>This is bio-</p>
              <p>A tri-ester is simply the compound formed after an esterification reaction between glycerol and fatty acids. </p>
              <p>Then the question asked you: Why triester melting point lower than the fatty acid monomer?</p>
              <p>First assumption you made is that the double bonds are cis. Do you know that they can be trans double bond and trans double bond can give MORE effective packing and therefore higher melting point? - so this is already a huge assumption you made</p>
              <p>Indeed, while triester may be larger in terms of having more electrons/dispersion forces, but using this explanation does not answer the question because that should mean triester will have higher melting point! </p>
              <p>But for you,  your major assumption was that the double bonds was cis. And in fact the part about the packing and cis double bond forming kinks is not under chemistry syllabus</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, Thefire521, for your willingness to help out with all the other students' queries. You're a private tutor or school teacher, not a JC student, correct? You said <i>"haha no i setted the paper was just interested in the discussions of students sitting for my little test hahaha"</i>.<p>As to the concerns raised by alliance88 and houdini_00, I never claimed to be (in fact, I can assure you I'm *not*) speaking on behalf of Cambridge or MOE-SEAB regarding official grade boundaries. Afterall, the bell-curve is subject to the performance of the entire Singapore JC cohort, which I've no way of knowing. I'm only giving my opinion (for whatever it's worth) based on the relative difficulty of the paper, without considering the performance of the entire Singapore JC cohort.</p><p>I simply assumed (mistakenly, perhaps) it would be understood by everyone reading this thread, that I was just giving my own opinion, whatever it's worth, (similarly to how Bilahari Kausikan is not, and never claimed to be, speaking on behalf of the PAP government whenever he writes an opinion article) on how the A grade boundary might be swayed by the difficulty of the Paper, just as how many other private tutors and JC teachers would also give their own opinion on this matter, after each paper.</p><p></p><p>You're (not just alliance88 and houdini_00, but everyone else as well who feels likewise) welcome to ignore my future opinion posts on possible shifts on the A grade boundary, eg. after the upcoming P3 and P1, if you feel they're not useful or worse, discouraging.</p></div>
