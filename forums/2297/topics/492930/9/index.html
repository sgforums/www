              <p>Hi for why alkanes are inert, if i gave 2 reasons which are
                  1.the c-h bond is stronf thus lots of energy needed and 2. I said
                  that electronegativity between carbon and hydrogen is similiar so
                  carbon will not acquire a partial positive charge will this get 2
                  marks? (On a side note one of my classmataes stated that carbon is
                  unable to expand its octet structure in alkanes ao it is
                  unreactive..will that get the mark?it sounds unusual though)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the bond energy qn, if i drew my diagram correctly but i
                  forgot to times 2 the bond formation of brf3, how many marks are
                  lost?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for drawing fo electrochem cell, i didnt state that it needs
                  to be under 298k and 1atm, but i did label 1 mol/dm^3 of ions so
                  how many marks are lost for this qn?</p>

              <p>Hi. Saying alkanes are inert because c-h bond is strong is not a valid reason. Alkenes, for example have c=c bonds which are even stronger (in terms of bond energy), but they are more reactive. </p>
              <p>I would more or less think there are many many ways to justify, whether is it by polarity or the fact that they have no lone pair of electrons available for donation (so rarely becomes nucleophile nor electron deficient to become electrophile...) </p>
              <p>If you say carbon cannot expand octet, i would think they might give it to you but to think of it the same reasoning-that alkenes are also made up of carbons which cannot expand their octet, so this reason isnt very important.. (i believe students probably give this answer alot when asked why ccl4 cannot hydrolyse in water, but should not for this question)</p>
              <p>If you did not label full set of standard conditions, then that should be 1 mark gone.</p>

              <p>QN5 is a 7 mark question so marks are awarded for each correct answer. Should be no ECF for deduction</p>
              <p>since they asked you to name the mechanism alr, they prob wont give any more marks to naming the mechanism again in the next part...</p>

              <p>Damn it about the alkanes question hahaha. Couldn't really think of any other reasons, my 2nd was just to explain lack of lone pair of electrons/electron deficient atom/lack of partial positive or negative charge due to non-polarity and close electronegativity of C-H bonds. Initially split up the partial positive/negative charge as my first reason but changed it because I felt it was similar (lack of reactive sites). Hmm if those are separate points I wonder if they'll be lenient? LOL.</p>
              <p>I finished Q3 fast simply because I have fun doing structure elucidation (reason I chose Q5 over Q1, although I regretted it in the end). I'm weird, I know.</p>
              <p>@Fire, I feel that strength would be a valid reason as the high BDE makes any reactions energetically unfavoured thus alkanes are unreactive. Your argument about C=C bonds doesn't seem to hold well since e.g. for halohydrogenation, 1 C-Cl, C-H and 1 C-C bonds are added when removing 1 C=C bond and enthalpy change is exothermic. For alkanes, 1 C-H bond is broken to form 1 C-Cl bond and the tradeoff is endothermic. Hence alkenes are more likely to react in terms of energetics. Perhaps it would be a clearer answer to state that "C-H and C-C bonds are strong, making reactions energetically unfavourable thus alkanes are unreactive" rather than just mentioning strength.</p>

              1 mark out of 2 marks.<p>Overall (combining all papers), you need approx 75% (depending on difficulty of papers, we haven't seen P1 yet, and performance of Singapore cohort, which we won't know) to get A for H2 Chem.</p><p>65/80 is 81.25%, but that's just P3. As long as your overall is &gt; 75% your A grade is safe. Between 70 to 75%, it's either a A or B, depending on the bell-curve for this year.</p>

              <p>^ Yeah that question was weird. Didn't know which they were
              referring to. I just explained ease of hydrolysis of the compounds
              then explained that reacting with NaOH will be more reactive since
              OH- is a better nucleophile than water.</p>
              <p>And omg. how to study for paper 1. LOL sucks to have a geog
              paper in the morning. </p>

              <p>Since it was 4 marks, i think there should be sufficiently enough to talk about the 3 things. And it wouldn't hurt either elaborating on NaOH </p>
              <p>though i highly doubt paper 1 will be hard.. they know that it has the biggest time constraint in 40 minutes, which is why next year's syllabus is changed to 1 hour with the same number of questions. </p>
              <p>They recognise the time constraint and therefore will try their best to make it as straightforward as possible</p>

              <p>I would say Carbon Dioxide should be gassed in as well. The hydrogen ions should be in H+ 1 moldm form. </p>
              <p>No it is homogeneous catalysis. </p>

              <p>Sorry but for Q4, why would there be hydrogen gas? Also would I be marked wrong if I wrote methane as a liquid? Completely slipped my mind that methane is a gas zz</p>

              <p>Yes haha if you look at the beginning of the question, they did tell you methane's boiling point. So at standard conditions of electrochem cell 298k, it is going to be a gas. </p>
              <p>This is the tricky part about the paper expecting you to synthesize info.</p>
