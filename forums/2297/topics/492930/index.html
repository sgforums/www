              Updated after Paper 1 :<p>     kyungsoostan and Sir3,</p><p>A grade boundary for this year will most likely be approximately 75% (overall, combining all papers including SPA), depending on the entire cohort's performance.</p><p>However, note that your own (ie. all students') estimation of your marks may be inaccurate (eg. you don't actually know your SPA marks, you may have made careless mistakes you didn't realize, Cambridge's required answer may be different from your school's taught answer, etc).</p><p>Notwithstanding, assuming your estimation is accurate, then kyungsoostan's 77% is a safe A grade, and Sir3's 73.5% is a possible A grade. As long as you get &gt; 70%, it's always *possible* to get an A grade (just that your chances increase dramatically at 75%), because the cohort's performance also has to be taken into account.

                                      <p>Guys I'm really trembling in fear... First i screw up paper2
                      (actually all my friends said it was hard) so i think i score
                      around low B for that paper itself. Than for Paper 3, it was so
                      easy! , but fml yeah i screw it up and my whole organic part was
                      blank and i mixed up my R&amp;C and haix. So my paper 3 was about
                      low B too. yeah although i screw up, low B was quite possible. So
                      based off p2 and p3 i got around 60-64%. Today's paper 2, i scored
                      27/40. First page all wrong idk what was i even thinking if not
                      couldve 31 sia. but yeah its over. With those 3 papers i think i
                      should be around 65 % AT MOST. Lets say spa affects my grades a
                      little, will i drop to a D? I really do not want a H2 D... Haix. my
                      uni course is AAB sia but i might end up with AAD if my chem really
                      xiao suay.</p>

                      Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. From your description, your most likely grade is a C, with a small chance of B or D.<p>Accordingly, be psychologically prepared to choose backup Uni courses with lower UAS requirements, and/or retake A levels as a private candidate (though if you have NS obligations, you've to decide exactly when to retake your A levels).</p><p><a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html">http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/NTU_IGP.pdf">http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/NTU_IGP.pdf</a> </p><p>This may sound harsh, but it isn't meant to demoralize you (of course you would rather hear soothing assurances like "no worries, you'll probably still get your B grade" but that's mere consolation not honest clarification), but rather to remind you, that whatever happens, make the most of it. Use every opportunity in life to grow, including growing in fortitude and resilience. Doing badly for A levels isn't the end, there are always 2nd chances in life, but only if you're willing to give them to yourself.
                  </p><p>__________________________</p><p>Updated the night after P3</p><p>Anyway (not that anyone cares), but in case someone is wondering why I felt Q1 was time-consuming, it's because, while the question didn't actually ask for it (in fact only rather simple questions were asked about it), for the sake of understanding, I took my time to figure out the full mechanisms behind the Monsanto process, which are rather interesting, and the Monsanto process actually has much potential for many more challenging questions to be asked on it. Rather wasted, that Cambridge only asked very simple questions on the Monsanto process.</p><p>Since nobody else did what I did, then Q1 wouldn't be considered time-consuming. In which case since only Q3 is considered time-consuming (everyone agrees), I guess this Paper 3 should be considered a standard paper in terms of difficulty (though I still felt P2 was even easier than P3, prolly coz I love to write too much for open ended P3 qns every year which is consequently time consuming, but apparently I'm the only one, everyone else thinks P2 is tougher than P3), so I'm gonna re-adjust the expected grade boundary back to 75% (again, I stress this is of course an unofficial % expectation, because the performance of the entire Sg cohort also needs to be taken into consideration, and MOE-SEAB will never release the actual A grade boundary for each year).
                              </p><p>
                      Edited to add : in case anyone is looking for full solutions, I won't be providing them here ; many Singapore JCs' Chem departments will be preparing the solutions, as well as several private tutors and tuition centers, who will probably upload their solutions in pdf format on their tuition websites or google drive or scribd, etc. You can look for the solutions online yourself, or ask your school teachers if your school's Chem dept will be providing the full answers.

                              Updated right after P3</p><p>How did you JC students (and tutor/teachers such as TheFire521) find the Paper 3 today? How did your schoolmates find the Paper 3? Which Qn did you not do?</p><p>I estimate it's slightly on the tough side, due to Q1 and Q3 out of the 5 Qns being slightly time consuming.</p><p>Overall, A grade boundary may be approx (updated back to) 75% (based solely on difficulty of Papers 2 + 3, not yet considering performance of Singapore cohort, which I would not know).

                                  Edited after P2 to add : As to the concerns raised by alliance88 and houdini_00, I never claimed to be (in fact, I can assure you I'm *not*) speaking on behalf of Cambridge or MOE-SEAB regarding official grade boundaries. Afterall, the bell-curve is subject to the performance of the entire Singapore JC cohort, which I've no way of knowing. I'm only giving my opinion (for whatever it's worth) based on the relative difficulty of the paper, without considering the performance of the entire Singapore JC cohort.</p><p>I simply assumed (mistakenly, perhaps) it would be understood by everyone reading this thread, that I was just giving my own opinion, whatever it's worth, (similarly to how Bilahari Kausikan is not, and never claimed to be, speaking on behalf of the PAP government whenever he writes an opinion article) on how the A grade boundary might be swayed by the difficulty of the Paper, just as how many other private tutors and JC teachers would also give their own opinion on this matter, after each paper.</p><p></p><p>You're (not just alliance88 and houdini_00, but everyone else as well who feels likewise) welcome to ignore my future opinion posts on possible shifts on the A grade boundary, eg. after the upcoming P3 and P1, if you feel they're not useful or worse, discouraging.</p><p>Edited after feedback from you students on this forum saying many students found today's Paper 2 on the tough side.</p><p>Overall, I'd say this was a rather standard Paper 2 in terms of difficulty.</p><p>Accordingly, as it stands (P2 alone), the A grade boundary will likely remain approximately 75% (as with most previous years).</p><p>Let's wait and see how goes P3 and P1, and adjust our A grade boundary expectations then.</p><p>To all JC2 students reading this : how did you and your schoolmates generally find today's paper? easy or tough?</p><p>Any questions and discussions regarding the Singapore A level 2016 H2 Chemistry Paper 2, 3 and 1, post here in this thread.

              <p>Watt ? easy, for A level standard I think quite challenging ah. Like a mid tier prelim standard I feel. </p>
              <p>So anyone think they got the last part of question 1 right ? the one regarding leaving olive oil forming rancid solution or sth.

              <p>Also quoting data from data booklet to show that K is more reactive than Cu, isit okay to quote the IE values and E values ??? </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the 4 mark rancid question, its like an oxidative cleavage of the alkene in the long fatty acid to give the dicarboxylic acid and the short fatty acid chains. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the 1 mark last part significance question since u calculated no. Of double bond is 2.85, then u will just have to say what is the other component of the olive oil</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for comparing btw reactivitt of k and cu they did say from data booklet or otherwise so i would think either e value of ionisation energy or if u talk about periodic trends nuclear energy increase bla bla bla they shd accept</p>
              <p> </p>

              B grades and below usually remain mostly unchanged (or less deviation) from the standard grade boundaries, compared to A grade boundary.<p>Unless P3 + P1 are surprisingly tough, B grade boundary should remain as just slightly above 60%.</p>

              It's ok, but won't be sufficient to score all 4 marks (most students will only score 2 or 3 of the 4 marks). Just stating the ionization energy *and* redox potential, scores just 1 mark. The explanation (which I won't give here) is worth 3 marks.<p>Ensure the solid is completely dissolved, assisted by manually stirring with a glass rod.</p>

              Unlikely. You can always ask your own school teachers for their opinion on this (since they might have a better idea of your report), but most likely nothing will happen. Don't worry and focus well on preparing for the rest of your upcoming papers.

              <p>for the observation question in planning (2 marks) can i say effervescence and deep blue solid dissolves in excess h2so4 without saying a blue solution is formed?</p>
              <p>For the K more reactive than copper question, I talked about much higher effective nuclear charge in Cu hence 4s1 electron more tightly bound to nucleus blah blah... correct?</p>
              <p>for the draw nucleophillic addition mechanism, in the second step is it the lone pair on O just attack a H+ or is it lone pair attack H in H2O to give the product and OH-?</p>
              <p>and for the NO2 effect on environment can just say photochemical smog and acid rain without talking about polluting river or corroding limestone buildings?</p>
              <p>Also, for slow corrosion of coper i said that a layer of CuO forms that will slow down corrosion, is that correct?</p>
              <p>other than that should be ok, but I skipped 10 marks of planning, is it still possible to get A? :( Thanks</p>
