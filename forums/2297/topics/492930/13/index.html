              <p>Then you should be fine! After all 40/192 for p1 isn't a large percentage especially if you made up for it in p2 and p3, you can always calculate and estimate your own score. </p>

                  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. From your description, your most likely grade is a C, with a small chance of B or D.<p>Accordingly, be psychologically prepared to choose backup Uni courses with lower UAS requirements, and/or retake A levels as a private candidate (though if you have NS obligations, you've to decide exactly when to retake your A levels).</p><p><a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html">http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/NTU_IGP.pdf">http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/IGP/NTU_IGP.pdf</a> </p><p>This may sound harsh, but it isn't meant to demoralize you (of course you would rather hear soothing assurances like "no worries, you'll probably still get your B grade" but that's mere consolation not honest clarification), but rather to remind you, that whatever happens, make the most of it. Use every opportunity in life to grow, including growing in fortitude and resilience. Doing badly for A levels isn't the end, there are always 2nd chances in life, but only if you're willing to give them to yourself.</p>

              <p>i figure people always like to guess but there'll always be anomalies alot of things can go wrong and right lol</p>
              <p>i would believe their grading is like a managed float system whereby the bellcurve exists between 2 stipulated limits (just like our exchange rate), it can fluctuate but not go too high or too low</p>
              <p>though nobody knows the exact way they mark papers (considering they probably vary every year), so i guess just wait for February 27th</p>
              <p>having said that i think next year's a level will be much more exciting and i believe there will be more people screaming and shouting for predictions!!!</p>

              lol assuming you score ok for spa, your overall score is easily around 80-85%, of course you can get A...

                  Unless you're a self-deluded big-talker-only, or your teacher hates your guts and secretly failed your SPA, otherwise assuming your estimation is accurate within 5%, of course you'll get your A grade with your overall score of 80%.

              <p>Actually i'm not from a top jc. In fact, the basis for my concerns lies exactly in the fact that 70 is already considered a shaky grade even in neighbourhood jc.

              <p>@Ultima, thank you very much for your response. I really appreciate it. Undeniably, i would have appreciate it more if your response had been made with kinder words. Given the fierce competition in the Singapore education system, i believe that there is sufficient basis in enquiring on the prospective grades that could be attained with my score, since i believe strongly that there will be a bunch who will be attaining a similiar score.</p>
