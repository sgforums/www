              <p>As for the reactivity question, i think generally the crux lies in the elctrons being more attracted to the nucleus (supported by I.E values), therefore...</p>

              <p>In general for planning (the steps)</p>
              <p>1). Do calculation for approx mass (shoud be arond 4+ grams to measure)</p>
              <p>2). Measure using TARE function or repeat weighing using weighing bottle and transfer into the H2SO4 flask</p>
              <p>3). Swirl, check for end of rxn when ppt dissolve and efferverscence/gas bubble isnt evolved</p>
              <p>4). Calculate dilution factor (should be at least 10 times) and take out abit of the solution and dilute in volumetric flask (100/250) </p>
              <p>5). Pipette 25 cm3 and titrate against NaOH, record for 2 titre value within 0.1, and take average</p>
              <p>6). perform your final calculation to obtain percentage </p>
              <p>Ya, in fact they rather you use pencil than use pen and cancel everywhere lol. And the guy who submitted a page of essay for a 2 mark question will only get raged at inside the examiner's report!</p>
              <p>@arjoe They didnt ask you for how to shorten carbon chain, in fact the rancid olive oil was exposed to air so how can there be KMNO4 present in the air all of us will die. </p>
              <p>I think ultima explained about the mechanism so the equation you can just represent oxidising agent as [O]</p>
              <p>@captainkids No, hydrogen bond is probably what they are looking for in the first place since one has ester linkage, which has no H to form intermolecular H bond, whereas the fatty acids have carboxyl group that can. </p>

              <p>This paper is quite challenging, the level of difficulty is almost on par with some of the Prelim Schools exam papers.</p>
              <p>I would say Ultimaonline gauge of difficulty would not be accurate. Every single year after taking the A level H2 Chem paper, he would say the paper is pretty standard. He is a private tutor, who is also an Ex-MOE teacher, with a Bachelor Degree in Science. Of course, to him , he would find the paper simple.</p>
              <p>But to us, A level students, our maximum knowledge for Chemistry is merely just from the lecture notes and lessons from lecturers, which only sufficiently prepare us for the papers. But he has more than knowledge in chemistry as he pursued a degree in chemistry, of course, he has a unfair advantage over this.</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion, the best estimate of how hard or how easy the paper is, is we students. The 2016 cohort, who are taking the paper to rate what is the difficulty of paper, by comparing with out peers in our JC. Ultimately, we are competing with the cohort in the different JC and not a tuition teacher.</p>
              <p>The benchmark of the A grade should not be determined by Pte tuition teachers, (I'm fine with school teacher, they know how their students fare in A levels). As he himself is doing the paper as a pte candidate, then he would find it easy, like a stroll in a park, and he will set the same benchmark every year.</p>
              <p>Of course, you could ask him questions about the paper , as it serves as a platform for learning, but never ask him about the A grade of the paper, he would not know? These are moderations made by the examiners, performance of entire JC cohort (30000 students), just merely few students of him is highly inaccurate...</p>

              <p>I didn't mention about hydrogen bond. I just mention triester is
              spherical in shape and while the fatty acids aren't so less point

              <p>I wrote the exact same response. Initially I thought hydrogen bonding would work but triester clearly outweighs the acids with the number of electrons in them so dispersion forces, by right, should be stronger. Hence I decided to argue from that point of view instead. Same boat.</p>

              <p>Of course, many are possible, platinum, palladium, nickel..</p>
              <p>i think in this paper there isnt much to discuss about as long as you studied your conventional arguments and applied them nicely you will probably score you full marks... Ultimately though there were more application questions, but they still bordered on the same old concepts (there wasnt anything out of the syllabus or new like coordination number in 2009) - so i guess wait for paper 3 since thats the one you can do better in if paper 2 wasnt a niche or forte!</p>
