              <p>hello. not sure if this has already been asked before,</p>
              <p>but for project work groupings, does anyone know if the grouping is done by your PW tutor or is it by random selection on MOE's part?</p>
              <p>also are there any tips/areas that i should watch out for or to take note of with regards to PW?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Be sure to deliver what your ST (Supervising Tutor) expects for PI (Preliminary Idea), EOM (Evaluation of materials), WR (Written Report), and OP (Oral Presentation). GP essay strategies will help you in WR. Primary data collection (interviews are better than carrying out surveys) is important as a means to substantiate your ideas.</p>
              <p>  Be sure to find out from your ST what attributes and behaviours will allow your team to score AE (Approaching Expectations), ME (Meeting Expectations), and EE (Exceeding Expectations) for the components mentioned above.</p>
              <p>  Talk to your seniors to gain from their experience of PW.</p>
              <p>  Jiayou!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  A common method to go about primary data collection for PW is to carry out a survey. The results of a survey and its in-depth analysis usually appear in the WR and emphasised again in the OP. When students substantiate WRs with their surveys, they tend to present only the results and make weak claims to certain phenomena and conclusions. Here are some useful pointers to increase the value of a survey in enhancing the quality of your WR and OP:</p>
              <p>  1. Highlight the objectives of your survey.</p>
              <p>  2. Highlight the rationale for your choice of questions and type of respondents.</p>
              <p>  3. Highlight key results obtained as well as identify interesting trends.</p>
              <p>  4. Give reasons to explain such trends.</p>
              <p>  5. Say how such trends support the points in your WR.</p>
              <p>  It is useful to lay hands on articles about surveys to study how others write. Here are two examples for your reference:</p>
              <p>  1. Straits Times article "Students find call of gadgets irresistible", dated 24 Feb 2011;</p>
              <p>  2. Fit to Post article "Boss, I am stressed because...", dated 23 Feb 2011.</p>
              <p>  My only complaint on these two articles is the lack of effort in explaining trends.</p>
              <p>  Thanks for reading.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Many students struggle with the WR (Written Report) component finding it challenging when they are unable to analyse issues deeply, come up with novel and implementable ideas and put forward strong reasons to back them. One may pick up pointers about such writing from the Workers' Party Manifesto. Economic Policy, Society, Population and Immigration, Education, Healthcare, Transport, and Labour Policy are good sections to read about for ideas.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>P.S. This is purely an educational message, with no political agenda.</p>

              Hi Wen Shih and Dejomel
              
              Thanks for the information! I am putting loads of effort into it. But i seem to be getting nowhere due to the lack of clear instructions from the PW tutor! If he had given me clear instructions in the first place, i would not be so lost!
              
              My PW Tutor is very vague and not helpful at all. He allocated his students a 12-15 minutes for a one time only consultation. So we can only make 1 submission. We are not allowed to consult again or even clarify about the definition/scope of task requirements. If we do so, he said that he will mark us down. So the pw tutor is just a dead end. :(( I have one question though. Does anyone know whether "symbols i.e. - -&gt; etc" are considered words for word count purposes? Also if you have slightly above 500 words say 520 words, will you be penalised? If yes, what is the penalty? I asked the PW tutor the above question and he said that he can't disclose the definition of word count. Sigh..... Any input is most appreciated. Thanks! PS Are we allowed to speak with our PW HOD? I am afraid that the PW tutor may be offended and later mark me down. A catch 22 position!

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  etc is a word, so it is counted.</p>
              <p>  Implementation of a penalty may vary from tutor to tutor and school to school, so it is important to clarify. Btw, the PW tutor should highlight requirements clearly, such as word count and the structure of any written submissions, since marking is eventually based on criteria (whether it is of the AE 1, 2 marks, ME 3, 4 marks or EE 5, 6 marks level). Perhaps, you could check with friends from other classes of what their tutors have shared with them?</p>
              <p>  If the whole class is not benefitting from the guidance of such a tutor, it is always good to arrest the situation early. Think - who suffers ultimately? Give the feedback properly and there should not be any unpleasant consequences. Provide the HOD only with facts that support the lack of guidance from your tutor, not show emotional outbursts to discredit the person.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              Hi Wen Shih
              
              Thank you for your advice! I have asked around but it seems that the tutors are all singing a different tune so not standardised. I have two friends with the same topic but two different PW tutors. One friend had his topic approved and the other one had her topic rejected. So we are not sure if the criteria is applied consistently across the student population. :((
              
              We may have to organise an uprising/petition but that needs to be considered seriously.
              
              Thank you for all your efforts and suggestions! You are most kind.
              
              By the way, my friend is looking for a Combined Science Tutor. Do you have anyone to refer? Please let me know.
              
              Have a great day!
              Cheers

              <p>Symbols like "--&gt;" or "-" do not count as words, as far as I know. But do be careful as microsoft word WILL count them as ONE word into the total word count.<br><br>Either way- try your level best not to exceed the word limit.</p>
              <p>If the whole of your cohort hits 499 words, and you hit 520 words, it's your own loss of comparative advantage. So don't risk it, play safe. Truly, since it's your PW grade at stake- better be safe than sorry.</p>
              <p>About the issue you have with the tutors and lack of standardization .. chill out.</p>
              <p>Frankly- I know EXACTLY what you mean. Where two people with different tutors choose the same topic- but one ends up getting rejected while the other gets approved of.</p>
              <p>In fact- we had many cases (became the norm, actually) where our tutor approved our "final" draft of our assignment on Day 1. And on Day 2, he rejects it (after approving it the previous day) and tells us to re-do it. May seem a little schizophrenic, but just think about it that perhaps your tutor spotted something new/found a new perspective to your work that he didn't have the previous day. It's to your benefit, either way.</p>
              <p>Headaches, cursing, swearing and "WTF IS MY TUTOR DOING" were very, very common for not just our PI submissions, but for almost every single PW assignment as well. Yet in the end, every single student under my tutor scored a distinction. Try your level best to remain calm- and, as hard as it may be, trust in your tutor.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Most PW tutors are subject teachers, so they may not be very conversant research project facilitation and formalised academic writing. PW tutors are also learning alongside with their charges, so be patient.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              Thanks for your advice! But i think my PW tutor (now referred aptly as "IT")  has a bipolar disorder and will ask you to change something and later when "IT" sees it again, "IT" will ask you why did you change it! "IT" will give you vague comments and you are not allowed to clarify "ITS" comments. It is a total waste of time and energy second guessing what "IT" wants. Anyway, PI is about 5 marks and i doubt that they will be awarding full marks, so at best 3.5 to 4 so if you get 3 it is alright. Not worth spending so much time on a H1 subject. My JC is right next to an MRT Circle Line! Ha ha :D I will take note of your advice and will strive  to remain calm, positive and happy inspite of the "ITDIOT". Wish me loads of LUCK!

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, who assesses the PI,EoM, I&amp;R and WR? Is it external examiners or the own tutor in this case, "IT"? I checked with the SEAB and they said external examiners, teachers from other JCs. Today "IT" threw my classmates PI into the dustbin and said that it was rubbish! Poor guy worked so hard on it. Even if it was not good, "IT" should show more respect for others. "IT" has no manners and brings shame to the teaching profession! Well i believe in KARMA, so what goes around comes around!! :D</div>

              <p>Even though PW is a H1 subject, you should try to aim for the EE criteria. Besides, PW is a good chance for you to get A for a H1, and it must also be counted in your uni score ( out of 90). A for H1 is 10 points, B is 8.75 points, C is 7.5 points, and so on..</p>
              <p>You should also consider consulting other PW teachers for your work as each components are very crucial, especially for WR.. These components are generally assessed by  your school internal PW teachers,  and only a few PW files are randomly selected and checked by external teachers.   Your JC shouldn't be getting moderators from MOE  for OP also.</p>
              <p>EoM, WR are x99999 tougher than PI...be prepared. and although GPP is not counted in the marks, it is still very important as a stepping stone for WR. You must set a direction for your group and plan ahead, don't waste the precious time in group meetings, do what you must for the best outcome..Good luck =)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks qdtimes2! Will take note. Reworked it and it seems alright. Just to clarify, does your own PW Tutor mark the PI,EoM etc or is it other PW Tutors in our school? We are not allowed to ask other PW Tutors :(  How many marks are EoM and I &amp;R? Thanks!!</div>

              <p>being insightful and coherent is the key in doing EoM, WR and I&amp;R in general. and also must meet up to their EE criteria</p>
              <p>EoM - very crucial to find an article that you can find arguable/you can strongly agree with/ useful to your project</p>
              <p>WR - GPP is an important step to this. Ideas must be organised etc. The EE criteria says it all. im not sure if it's compulsory to interview an expert in the area of your project topic, but it can be very useful. it definitely helps to substantiate a lot, and may be helpful to your project also ( my friend got 80% of the ideas from a professor!)</p>
              <p>OP - must be loud and clear, have appropriate hand gestures, no monotone, eye contact etc, all the standard stuffs. Killer part is Q&amp;A. Think of any possible questions the examiners may ask and prepare for it. Think well before you answer. Normally they will ask about the questionable points your group raised in the presentation, or ask about the limitations of your groups' suggested solutions.</p>

              Thank you so much for the tips! I will take note and work on them. I will try to locate an article and start work on my EoM. :D 
              What is your combination? J2 must be stressful. Anyway, take care and all the best for A's! What do you intend to pursue in uni? Cheers
