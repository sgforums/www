              <p>Hey all. I'm having my 'O' level exams this year and honestly, I'm pretty worried about my grade for Literature. My desired grade is about A2 (the same grade for English) but I managed to have only gotten a B4 for MYE, which was enough to galvanize me! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>
              <p>I'd like to know what must I really do to attain a good grade (e.g. A2) for Literature? Besides knowing one's set texts/plays really thorough, what <em>else</em> must I do to score a distinction? I thought I wrote pretty well for MYE but it came out as a B.</p>
              <p>And is it true that being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">individual</span> i.e. having your personal opinion and response towards a text helps score a better grade? A senior told me that because of that, he'd scored an A1 for Literature in '08.</p>

              <p>Having your personal opinion and response is good, but I can tell you it will be a gamble.</p>
              <p>If the marker is not please with the response which you have given, you may get even lower grades than without it.</p>
              <p>Indeed, your senior is right on target, those who has A1/2 are the ones who give their personal opinions and thoughts onto the paper, BUT let me warn you, if you are not fully-prepared to give proper statements which you can back up, and is just writing what straight away comes to your mind, you might end up flunking the paper instead.</p>
              <p>In short, what you will mostly be giving is "standard answer opinion", instead of your REAL own opinion, as it will take a lot of effort to back up what you believe in, and it is highly unrecommended for people who are not able to back up their own points properly.</p>
              <p>Ask your senior to lend/give you his works, and look at how he wrote his opinions, and what opinions he gave for what type of questions. Nevermind what you have in mind when you faces such questions, just give back the same opinions which your senior has given, and you should be able to score well.</p>

              <p>O Level literature is all about memorising quotes from your Shakespeare or Chekhov or Emily Dickinson works and bombarding them to the marker.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For some reason or another, markers always like to see candidates quoting lines here, there and everywhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's the only way you can score an A for O level lit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forget about your personal opinion about the work.  Unless it is really a fresh look or new spin at the characters or settings or theme or ideology, the marker has probably seen it and read about it thousands of times.  So going through that route will likely not help you much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>That is what I strongly advise again, unless you have been contantly able to write outstanding opinions which are on a different level. Personally, I still prefer to stick to 'photocopying' opinions of those who constantly write stuffs which are excellent yet not often seen.</p>
              <p>If one has been getting B4 and suddenly decided to try using his/her own opinions and thoughts, he/she will be taking a gamble here, and if he/she lose, he/she will lose very badly.</p>

              <p>maybe you can ask me .. if u willing to meet and tell me wat problem u encountered</p>
              <p>else you should read your school recommended guide book on that literature topics for O level</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay .now is my opinions on O level literature.Having  your own opinion is good ,but have you realised its more of hard work and making strong impactful arguments to make sense ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>English Literature is still based on English Language , as we all known the native markers are Vultures ,ready to spot mistake of students 5000 Km beyond their shores in the Tropics .</p>
              <p>My advise is you should ask your teacher if you have the "making" in writing your own opinions .In another words ,it means when you write argumentative essay , are you strong enough .If not ,please do not test water on your impending O level English Literature ,can be disasterous</p>

              <p>That is what I strongly advise again, unless you have been
              contantly able to write outstanding opinions which are on a
              different level. Personally, I still prefer to stick to
              'photocopying' opinions of those who constantly write stuffs which
              are excellent yet not often seen.</p>
              <p>If one has been getting B4 and suddenly decided to try using
              his/her own opinions and thoughts, he/she will be taking a gamble
              here, and if he/she lose, he/she will lose very badly.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do agree with you that TS should not test water on the O'levels. However, one has to put in effort to secure an A. Thus, what I would suggest is that TS should really try to jot down some of his own opinions of the text and if really hardworking enough, expose himself to some easy to understand short poems and just jot down his thoughts and feelings and perhaps get his teacher to comment during consultations.</p>
              <p>In this way, he would be able to gain confidence as time goes on and listens to what his teacher has in store for him, so that he knows if he's heading towards the right way. Well at least it worked for me.</p>
              <p>Just a penny of my thoughts. =)</p>

              <p>Now that's the annoying part. As Island Voices (my set text) is a relatively new book in the syllabus (introduced only in 2007), there aren't much notes online so I cannot double-check whether my intepretation is authentic or not.</p>
              <p>In this way, I'm having much difficulty in truly comprehending what the text might imply.</p>

              <p>Island Voices is essentially just a compliation of several short stories written by Singaporean authors. The timeline ranges from 1978 to 2006.</p>
              <p>The stories are taken from works of Catherine Lim ("Paper"), Stella Kon ("The Martyrdom of Helena Rodriguez"), Gopal Baratham ("Sundowner"), Ho Minfong ("Tajong Rhu"), Phillip Jeyaretnam ("Evening Under Frangipani"), Claire Tham ("Lee"), Simon Tay ("A History of Tea"), Ovidia Yu ("A Dream of China"), Tan Mei Ching ("Release"), Patricia Wong ("An Obituary for Fifth Aunt Come Late"), Alfian Sa'at ("Corridor"), Tan Hwee Hwee ("Mid-Autumn"), Zuraidah Ibrahim ("Hamid and the Hand of Fate"), Wena Poon ("The Move") and Sim Wai Chew ("Pastime").</p>
              <p>From what I know, this collection was commissioned by the MOE and was published in 2007. I haven't heard any of the stories except for Catherine Lim's "Paper". The others are pretty much strange and unknown to me.</p>
              <p>I don't think any information can be unearthed regarding these stories due to the time and possibly the lack of promotion of such authors.</p>
