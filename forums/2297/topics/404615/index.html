              <p>Private poly is more costly. it is less recognized as the educational institute need to submit the course details to MOE for verification. And many did not do so taking shortcut.</p>
              <p>Informatics is a good choice to start for IT related.</p>
              <p>And in fact, the private diploma and degree stuff is more for the elites. As they are squeezing the stuff from 3 years to 1 plus. It is not that you study less than other poly. You have to work even harder than the rest for compress work. </p>
              <p>I suggest you take things slow (since you are N level guy). Else you will kill yourself on the road, when you are taking like 12 subjects while others is taking 6 for the same semester. </p>

              <p>You should continue your O Level, at least you have and O Level cert to fall back on should you decide not to continue your private diploma(not to curse you)</p>

              <p>i think those who make it with a private dip are few and far in between. Singapore has a new poly in recent years. There are more than 20,000 of poly grads every year. What's more, we have cheaper but educated foreigners. The labour market has a huge supply of new grads every year and naturally, salaries are depressed.</p>
              <p>Fresh poly grad pay ten years ago is $1500/mth on average. Today, it hasn't changed much.</p>
              <p>Your best bet is to focus on your n, then o levels, enter a JC, then a local uni. Or if not, drop out altogether and start planning a business venture. Many businessmen out there are uneducated but they have a business acumen never taugh in our textbooks.</p>

              <p>I suggest U stay in school and do your O's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have never heard of employers would rather hire a
              private diploma than a local one...in fact...private diploma's pay is lower than the local poly's one...assuming similar grades and field of study...think about it...$100 difference per month is about $1200 a year...excluding bonus....$200 difference is about 2400 per year...</p>
              <p>Local uni wouldnt take private diplomas....poly grads they also must choose liao...private diploma can forget about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are tons of schools around offering private diplomas....Informatics...TMC...etc....End of the day...they are commercial companies looking at profit...not ur education....expensive....and quality of lecturers varies...greatly.From my experience...cannot make it lar...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I feel that the value of a private diploma is not as a basic diploma....its for those already with diplomas....say...Diploma in Business from a poly...to take a 2nd diploma...say...Diploma in IT....since its not cost/time-effective for the learner to go back to poly for the 2nd diploma...</p>

              <p>Different people learn differently....According to U...U screwed up in poly....but that doesnt mean polys are not good....they are just not good for U.There are people who couldnt make it in JC and did very well in poly.</p>
              <p>JCs exist simply to serve the needs of a different learning model as compared to polys...There is no better model...just a matter of which one U subscribe more to.</p>
