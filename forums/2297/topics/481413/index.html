              <p>Hello, I'm new here so I'm sorry if I post this on a wrong forum. I'd like to ask a few questions.</p>
              <p>Firstly, some intro about me.</p>
              <p>I'm an international student in singapore and I'm now a sec 4E student. I still don't know whether to continue my studies here in singapore after o level or not but, if I were to continue, I want to go to JC (and if possible the one which provide boarding or hostel). So, I have done some research and came up with NJC, AJC and CJC. But, they are all a very good JC as their cut off points are 10 and below T_T. Moreove, so far, my grades are not very good. It's just average so if it's o level, I don't think I'll pass with the results I want. I also don't think I'll have bonus points from CCA so it's kinda tough for me to reach the score I'm hoping for</p>
              <p>My first question is</p>
              <p>1. can I take physics in JC if the subject combination I'm taking are:</p>
              <p>-EMath</p>
              <p>-AMath</p>
              <p>-combined science (bio and chem)</p>
              <p>-EL lit</p>
              <p>-Malay</p>
              <p>-Art</p>
              <p>-English</p>
              <p>-combined humanities (geo n SS)</p>
              <p>Actually, I'm taking bio is not because I like it but because the vice principal said that other classes (which offer pure physics and combined one) are full so I had no choice but to take bio T_T so will I have the chance to take physics?</p>
              <p>2. Am I in science or art stream?</p>
              <p>3. The school I'm attending now is ranked between 70-80 according To http://www.tutorchen.com/secondary-school-ranking-2013/ which ranked school based on PSLE intake. So, is it a good school?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>4. After some research in the internet, I found out about bell curve. And it scares me T_T can someone tell me about the bell curve for the subjects I'm taking?</p>
              <p>thank you very much and sorry for my grammar and or spelling mistake.</p>

              1)Many JCs will not allow you to take h2 sciences especially if you did not take physics. However, if you score A1 for your combined science, the JC might allow you to take 1 h2 science but I seriously doubt they will allow h2 physics since you did not take physics...you may take h1 physics though.
              2)Art stream
              4)For El and humans, the bell curve is rather low around 70-75.E maths around 90-92,a maths around 80 and pure sciences I believe it is between 75-80 although it varies year by year.

              <p>Thank you for replying ArJoe :)</p>
              <p>So, if I get A1 for my combined science, I can take H2 chem and H1 physics without appeal to take physics?</p>
              <p>Are those the scores for distinction (A1 n A2) or passing scores?</p>

              You might have to appeal for certain JCS especially the top ones.You may check out the websites of respective JCS for more information. May I know what are your grades for the respective sciences?H2 chem is really a big gap ahead of pure chemistry, but it is possible to cope if you work hard.
              
              The scores are for A1,although for pure sciences it may be 81-84 in certain years depend on the difficulty of the papers.. note that the 75-80 is for pure sciences..for combined science it will be a lot lower because the top students do not take combined science..

              <p>For CA1 (sec4), my chemistry got A2(71) for daily work components but for the common test, I got E8(44) as i didn't really understand about acid base n alkali so I have to study hard for the topics again T_T as for bio, both components are A1 (75.3 n 76 respectively)</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice :D actually, the common test was also about extraction of metals so, I missed out some key points when I answered the questions :'( moreover, there's a change of teacher and when she marks the paper, it's not lenient (just found out that the previous teacher was quite lenient in marking. Lol)</p>

              Whenever you answer a question for chem,physics and bio, ALWAYS look out for the number of marks.It is indicating how many points are required. always check you have the correct number of points to secure the full marks.
              
              Regarding the matter on rating, I am sure you have already purchased your ten year series. Look through your TYS and try them. If you can do a lot of the questions or find them easy and vice versa, then you would roughly find out the standard of o level paper.
              BUT a precaution, do not always presume that the difficulty of the paper will stay the same. There are years where there is a sudden increase in difficulty level, such as last year's A math paper... it was quite tough for the weaker students.

              You will definitely have to purchase the TYS for every single subject and practice diligently to familiarize yourself for the questions that will come out for o level.
