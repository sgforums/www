              <p>What course you want? Diploma? degree? masters?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For starters i suggest you go MDIS for private diploma in business management. (Cost 5k for 2 years according to my friend who is going there) Can pay by installments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you completed O levels you can go polytechnic and study diploma in accounting and finance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you N levels(NT) can go ITE study Service skills retail/office(1year) then go to Accounting OR bank services(2years) in higher NiteC.</p>

              <p>Don't waste money on a private diploma in business management. The knowledge that you will learn in the diploma can be easily replaced by reading a few good managment, marketing, accounting and financial textooks.Anyway, a private diploma in business managment is hardly recognised by the employers.</p>
              <p>Instead, you should use the 5k to start some small business and learn first hand knowledge on doing business or use the 5k to buy shares to learn first hand experience in trading of shares.</p>

              <p>Most business school I guess would teach you all the fundamental concepts except for the analysis of stock market. I think you would have to take another short course on it. Look for a credible school in Singapore to start acquiring your business knowledge, preferably one that come with an internship program which can put you in good stead when you graduate. Alternatively, Unisim being the first private university offer a wide range of business courses which are relatively on par with local university modules except for some slight teaching or methodology differences.</p>
              <p>For business start up, you know you are in for an arduous path ahead. Armed with a brillant idea, you seek to present your business proposal to prospective investors who are keen to inject millions of capital into you.</p>

              <p>I'm going to give a different opinion.</p>
              <p>Give consistant effort to yr studies, no matter how irrelevant it is to yr future dreams. If you have the financial capability to, aim to get into the top tier economics schools overseas</p>
              <p>Start reading up on stocks, bonds, warrants, shares etc. At first this will be very dry and boring but try to find interest in what you read (and don't read for readings sake.)Go and download a few annual reports and take a look at the terms and find out what they mean. Get an understanding of how it works. Start <strong>slow </strong>and don't <strong>burn out</strong>. All these financial terms are <strong>not hard</strong>, just takes time to absorb. Learn how to speak the vocabulary, but don't use big terms without understanding them first.</p>
              <p>If you have cable tv, watch Bloomberg channel and CNBC once in a while and absorb what you can from the shows that you watch.</p>
              <p>When you get into university, go and participate in investing and business competitions. If you can do well this is worth a lot in the eyes of financial businesses. Find like minded individuals who are interested in the same career path as you. And talk constantly about investing and businesses.</p>
              <p>Summary</p>
              <p><br>1) Learn actively and Sustain Interest. Read for the sake of understanding and get a feel of how it is to apply textbook knowledge into the real world. Learn how to speak confidently and give people a sense that you are truly interested in what you do. (Not the kind of person who likes to comment about the stock markets etc but lack substance in what they say. Its very obvious and off-putting.)</p>
              <p>2) Academically you must be at least average. Don't neglect your studies. If you're gunning for schools like London School of Econs, plan out what's needed to get in. If you can get into top flight schools, I think you'd be amazed how many doors are open to you.</p>
              <p>3) Business competitions and investing competitions in University!! They show prospective employers that you have the ability to apply what you learn in school, instead of merely being theory strong and practical weak.</p>
              <p>4) Find people that share your dream and interact with them!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you just want an average career in finance or business, 2+3 are the key ones. I have to warn you that business degrees do not focus on investing enough to get a solid grasp of the stock markets etc. That is why you have to put in effort to learn by yourself.</p>
              <p>If you want a really disgusting salary in the future, 1 and 4 are also very important. Because many people merely focus on the academics and the bare minimum.. so thats what they get when they step into the working world.</p>
