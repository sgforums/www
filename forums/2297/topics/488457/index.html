              <p> Hi , i am currently taking Molecular Biotechnology in a local polytechnic (Year1 Semester 1). But after starting school for 2 weeks , i realise that ive made a huge mistake D: This course is just like studying in JC. Very hard to cope etc... <br>I'm discouraged to go to school as a result and my attendance sucks to date. It is IMPOSSIBLE for me to pass almost all my modules (I suck at Science).<br><br>1) Is there a possibility of transferring course/ to another polytechnic by next semester ? I realise don't want to waste 1 year ...<br><br>2) Besides , once i get withdraw/dismissed by the polytechnic , will the NS force me to enlist ? Or can i wait till next year apply for a new poly course thru DAE ?<br><br>Also .... you can give me some advice on which poly courses to choose next time (I have no interest in any so don't tell me follow my interest ) ???</p>
              <p>Thank you in advance D:</p>

              <p>To score well in Poly, one has to work just as hard as JC students who want to score well, if not more. There's no short cut at all.</p>
              <p>It is probably an "easier" route because a pass in a poly degree is worth more than a pass in A Level. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be brutally honest, when I read this:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>This course is just like studying in JC.</strong> Very hard to cope etc...</p>
              <p>I'm discouraged to go to school as a result and my attendance sucks to date. It is IMPOSSIBLE for me to pass almost all my modules</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't think anyone can recommend you any useful Poly course with that attitude. </p>
              <p>I don't know about your expectations when you sign up for Poly but it sure looks as though you are expecting Poly life to be a bed of roses. I don't believe any courses to be less intensive.</p>
              <p>Lack of interest is different from lack of attitude to work hard at what you want. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly, if you think you suck at science, why choose Molecular Biotechnology in the first place too?</p>

              <p>Hi YctLeong,</p>
              <p>  What you hear has to be verified unless you have gone through the experience personally. Do know that every experience is unique...</p>
              <p>  In present time, Poly has gotten tougher than before and competition among students is intense as they strive to enter university to continue with further education. I make this observation as a current Poly lecturer/tutor coaching both engineering and science students.</p>
              <p>  May you learn insightfully from this experience of a random decision-making and ponder really carefully next time so that you will get where your heart wants you to head towards.</p>
              <p>  Jiayou!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>not sure about CLS, but at EEE/MAE, if I am not wrong, year one the modules are the same across the diplomas. It is at year two then will specialise.</p>
              <p>maybe you can consult your school about it.</p>
              <p>whereas for the comparasion with JC... err... A level and Diploma are equally difficult. for example, what I learn at Engineering Mathematics is somewhat similar to A level H2 mathematics... both are equally difficult, except, there are a few differences. #justsaying</p>
              <p>and... by the way, now already week six. MST/Common-Test coming. but i heard this year because of SEA games NP postpone CT. SP I heard MST starting this friday because monday is vesak day... anyway, just wanna say, pls catch up on your studies.</p>

              <p>The best solution now, is to really work doubly or triply hard to catch up on your studies, since you can't change course nor could you really back off. Take responsibility for your own decisions. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 13.1306657791138px;">To choose a course randomly probably means all courses are of equal interest (or disinterest) for you, so there's isn't really any point to change course. So, best to go on with it for now.</span></p>
              <p>Please, go off forums till after exams. Focus all your energies on catching up. It is not impossible. Miracles happen when people put their minds to it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a good thing you experience it early in life: to find out more about things before making decisions instead of based on hearsay. </p>
              <p>Wishing you best of luck.</p>

              <p>Totally agree with what eagles says about the attitude. If you're going to have that kind of attitude and not manage your expectations (what with you believing your seniors about poly being slack), then there's no way that you're going to have a field day in any other course. </p>
              <p>Talking to your counselors isn't gonna "curry favour" either. It makes sense that the school wants you to do well so you can transfer to another course. I mean, no school wants a failing drop out what. It's not as easy as just changing your name in the register leh. You'd probably have to wait till the next intake so you can join. That means you'll be joining the students who take their O's this year. At least that's what happened to my friend who transferred out to another course. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cons </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">of going to NS before tertiary education</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">:</span></strong></p>
              <p>1) You'll be going on with only O level qualifications. Rank will be given accordingly. You'll be most likely competing with those already with Diplomas/A's/Nitec/Higher Nitec. All of which are higher than you.</p>
              <p>2)  When you go back to school, you will be significantly older than everybody else. For some people this isn't a big problem, but for some, they fill a very big maturity gap that can be very hard to bridge. Will affect your mood for school.</p>
              <p>3) Depending on how long you serve for, you have to apply for the school via a more ma fan method. For poly, not as swee as JAE already. You might have to go for interviews etc etc.</p>
              <p>4) What if you kena reservist during school time? I had a friend who did NS before poly and he was very affected when he had to go reservist. He couldn't pull his weight during group projects and stuff. His group members all damn sian. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><strong>Pros of going to NS before tertiary education:</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1) When you graduate, you don't have to enlist like all your other friends lor. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2) You will probably get your pick for all the xmm</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">///</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I suggest you think about this properly. If transferring doesn't work out, maybe you want to leave school anyway and take some time to look at ALL the courses before applying during the next JAE. Use the time to work and gain experiences. Maybe you'll find something while working which will even trigger you to take a diploma you actually LIKE (E.g If you work retail part time, you might like Retail Management etc) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Maybe you'll even feel a calling for JC. Or you can start looking up private institutions as well if you have the $$$. Make sure you don't just blindly follow friends. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">People can influence you, but they can't make you do it. </p>

              be very hard to bridge. Will affect your mood for school.</p>
              <p>3) Depending on how long you serve for, you have to apply for
              the school via a more ma fan method. For poly, not as swee as JAE
              already. You might have to go for interviews etc etc.</p>
              <p>4) What if you kena reservist during school time? I had a friend
              who did NS before poly and he was very affected when he had to go
              reservist. He couldn't pull his weight during group projects and
              stuff. His group members all damn sian. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><strong>Pros of going
              to NS before tertiary education:</strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1) When you graduate,
              you don't have to enlist like all your other friends lor. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2) You will probably
              get your pick for all the xmm</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">///</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I suggest you think
              about this properly. If transferring doesn't work out, maybe you
              want to leave school anyway and take some time to look at ALL the
              courses before applying during the next JAE. Use the time to work
              and gain experiences. Maybe you'll find something while working
              which will even trigger you to take a diploma you actually LIKE
              (E.g If you work retail part time, you might like Retail Management
              etc) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Maybe you'll even feel
              a calling for JC. Or you can start looking up private institutions
              as well if you have the $$$. Make sure you don't just blindly
              follow friends. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">People can influence
              you, but they can't make you do it. </p>
