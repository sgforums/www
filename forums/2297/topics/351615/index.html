              <p>Hello, Im' doing a <strong>project</strong> on Geography of how <span style="color: #993300;">'<strong> Singaporeans <br>support the use of GM food as a solution to food security</strong> '</span></p>
              <p>In simpler terms, <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Modified(GM) food could be the solution towards the<br>availability and access of food</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Our aim is to collect the views of how people would react to this situation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Would you like your daily food to be like these?</span></p>

              <p><br>That is not necessary GM. That could be through breeding the genes out naturally</p>
              <p>Genetically Modified is when you add the genes of a totally different plant species or animal genes into the plant so that it is more resistant.</p>

              <p>is adding chemical fertilizers 'natural'? how about when humans are the ones controlling the amount of water/light/food/etc the 'food' is getting? Does that still make it 'natural' then?</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The Ecologist spells out the five overriding reasons why the commercialisation of GM crops should never be allowed in the UK [and Mendocino County]</span></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GM WILL REMOVE CONSUMER CHOICE</span></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The UK government's official adviser on GM, the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission (AEBC), has said it would `be difficult and in some places impossible to guarantee' that any British food was GM-free if commercial growing of GM crops went ahead. In North America, farmers can no longer be certain the seed they plant does not contain GM genes.</span></p>

              <p><strong><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Cross pollination<br></span></em></strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>GM genes are often `dominant' - ie, <strong>they are inherited at the expense of non-GM genes when cross-pollination occurs between GM and conventional species</strong>. With the first GM crops considered for commercialisation - oilseed rape and sugar beet and maize - the `gene flow' (ability to contaminate non-GM varieties) is `high' and `medium to high', respectively.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To prevent cross-pollination, the official advice in the UK is that there should be a separation distance of just 50 metres between GM oilseed rape and non-GM varieties. But pollen can travel a lot further than that. Bees, for example, regularly fly for up to 10 kilometres; hence, oilseed rape pollen has been found in hives 4.5 kilometres from the nearest GM crop field. Tree pollen grains have been recorded in the essentially treeless Shetland Isles, which are 250 kilometres from the nearest mainland.

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The common methodology for government food-safety requirements in North America and Europe has traditionally been a comparison between a food and a conventional counterpart. The assumption is that existing foods have a long history of safe use. So, if a GM crop is found to be `the same' as a non-GM counterpart, it can claim this history. This is called `substantial equivalence'. But GM crops are not the same, because of the random nature and uncertain consequences of modification. Biotech firms acknowledge this when it suits them - stating, for example, that their GM varieties are distinctive enough to warrant their own patents.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Genetic modification frequently uses proteins from organisms that have never before been an integral part of the human food chain. Hence, GM food may cause unforeseen allergic reactions - particularly among children. Allergens could be transferred from foods to which people are allergic to foods they think are safe. When a new food is introduced, it takes five to six years before any allergies are recognised.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>In 2000 GM `StarLink' maize was found in taco shells being sold for human consumption in the US - even though the maize had only been approved for animal feed. StarLink is modified to contain a toxin that could be a human allergen; it is heat stable and does not break down in gastric acid - characteristics shared by many allergens.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Genetic modification could also make disease-causing bacteria resistant to antibiotics. This could lead to potentially uncontrollable epidemics. Antibiotic-resistance genes are used as `markers' in GM crops to identify which plant cells have successfully incorporated the desired foreign genes during modification.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>A 2002 study commissioned by the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) showed that antibiotic-resistance marker genes from GM foods can make their way into human gut bacteria after just one meal (see box below). Two years previously, the British Medical Association had warned: `The risk to human health from antibiotic resistance developing in micro-organisms is one of the major public health threats that will be faced in the 21st century.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The Soil Association's US investigations found that GM crops have increased the cost of farming and reduced farmers' profits for the following reasons:</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>1- GM varieties increase farmer seed costs by up to 40 per cent an acre; GM soya and maize, which make up 83 per cent of the GM crops grown worldwide, `deliver less income on average to farmers than non-GM crops';</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>2- GM varieties require farmers to pay biotech firms a `technology fee';</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>3- The GM companies forbid farmers to save their seeds for replanting; contrary to traditional practice, farmers have to buy new seed each year; and</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>4- GM herbicide-tolerant crops increase farmers' use of expensive herbicides, especially as new weed problems have emerged - rogue herbicide-resistant oilseed rape plants being a widespread problem; contrary to the claim that only one application would be needed, farmers are applying herbicides several times.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Even a 2002 report by the US Department of Agriculture, a key ally of the biotech industry, admitted that the economic benefits of cultivating GM crops were `variable' and that farmers growing GM Bt corn were actually `losing money.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Adopting GM crops would place farmers and the food chain itself under the control of a handful of multinational corporations such as Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer and DuPont. For US farmers this has meant:</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>1- Legally-binding agreements that force farmers to purchase expensive new seeds from the biotech corporations each season;</span></p>

As with all crops, leftover seed from GM plants can germinate in fields since used to grow different crops; the seeds produce so-called `volunteers'. If biotech company inspectors find any such plants, they can claim - and have repeatedly done so - that the farmers are growing unlicensed crops and infringing patent rights. For example, David Chaney, who farms in Kentucky, had to pay Monsanto $35,000; another Kentucky farmer agreed to pay the firm $25,000; and three Iowa farmers are on record as having paid it $40,000 each. These and other farmers have also had to sign gagging orders and agree to allow Monsanto complete access to their land in subsequent years. Crops have also been destroyed and seed confiscated. The biotech industry currently has legal actions pending against 550 farmers in North America.</span></p>

Contamination has already:</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>4- If commercial planting of GM crops took place in Britain, the UK's burgeoning organic sector - now worth £900m, and set to increase with (supposed) government support - would perish. If, by some miracle, contamination could be avoided the costs involved would inevitably lead to organic farmers going bust. A study published by the JRC in May predicted that efforts to protect conventional and organic crops from contamination would add 41 per cent to the cost of producing non-GM oilseed rape and up to 9 per cent to the cost of producing non-GM maize and potatoes.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The proponents of GM argue that the technology will lead to a reduction in the use of chemical weedkillers. But for the majority of GM crops grown so far, the evidence does not bear this out.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Four years worth of data from the US Department of Agriculture shows herbicide use on Roundup Ready soya beans is increasing.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>In 1998 total herbicide use on GM soya beans in six US states was 30 per cent greater on average than on conventional varieties.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The Soil Association's US investigation found that `the use of GM crops is resulting in a reversion to the use of older, more toxic compounds' such as the herbicide paraquat.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>WHY?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Genes modified to make crops herbicide-resistant can be transferred to related weeds, which would then also become herbicide-resistant.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Crops can themselves act like weeds. Because GM crops are designed to have a greater ability to survive, leftover seeds can germinate in later years when a different crop is growing in the same field. The leftover volunteer plants would then contaminate the new crop. In Canada, where GM herbicide-tolerant oilseed rape has been grown since 1998, oilseed rape weeds resistant to three different herbicides have been created. These oilseed rape weeds are an example of `gene-stacking' - the occurrence of several genetically-engineered traits in a single plant. Gene-stacking was found in all 11 GM sites investigated in a Canadian ministry of agriculture study. As professor Martin Entz of Winnipeg's University of Manitoba observes, `GM oilseed rape is absolutely impossible to control'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Following a review of the Canadian experience, English Nature - the UK government's advisory body on biodiversity - predicted: `Herbicide-tolerant gene-stacked volunteers of oilseed rape would be inevitable in practical agriculture in the UK.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>There has also been an increase in pesticide use by farmers attempting to cope with pest resistance created by GM Bt crops. Bt crops are modified to produce the insecticidal toxin Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in all their tissues.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>However, the World Bank says insects can adapt to Bt within `one or two years'. And scientists at China's Nanjing Institute of Environmental Sciences have concluded that if it was planted continuously Bt cotton would probably lose all its resistance to bollworm - the pest it is designed to control - within eight to 10 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Meanwhile, pests' adaptability to pest-resistant GM crops could force farmers onto a `genetic treadmill' of ever more technical biotech fixes (including new varieties of pest-resistant crops) and more frequent spraying, and more toxic doses, of chemical pesticides. It could also destroy the effectiveness of Bt as a natural insecticide in organic agriculture.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Perversely, GM pest-resistant crops could make agriculture more vulnerable to pests and disease; they could end up harming beneficial soil micro-organisms and insects like ladybirds and lacewings that keep certain pest populations in check.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The Delhi-based Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology found in a study of four Indian states that `not only did Monsanto's Bt cotton not protect plants from the American bollworm, but there was an increase of 250-300 per cent in attacks by non-target pests like jassids, aphids, white fly and thrips'. And researchers at Cornell University in the US found that the pollen from Bt corn was poisonous to the larvae of monarch butterflies.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>As GM `pest-resistant' crops fail to deliver, Australian farmers have been advised to spray additional insecticide on Monsanto's Bt cotton by the Transgenic and Insect Management Strategy Committee of the Australian Cotton Growers Research Association. Overall insecticide applications on Bt maize have also increased in the US.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>GM crops may also reduce the diversity of plant life by contaminating their wild relatives and indigenous crop varieties in areas where the crops evolved. Widespread GM contamination of conventional maize has already been detected in Mexico. In Europe, contamination of wild relatives of oilseed rape and sugar beet is considered inevitable if GM commercialisation goes ahead. The same applies to wild relatives of rice in Asia.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The idea that GM will end global poverty is probably the biggest of all the GM apologists' lies - the one used to accuse anti-GM campaigners in rich countries of not caring about the Third World. The truth is that the introduction of GM crops into the developing world will result in decreased yields, crop failures and the impoverishment of literally billions of small farmers.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>As already statedon page 36, there is no evidence that genetic modification increases yields. But, just to make the point, consider the following:</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>1- a US Department of Agriculture report published in May 2002 concluded that net yields of herbicide-tolerant soya bean were no higher than those of non-GM soya, and that yields of pest-resistant corn were actually lower than those of non-GM corn;</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>2- in September 2001, the state court of Mississippi ruled that a Monsanto subsidiary's `high-yielding' GM soya seeds were responsible for reduced yields obtained by Mississippi farmer Newell Simrall; the farmer was awarded damages of $165,742.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>But then, no commercial GM crop has ever been specifically engineered to have a higher yield.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>CROP FAILURES</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Crop failures (and, therefore, drastically reduced yields) have already occurred with GM soya and cotton plants in the developing world. This is largely due to the unpredictable behaviour of these crops. GM soya's brittleness, for example, has made it incapable of surviving heat waves. And in 2002 `massive failure' of Bt cotton was reported in the southern states of India; consequently, in April the Indian government denied Monsanto clearance for the cultivation of its Bt cotton in India's northern states.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>GM would force the two billion people who manage the developing world's small family farms to stop their age-old practice of saving seeds. Each year they will have to buy expensive seeds and chemicals instead. The experience of North American farmers shows that GM seeds cost up to 40 per cent more than non-GM varieties.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Inadequate yields are not the cause of hunger today. As Sergey Vasnetsov, a biotech industry analyst with investment bank Lehman Brothers, says: `Let's stop pretending we face food shortages. There is hunger, but not food shortages.' In 1994, food production could have supplied 6.4 billion people (more than the world's actual population) with an adequate 2,350 calories per day. Yet more than 1 billion people do not get enough to eat.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Furthermore, the types of GM crops being produced are almost exclusively for the processed-food, textiles and animal-feed markets of the West. Instead of being used to grow staple foods for local consumption, millions of hectares of land in the developing world are being set aside to grow GM corn, for example, to supply grain for pigs, chicken and cattle. In May, ActionAid published a report called GM Crops: going against the grain, which revealed that `only 1 per cent of GM research is aimed at [developing] crops [to be] used by poor farmers in poor countries'. And ActionAid calculates that those crops `stand only a one in 250 chance of making it into farmers' fields'. As the UN Development Programme points out, `technology is created in response to market pressures - not the needs of poor people, who have little purchasing power'.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Sustainable agriculture projects have led to millet yields rising by up to 154 per cent in India, millet and sorghum yields rising by 275 per cent in Burkina Faso and maize yields increasing by 300 per cent in Honduras. Combined with reforms aimed at achieving more equitable land ownership, protection from subsidised food imports and the re-orientation of production away from export crops to staple foods for local consumption, sustainable farming could feed the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>In 1998 a delegation representing every African country except South Africa submitted a joint statement to a UN conference on genetic research. The delegates had been inspired by a Monsanto campaign that used images of starving African children to plug its technology. The statement read: `We strongly object that the image of the poor and hungry from our countries is being used by giant multinational corporations to push a technology that is neither safe, environmentally-friendly nor economically beneficial to us. We do not believe that such companies or gene technologies will help our farmers to produce the food that is needed in the 21st century. On the contrary, we think it will destroy the diversity, the local knowledge and the sustainable agricultural systems that our farmers have developed for millennia, and that it will undermine our capacity to feed ourselves.'<br>__________</span></p>
