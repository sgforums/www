              <p>Nope, cos i am a FM student last time... speed in calculation meant something to us.</p>

              <p>Hi Uncertain,</p>
              <p>I certainly agree with you that it is still important to learn the concepts and not be totally reliant on the use of the GC.</p>
              <p>The intent of introducing the GC into the A level curriculum (in my personal opinion) is to take away the "hassle" of mathematical calculations/manipulations, so that students can focus better in learning the concepts.</p>
              <p>For secretliker's question, it makes more sense to use the GC than to apply the Poisson formula.</p>
              <p>I taught in a JC for 3 years and have observed students who are not adaptable enough to tap on the powerfulness of the GC. One analogy I used to share with my students was: "If you can get to your destination faster in a sports car, why would you want to use a bicycle?"</p>

              <p>I disagree with you. Why? Because the O level A Maths syllabus took away the topic formerly known as function (eg. f(x), g(x), f^-1(x) etc)... In addition, they also simplify the requirements for sketches of graphs of trigo, linear, quadratic, modulus etc...</p>
              <p>Learning by the old school way would take something like 10hrs... and would equip the student to do sketch of stuffs like y = |3cos[(pi)x-2]+1|-5... the example I chosen is "illegal" (to be an AM question) for the  3 reasons</p>
              <p>1. The coefficent of (pi)x is illegal, must be an integer.</p>
              <p>2. Cannot have +/- inside the ratio.</p>
              <p>3. Cannot have anything outside the modulus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may feel that the syllabus is "wrong" but think about it... do you really need to sketch? Cannot draw/plot meh? Especially in this age and time when computers can do the "plotting" for you anytime... I don't know about you but if my GC is down,</p>
              <p>1) I can use my PC...</p>
              <p>2)my PC is down... I can use my laptop... my laptop is down...</p>
              <p>3)I can use my MacBook... my MacBook is down...</p>
              <p>4)I can use my spare PC... my spare PC is down...</p>
              <p>5)I can use my webserver PC... I webserver PC is down...</p>
              <p>6)I can use my LG KT610 handphone... my KT610 down...</p>
              <p>7)I can use my Nokia with java applications...</p>
              <p>Tell me what are the chances that I do not have access to a piece of equipment which can draw me a graph?</p>
              <p>I agree with the change in emphasis personally. I think the syllabus reviewers did an excellent job phasing out unnecessary skills to make room for more meaningful stuff such as Geometric Proof. Complicated graph sketching is just about mechanic skills whereas Geometric Proof build up the ability to reason and argue mathematically.</p>
              <p>Concepts over technicalities. Kudos to the Maths Specialists in the MOE.</p>

              <p>First simple question.</p>
              <p>During exams (might be A levels), your GC is suddenly down, and no one else have a spare since it is so expensive. Then how?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second simple question.</p>
              <p>Without knowing properly the concepts beforehand, how did programmers even come up with the most efficient software?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current A level syllabus isn't even concept over technicality. Many of the students do not even know how to sketch a complicated graph from scratch; they only know how to plot it on the GC. This is in my opinion, technicality (of how to use the calculator) over concepts.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, computers can do many things, but to me, it is still wise not to be overly reliant on them, which is actually what Uncertain and I meant. :D</p>

              <p>Well Mikethm, I cannot change your thinking. But if u ever want to pursue study in university especially in the finance sector or mathematices field, then good luck to u.</p>
              <p>As what purpledragon had said, it is possible to do all math questions with scientific calculator. The only time i use my GC is for my matrix reduced-row echleon form and my Further Mathematics teacher taught us this topic by first telling us to do it the brute force way. I admit it is tough but is enriching which make some of my courses a brisk.</p>

              <p>Again, if you are trying to say that it is because O levels and A levels are "GENERAL certifications of education", then you are not learning it for the sake of knowledge, but for the sake of examinations. This clearly contradicts what you said earlier  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Because it is for the sake of knowledge, I always teach extras to my students (if they want to hear) and tell them what they are learning at their level is not complete, to help them appreciate the subject at hand. I believe that one should adopt the same mindset for maths as well, learn and not rely on the GC.</p>
              <p>Of course, I'm not denying that you will still have to be well trained in the GC as well to make full use of it in exams; I strongly advocate that too.</p>

              <p>Erm</p>
              <p>The problem is, the graph sketching techniques are not complicated at all. We are not even talking about the super chim graphs, just standard graphs at A levels. It is definitely not at all tough to sketch them.</p>
              <p>Next, "A student
                                          satisfied with concepts of graphs and more than happy to let the
                                          GC/Computer do the actual mechnical aspects is learning for the
                                          sake of knowledge."</p>
              <p>This is what I am saying actually. However, is the student even taught the concepts of the graphs at all to let them be satisfied? It doesn't seem so. Do you think most of the A level students now have the ability to get a general feel of a graph before even touching the GC? Do you think they really understand why certain parts of a graph are of an increasing or decreasing nature? And the short cuts to knowing whether a graph tends to positive or negative infinity when it encounters an asymptote? Even if you give them the asymptotes, the stationary points, the x and y intercepts (and thus not necessary to do all the so-called complicated stuff), they might not even be able to sketch a nice and proper graph with ease. These are to me also concepts of the curve; merely understanding the output from the GC is insufficient.</p>
              <p>These are all simple concepts, but sadly, with the over-reliance on the GC, many of the students are now not able to employ them. Not sure if you considered these "in-depth". But from what you have said, I think we are sort of going a little off tangent to each other, that's why the disagreement <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Well of course there are still questions in the 'A' Level Syllabus which requires manual sketching. The GC is there to help one gauge the general shape of an equation, however one must know how to find intercepts and asymptotes as my current GC do not directly tell me.</p>
              <p>The more challenging types of questions are those which they give you symbols instead of actual numbers, where you are required to find certain points in terms of symbols like y-intercept = a/b or something like that. But even this should be basic concept.</p>
              <p>Simply put, the GC is there as an aid, a helpful aid to simplify tedious calculations, which would otherwise waste precious time, and not part of the testing objective essentially.</p>
              <p>For instance, a question which involves solving for the roots of say an equation y = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - 1, but the main purpose of that question is not to test students on solving for the roots, but on other stuff. Thus the process can be simplified with the GC and just read off the roots from the GC.</p>
              <p>In another anology, most 'A' Level students, I believe, are familiar with the rules of differentiation and integration, but they do not know how to derive the exact principle of why d/dx (sin x) = cos x, from scratch. Hence, for simplicity sake, we take for granted that the equation above is true and apply it whenever required in examinations, because what the Examiner intend to test was not for one to show why d/dx (sin x) = cos x, but for one to show the working using simplified and already-worked out formulae. </p>

              <p>Analogy, you know how to do big numbers multiplication from primary school. You understand the principles of how to solve it, but you use a normal calculator as an aid to simplify it. But then, you know you can still do it even if your calculator goes haywired.</p>

              <p>Aiyo, when did my Poisson distribution question turn into this lengthy discussion? o.O</p>
              <p>Hmm well, think my example of d/dx (sin x) = cos x is not a good one. Haha.</p>
              <p>But my point is that there are many tedious mathematical principles which have been simplified for us to use, and we just take it as it is. The calculator is also used to minimize these tedious workings to minimum. </p>
