            <div class='col-md body'><p>First, you need to understand that move relates to mobility which means of an particular object been capable of point to point action unaided. This means that all animals can move as they have moving-aiding cell such as muscles. However, plants can only move certain parts of their body, so for plant movement, it should be movement to aid in photosynthesize and other life process and the moving is very gradual and some movement in plants are still debatable by Biologists such as translocation. So for plants, they do not move but can lean toward one side and could grow. In this context, growing is not equal to mobility. Therefore, that statement technically is true in some sense but in your context, false.</p></div>

              <p>Plant moves in response to sunlight/light.What are the other available options in the question?</p>

              <p>OMG! i am sec 4 this yr and i do not really know this answer after looking ur replies...</p>
              <p>but i think that plants move,</p>
              <p>there is always this experiment about putting a plant in a black box and open a hole... then next few day the plant will point towards the hole... no one moved that plant right? and it moved itself...   then we are always asked what did you observed? then my answer would be the plant point/move/tilt towards the hole.. then i got a correct...</p>
              <p>next thing is that there is this plant u would almost see it near restaurants or rich apartments, i dunno wat the plant name is but this plant likes to stick to the wall and "climb" up, if not u put and stick near it the plant will "climb" up the stick... so the plant moved by itself, right?</p>
              <p>so i still think that plant DO move by itself..</p>
