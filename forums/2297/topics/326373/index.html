              <p>Hello. Im starting this topic to call to my fellow singaporean secondary school students who are taking the national exams. To share with your thoughts and tips.</p>
              <p>So guys... what are you doing? Are you all well prepared?</p>
              <p>I've never really studied that hard before. But for this month I'll have to slaught like crazy. I go to school, come back home, without removing my uniform or having lunch straight dive into my books. My room is where I'm at all the times. Gonna start to do my ten year series and other school test papers.</p>
              <p>Seriously... I've never studied this much in my life. I sleep 7 hours a day from 10pm - 5 am the next day. Wake up get ready for school then spend like about an hour or so doing some maths, (maths is the best thing to study in the morning for me) Go to school then rush back home when school is over than start doing mock papers.</p>
              <p>Crash course: I dont go through each chapter because not much time left. I'm trying to get into the feel of doing the papers. Even though I don't know the questions for example E Maths I do the papers first then check the answer and learn from the textbook the method to solve it. So instead of going through each and every exercise for different topics, I cut short and focus on the exam paper more and see where I can score best and try to score as much.</p>
              <p>Man Im so lag, once my "N" levels are over I've gotta start going through the topics backwards and finish what I've left.</p>
              <p>For my english I try to whack as much as marks I can from paper 2 the compre. Summary is the one I gotta be careful off. Paper 1 is easy, but unpredictable as well, I thought of going for certain types of essays, like my favorites genres are argumentative, narrative and descriptive but to play safe I've gotta mug those typical ones that ask about your personal life, you know... those abstract ones like; Family,Â  Friends or School e.t.c Situational Writting is also another thing I gotta look our for because they can ask anything from Reports to Informal letters.</p>
              <p>MT is quite easy I guess. Just gotta read up abit, do some previous year papers and it'll be all good.</p>
              <p>My room is pretty much my world. Stuck within those four walls. I've almost like chained myself to my desk. I'm aiming for A1 for EMaths, and A2s for both languages. Other subjects I hope to pass but right now I'm only stuck with the prerequisite of having to score 10 points and or below for 3 subjects to make it for next year.</p>
              <p>So anyways... I would like to know how youre keeping motivated and how your study atmosphere is like? Do you play soothing music, on the air con or keep some munchies at your desk?</p>
              <p>Finally good luck on your prelims and N/O levels.</p>

              <p>my advice is start studying everyday and nvr try those "crash" style.</p>
              <p>of course, if u are lazy, den last minute study will do you some good</p>
