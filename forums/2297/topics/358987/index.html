              <p>First , I will like you to imagine "1unit" as one of those boxes in model diagrams.</p>
              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>On normal days,</p>
              <p>Factory A "1 unit" + 2 chairs</p>
              <p>Factory B "1unit" - 4 chairs</p>
              <p>Factory C "1/3 unit"</p>
              <p>Factory D "1 unit"</p>
              <p>Total = 1398 chairs = 3units +1/3 units - 2 chairs</p>
              <p>=&gt; 1 unit = 420 chairs</p>
              <p>Chairs produce on that particular day</p>
              <p>= 1 unit + 1 unit + 1unit + 1unit</p>
              <p>= 4 units</p>
              <p>=<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1680</strong></span> chairs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a normal day, total chairs produced by factories B and C</p>
              <p>= "1 unit" - 4chairs + "1/3 unit"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>= <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>556 </strong></span>chairs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>Now, let ahmad's original money be "1 A unit" and Siti's original amount of money be "1 S unit".</p>
              <p>Once again, you will have to imagine it as a model diagram : P</p>
              <p>"1 A unit" + "1 S unit" = $100</p>
              <p>"2 A unit" + "3 S unit" = $275</p>
              <p>You will realise now that "2 A unit" + "2 S unit" = $200</p>
              <p>If you use it with the 2nd model ( ahem...equation ), </p>
              <p>you will get "1 S unit" = $75</p>
              <p>And since Siti receive "2 S unit" from her mother, the amount she receive is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>$150</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Originally, ahmad has "1 A unit", which is $25.</p>
              <p>Every month he receive "1 A unit", which is still, sadly, $25.</p>
              <p>30% of $25 = $7.50</p>
              <p>amount of months needed</p>
              <p>= [$55 - $25 ( initial amount he has )] / $7.50</p>
              <p>= 4 months, including January.</p>
              <p>Hence Ahmad will have $55 in savings in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>April</strong></span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Alice = 16km/h, Betty = 12km/h</p>
              <p>In 30mins, Alice travelled 8km, Betty travelled 6km.</p>
              <p>Hence Alice gained another 2km.</p>
              <p>Total distance ahead = 5km + 2km = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>7km</strong></span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 2.30pm, Betty = 7km behind.</p>
              <p>At 4.30pm, Betty travelled 12km X 2h = 24km</p>
              <p>At the same time, Alice travelled only 24km - 7km = 17km</p>
              <p>Hence, Alice's new average speed = 17km / 2 hours = <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>8.5km/h</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
