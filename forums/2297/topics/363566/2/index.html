              <p>I won't deny that. Last time i had classmates who stay in the east and north east who travel to the west for lessons when there were nearer choices.</p>
              <p>Good luck in making your plans but more importantly, remember to leave time to study for your O's</p>

              <p>As far as i know, the 10% special criteria ppl are NOT included
              in this results compilation since they go in by merit which is NOT
              purely academic. Most have to take entrance exams to qualify for
              their place and for such people, its no longer their results that
              matters but how well they do for the entrace exams. No uni will
              accept a student who shows significant inability to handle his
              studies and end up dropping out of school so regardless of
              criteria, they still need to meet a certain standard of academic
              ability. Do not provide the wrong info and mislead people.</p>
              <p>Popularity of courses and annual intake are generally rather
              constant and unless there is a major change in market demand etc,
              its unlikely to change significantly and if it does change, do does
              JC entry criteria so there is not much difference either way.</p>
              <p>The chemical and biological science field has been popular and
              has gain more popularity with S'pore's aim to become a biomedical
              hub etc yet there is not very significant change in admission
              criteria over the past 4 yrs since i was admitted to my course till
              i'm taking it now so such things as 3.4 jump to 3.7 is impossible
              over a year but slight variations of 0.1 is more practical.</p>

              <p>Read Question 6. The reason why the 10th percentile is made known, and not the zero percentile, is because those who got in through discretionary admissions could possibly have a really low GPA. Hence, the GPA range between the undergraduate with the highest GPA and the lowest GPA could be very wide. But on the otherhand, this means that those who got in through discretionary admissions are also included in the full GPA count.</p>
              <p>Do not accuse me of misleading people if you have not read up yourself before posting.</p>
              <p>As for the 2nd part, I am making an example, despite the odds of it happening are close to, if not equal to, zero. I want the TS to understand the importance of the "Available Lots" factor, and not the 'GPA Jump'. Talking about it here, I will like to add on an important sub-factor which affects this factor too, and that is the year you are applying in. If you apply in the year where there are lots of "Dragon Babies", obviously you will have a larger and tougher competition to get into the course. Hence, the same amount of GPA might get you in if you apply in a certain year, but may not do so in another year.</p>

              <p>Ok i will admit i'm wrong in that but your statement was still misleading.</p>
              <p>The 10% covers all courses and is the entire uni enrolment and not 10% of each course. This makes it have minimal effects when affecting the overall grade profile. You made it sound like that 10% is because almost all in that 10% of DA causes the GPA grade profile to be low which is what is misleading when that 10% DA is spreadout and there is nothing to say all DA applicants must be academically weaker than those who got in academically. Anyway, JC students also can do poorly and apply through DA as well so do not just say its poly students who applies for DA and only the poly grade profiles are affected.</p>
              <p>Furthermore i used the 10% mark as the minimum requirement for TS to aim for and not tell him to aim below that to qualify for admission.</p>
