              <p>I am concerned about the decision taken by the public prosecutor to charge the 44 men for having commercial sex with the the under-aged girl.</p>
              <p>I am not defending the actions of these men. Rather, I am questioning the decision to charge them, based on the evidence that was available. According to what I read in the papers, these men were enticed by an online website that showed the girl to be 18 years old. If she was below 18 years, she must have deliberately lied about her age. Surely, she is the bigger culprit?</p>
              <p>Let me give you this analogy. I bought a piece of cake and gave it to my friend. My friend died from food poisoning after eating the cake. I was not aware about the ingredients in the cake. Should I be charged for homicide, being the person who delivered the cake? Was I responsible to check that the cake was fit for consumption, when I had no reason to suspect otherwise?</p>
              <p>For a person to be charged for a crime, there must be evidence that he knew of the crime or had to duty to find out. Did the police had grounds to know that the 44 men knew that the prostitute was below the legal age? If they had the duty to find out, how could it be done? Quite likely, the prostitute would not want to show her real name by producing the identity card.</p>
              <p>Did the police ask each of the 44 men for their side of the story? Was there any reason to reject their excuse that they did not know her real age? Should these people be let off with a warning? Could they pay a penalty without being charged in court and without admission of guilt?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, a person is condemned by public opinion when they are charged in court, regardless of whether they are eventually convicted. We are destroying the reputation and careers of 44 people by taking this drastic action. Is this the type of outcome that is desirable for the future of Singapore?</p>
              <p>I wish to repeat that I am not condoning the action of these 44 men and that action should be taken to protect our under-aged girls. But this is probably a bad case to act on. And it may be unjust to the people who are involved.</p>
              <p>I hope that the police and public prosecutor will review this matter and find a better solution - before more people and their families are harmed unnecessarily and excessively.</p>

              <p>Many of us take our smiles for granted, because it's something we can do without thinking. For 23-year-old Wang Na, however, even something as basic as smiling is impossible because she was born without an upper jaw.</p>
              <p>Wang Na, Shaanxi province, has a face that looks like a sunken pit because of her rare condition. She says she was often made fun of by other kids, and had to cover her face with a scarf whenever she went out. She ran home crying after her first day at school and never went back. She was also abandoned by her real parents.</p>
              <p>In May 2010, her life changed forever when her face was rebuilt by doctors after four years of treatment. She can now smile like a normal person... <br> </p>

              <p>Tuesday, Apr 17, 2012 <br>China Daily/Asia News Network <br>By Ma Lie, Liu Zhihua and Lu Hongyan <br>XI'AN, China - For the first two decades of her life, Wang Na just wanted to be able to smile and chew food.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old was born without an upper jawbone or upper gums, making the middle of her face look like a sunken pit.</p>
              <p>She rushed back home, crying, the first day she went to school and had never gone back.</p>
              <p>"I had to cover my face with a scarf when I went out and I was always ridiculed by other kids," she recalled.</p>
              <p>That was until May 2010 when her face was finally rebuilt by doctors after four years of treatment.</p>
              <p>For the first time in her life she could smile like a normal person, and chew and taste food. It was like being reborn.</p>
              <p>Wang, from Shaanxi province, had been abandoned soon after her birth.</p>
              <p>Wang Youren, 67, Wang's adoptive father, recalls the night of July 24, 1988, when he heard a noise outside as he prepared to go to bed.</p>
              <p>He had thought someone was trying to steal his cow, but instead found a package of bedding next to his firewood stack.</p>
              <p>Inside, the father found Wang Na and brought her into the house.</p>
              <p>In the light, the couple found a piece of paper with the baby's date of birth: July 23, 1988.</p>
              <p>The couple felt glad when they found that the baby was a girl as they had two sons and no daughters.</p>
              <p>But their hearts sank when they found, while trying to feed her, that the baby girl had no upper jaw.</p>
              <p>Though their elder son had been born deaf and dumb, the couple decided to adopt her because they thought she would die, if abandoned again.</p>
              <p>To feed her, the poor family borrowed money and bought a dairy goat to produce milk.</p>
              <p>As Wang Na grew, her mother mashed steamed bread and rice into a paste to feed the girl - a special feeding that lasted more than 20 years.</p>
              <p>Wang Youren recalled taking her to a rural fair where many people looked at her as a monster. "I was even scolded and told not to bring her out to scare people," said the father.</p>
              <p>The family had tried to restore her face since she was eight, visiting many hospitals in the province, but were told there was no way.</p>
              <p>One day in 2006, a neighbor who worked in Shaanxi's capital, Xi'an, suggested that the family go to the Dental Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University.</p>
              <p>Liu Yanpu, a professor and director of oral and facial plastic surgery in the hospital, knew the case was rare. The cost of treatment, as well as the difficulties and risks, were quite high.</p>
              <p>"Seeing the praying eyes of her parents and Wang Na, I couldn't refuse the family."</p>
              <p>The doctor reported the case to the head of the hospital next morning and the hospital decided to give her free treatment.</p>
              <p>"I knew we would take risks to do this surgery, as there was no successful experience to learn from," said Zhao Yimin, director of the hospital.</p>
              <p>The rest is history.</p>
              <p>When Wang Na returned home with her restored face, she was introduced to many men for marriage.</p>
              <p>After thinking for many days and nights, she made the unexpected decision to marry her elder deaf-mute adopted brother, who had looked after her for the past two decades.</p>
              <p>Life has never been better for Wang, she said.</p>
              <p>"I have had double happiness during the past half year," Wang continued.</p>
              <p>"One is that I held my wedding ceremony in November. The other is that I got 0.67 hectares of the best farmland from the villager's committee to grow vegetables for my new life."</p>

              <p>STOMPer Catherine was appalled that nobody gave up their seat to this little girl who had been standing on the MRT from City Hall Interchange to Kembangan MRT station.</p>
              <p>Said the STOMPer:</p>
              <p>"I boarded a train at City Hall at around 9pm last Saturday and saw a woman who was carrying a lot of bags. She was with two kids -- one in a baby pram and the other standing on the train.</p>
              <p>"The little girl who was around two years old must have gotten tired of standing as she asked her mother to be carried after a while. And she almost fell down a few times!</p>
              <p>"Nobody gave up their seat to either the mother or her tired little girl, not even the guy who was on the Reserved Seat (meant for pregnant women and elderly)!"</p>
              <p>"At a station, a seat was emptied after a guy alighted. Just when the little girl wanted to take the seat, another guy had occupied it!</p>
              <p>"When I alighted at Kembangan MRT station, the little girl was still standing on the train."</p>

              <p><em>The obscenely rich get obscenely richer, while the obscenely poor get obscenely poorer. </em></p>
              <p>As Colin Goh (the man behind the social-issues movie Singapore Dreaming) writes in his farewell article :</p>
              <p>I'm particularly dismayed by the polarised state of America today, especially because it's a manufactured polarisation. Basically, there are some ultra-rich people who believe they are entitled by the mere fact of their wealth to do whatever they want, which is usually to make even more money, and that the less well-off owe their reduced circumstances merely to indolence and lack of will.</p>
              <p>These loaded sociopaths also have no compunction in manipulating the less-educated over to their side by stoking deep-seated prejudices and insecurities. This is why, for instance, you'll find deeply impoverished people supporting billionaires who see nothing wrong with paying a much lower tax rate than everyone else, but wanting to lynch those who actually want to narrow the income gap. Why? Because the wealthy wackos keep pandering to their base's baser instincts on issues such as race, immigration, sexual orientation and religion.</p>
              <p>If there's one lesson Singapore should take away from the present state of America, it's that we should beware the toxic combination of prosperous psychopaths and the rabidly religious.</p>
              <p>Like many Singaporeans, I came to America believing in small government, and I still do. It's just that I now know that allowing mega-corporations or rich individuals to occupy the roles of government isn't necessarily an improvement. In fact, dislodging private players may be even more difficult than voting out politicians.</p>
              <p>Freedom, I've learnt, isn't simply about getting to do as you wish. It's about creating the conditions where as many people as possible can achieve their aspirations, without crushing others in the process.</p>

              <p><img src="http://content.tremeritus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/marina-bay-sands-and-helix-bridge-at-night-232x300.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Marina Bay and big part of Sentosa are reclaimed lands of Singapore. We should applaud our founding PAP leaders (eg Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye) for having the vision and Singaporeans’ interests at heart to embark on the land reclamation program, knowing that with the increase in population and progress in development, Singapore will inevitably need more land.</p>
              <p>Billions and billions of Singaporean taxpayers’ money were invested in the land reclamation. Our founding leaders must have had in the their minds and plans to earmark all these heavily capital invested lands to be used for more productive and wholesome purposes for the benefits of all Singaporeans, their children and the children of their children.</p>
              <p>But today, we see two casinos occupying these reclaimed land. Our MM Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed that casinos would only possibly be built in Singapore over his dead body and he is not dead yet but his son and the Ministers have already allowed the foreigners to build two casinos with the intention to build more on these valuable reclaimed lands.</p>
              <p>PAP not only has to grant the valuable lands, it also has to further invest huge sum of taxpayers’ money to build the infrastructures like roads, MRT stations , bridges, staff housing , etc and to provide security with our young Singaporeans in blood, sweat and tear as NSF soldiers and police to ensure that the casinos are secured, viable and profitable.<br>Correct. No doubt, the casinos do generate a few billions of dollars a year for our economy. But who are benefiting from this lucrative vice activity?</p>
              <p>Certainly, not the common Singaporeans. The first direct beneficiaries are the two foreign owners of the casinos. They probably reap a few hundred millions a year each. Mind you, according to reports, majority of the casinos’ patrons are still Singaporeans. Therefore, majority of the money that the casinos’ owners put warmly in their owned pockets are probably taken out from the Singaporeans’.</p>
              <p>Next is our betraying PAP govt. It has benefited handsomely from the taxation on the casinos’ profit and the entrance fees from the local Singaporeans it has collected. Singaporeans have to pay $100 each to enter the casinos.</p>
              <p>However, these revenues collected are not filtered down to be enjoyed by the public. Singapore is totally a non-welfare state. A Singaporean may consistently pay personal tax for the last 30 years, but once he or she is unemployed the next day, he or she will not get a cent from the govt as temporary unemployment benefit.</p>
              <p>Our govt is one of the richest in the world now. But nothing is really subsidized by the govt in Singapore, even for the poorest. In fact, for most common Singaporeans except for the Ministers, they have to pay much higher prices for the basic public services like health care, public housing, transportation and total education as compare to their counterparts do in Taiwan, Hong Kong, S Korea or Malaysia.</p>
              <p>One of our Ministers paid only $8 for his by-pass heart surgery but a common Singaporean has to pay at least $20 for just an outpatient consultation at the public polyclinic.</p>
              <p>Our public services are not only not subsidized by the govt but they are virtually systematically managed and operated to make profit out of the people. As such, the welfare of the people, if any, is all self-providing. The govt provides nothing.</p>
              <p>So, how the PAP govt utilizes the nation’s wealth, is everybody’s guess. But from records, we know for sure that the two PAP controlled companies, GIC and Temasek which have acquired most of the nation’s wealth under their assets have lost billions and billions of dollars in their overseas investments.</p>
              <p>The casinos may provide jobs but for mostly foreigners. Most jobs in the casinos require you only to stand and serve without really having to use the brain. You may even be forced to call the customers ‘Your Highness’. Casinos are labour-intensive. Therefore, they always offer low paid jobs. There is certainly no long term prospect even if one works for 50 years in the casino. Surely, most Singaporeans will naturally reject such jobs.</p>
              <p>Besides, casinos will not bring in any technological-know-how for our country. A casino will still be a casino after another 100 years.</p>
              <p>Casinos also cause many social problems for Singapore. I believe the PAP has purposely understated or denied the severity of the social problems caused by gambling. MM Lee had let the cat out of the bag at a recent Japanese conference. He said he would like to see the entrance fee for the casinos increase by five folds, from $100 to $500 for Singaporeans. We can infer from his statement that gambling is now a serious problem and the govt has to do much more to mitigate the problem.</p>
              <p>I can also attest to the fact that pathological gamblers are increasing at an alarming rate after the casinos are allowed to operate in Singapore. I am a taxi driver. Although, I don’t drop or pick up pathological gamblers everyday at the casinos, but I do often meet enough of these Singaporeans who have gambling problems or are prepared to divulge their gambling problems to me while they are sitting in my taxi to safely use them as a reliable sample to represent that casino gambling has indeed caused increasing social problems.</p>
              <p>I do go to casinos to gamble myself but perhaps only once in a few years if only I have a chance to go to gambling cruise, Macau or Genting. It is only for leisure, may be win or lose a few hundred dollars. But the gambling problems faced and told by my passengers which I am going to relate as follows are really disheartening.</p>
              <p><strong>One drizzling night at about 10.00 pm, a 70 year old woman with a swollen eye and a baby grand child in her arms suddenly rushed to my taxi from the HDB void deck and nervously told me to take her to the Sentosa Casino. On the way there, she pleaded me to also help her to find her son who she confirmed was gambling in the casino. She said not matter how, she must find his son immediately. Her daughter-in-law had just assaulted her and threatened to kill herself and the grandchild if her son did not return home by midnight. She said her son who works as a delivery man has often stayed overnight at the casinos since the casinos opened. I told her it was impossible for me to locate her son. I suggested to her to use my mobile phone to call her son first. She said her son seldom answers her calls at these times but she tried anyway and fortunately, the son answered. My phone was on speaker mode and I could hear that as soon as the son recognized that the caller was his mother, he started yelling vulgar words on his mother and said that he had just lost few hundred dollars in the casino and was on the way back home. The woman then shyly asked me to turn back worrying she might not have enough to pay me the taxi fare. Indeed, she was short of few dollars in paying me. I told her not to worry and to please take the time to alight the taxi and go home. The baby needs to sleep. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>This time, I was ferrying a 40 years old male home at Hougang from Marina Sand Casino. He was quiet all the way in my taxi until we reached near Hougang. He suddenly tapped my shoulder and said that he had no money at all to pay me because he had lost all the money in the casino. He said he would call his wife to bring down the money when we reached his house. I said no problem. It was about 3 am at that time. We waited for about 10 to 15 minutes for his wife to come down, then I told him to forget about the taxi fare and I had to go. But to my consternation, once he saw his wife who looked much older than him approaching us, he aggressively rushed out of my taxi, then slapped his wife and snatched the money from her. After politely paying me the taxi fare, he slapped his wife again. I just drove my taxi slowly away. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Another woman but this time much younger, about early 30s. It was at Marina Sand Hotel, also about 3 am. The moment she stepped into my taxi she started sobbing. She said uncle could you drive me around. I said you must tell me exactly where you wanted to go. She said never mind, just keep driving to Changi Village. I asked, “are you sure?” She said she needed some fresh air. When we hit the ECP, she suddenly said loudly that all men are beast. I replied softly, may be not all and asked why she was so upset. She started to confess that she divorced one year ago and has custody for her 4 years old son. Her ex-husband had forced her to sell their condo and she was renting a room in a HDB flat to stay with her son. She had some cash after selling the condo. She was depressed after the divorce and started to patronize the casinos with her friends. For the first few weeks, she always felt euphoric because she always won. But later, she began to lose more often and bigger. She had used up all her cash saving and began to borrow from siblings, relatives, friends and finally she had to borrow from the ‘Ah Long’. In fact, she told me she just had a discussion with the Ah Long’s runners at Marina Sand Hotel. The runners directly told her that she could sell her body if she could not repay the debt. I did not know what to say. I am not a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker to advise her accordingly. I just softly asked her where was her son now. She said it didn’t matter and changed her mind that she wanted to go home at Bedok South. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>This was a young man, may be about 26 years, probably just started working in the financial district of Shenton Way. He flagged my taxi at the road along the Marina Sand Casino and asked me to drive him home quickly. It was about 4.30 am already on a weekday. He had to rush back to take a nap, then change and go to work again. He told me he would go to the Marina Sand Casino immediately after work and gamble until 3 to 5 am the next morning and then went to work again, at least 2 or 3 times a week. He said he often lost lately and had almost maximize his credit cards to finance the losses. </strong></p>
              <p>I can go on but it will probably bore you.</p>
              <p>You will never able to read all these despairing stories in our prostituting state-controlled mass media. I believe they purposely not report them in order not to discredit the gambling industry which the PAP has been supporting. PAP and pro-PAP psychologists, psychiatrists or sociologists may say that gambling is a problem that is self-inflicted. It is certainly not the fault of the govt or casinos. Nobody force you to gamble.</p>
              <p>But metaphorically, I would like to ask them a question. If hard drug is legally allowed to be sold in Singapore, will there be more drug addicts. The answer is an obvious YES. It is the same for gambling. If the govt allows more casinos, there will be more gamblers.</p>
              <p>The death victims of the recent Ferrari accident saddened PM Lee and DPM Teo. I hope the despaired gambling victims of our two casinos also sadden them. After seeing first hand of some of the gamblers’ problems, I must say I am certainly saddened by the social problems caused by our casinos on our fellow Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singapore is too small a city nation to have casinos. It is just too convenient for any Singaporean to take a bus, taxi, MRT or drive and within few minutes he or she can start gambling in the casino.</p>
              <p>I hope all Singaporeans will join hands with me to reject this evil industry. Let’s boycott going to the casinos. Without local Singaporeans’ patronage, the casinos will wind up in no time.</p>

              <p><em>An enlightened nun.</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://myfox8.com/2012/06/04/us-nuns-book-on-sexuality-criticized-by-vatican/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://myfox8.com/2012/06/04/us-nuns-book-on-sexuality-criticized-by-vatican/</span></span></a></p>
              <p>VATICAN CITY — The Vatican on Monday sharply criticized a book on sexuality written by a prominent American nun, saying it contradicted church teaching on issues like masturbation, homosexuality and marriage and that its author had a “defective understanding” of Catholic theology.</p>
              <p>The Vatican’s orthodoxy office said the book, “Just Love: A Framework for Christian Sexual Ethics” by Sister Margaret Farley, a member of the Sisters of Mercy religious order and emeritus professor of Christian ethics at Yale Divinity School, posed “grave harm” to the faithful.</p>
              <p>The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said that in the 2006 book, Farley either ignored church teaching on core issues of human sexuality or treated it as merely one opinion among many.</p>
              <p>Farley said Monday she never intended the book to reflect current official Catholic teaching. Rather, she said, she wrote it to explore sexuality via various religious traditions, theological resources and human experience.</p>
              <p>The Farley critique, signed by the American head of the congregation, Cardinal William Levada, comes amid the Vatican’s recent crackdown on the largest umbrella group of American sisters.</p>
              <p>The Vatican last month essentially imposed martial law on the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, accusing it of undermining church teaching and imposing certain “radical feminist themes” that were incompatible with Catholicism.</p>
              <p>It ordered a full-scale overhaul of the group and appointed three bishops to carry it out.</p>
              <p>The crackdown on Farley, a top American theologian, will likely fuel greater resentment at Rome among more liberal-minded American sisters.The Vatican examination of the book began in 2010 and involved seeking Farley’s responses to its concerns. After her replies failed to satisfy the Congregation, it moved to a full-fledged “examination in cases of urgency” that concluded Dec. 14.</p>
              <p>Pope Benedict XVI approved the decision last March and ordered the decision published.</p>
              <p>In its statement, the Vatican singled out specific problems in Farley’s book which it said “affirms positions that are in direct contradiction with Catholic teaching in the field of sexual morality.”</p>
              <p>Farley, for example, writes that masturbation doesn’t raise any moral problems and can actually help relationships rather than hinder them. The Vatican asserted that according to church teaching “masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action.”</p>
              <p>Farley wrote that homosexual people as well as their activities should be respected. Church teaching holds that gays should be respected but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.”</p>
              <p>On gay marriage, Farley asserted that legal recognition of gay marriage can help transform the stigmatization of gays. Levada wrote back that approving gay marriage would not only signal approval of “deviant behavior” but would obscure the value of traditional marriage between man and woman in society.</p>
              <p>“The principles of respect and non-discrimination cannot be invoked to support legal recognition of homosexual unions,” he wrote.</p>
              <p>In her statement, Farley said she had aimed to propose a framework for sexual ethics that “uses a criteria of justice” in evaluating sexual relations.</p>
              <p>She acknowledged that her responses to certain issues do depart from traditional doctrine, but said they nonetheless were coherent in theological and moral traditions.</p>
              <p>“The fact that Christians (and others) have achieved new knowledge and deeper understanding of human embodiment and sexuality seems to require that we at least examine the possibility of development in sexual ethics,” she wrote.</p>
              <p>She said she appreciated the Vatican’s work but lamented that her positions weren’t reflected in the Congregation’s final document.</p>
              <p>The Rev. James Martin, a liberal-leaning Jesuit author, said the notification will sadden many Catholic theologians who consider Farley a mentor.</p>
              <p>“It will also, inevitably, raise strong emotions among those who already feel buffeted by the Vatican’s Apostolic Visitation of Catholic sisters in the U.S., and its intervention into the LCWR,” said Martin, who has been a vocal critic of the Vatican’s crackdown on U.S. sisters.</p>

              <p>Recently I have asked some questions about discrepancies in our national accounts. These seem to indicate that our reserves are not as buoyant as we might have been led to expect by past surpluses and the supposedly class-leading returns achieved by our sovereign wealth funds. No answers have been forthcoming. Instead there has been a <strong>deafening silence from the State media</strong>. Whether our reserves have been depleted through poor management or were never there in the first place or whether there is a relatively simple explanation is something we can only speculate about.<br><br>The PM’s speech to the Economic Society of Singapore did not set my mind at rest. Instead it exacerbated my previous concerns. Already Tharman, in his 2012 Budget speech, said that <strong>not much more could be spent on health by the government without tax rates rising significantly</strong>. He said that<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> doubling health expenditures as a proportion of GDP would require a top income tax rate of around 60% and a GST rate of 25%.</span></strong> My immediate thought was that this did not square with what the government has told us about its cushion of assets built up through years of austerity. However I put this down to nothing more than the PAP government’s usual desire to <strong>hide the crown jewels from the peasants</strong>.<br><br>It was thus even more alarming to hear much the same story from the PM. The PM talked about taxes needing to rise in the medium term if we were to deal with an aging population and rising healthcare expenditures. He also said that <strong>returns from investing our past reserves only contribute about 2% of GDP </strong>(or S$6.5 billion approximately).<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> This does not square with the total level of assets (about S$700 billion). </span>Neither is it compatible with Temasek’s reported annualised return of 17% p.a. since 1974 or even GIC’s reported long term returns of around 7%. I have already pointed out in my letters to the Finance Minister the alarming and rapid increase in public debt. This is now some S$367 billion according to the latest Monthly Digest of Statistics. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why would the government be borrowing so much? </span></strong>Particularly when it only seems able to achieve a return of less than 1% of total assets which is less than it pays on its debt. I said earlier that if <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the reserves had indeed been depleted through bad investments and were not sufficient to repay the CPF </span></strong>then the government had two alternatives. It could print money but in view of the likely implication for the currency it was more likely to raise the money through a combination of higher taxes and more borrowing. This seems to be becoming an increasingly probable scenario.<br><br>You would think that the government would want to reassure the people that all is well. However all we get is a deafening silence. Like when Tharman said we did not need to know the reasons for Chip Goodyear’s resignation as CEO-in-waiting at Temasek. The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stunning arrogance of a government </span></strong>that thinks we are its employees and is not answerable to us.<br><br>I have already ridiculed the PM’s use of those well-worn phrases “An Inclusive Singapore” and “Politics That Works” in a separate article. Here I will devote the remaining space to a critique of the rest of the PM’s speech. In particular I will focus on his assertion that the Nordic model will not work in Singapore. What is remarkable is that despite new buzzwords the PAP model remains the same one of adding more inputs to produce higher output.<strong> This has not changed for fifty years.</strong> The only way the government knows of keeping the growth rate up is by bringing in more cheap foreign labour. In the section entitled “A Successful, Growing Economy” there is the seemingly deliberate confusion of raw growth with what should be the relevant measure which is productivity or growth in GDP per hour worked.<br><br><strong>Where Are We Today?<br></strong><br>This was the usual blend of misleading statistics to buttress the PM’s case that PAP policies have worked well. Given the fact the flaws in these statistics have been apparent for some time you would think that the PM would come back with slightly more sophisticated arguments. Instead he has opted to use the <strong>same old discredited statistics.<br></strong><br>The PM starts with a comparison of GDP per capita. It is true that this puts Singapore nearly at the top if measured on a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis. However if we then normalize this as GDP per hour worked (Singapore both has a high employment to total population ratio because of the large number of foreign workers and one of the highest numbers of hours worked) then the reality is more prosaic. <strong>Singapore is near the bottom of the international league table when it comes to GDP per hour worked.<br></strong><br>Even the lowly position it has owes much to a highly <strong>suspicious enormous one-time jump in productivity in 2010 of 11.1%.</strong> This happened right after I criticised Singapore’s poor productivity performance way back in 2009. After that we had the report of the Economic Strategies Committee which was all about the productivity problem. Subsequently Tharman devoted most of the 2010 Budget to the issue. And then this was followed almost immediately by a massive jump in productivity. The gain is enough of an outlier given Singapore’s historical record to arouse suspicion. It seems to stem from a <strong>revision of the way Singapore’s PPP exchange rate is calculated</strong>. This has had the effect of pushing up the value of Singapore’s output. Could it be connected with the fact that our CPI does not track the rise in housing costs accurately? Even if there has been a genuine underestimation of Singapore’s PPP output, the Statistics Department allocation of the change to a single year rather than spreading it out over past years looks fairly dubious.<br><br>The PM goes on to say that the appropriate comparison for Singapore is with other cities. He is absolutely correct. On that basis Singapore’s economic success looks distinctly pedestrian. We <strong>fall out of the top 20 down to number 40 or so in the Brookings Global Metro Monitor </strong>of the top 200. The top positions are all held by American or Nordic cities. However again the PM does not normalize the figure for GDP per hour worked. This would surely push Singapore’s position further down the rankings.<br><br>The PM also says that our real median wages have risen in the last decade. I am not so sure. Firstly, if like Tharman in the Budget speech, he has used income per household member this has not been corrected for changes in the number of dependents per household. Secondly there has been a big rise in the number of new citizens and PRs whose incomes you would expect to be higher than native Singaporeans and who have fewer or no dependents. However I believe the real problem lies with the way housing costs are calculated in the CPI which uses imputed rents. Tharman himself pointed out that this may not be an appropriate measure when most Singaporeans are leaseholders. I wrote about this in “Inflation a Problem? Just Change the Way You Measure It.” <strong>Since HDB properties are leasehold, capital costs strictly should be amortized and included in the calculation of total housing costs.<br></strong><br><strong>An Inclusive Singapore and the Nordic Model<br></strong><br>Just as, not surprisingly,<strong> foreign heads of MNCs are happy to sing the PAP’s praises if a generous tax break or two is tossed their way</strong>, so in the question and answer session that followed this speech we had the usual sycophantic foreigners ready to jump in and say that the freedoms and benefits their countrymen enjoy are not appropriate for Singaporeans.<br><br>When the Danish ambassador says that Singaporeans have decided that the Nordic model does not work for Singapore he should qualify that by saying that Singaporeans have never had a choice. Much as it pains me to say it, the Scandinavian countries also do not support the view that high levels of taxation and an overly generous welfare state destroy incentives to work and innovate. <strong>They have historically been among the top performers in innovation and growing new start-ups and world class companies. This may have something to do with the fact that all of these countries spend more than double what Singapore spends on education as a proportion of GDP.<br></strong><br>PM Lee’s arguments that the Nordic states enjoy many natural advantages over Singapore which allow them to have generous welfare states can easily be refuted. At the very least it can be shown that Singapore has equal and offsetting advantages. <strong>Norway sits on huge oil reserves which Singapore lacks but then the other Nordic states lack oil as well. Much of their land area is frozen and unsuitable for human settlement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are on the periphery of international trade routes whereas Singapore sits in the middle of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.</span></strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Far from being a malarial swamp as LKY would have gullible Westerners believe, Singapore was already the second richest city in Asia after Tokyo at the time of independence.</span></p>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Norway in any case manages its oil reserves, which are of course exhaustible, by transforming them into a permanent stock of capital in the form of its sovereign wealth fund. <strong>The fund, in contrast to our SWFs, is a model of transparency and accountability.</strong> Norwegians know exactly where their fund is invested whereas, as my two open letters to the Finance Minister have shown, Singaporeans are treated like the proverbial mushroom farm.</div>
              <p>Other than saying that the Nordic model was not right for Singapore, the PM spent the rest of this section of his speech trying to show how PAP policies have worked towards a more inclusive Singapore. However I fail to understand how <strong>spending less on education than any major developed country </strong>as a proportion of GDP is “equipping people with the skills and ability to do well for themselves”. Singapore fares poorly on any measure of private sector innovation or new start-ups. Almost all the <strong>growth comes from foreign MNCs lured here by cheap labour </strong>and low tax rates and from the GLCs.<br><br>While welfare spending may have risen marginally it still remains very low as a proportion of GDP, particularly when compared to what we spend on defence. It may just be that the <strong>PAP elite are against greater welfare despite a steadily growing positive net asset position</strong>. However a less charitable explanation is that the <strong>assets are much smaller than we thought and that the money simply is not there.</strong></p>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Instead the PM says that the government has concentrated on raising assets more than incomes. However rather than being a source of uplift the HDB programme has become a means of converting Singaporeans into serfs. It has also historically been <strong>a useful tool in intimidating the people into voting PAP for fear of losing upgrading</strong>. The government has used its <strong>monopoly over the supply of land </strong>to deliberately create a housing bubble which it has further <strong>inflated through immigration and subsidies</strong>. It has cost them nothing but instead boosted their profits from land sales. It is misleading of the PM to boast that households in the lowest quintile have on average over $200,000 of equity in their flats. Firstly they <strong>cannot monetise that equity easily because otherwise they would have nowhere to live</strong>. Secondly if a significant proportion tried to sell at the same time that equity cushion would disappear and quickly become negative just as has happened in the US and Europe. This could happen even faster if Singaporeans wised up to the fact that what they own is a 99 year leasehold property that will revert to the government at the conclusion of the lease.</div>
              <p><strong>Conclusion<br></strong><br>The PM’s speech was shocking on several levels. It showed the PAP are bereft of ideas on how to transform the economy other than continue the same old tired policies of extensive growth. Just as was the case with the Soviet Union, a fear of creative destruction and losing their grip on power will prevent the PAP from taking the steps necessary to foster innovation and new technologies.</p>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Even more alarming were the hints that perhaps the <strong>government’s reserves are not as big as we have been led to believe</strong>. If this is the case will Singaporeans fall into line like the animals in Animal Farm when their dam collapsed and meekly accept they would just have to work harder to rebuild it? It is to be hoped that instead it will finally bring about the democratisation that Singapore so desperately needs if we are to have inclusive prosperity.</div>

My company put up a job ad recently hiring full-time administrative staff at $1,800 monthly (office hours, five day work week, no shift work) looking specifically for Singaporeans. We received a number of inquiries over the phone, but most just want to bargain for higher pay first without making the effort to make a trip down for the interview to discuss the details. We eventually hired two fresh polytechnic graduates. One did not turn up for the on-the-job training without giving a valid reason and another left after two weeks citing a better offer elsewhere.<br>2. One staff who has been working for over a year tried to hold me to ransom for a higher salary via SMS in spite just being given a pay rise of $200 three months earlier. She rejected my offer to negotiate in person and ‘MIA’ the next day without giving a month’s notice.<br>3. Spending time on Facebook, surfing the internet, using the company’s PCs to watch Korean dramas during working hours are commonly observed among some Singaporean workers. Sometimes, they even act blur when I walked into the office as if nothing has happened. Despite repeated warnings by the HR, they persist in their ‘activities’. When one was threatened with the sack, she simply threw all her work aside and walked off without saying the word, disrupting the company’s operations and causing it to make a loss.<br><br>4. Taking MCs and leaves in the last minute without passing their work and responsibilities to fellow colleagues. There were times when they left office early to ‘see’ a doctor only to come back hours later without a valid MC.<br><br>5. Job-hopping: reading the classified ads during working hours, using the company’s phones to call for prospective employers and arranging interviews and giving short notices when leaving the company.<br><br>I could go on and go and I have not stereotyping young Singaporean workers. <strong>While there are some good, motivated and responsible ones around, such workers are the exception rather than the norm.</strong><br><br>We are a home-grown company which employs more than 90 percent Singaporeans. As far as possible, we will try to employ Singaporeans first before foreigners, but with so many difficulties faced in hiring Singaporeans and retaining them for a number of years, we may have no choice to turn to foreigners.<br><br>For those of you in the SME sector, you will know the many constraints we face – many of us struggling to keep afloat in the face of <strong>intense competition from the giant GLCs for the same pool of clients in the small Singapore market. </strong>We would love to offer higher pay for Singaporeans provided they are able to contribute to the company, but if they come with the mindset of just earning quick and easy cash, why should we invest in them?<br><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Young Singaporeans seriously need to wake up their bloody idea </span></span>that they are guaranteed an iron rice-bowl upon stepping into the workforce. When I graduated twenty years ago, I worked seven days a week, 12 – 18 hours each day for five years to earn enough to start my own company. My wife and I saved every single cent we have for our family. We had no car, no paid holidays and no luxurious pursuits or products. Just plain, honest and solid hard work to get to where we are today.</strong><br><br>If you refuse to plant your feet solidly on the ground and <strong>work your socks off</strong>, then don’t expect money to drop from the sky. If you do not have the earning capability, then spend less and don’t splurge on expensive holidays and branded stuff to show off in front of your girlfriends and relatives. And if you do not have the will, hunger and desire to succeed in life, then be prepared to live in mediocrity for the rest of your life.<br>I know I will get flamed for this article, but this is the HARD TRUTH for young Singaporeans – your diploma or degree is only a stepping stone in life, not a fast-track ticket to success. Nobody is going to give you a car, a career and a flat for free. You have to fight hard for them yourselves and you have nobody to blame but yourselves if you fail to make the mark. I am sorry, this is how the real world works outside and you folks seriously need to shape up or get ship out! Lastly, but not the least, please get out of your mama’s shadow, stop whining and start behaving like adults!<br><br><strong>LAM C K</strong> </blockquote></div>
