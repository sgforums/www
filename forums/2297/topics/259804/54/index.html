              Monday, October 12, 2009
              
              May 12, 2009 Tuesday: Indecent proposal
              
              Around midnight on Jalan Besar, I was flagged down by a young woman. She took the back seat and told me in Chinese to go to Hougang. 
              
              She was in her mid or late twenties, wearing a tight, light color, spaghetti string singlet and a pair of denim shorts that were so small they could pass for a pair of underwear. Although this was a pretty common outdoor getup among teenage ladies in Singapore, it was also a standard dress code for bar girls.
              
              I knew because I had one time driven a KTV girl a round trip who was ordered by her boss to go home to change for something â€œappropriateâ€�. She went in jeans and tank top and came back dressed in exactly the same way as this woman now sitting behind me.
              
              Sure enough, the woman told me that she worked in a pub near where I picked her up. Today, she said, the business was very slow. The pub was almost empty for the whole evening. As she didnâ€™t get any chance to sit with customers, she was asked to leave â€œearlyâ€�.
              
              I was not surprised. â€œWhat do you expect on a Tuesday night?â€� I said nonchalantly. â€œWorse still, Jalan Besar isnâ€™t exactly a hotspot for night owls. Maybe you should switch to somewhere with a better location.â€�
              
              She sighed but said nothing in return. I stole a glance at her in the mirror. She looked she had fallen into a sea of unhappy memories. I started to regret the tone I had just used.
              
              After a few moments, she began to tell me that she came to Singapore a couple weeks ago from Fujian, China. She did not know anybody here except a few folks from her hometown. And she could not speak any English. She was able to find a job in this pub only because one of her hometown friends helped her. The job paid peanuts, relying mainly on the handout of the customers, and was very inconvenient to get to by public transport from her place, which she paid $300 a month for a bed in a room she shared with two other girls. She had no choice but to be stuck with both the working and living situations she was blessed with at the moment. She felt she wanted to tell me about it because I was â€œthe first taxi driver from Chinaâ€� she had met, she said. 
              
              I knew too many stories like that. I knew how they came, how they got stuck, and how they were carried away by the murky undercurrent beneath the dazzling glory of this place. I heard them time and again so that I had grown immune to the tormenting feelings generated by them. â€œYes, I know. I know.â€� I muttered to her as much as to myself. 
              
              As I stopped outside her residence, an old condo, the meter showed a fare of $12. She slowly opened her purse while asked me if I could give her some discount. â€œI didnâ€™t get any tips today.â€� She said. â€œI come home empty-handed.â€�
              
              I chewed on it for a moment and said, â€œOkay. $10 will do.â€�
              
              She took out a $10 note from her bag and said, â€œThis is all I have. I give you this I will go hungry tomorrow morning.â€�
              
              â€œI donâ€™t believe you.â€� I said. â€œIt canâ€™t be that bad.â€�
              
              â€œYou can see for yourself.â€� She opened her bag in front of my face and went through the stuff inside. There were keys, some makeup things, a small pack of tissue paper, a phone, and a wallet which contained nothing but some plastic cards. No money. She then patted her pockets, which were set so tightly on her hips that it was obvious thereâ€™s nothing in there.
              
              She leaned forward and placed her elbows on the top of the front seats, and said in an undertone, â€œYou are a nice man. I want to be a friend with you.â€�
              
              I turned and gazed at her. She held my look with a slight smile. I looked away and said, â€œNo matter what you say, you still have to pay for the fare.â€�
              
              â€œI will be your girlfriend.â€� She said softly into my ear. â€œAll you need to do is juâ€¦.â€�
              
              â€œI am an old man and I donâ€™t need a girlfriend.â€� I quickly cut her off.
              
              â€œWrong. Old men especially need girlfriends!â€� She said with laughter.
              
              â€œNo!â€� I turned to her again and said forcefully, â€œI said no! Okay? Just give me the money!â€� 
              
              â€œYou donâ€™t like me?â€� She was startled by my anger and hurriedly took out the $10 and handed it to me. 
              
              I took the money and gave her back a $5 and said, â€œThis should be enough for your breakfast. Now go home.â€�
              
              She accepted the money and gave me a long, steadfast look before she stepped out. 
              
              I felt I was carrying a terrible weight on my heart as I drove away.

              April 2, 2009. Thursday: Out of innocence 
              Shortly after midnight, a young Chinese lady flagged down my taxi on Balestier Road. After I stopped, she lowered her head and peered through the window for a second before opened the door. She came in, sat in the front seat, and told me in Chinese to take her to â€œYou Chiâ€�.â€œYou mean Yew Tee, the oil pond?â€� I asked.â€œNo,â€� she said. â€œYou Chi, the KTV.â€�But I had no knowledge of a KTV in that name. I asked her if she knew where it is and she took out a phone and got somebody on line. â€œLet my landlord speak to you,â€� she said as she passed the phone to me.A man with a hoarse voice at the other end of the line said in English, â€œtake the girl to Orchard KTV in Orchard Tower quickly as you can, and tell her I am waiting here.â€� The tone was bossy and loaded with impatience. I could also hear some noisy music in the background.â€œOkay,â€� I replied.I gave the phone back to the girl, and started heading towards Orchard Tower.The girl appeared to be in her early twenties. She was dressed in jeans and a T shirt, and looked nice and endearing in an innocent kind of way. The fact that she pronounced â€œOrchardâ€� as â€œYou Chiâ€� indicated to me that she was new to the town and could not speak English, which also explained why she checked upon the driver before she got into the taxi. She had to make sure he or she speaks Chinese.On the way, the girl confirmed that she just arrived here three days ago from Fujian, China. She came to Singapore because she believed what she was told by middle agents that she could make money here. â€œThey told me that I can work here in Singapore earning equivalent to at least eight thousands of RMB a month,â€� she said.But it first cost her and her family 60,000 RMB to come. And after she came, she was very much disappointed to know there was no job of 8000 RMB waiting for her. No job at all, in fact.I asked, â€œwhy donâ€™t you just go back?â€�â€œI am stuck,â€� she said moodily. â€œMy family, my parents, are in deep debt now. I have to stay here to find a job to repay the money they borrowed for me.â€�I had heard similar stories before. I sighed privately.But then, her eyes lit up. â€œLuckily, my landlord is a kind man and heâ€™s helping me find a job,â€� she smiled at me. â€œHe has arranged an interview for me tonight. Thatâ€™s where I am going to now. If they like me, I will be working in a KTV as a waitress, as soon as today.â€�â€œI am sure they will like you,â€� I murmured. I started to have a bad feeling about this."It is not something I had in mind, but it will buy me some time.â€� She added, her smile still visible.After a short period of silence, I asked, â€œhow did you know your landlord? I mean, how did you find him?â€�â€œOh, he was introduced to me by the middle agent,â€� she replied glibly.That surely made sense. I nodded to myself.I was again quiet for a while, not sure what to say to her. Towards the end of the trip, I decided to say something which I was certain if I kept to myself I would feel bad for the rest of the night.I told her that during the month of my taxi driving, I drove young and good-looking girls like her from China on several occasions. Some of them, also like her, paid hefty prices, some 50 or 60 thousand RMB, to the middle agents to come to Singapore with the belief that they could work here and make more money than they could in China, only to wake up to the reality that there was no such thing in Singapore, especially the Singapore in its worst economic crisis, after they stepped on this island. The girls I met all ended up selling themselves to Chinese-speaking men, because they, like her, cannot speak any English. â€œYou shouldnâ€™t trust your landlord,â€� I cautioned, â€œas you shouldnâ€™t have trusted your agents, because I think they are in this together. Melons of the same vine.â€�â€œI donâ€™t want to sound overly negative,â€� I added in the end. â€œBut just think about it. Whatâ€™s the odd of getting a normal job in Singapore without being able to speak a single word of English?â€�She had kept her lips compressed into a thin line while she listened. After I was finished, she took a deep breath and said, â€œthanks for telling me all this. I appreciate it. I know how to protect myself.â€�â€œYouâ€™ll need to. It is a jungle out there.â€� I said in earnest.Orchard Tower was aside us now. The huge neon sign board hung on the wall of the building shone on the street below which was still crowded with partygoers at this hour. As the girl handed me with the taxi fare, I noticed that her hand trembled slightly. I knew she was still excited or nervous about the coming â€œinterviewâ€�. I wished her luck as she stepped out of the car.Perhaps she had also stepped out of her innocence. I hoped. - Posted by Cai MingJie 
                
              
              Here's another, that tells of respect for a gentle elderly lady : 
              
              March 31, 2009. Tuesday: An old working lady 
              Late at night, picked up an old lady in Chinatown to go to west coast. I asked her what she was doing at this hour and she said sheâ€™s working. I was surprised, as she looked well over 70. I asked why she had to work late into the night. She told me her story. 
              
              She came to Singapore with her family in 1942 from Sichuan, China, when she was nine. Her husband had passed away some years ago. For some reason, she didnâ€™t live with her children. Instead, she bought a small HDB flat for herself in west coast after her husband died. Because of her age, the flat must be paid up in 10 years. She has to pay over $1000 a month for the mortgage. She didnâ€™t want support from her children because â€œthey have their own flat to pay forâ€�. She earns $50 a day by working in a restaurant as a cook. 
              
              She spoke like a woman who is old but not weak, alone but not forlorn, poor but not without dignity. 
              
              I have a soft spot for people like her. I have more respect for them than those who sit high on the social pyramid and have everything, wealth, power, fame, privilege, or whatever they mean by the term "success", revolve around them. Behind the glorious skyscrapers and ravishing neon lights, thousands and thousands of people in this city live their lives like this old woman. They have nothing outside, but they are strong inside. They live at the bottom of the society, but they are the very foundation of it precisely because of that. Without their strength and endurance, this nation, doesn't matter if it is a first or second world country, and doesn't matter how many gold or silver medals it wins in the Olympics, and doesn't matter how many hundreds of billions in its reserves, will inevitably collapse. 
              
              At the end of the trip, I wanted to discount her fare by half but she insisted in paying the full amount.
