              <p> </p>
              <p>[Singapore] - The PAP Elections Conspiracy Theory</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Heard this from a reliable source amongst the highest echelons of the PAP.</p>
              <p>The PAP was well aware that Aljunied is a risky proposition for them. This was clear even in 2006 and George just scraped through.</p>
              <p>The PAP also knew that this time LTK is going to contest the Aljunied GRC, especially after the electoral boundaries were redrawn. They had factored that in and they knew that Aljunied is a goner in that case. There was apparently considerable thinking to move George to East Coast GRC so that his success is guaranteed. This was mooted by GCT. It carried through the day and apparently George was also sure that he would be moved to East Coast. Suddenly for no apparent reason, Lim Swee Say was moved to East Coast GRC and George was retained at Aljunied. Apparently the decision was taken by LHL, TCH and WKS. No one knows the rationale for that decision. There are 2 theories going around:</p>
              <p>One, they didn’t want to sacrifice Lim Swee Say and wanted a safe seat for him. Second, some sections in the PAP believed that George was gaining international stature (much more than the PM himself) and wanted to cut down his size. He was also considered to be GCT’s man and LHL wanted him out respectably. One should also note that it is only GCT who is making statements supporting George. LHL is conspicuous by his silence on GCT. LKY’s threat to Aljunied residents (leaving residents confused as George himself, while causing more Aljunied residents to be frustrated &amp; vote for Workers’ Party) is actually deliberately sounding the death knell for George (and do S’poreans still think that LKY is old &amp; senile? He's more cunning than ever). So, LKY &amp; LHL wanted George to lose. LTK has questioned the rally attendees that if George is so important to the PAP team, why didn't they let George be removed from Aljunied GRC.</p>
              <p>One can easily observe that there’s enough dissent even within PAP ranks and one just has to wait for Mentor Lee to exit for the dissent to come out in the open. They have given up on Aljunied and Hougang.</p>
              <p>What’s next for George? Could he stand for the coming President election? Or hop on in another high profile job in the civil service? You draw your own conclusion.</p>
              <p>So, you think the PAP are morons??? Think again..</p>
              <p>PAP is using Tin Pei Ling as test-water (as a young candidate). In GE2016, the most exciting moment is the arrival of Li ShengWu (elder son of Lee Hsien Yang), LKY grandson and he should be 28 years old by then to continue the process of dynasty building…</p>
              <p>Other possible candidates in 2016:<br>1. Li HonYi (elder son of LHL/Ho Ching)<br>Li was apparently being groomed for a future leadership role after being awarded a government scholarship to study economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (in 2008). The Singapore military has served as a training ground for political leaders and executives in state companies.</p>
              <p>2. Teo Eng Siang (son of Teo Chee Hean)<br>Singapore pays S$280,825 for tuition for Teo’s son –<br>Teo Eng Siang was awarded a Public Service Commission Scholarship in a public ceremony by his own daddy, Singapore Admiral and Minister Teo Chee Hean. Young Teo now(2008) heads for the United States where he will be attending Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Brown University is a fashionable Ivy Leage school and has a huge annual tuition of US$42,303, or US$169,202 (S$280,825) for the full four years. Don’t you think there are needier students in Singapore?</p>
              <p>3.Warren Mah<br>Warren Mah, son of Mah Bow Tan, Singapore’s Minister for National Development, is living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br>He is on a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is Politics (Singapore Politics i should think), its not as simple as we ordinary folks out there to comprehend precisely. The PAP do have contingency and far-sight plans ahead.</p>

              <p>May 11th, 2011</p>
              <p>Now that the election is over and our government promising to listen and help Singaporeans more, it remind me of my personal experience which had never give me a good impression of the ST Pocket Money Fund by the Straits Times Group which is part of our government machinery.</p>
              <p>I was unemployed for over 2 and half years with 3 children attending school surviving on my wife $900 salary. In 2009, my eldest daughter pleaded with me to apply for the ST fund. I told her that this fund is just another hungry funding mechanism to entice the citizen into donating endlessly. She is not contended with my explanation and hence I submit my application to the FSC at Towner.</p>
              <p>I was asked to attend an interview with my daughter. The officer informed me that besides submitting the income document, they also need to come to my house to interview my wife and other children. She also mentioned I also had to show all bank statement and all other payment default before she can proceed with my application. All this trouble just for asking $50 for 6 months. On the spot, my daughter told me to drop the application and she return home disappointed.</p>
              <p>In the next election, my 2 daughters will be eligible to vote. Base on their personal experience, do you think they will vote for the PAP who promise the moon?</p>
              <p>In conclusion, please help to inform to all around you to stop donating to ST Pocket Money Fund. Instead encourage them to donate to other religious group or other charities who are much more sincere and forthcoming in helping the needy. Besides, let stop this huge fund before it end up like our NKF, Ren Ci and next….</p>

              <p><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/sex-drug-parties-pore-chalets-054402765.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #500080;">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/sex-drug-parties-pore-chalets-054402765.html</span></span></a></p>
              <p>While it is usual to see teenagers in Singapore gathering in chalets for barbecues or birthday celebrations, some of their peers get together only to engage in sex and drug parties.</p>
              <p>Once intoxicated after a cocktail of alcohol and illegal drugs, some of these teens, which include girls as young as 14, engage in sexual intimacy -- from heavy petting to intercourse.</p>
              <p>It is understood that such chalets stays are organised by some members of gangs in Singapore, and that they are getting more common.</p>
              <p>An 18-year-old former gangster who wanted to be known as John told The New Paper, "We would tell our parents that we were going for a barbecue, but we didn't even take any charcoal or chicken wings with us."</p>
              <p>While he had attended such sex-and-drug orgies twice, John — who left the gang last year after he was arrested for theft — claimed that he has not taken part in such vices.</p>
              <p>"I don't do drugs, so I would go home when the rest got too 'high' and became violent or started taking their clothes off," said John, adding that most of the gang members at these parties were in their teens.</p>
              <p>Speaking in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien, John described the girls who take part in the parties as either "lor kway" (Hokkien for streetwalker) or some of them "ah dai" (fools).</p>
              <p>The former are girls considered to have loose morals, while "ah dai" refers to newbies who attend the chalet parties without knowing that drugs and sex are involved.</p>
              <p>As they were under the influence of drugs such as ketamine and "ice", some of the teens have no recollection of their experiences the night before.</p>
              <p>The parties would usually have more males than females, said former gangsters. Such situations occasionally lead to several men sharing one woman and can even result in gang rape.</p>
              <p>When morning comes, they pack their bags and check out of their unit. The guys may go through the same routine a few months later with new girls, or "fresh meat" as they are called.</p>
              <p>A 28-year-old former gang member turned social worker, who wanted to be known as Peter, said he has not seen such a gang rape before, but he has heard of four or five such incidents among his former circle of friends.</p>
              <p>"It is not just happening in chalets...such activities can also take place in pub shophouses or in the homes of the gang members," he added.</p>
              <p>However, John pointed out that not all chalet outings organised by his gangster friends involved sex and drugs.</p>
              <p>Parents to be blamed?</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, social workers said they have counseled those who have engaged in such vices as part of their gang activities.</p>
              <p>Those involved may not necessarily come from broken or low-income families, a common stereotype in the past, they said. But they noted that such teens usually suffer from an emotional emptiness at home.</p>
              <p>"Some parents give too little affection and neglect their children because they are busy, while others give too much attention because they are authoritative," said Faith Png, 39, a social worker with YouthReach.</p>
              <p>"Both will drive their children to seek freedom and love outside of the family and sometimes, the children befriend gangsters."</p>
              <p>Executive director of Singapore Children's Society Alfred Tan, 50, blamed the media's portrayal of casual sex and easy access to pornography as resulting in the country's youth to become more promiscuous than in the past.<br>"This is a worrying trend as there may be peer pressure to have sex. Instead of being harsh to their children, parents should get to know their friends," he told TNP.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, chalet operators said that they have not come across sex-and-drug-parties on their premises.</p>
              <p>Manager of Goldkist Beach Resort at East Coast Park Vikas Gupta, 22, said that the management has not encountered any such incidents thus far.</p>
              <p>Steven Tang, director of Costa Sands Resort — which has two outlets in Pasir Ris and one in Sentosa — echoed the same thing, adding that it has always been its practice to increase security presence during peak hours.</p>
              <p>"It has always been our practice to step up our security presence during our peak periods, such as the June school holidays, to deal with the additional visitors," he said.</p>
              <p>The frequency of security patrols in GoldKist Beach Resort will also increase by 50 percent during peak periods, said Vikas.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to have sex with children under the age of 16. If the victims are between 12 and 14 years old, it is considered statutory rape and offenders can be jailed up to 20 years and fined or caned.</p>
              <p>If the victim is above 14 but below 16, offenders can be jailed up to five years and fined $10,000 for carnal connection. The maximum penalty for rape is 20 years' jail with possible caning.</p>

The last robber, an obese robber, cocked-up the robbery operation as he was too heavy to climb over the fence (see video), forcing them to abort, and possibly saving the lives of the victims (it appears at least one of the robbers were armed with a gun).</p>

              <p>Excerpt from :<br><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_63.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_63.htm</span></span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On February 20, 1954, President Dwight David Eisenhower was in Palm Springs. He is scheduled to hold a press conference but cancels it at the last minute. His press secretary advises the media that he has a tooth ache and can not appear. In reality, he was whisked away to Muroc Air Force Base (later known as Andrews).</p>
              <p>On the runways of the air base, along with his military advisors and a select few civilians, the President watched as a detail of several extra-terrestrial ships approached. For the next few moments, the saucer-like disks performed a series of maneuvers that both stunned and surprised each of the on-lookers. With a final demonstration of invisibility and 'space-skipping', the ships suddenly came to a halt.</p>
              <p>As the President's contingency continued to watch, from seemingly nowhere, a door opened in the closest disk and an intimidating figure moved forward.<br>The grey Being is nearly six feet tall. His head is an oddity, it is very large and possesses two large black eyes that dominate his face. His nose is large, his mouth, ears and chin disproportionately small.</p>
              <p>As he moves forward, he reaches into a small box on his chest. He removes something from the box and with a simple gesture, begins to communicate with the President's party.</p>
              <p>The Being identifies himself as KRLL, an emissary from another planet. KRLL advises the President that his people have been watching Earth for quite some time. Though their race cannot comprehend our animalistic behavior, they are, nonetheless, impressed with human beings.</p>
              <p>KRLL explains to the President that they are impressed, astounded, with the genetic make-up of humans. Humans are hardy and surprisingly adaptable. In addition, they are an extraordinary species capable of living and breathing in an atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen, a poisonous gas.</p>
              <p>KRLL has been instructed by his people to come to Earth and examine human beings, returning with samples of genetic cellular material. In exchange, he is authorized to offer flying disk technology and disintegration light weaponry to the leadership of Earth. It is their hope to identify and isolate the genetic cellular materials which may help their own race become stronger.</p>
              <p>KRLL continues, explaining that they come from a dying world and hope to integrate both our genetic materials and theirs to create a hybrid race which will allow them to endure.</p>
              <p>The President is horrified. It is inconceivable to him that he could permit human beings to be dissected...for any reason! He immediately refuses the offer.</p>
              <p>The tall alien responds. He assures the President that no harm will come to any human being examined. All individuals selected will undergo electronic 'nerve-disconnect'. They will feel no pain.</p>
              <p>In addition, they will have their memories disconnected, thus preventing any trauma to their psyche. As further precaution, they will be implanted with 'screen memories', a technique which will mask any memories of the incident, creating the illusion that any memory that might resurface is just a dream.</p>
              <p>Individuals selected for examination will be taken only under the most discreet situations, the major populace will not be aware of the abductions. Those who are removed will be returned to the same location they were taken from, they will have no memory of the event, only missing time.</p>
              <p>The President is still unconvinced. Examination of any human being without their approval or knowledge seems to be a violation of their privacy and rights. He again refuses. His military advisers argue in favor of the Treaty. Debate and forced quiet arguments continue. Finally, one General makes a point that decides the issue. If the alien's offer is refused... how would Mankind prevent the abductions from occurring anyway?</p>
              <p>The President can see no alternative.</p>
              <p>He asks for one additional consideration to be part of the agreement: a group of human medical advisors will take part in every examination. They will observe all clinical procedures and will be given unrestricted access to any and all aspects of the abduction process. They will report any violations to both humans and aliens. Any such violations will terminate the Treaty. The alien agrees. <br><br>The pact is known as the Tri-lateral Treaty. It has an unparalleled impact on the affairs of the globe. On behalf of planet Earth, the President of the United States, undeniably the most powerful man in world affairs, has extended an invitation for the lizards, now known as the 'GREYS', to participate in our world's development.</p>
              <p>The President requests the formation of an alien supervisory board. Some reports list its name as MJ-12, others assign it a different name. Its task is to monitor all the abductions and report back to the President.</p>
              <p>Two underground bases are planned. The first will be a large facility for United States military to use to develop and become familiar with UFO technology and weaponry. This base is built below a gunnery range north of Las Vegas.</p>
              <p>It is variously called Area 51 and Dreamland. The second base is built utilizing the caverns under the Four Corners area, near a small town called Dulce. it is to be used by aliens for the examination of their human abduction subjects.</p>

              <p>Legacy of Chernobyl: Voices of Pripyat</p>
              <p>Ray Madrigal (California, USA) is seeking support in going ahead with "Legacy of Chernobyl: Voices of Pripyat", a film project that aims to spread international awareness about the risks of nuclear reactors. A nuclear accident will always be a very real risk, and will have widespread, devastating, irrepairable consequences for everyone across the planet. This isn't someone else's problem, because this is our planet.</p>

              <p><em>Posted by a young female Singaporean graduate on CNA forum, but CNA soon deleted her post :</em></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yi Zhu Liew posted :</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br><br>Hi Mr Goh, I read your comment in ST actually but decided to come and post here to give you a perspective.</span><span style="color: red;"><br><br>This is really from my heart because my family wouldn't want any of this out here in this way</span><span style="color: black;">.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><br></span>All my family members had voted for PAP throughout every single election. My grandmother was highly active in the women's wing from its formation till her death and had nothing but good words to say about its leaders and their dedication. We grew up hearing those stories.<br><br>I can say my household are white collared folks - well, originally at least! </span><span style="color: red;"><br><br></span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">My mum got retrenched in 2009 after working almost 30 years for the same bank</span><span style="color: red;">.</span><span style="color: black;"> Right after retrenchment aged in her late 50s, she cannot find any other job. It's almost heartbreaking seeing her waking up every morning at 8am and faithfully sending out PDFs</span><span style="color: black;"> after PDFs </span><span style="color: black;">(yes, she is PC-literate and had to learn so much of the gizmos on her own) to any employer that she can find on the newspapers, online etc. She had even signed up for e2i, NTUC , NE district..whatever.<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">NTUC in particular, held a job matching programme and told her to turn up at 10am but saw her only at 5pm..<span style="font-weight: bold;">for almost the whole day, she sat there not daring to leave just in case she loses her place in the queue, not eating lunch</span>. Unfortunately, it resulted in nothing.</span><br style="color: #0000ff;"><br>All that she has yet to do is probably go and see the MP. So for 2 years now, that's her routine.</span><span style="color: red;"><br><br></span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">Initially, she came across adverts put up by hospitals for patient admin clerks..she applied for that but heard nothing from them. <em>When she went to the same hospital for her medical appointment, she saw Filipinos manning the very same counter for which the job advert was placed and upon enquiring, found out they were recruited +/- the same time as she had applied.</em></span><span style="color: red;"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">What are we to think?</span><span style="color: black;"> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The only job she could find was a data entry clerk - and this, </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">we are talking of an ex-VP of a bank</span><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> So she swallowed her humble pie and took it. To her horror, the </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">supervisor of the data entry pool is a Filipino! </span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #1c1c1c;">What's happening here?!?!</span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;"> </span><span style="color: black;">You mean to say there are no Singaporeans who are able to work as a Supervisor? I think therein, </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">my mother felt betrayed</span><span style="color: black;"> and if she doesn't, I would feel so on her behalf. </span><span style="color: #0080ff;">Regardless, she ploughed on. This as a contract staff with no benefits whatsoever such as medical leave (something that's so basic).<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>When she has the flu, a cough, whatever, she worries for her daily-rated job. </span><span style="color: black;"><br><br>I've told her to give up, don't do cos it's so </span><span style="color: red;">miserly- $4/hr</span><span style="color: black;">, but she says, she doesn't know what else to do and if she doesn't work, she would really be very bored. For your added benefit, </span><span style="color: red;">this job was found not thru' any of the aid agencies but on her own.</span><span style="color: black;"> Even so, it's nothing secure. The projects come and go for a few weeks. A sprinkling here and a little there. By the time she takes the bus and MRT to her workplace, I really don't know why she bothers.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;">Are we the only ones suffering like that? </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;">No...my mother also had her peers who were similarly retrenched by the same bank. They too, have found jobs such as night-time taxi driver, food court supervisor (sounds nice but it is actually i/c of clearing tables and spit).</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #1c1c1c;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: red;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #1c1c1c;">Why are things like that happening?</span><span style="color: black;"> I am sorry for this long rant here but </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">I hope that you do not sugar coat what is happening,</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #1c1c1c;"> </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">the painful examples that abound.</span><span style="color: red;"> </span><span style="color: black;">So maybe my mother is now the 420,001th blue-collared worker but she at least, would hope that </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">maybe what Mr Tan says has merit so she can continue to work in the capacity that she has trained for.<br></span><span style="color: black;"><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">BTW, </span></span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">this is not about money</span> - she had left the bank with compensation, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000; font-style: italic;">but it's about your sense of worth as a human being</span>...sometimes u wonder if all u are capable for is clearing a plate on the table or punching in mindless numbers</span><span style="color: red;">.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">Therein lies the daily torture</span><span style="color: black;">. I am finding my feet in the working world but now, </span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">I worry a lot about my own future. After a degree and all this, don't tell me one fine day I have to eat the same humble pie and settle for something beyond mediocre? Also</span><span style="color: black;">, we have nothing against foreigners per se, so don't get me wrong. We just think that somewhere along the way</span><span style="color: #1c1c1c;">, a particular govt policy is to be blamed for our predicament. </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">Don't you think so</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">?</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">Why don't you just seriously read what Mr Tan [Jee Say] had taken pains to write, contrast it with what your cabinet has set out..find a middle path maybe? Rather than dismiss it immediately like that as something without merit. Please reconsider.</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Thank you and so sorry once again for the length of this post. <br></span></p>

              <p>Some of these stunts are awfully dangerous, and shouldn't be attempted by amateurs. But when executed exquisitely by professional or expert sportsmen, dancers and martial artists, you really gotta respect and admire the Atheletism of the Human Body.</p>

              <p>The level of violence in such bullying incidents, including the one depicted in this video, is certainly nothing compared to say, the daily ongoing atrocities in Africa (google "Congo rape"). Nonetheless it is indicative of the psychological illnesses present in many humans (not just youths). Some aspects of human society may have changed since the dark ages, some unfortunately still remain.</p>

              <p>I am surprised that Singaporeans do not know of such China national’s agressiveness and gangsterism. I am sure the plain cloth police (detectives) and undercovers covering Chinatown (Pearls Centre area) and Geylang know alot of such abuses against Singaporean, not only Malays.</p>
              <p>I was having coffee at a coffee shop (in one of the HDB flats along food court/Yei Hwa emporium) opposite the Court when a Singaporean had a quarrel with a Chinese national. Thereafter the Chinese national walked away. The coffee shop server came over and told the Singapore boy to move off as he knew the China national had gone to get his gang to beat him up. Soon enough after the Singaporean left, a gang of China nationals turned up, some holding what seems like stick wrapped in newspaper. Seeing that their target has left, they also left.</p>
              <p>I also know of Chinese workers who became sub-sub-contractor working in Singapore. They are able to charge low rates because they ‘import’ their own relatives to work for them in Singapore. How they do it I dont know. But I was told the China national boss would pay all the legal levies but pay all their relatives salary slightly better than their pay in China to stay compeitive. Whether this is breaking the law or not, I dont know but I know this is how they are so competitive.</p>
              <p>I just don’t understand why I as a Singapore citizen, can sometime feel like second class citizen. But that is the truth.</p>

              <p>PostPosted: Mon Jun 27, 2011 6:59 pm <br>Young couple hacked by teens at Hougang<br><br>Shin Min Daily News - 1 hr 44 mins ago<br>A 20-year-old man and a 19-year-old girl were attacked last night at about 10.35pm when they were sitting at the void deck of Blk 504, Hougang Ave 8. At the time, they were sitting some stone benches and chatting.<br><br>According to a resident, Mdm Chen, 63, who lives on the fourth floor, she looked out the window to see what was going on as it was very noisy at the void deck. She saw three youths, among them, a man was scolding a couple loudly using Hokkien vulgarities. The three got into a fight and the aggressive man attacked the couple with a knife.<br><br>The couple tried to escape the knife-wielding man by running from the void deck to a nearby carpark. A 50-metre-long trail of blood was left at the scene, marking the escape the injured couple had taken.<br><br>The girl is said to be badly injured, having sustained deep wounds to her shoulder. Her wounds were so deep her bare bones were visible. The injured couple has since been treated at a hospital.</p>

              <p>Watch the video. The text in the video is reproduced below.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OpglZVe2fg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OpglZVe2fg</a></p>
              <p><br>AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL MANKIND from Thommo <br>Please Help Me</p>
              <p>I am thommo and I am a human being. I write this open request for help to all other human beings on this beautiful planet we share. The world that I am currently living in appears to be broken. It’s not irreparable, but it is not far off. That’s why I need every one to help me.</p>
              <p>In my world, all the resources are used for the financial gain of big corporations and a greedy few that control them. They hold power over the governments in my world and none of them are interested in the needs of their people, in fact, many of them are actively trying to get rid of us. Also in my world, the people are very sick. Unfortunately all our scientists are trained by and have their research paid for by the big corporations. They no longer strive to make life better for us all, merely to make more money. They create cures and then invent the illness. They no longer look to prevent disease, they look to ‘treat’ it, prolonging the suffering and maximising the revenue stream. They tamper with the genetics of our crops ‘for the good of mankind’ as if mankind and nature didn’t have it pretty well sorted already! Soon all our food will be genetically modified and so will we. Our scientists keep quiet when harmful chemicals and drugs are added to our food and water because if they spoke out they would lose their funding. Our power needs are based on dangerous nuclear power and resource wasting fossil fuels. We have the technology in my world to produce all our power through renewable resources such as solar and geothermal. There is little money in free energy so the corporations block the scientists from finding ways to utilise it for the good of us all. I need your help to set the scientists in my world free so that they can do what they are supposed to.</p>
              <p>In my world, engineers that could build for the future of our kind are not allowed to. Instead they are required to build what they are told by the greedy corporations. Profit is more important than function and quality. Transport systems and networks are dangerous and out of date. Our engineers cannot use the technologies developed by our scientists for anything other than war. There is a lot of money to be made out of war in my world. These two sets of people together could transform it if they were allowed to without causing the mass destruction of our precious planet. All that stops them from working together for all our benefit is the handful of human beings that control the governments and corporations, and they like my world the way it is and don’t want it to change.</p>
              <p>Many of the people in my world are controlled by belief systems that they have been brainwashed into believing. Deep down in their hearts they know they are controlled, but they are unable to escape. They are bombarded day in and day out by rules and regulations that they must follow. Their religions indoctrinate them with one set of rules they must follow, the corporations indoctrinate them with another which often causes conflict. Television programmes are exactly that, programmes subconsciously altering our state of mind and entering new beliefs without our knowledge. Our music now indoctrinates our children with perverse messages designed to corrupt and entrap them in a sub human existence. The people have been divided and view each other by the colour of their skin, their wealth and social standing and the part of the planet they were born on. They are divided by the politics that is forced on them by the corrupt governments and corporations. They no longer see each as equal human beings, and I need your help to wake them up.</p>
              <p>Fear is the emotion most people in my world feel every day. Fear of what they will ‘lose’ if they don’t keep up their mortgage payments or pay the loans and credit cards bills. Fear that they won’t earn enough money to pay for their children’s state controlled education. Fear that they will ‘lose’ their jobs if they don’t perform better and put the company before their own families. They are the lucky ones! People in my world also experience hunger, not knowing if they will eat from day to day. They fear that their children will die of preventable diseases, caught from contaminated dirty water. They fear that in times of drought there will be no help that reaches them from their brother human beings no matter how much we give to charity. Fear that they will be killed in a war against an imaginary enemy, that could ‘appear’ anywhere in the world. Fear that soldiers from another land that don’t speak the same language will see them as an enemy because they have been programmed to believe that they are. Fear that their whole families will be instantly destroyed by an unseen attacker as they sleep in their beds, whilst a teenage soldier thinks he is playing a video game as he pulls the trigger that creates the fear. There is also the fear of dying. The way the governments and corporations treat the human beings in my world, for many that will be the end of their working life. Fear is a very negative emotion when it used as a control mechanism and it stops the people in my world from making positive change. Can you help the people in my world dispel the fear?</p>
              <p>In my world the people have been lead to believe that money is the most important thing in their lives. That without it we could not function. This is an illusion that has been created by the wealthy corporations and the governments they control. If the people in my world knew that it was all a massive deception to keep them operating as slaves for the benefit of their masters, they would break free and restore the world back to its natural balance of peace and harmony. They would very quickly learn that we can all work together for the benefit of all mankind without the need for money and the slavery it creates. They would soon learn that money is the barrier to progress, not the result of it and would so learn to cooperate to maintain society the way it should be. The money control mechanism is rooted so deeply into the subconscious that people in my world say they would not bother working if there was no money in it. But there is still hope!</p>
              <p>I need your help to make the people of my world understand that they are better than that. To understand that they can achieve amazing outcomes just by the power of thought.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned previously, my world is currently ravaged by wars. In the last 60 years in my world roughly 20 million people have died as a result of war, however, no politicians or ‘rulers’ have died in these wars. Only the poor that join up as a last resort die, not to mention the poor people that are invaded. Please help me to end the wars in my world. Violence is not the route to peace and love, it is the route to anger, hate and mistrust.</p>
              <p>All I ask from you is that you imagine my world the way it should be. Imagine that it is peaceful, no wars at all. Imagine that it is balanced and only what is really needed is taken from nature as we learn to live in harmony with the world. Please imagine my world with no hunger. Imagine that no human being goes without the love that they need. Imagine that money does not exist and that the wealthy have no mechanism to divide and rule my world. Imagine that all human beings in my world work together to create paradise for all to enjoy. Please spend a few minutes a day imagining what I ask and my world will surely change for the better. You may even notice that there are things in your world that are not right and need changing. If you change what is wrong in your world, my world will also be changed for the better. There are nearly 7 billion people in my world and we are all equal. I believe that my world will change for the better, and I thank those of you that chose to help me change my world. All it takes is a little bit of empathy and compassion. Maybe that will be the reason that you pass my letter on to all the human beings that you know, so that they may decide whether or not to help me change my world and yours in the process.</p>
              <p>Thank you,<br>__________________<br>Peace, love &amp; respect</p>

              <p>Day off for my maids resulted in sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
              <p>We have two maids in our household , our children are still young and we stay in a semi-D . As both husband and wife are working , we had no choice but to be dependant on our maids to take care of the kids and housework. Our maids are given day offs twice a month , one is Indonesia and the other is Filipina. Our reason for having two different races is to ensure that they dont get too close to cause mischief .</p>
              <p>The postman ,news vendor and some foreign workers are often passing our house and we did not suspect much until one of our maids started to behave suspiciously . She was having mood swings and very irritable, often complaining about her Filipina companion that is not doing her work and she has to work more. I questioned the Filipina and soon there is a "war" between them .</p>
              <p>Then I suddenly found out something very frightening , the Filipina confided in me that a dark skin foreign worker has been visiting my house 2 or 3 times a week and he will stay in the maid's room for a few hours each time! Although they have an agreement not to spill the beans because both maids are having some dark secrets, their unhappiness with each other prompted the Filipina to make the first move to report on the Indonesian.She further told me that the Indonesian has been asking her for medical advice to stop an itch around her genitals but she could only refer her to consult a doctor.</p>
              <p>I almost panic as she is the one cooking for my kids and any form of sexually transmitted disease in her may affect my children. I confronted her to find out about her illness and she knew her Filipina friend has given her away, in between sobs she took the opportunity to report that the Filipina is also no angel and she was meeting her boy friends at short time hotels on off days too.that drove me crazy , I called for the Filipina and the whole situation became chaotic . They hit each other without pulling any punches and the Indonesian accused her of making money through the men she slept with.</p>
              <p>I lost my patience and brought them back to the agent to cancel their permits , the agent rebuked me for not taking his advice that I should not allow off-days but instead pay them in lieu. He has his reasons which I did not listen as I was more concern with the maids' well being and agreed to off-days for them to have their own time for relaxation. Never did I once imagine that the day off is for them to engage in meeting strangers and making more money through sexual services. I was also shocked to hear from the Filipina that on week-ends , all budget hotels are fully booked for the whole day by these migrant workers .</p>
              <p>From this experience, I pay my new maids in lieu of off-days and there is no fear of them getting into contact with men on the prowl.</p>
