              <p>The New Paper<br>Tuesday, Feb 21, 2012 <br>This ex-model targets married tycoons for their money.</p>
              <p>Her coup? Getting one to divorce his wife and marry her</p>
              <p>He's not handsome. Never mind. He's married. So what?</p>
              <p>What matters most is that he's rich and, given his social status, he has the potential to be her ticket to the high life.</p>
              <p>And indeed she did have it all.</p>
              <p>A short fling - lasting about six months - with the "stout and ugly" business tycoon opened the right doors for this former model.</p>
              <p>The Singaporean is now happily married to another business tycoon, whom she met through her former lover.</p>
              <p>Ms T, who agreed to this interview on the condition that we do not name her, says: "You can call me a gold-digger, I don't care.</p>
              <p>"I got my man and, along with it, the lifestyle that I desire. I am happy."</p>
              <p>Ms T, who is in her early 30s, admits that it took careful planning before she "deliberately 'accidentally' bumped" into her former lover.</p>
              <p>She says: "I knew he had a weakness for girls who are way taller than him and I am, by one head."</p>
              <p>But to ensure that she caught his eye at a private function at Velvet Underground, she bought a pair of three-inch stilettoes.</p>
              <p>She spent two weeks working in the gym and going for spa treatments - from facials to manicures, and even luxurious soaks.</p>
              <p>Ms T, who had secured the invitation through her modelling agency, invested in a $2,000 branded dress that was "both sexy and sweet".</p>
              <p>She says: "Before you expect the man to pamper you, you must pamper yourself. "That's the basic rule that women, when they become wives, forget."</p>
              <p>Ms T clucks disapprovingly, then adds: "When you turn into a 'huang lian po' (loosely translated as 'sallow-faced woman'), do you think your husband will want to take a second look at you?"</p>
              <p>Men, she insists, are "ruled first by their genitals, then their hearts".</p>
              <p>She laughs mockingly, then adds: "Don't expect love without the lust. It comes with a price."</p>
              <p>Three months into her affair with her former lover, Ms T realised that "he was not ever going to leave his equally rich wife".</p>
              <p>She says: "He doted on me and showered me with lavish gifts, but it soon became clear that I'd never be the No. 1."</p>
              <p>While he was generous with gifts, he was stingy with cash, she adds.</p>
              <p>"It's like, you can get him to buy you stuff but don't expect him to hand over cold, hard cash."</p>
              <p>That was when Ms T started to plan her escape route - with an option that would lead to "another pot of gold".</p>
              <p>She soon set her eyes on a "younger and better-looking" businessman - albeit not as rich. "He was good enough for me," she said.</p>
              <p>But she hit a slight snag: He was married, with a young child.</p>
              <p>Says Ms T: "I was irritated because I was less confident of turning the situation in my favour.</p>
              <p>"Also, it was known in social circles that he was a reasonably decent man, which meant that my chances were much slimmer."</p>
              <p>Not that she was about to give up.</p>
              <p>Ms T declined to provide the full details as she didn't want to "create the unnecessary impression" that she does not love her husband, should he chance upon this report.</p>
              <p>Suffice it to say, she succeeded in snaring the man. He proposed to her in 2008.</p>
              <p>She says: "Once I managed to convince him that we are very much in love with each other, the rest was easy."</p>
              <p>But when her husband's divorce threatened to turn messy, Ms T approached the ex-wife.</p>
              <p>And here is another trick that she says "all wives should learn".</p>
              <p>She says: "Don't be dumb. When love is gone, don't hang onto it like an idiot.</p>
              <p>"Cut your losses and get out quickly, and if the man can afford it, make sure you get as much out of the break-up as you can."</p>
              <p>And that was the point that Ms T drove home during her discussion with the ex-wife, she claims.</p>
              <p>"It was easier because she wanted custody of their child - and I made good my promise to her that she'd get it," says Ms T.</p>
              <p>Now that she is married to the man who once cheated on his wife, she says she's smart enough to make the right moves.</p>
              <p>"I give him enough freedom to do what he wants.</p>
              <p>"But I won't ever be stupid to let him get too close to any gold-diggers," she adds.</p>
