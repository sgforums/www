              <p>I love her but I'm just too shy</p>
              <p><br>10th grade</p>
              <p>As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to me. She was my so called "best friend". I stared at her long, silky hair, and wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before and handed them to her. She said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>11th grade</p>
              <p>The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears, mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes, wishing she w as mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me, said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>Senior year</p>
              <p>The day before prom she walked to my locker. "My date is sick" she said; he's not going to go well, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates, we would go together just as "best friends". So we did. Prom night, after everything was over, I was standing at her front door step! I stared at her as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but she isn't think of me like that, and I know it. Then she said "I had the best time, thanks!" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>Graduation Day</p>
              <p>A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before I could blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and cried as I hugged her. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder and said, "you're my best friend, thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>A Few Years Later</p>
              <p>Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting married now. I watched her say "I do" and drive off to her new life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn`t see me like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away, she came to me and said "you came!". She said "thank s" and kissed me on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>Funeral</p>
              <p>Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my "best friend". At the service, they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years. This is what it read: <br>I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesn't notice me like that, and I know it. I want to tell him, I want him to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love him but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me! <br>I wish I did too... I thought to my self, and I cried.</p>

              <p>[Singapore] - Singapore's scholarship offers to China <em>is increasingly becoming a sore political issue against the government. Unlike all other countries who look after their own citizens first, Singaporeans feel increasingly marginalized, not least of all by foreigners who take up generous scholarship offers, but decline to return the favour at the end of it all.</em></p>
              <p>*Xin Ping (not her real name) was born to a small humble family in the <br>industrial city of **Liaoyang** (**è¾½é˜³**) (picture left) in **Liaoning** ** <br>province** of **China**. ** <br>**Her parents were civil servants and they lived in a small cramped <br>apartment on the outskirts of the city. <br>Xin Ping might have followed the footsteps of her parents if not for one <br>fateful day – a friend persuaded her to accompany her to attend a seminar <br>conducted by MOE officials from **Singapore** in the provincial capital of * <br>*Shenyang** (**æ²ˆé˜³**). <br>“The **Singapore** officials were very nice and friendly. <br>They said they are coming to recruit college students to study in ** <br>Singapore** universities and we were told we would be well taken care of. <br>I was very impressed by what I heard and I signed up my interest.” <br>After passing a pre-admission test and two rounds of interview, Xin Ping <br>was on the plane to **Singapore** after being awarded an undergraduate <br>scholarship to study Chemical Engineering at the **National** **University**of <br>**Singapore**. <br>To her surprise, a fellow classmate who topped her class was not given an <br>‘exit permit’ to leave **China** despite being given the same scholarship. * <br>* <br>**“I learnt later that he went on to study in **Qinghua** **University** (** <br>æ¸…**å�Žå¤§å­¦**). ** <br>**The (Chinese) government barred the top students and athletes from <br>leaving the country.” <br>Life was tough in the beginning for Xin Ping, exacerbated by the fact that <br>it was the first time she went abroad alone and separated from her parents. <br>She spoke little English as she started to learn the language only in <br>middle school. <br>She was put up with other scholars from the same batch with a foster family <br>in Sembawang before the school term began. <br>“The six month English preparatory course was very tough. We have to pass <br>an English proficiency test before we can study in NUS.” <br>Though Xin Ping was handicapped by her English proficiency, she did well <br>enough to breeze through her four years in NUS and graduated with First <br>Class Honors. <br>She did not have to pay for her tuition fees and was given a generous <br>living allowance. <br>Upon graduation, she found a well-paying job with a MNC in the <br>petrochemical industry. <br>“The Singapore government sent me an invitation to apply for PR three <br>months after I started work which I did for a matter of convenience and <br>also because I need to travel to and fro from China to visit my parents. <br>A year later, I was invited to become a **Singapore** citizen and after <br>much deliberation, I decided otherwise.” <br>While Xin Ping has spent nearly ten years of her life in **Singapore**, she <br>did not feel a sense of belonging here though she readily admits that <br>Singaporeans are one of the most ‘friendly’ people she ever met. <br>“**Singapore** is a great city. The people are nice, the streets are safe <br>and the government is efficient, but my roots are back in **China**. <br>That’s where my homeland is.” Upon completion of her bond, Xin Ping applied <br>to be transferred to **Beijing** to be closer to her family. <br>Two years later, she left to start her own company and is now a mother of <br>two. <br>“**China** is fast catching up with **Singapore**. Twenty years ago, there <br>isn’t even a Mac’s in **Liaoyang**. <br>Now we have Carrefour, Walmart…people are flocking to **China**. This is <br>where the money is.” Does she miss **Singapore**? <br>Yes, she said, especially the cuisine and her **Singapore** friends with <br>whom she still keeps in touch on Facebook where she learnt about the Sun Xu <br>saga and contacted us. <br>“I am not defending Sun Xu – he probably wrote those harsh words in a fit <br>of anger. <br>The truth is – most Chinese adapted well in **Singapore** and they are <br>grateful to **Singapore** for giving them the opportunity to succeed in <br>life. <br>I won’t be where I am today without **Singapore**. Being bilingual is a <br>great asset in doing business in **China** nowadays.” <br>When asked why she did not express her gratitude to **Singapore** by <br>taking up citizenship, she paused for a while before replying: <br>“Singapore is like a very rich man in hot pursuit of a girl, showering her <br>with expensive gifts everyday, but the girl’s heart is with somebody else <br>and while she may accept his gifts, she will not be together with him, just <br>like me, my heart is with China, my fatherland. <br>It’s a fact which cannot be changed. I will forever be thankful to ** <br>Singapore**, but gratitude is not love.” <br><br>Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education &amp; Ministry of Law Ms <br>Sim Ann revealed recently in Parliament that the **Singapore** government <br>spends some $36 million dollars on scholarships to over two thousand <br>foreign students each year, <br>or about S$174,000 per scholar. <br>The percentage of foreign scholars who leaves **Singapore** for good yearly <br>like Xin Ping is not known.* <br>****</p>

                  for one<br> fateful day – a friend persuaded her to accompany her to attend a
                  seminar<br> conducted by MOE officials from **Singapore** in the provincial
                  capital of *<br> *Shenyang** (**æ²ˆé˜³**).<br> “The **Singapore** officials were very nice and friendly.<br> They said they are coming to recruit college students to study in
                  **<br> Singapore** universities and we were told we would be well taken
                  care of.<br> I was very impressed by what I heard and I signed up my
                  interest.”<br> After passing a pre-admission test and two rounds of interview, Xin
                  Ping<br> was on the plane to **Singapore** after being awarded an
                  undergraduate<br> scholarship to study Chemical Engineering at the **National**
                  **University**of<br> **Singapore**.<br> To her surprise, a fellow classmate who topped her class was not
                  given an<br> ‘exit permit’ to leave **China** despite being given the same
                  scholarship. *<br> *<br> **“I learnt later that he went on to study in **Qinghua**
                  **University** (**<br> æ¸…**å�Žå¤§å­¦**). **<br> **The (Chinese) government barred the top students and athletes
                  from<br> leaving the country.”<br> Life was tough in the beginning for Xin Ping, exacerbated by the
                  fact that<br> it was the first time she went abroad alone and separated from her
                  parents.<br> She spoke little English as she started to learn the language only
                  in<br> middle school.<br> She was put up with other scholars from the same batch with a
                  foster family<br> in Sembawang before the school term began.<br> “The six month English preparatory course was very tough. We have
                  to pass<br> an English proficiency test before we can study in NUS.”<br> Though Xin Ping was handicapped by her English proficiency, she did
                  well<br> enough to breeze through her four years in NUS and graduated with
                  First<br> Class Honors.<br> She did not have to pay for her tuition fees and was given a
                  generous<br> living allowance.<br> Upon graduation, she found a well-paying job with a MNC in
                  the<br> petrochemical industry.<br> “The Singapore government sent me an invitation to apply for PR
                  three<br> months after I started work which I did for a matter of convenience
                  and<br> also because I need to travel to and fro from China to visit my
                  parents.<br> A year later, I was invited to become a **Singapore** citizen and
                  after<br> much deliberation, I decided otherwise.”<br> While Xin Ping has spent nearly ten years of her life in
                  **Singapore**, she<br> did not feel a sense of belonging here though she readily admits
                  that<br> Singaporeans are one of the most ‘friendly’ people she ever
                  met.<br> “**Singapore** is a great city. The people are nice, the streets
                  are safe<br> and the government is efficient, but my roots are back in
                  **China**.<br> That’s where my homeland is.” Upon completion of her bond, Xin Ping
                  applied<br> to be transferred to **Beijing** to be closer to her family.<br> Two years later, she left to start her own company and is now a
                  mother of<br> two.<br> “**China** is fast catching up with **Singapore**. Twenty years
                  ago, there<br> isn’t even a Mac’s in **Liaoyang**.<br> Now we have Carrefour, Walmart…people are flocking to **China**.
                  This is<br> where the money is.” Does she miss **Singapore**?<br> Yes, she said, especially the cuisine and her **Singapore** friends
                  with<br> whom she still keeps in touch on Facebook where she learnt about
                  the Sun Xu<br> saga and contacted us.<br> “I am not defending Sun Xu – he probably wrote those harsh words in
                  a fit<br> of anger.<br> The truth is – most Chinese adapted well in **Singapore** and they
                  are<br> grateful to **Singapore** for giving them the opportunity to
                  succeed in<br> life.<br> I won’t be where I am today without **Singapore**. Being bilingual
                  is a<br> great asset in doing business in **China** nowadays.”<br> When asked why she did not express her gratitude to **Singapore**
                  by<br> taking up citizenship, she paused for a while before
                  replying:<br> “Singapore is like a very rich man in hot pursuit of a girl,
                  showering her<br> with expensive gifts everyday, but the girl’s heart is with
                  somebody else<br> and while she may accept his gifts, she will not be together with
                  him, just<br> like me, my heart is with China, my fatherland.<br> It’s a fact which cannot be changed. I will forever be thankful to
                  **<br> Singapore**, but gratitude is not love.”<br> <br> Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education &amp;
                  Ministry of Law Ms<br> Sim Ann revealed recently in Parliament that the **Singapore**
                  government<br> spends some $36 million dollars on scholarships to over two
                  thousand<br> foreign students each year,<br> or about S$174,000 per scholar.<br> The percentage of foreign scholars who leaves **Singapore** for
                  good yearly<br> like Xin Ping is not known.*<br> ****</p>

              <p>Red Bull gives you.... increased risk of heart disease, say scientists<br><br><strong>Just one can of Red Bull could raise the risk of heart attack or stroke, even in young people, researchers have warned.<br><br></strong>A study of university students found drinking one 250ml can of the sugar-free version of the energy drink that 'gives you wings' increased the 'stickiness' of the blood and raised the risk of life-threatening clots.<br><br>Researcher Dr Scott Willoughby said: 'One hour after they drank Red Bull, (their blood systems) were no longer normal.<br><br>'They were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease.<br><br><strong>'If you get an increase in stickiness and a decreased ability of the blood vessels to stop its stickiness, that adds up to a bad situation.<br><br></strong>'If you add in other risk factors for cardiovascular disease - stress or high blood pressure - this could be potentially deadly.'<br><br>Dr Willoughby, of the Cardiovascular Research Centre at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, said he was 'alarmed' at the results and would not drink Red Bull himself.<br><br><strong>Those with underlying heart or circulatory problems should think twice before buying the caffeine-loaded drink, he said.<br><br></strong>The results, reported in the Australian newspaper, also shocked the students taking part, some of whom drank up to eight cans a night to help them stay awake to study. Many now refuse to drink Red Bull again.<br><br><strong>Red Bull is banned in Norway, Uruguay and Denmark</strong> because of health fears, but the company last year sold 3.5 billion cans and bottles in 143 countries. <br><br>In Britain alone, it has sales of £271 million a year, with much of the cash spent in bars and clubs were it is a popular mixer with vodka and other spirits.<br><br>Previous studies have warned the stimulant effect of Red Bull can mask some of the tell-tale signs of drunkenness - putting revellers at risk of injury and attack because they do not realise how intoxicated they are.<br><br>Dr Willoughby said drinking Red Bull caused the blood 'to become sticky'<br><br>The Australian researchers said that two of the drink's ingredients - caffeine and the amino acid taurine - may have dangerous consequences for the heart when taken together.<br><br>Dr Willoughby said: 'Caffeine and taurine - both of these individually point towards being beneficial but maybe there's something quirky about the effect of the combination of the two that is causing this reaction, that is what we need to look at next.'<br><br>Formulated by the marketing director of an Austrian toothpaste company in the 1980s, one can contains 80 mg of caffeine, around the same as a cup of filter coffee, or two cups of instant. <br><br>However, cans do carry health warnings advising people not to drink more than two a day.<br><br>Red Bull Australia spokeswoman Linda Rychter said: 'The study does not show effects which would go beyond drinking a normal cup of coffee.<br><br>She added that Red Bull's global sales were testament to health authorities across the world concluding it was safe to drink.<br><br>But Dr Willougby said: 'If you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease, I'd think twice about drinking it.' <br><br></p>

              <p>I love her but I'm just too shy</p>
              <p><br>
              10th grade</p>
              <p>As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to
              me. She was my so called "best friend". I stared at her long, silky
              hair, and wished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that,
              and I knew it. After class, she walked up to me and asked me for
              the notes she had missed the day before and handed them to her. She
              said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to tell
              her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I
              love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>
              11th grade</p>
              <p>The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears,
              mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She
              asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I
              did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her soft eyes,
              wishing she w as mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, and
              three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me,
              said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her,
              I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her
              but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>
              Senior year</p>
              <p>The day before prom she walked to my locker. "My date is sick"
              she said; he's not going to go well, I didn't have a date, and in
              7th grade, we made a promise that if neither of us had dates, we
              would go together just as "best friends". So we did. Prom night,
              after everything was over, I was standing at her front door step! I
              stared at her as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal
              eyes. I want her to be mine, but she isn't think of me like that,
              and I know it. Then she said "I had the best time, thanks!" and
              gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know
              that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too
              shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>
              Graduation Day</p>
              <p>A day passed, then a week, then a month. Before I could blink,
              it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated like
              an angel up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine,
              but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before everyone
              went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and cried as I
              hugged her. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder and said,
              "you're my best friend, thanks" and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I
              want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just
              friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>
              A Few Years Later</p>
              <p>Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting
              married now. I watched her say "I do" and drive off to her new
              life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine, but she
              didn`t see me like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away,
              she came to me and said "you came!". She said "thank s" and kissed
              me on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I
              don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and
              I don't know why.</p>
              <p><br>
              Funeral</p>
              <p>Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to
              be my "best friend". At the service, they read a diary entry she
              had wrote in her high school years. This is what it read:<br>
              I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesn't notice me like
              that, and I know it. I want to tell him, I want him to know that I
              don't want to be just friends, I love him but I'm just too shy, and
              I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me!<br>
              I wish I did too... I thought to my self, and I cried.</p>

              <p>[Military] - US Military's new weapon : the Microwave Canon</p>
              <p>Article :<br><a href="http://rt.com/news/weapon-us-microwave-cannon-363/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #810081;">http://rt.com/news/weapon-us-microwave-cannon-363/</span></span></a></p>
              <p>YouTube :<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SpBCB0G0LOU"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SpBCB0G0LOU</span></span></a></p>
              <p><em>ADS fires a high-powered beam of high-frequency millimeter waves at 95 GHz (a wavelength of 3.2 mm). Similar to the same way that a microwave oven heats food at 2.45GHz, the millimeter waves excite the water and fat molecules in the body, instantly heating them via dielectric heating and causing intense pain. While microwaves will penetrate into human tissue about 17mm (0.67"), the millimeter waves used in ADS only penetrate the top layers of skin, with most of the energy being absorbed within 0.4 mm (1/64").</em></p>
              <p>The last sentence implies that the US military already have the technology at hand to use microwaves (rather than millimeter waves) that can penetrate far deeper into the human body if they wanted, and cook entire populations of humans alive. Such a weapon probably already exists.</p>
