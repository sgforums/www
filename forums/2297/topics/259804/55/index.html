              Toronto, ON, Canada, — Is there any end to Chinese ambitions in Asia? China wishes to dominate Asia with blockades, blockages, military diplomacy and political Machiavellism.
              <p>China’s building of the port of Gwadar at the mouth of the Persian Gulf in fact is meant to blockade the oil supplies of the world. Its military diplomacy is on display at the Tibet-India border, where for the last ten years it has strengthened its military infrastructure to intimidate India. In its blockage diplomacy, it is planning to divert the flow of the River Brahmaputra, also called the Tsandpo in Tibet, toward China’s northeast, hence in the process starve 100 million people in India.</p>
              <p>With a US$2 trillion economy, 1.3 billion souls and a $1,600 per capita GDP, the Chinese consider themselves wealthy. To them India is a poor rival, although India has a US$1 trillion economy, $1,000 per capita GDP and a superior and faster-growing technological sector than China. The Chinese think of India as a minor opponent. Their friendship with Pakistan is a Machiavellian tactic to checkmate India.</p>
              <p>The scheme to block and divert the River Brahmaputra shows the Chinese do not care about others, only about themselves. The scheme is foolhardy to begin with. Its environmental impact on Tibet’s economy, ecology and culture is of no consequence to them, however. All they need is additional water to flush the rapidly silting Three Gorges Dam and provide water to the parched northeast.</p>
              <p>The net consequence on India will be a manmade disaster. If 50 percent of the river’s water, which flows through the center of India’s northeastern state of Assam, is taken out, the river will become a seasonal ditch. One hundred million souls in India and Bangladesh will lose their livelihood. It will surely start a big new dispute between the two rivals and could eventually lead to a shooting war.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The river begins its journey in the glacier country of western Tibet in close proximity to the sources of other mighty rivers -- the Indus and Sutlej. Its origin is not far from the Indian border in Tibet, in the holy land of Lake Mansrovar and Mount Kailash. The Tsandpo-Brahmaputra travels west for 1,500 kilometers, hugging the northern slopes of the Himalayas through Tibet.</p>
              <p>All along its journey it gathers more water and sustains life in Tibet. Because of its remoteness, it has long gone unexplored. The river skirts the last of the Himalayan ranges and turns south into India into Arunachal Pradesh. It later turns west into the plains of the Indian state of Assam. Multiple smaller rivers join it in Arunachal Pradesh to make it into a huge water resource. At about this place the pre-rainy season flow averages well above 120,000 cubic feet per second, rising to 1million cubic feet per second during the heavy monsoon rains.</p>
              <p>The Tsandpo begins its long journey at about 13,000 feet and drops to about 5,000 feet in eastern Tibet, before it enters India. Through a series of mysterious falls and gorges, the river manages to drop to about 1,000 feet and then to 500 feet in Assam state. The water flow before the river enters Arunachal Pradesh is about 60,000 cubic feet per second. It is mostly fresh glacial water.</p>
              <p>As the river meanders thru Arunachal Pradesh it receives additional water from its tributaries and then in Assam from the discharge of other streams. The 1 million cubic feet per second flow of the Brahmaputra during the rainy season is due to the topography of the land. All the rainfall in the Assam hills is discharged into this river, making it at places 10 kilometers wide. This area is known for the highest rainfall in the world, leading at times to massive flooding in Assam and Bangladesh. Flooding brings misery, but it is also welcomed as it deposits rich nutrients for better crops the following year.</p>
              <p>Ever since they occupied Tibet, the Chinese have viewed the Tsandpo-Brahmaputra River as a source of hydroelectric power and a new source of water for the Yangtze River and parched northeast China. Numerous rafting expeditions by the Chinese military were mounted to explore the river, prior to its entry into the deep gorges in India. They were looking for a suitable site to divert the river.</p>
              <p>The first hint of this scheme came out in official Chinese newspapers in the 1990s, confirming its intent. A Chinese-inspired paper in Scientific American in June 1996 also confirmed it. The Chinese wished to use the tremendous drop in elevation of about 8,000 feet to generate electricity. According to the Chinese account, 40,000 megawatts could be generated.</p>
              <p>Just before it enters India, the river would be diverted through a network of canals, tunnels and pipelines to China’s parched mainland. All the electricity generated would be needed to pump the river into the new system. The advantage to the Chinese would be that the parched northwest may become fertile. Any remaining water could join the Yangtze River to inhibit silting in the Three Gorges Dam.</p>
              <p>This scheme is twice as big as the Three Gorges Dam. About half the total capital of about US$40 billion will go to power generation and the rest into dams, diversion canals, pipelines and tunnels. The power generation capital is a net waste, as not 1 kilowatt will benefit the Tibetan populace. All of it will be needed to pump the water through the system.</p>
              <p>The Chinese do not undertake any environmental or socioeconomic studies on large projects, lest they discover any negative impact on the environment and people. That is how they built the Three Gorges Dam, against the advice of environmentalists on locating it in a high seismic region. A major earthquake could knock this dam down or damage it. The floods that would follow could bring death and destruction to 200 million people.</p>
              <p>The Tsandpo project could bring similar damage to the ecology and people, as well as possible confrontation with India, making it not worth the effort. But the Chinese do not care.</p>
              <p>The impact on India and Bangladesh would be tremendous. Assam and part of Bangladesh would lose the capability to grow food. A massive migration toward the rest of India would follow. A wave of 100 million homeless people moving toward India would overwhelm it. India would surely move to prevent this from happening, and a military confrontation could begin.</p>
              <p>In this foolhardy scheme the Chinese have counted on their financial and military muscle. They regard India, as stated above, as a poor rival. But with the livelihood of 100 million people impacted, India would muster its own financial, technological and commercial muscle and come out fighting with vigor. This confrontation could be far bigger than the present India-China territorial dispute over the possession of the Tawang tract.</p>
              <p>In this scenario, India would have many supporters of its cause. In general, the blocking of naturally flowing rivers has not been taken kindly in human history. The world will support India. China will have a lone supporter in Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Today’s Chinese leadership is obstinate, headstrong and overconfident of its prowess. This confidence will have to be tested, if necessary, militarily. A shooting war may follow an attempt to divert the river. In a war of short duration China would have the advantage of better infrastructure close to the border. In a broader, drawn-out war, China would be at a disadvantage as its Tibet rail and road links could be interdicted and the Tibetan population inflamed to expel the Chinese from their land. It may become a lose-lose situation for China.</p>
              <p>Before a shooting war began, India could make its intentions known by a display of its own military prowess in the border region and in the Indian Ocean. India would have international law on its side.</p>
              <p>U.S. and Russian support would be critical in this situation. The United States could tie down Chinese forces on their eastern seaboard opposite Taiwan, and the Russians along the Ussuri River border. As far as Pakistan is concerned, it would have to be prevented from making mischief along India’s western border. U.S. support would be needed to keep Pakistan in check.</p>
              <p>In summary, a bigger dispute may emerge along the India-Tibet border in the form of Chinese mischief. Let us hope that sane counsel prevails within the Chinese ruling clique and the country does not embark upon the Tsandpo River diversion project.</p>

              <p>Greg Peterson <br>February 19th, 2009 at 11:23 am</p>
              <p>Much as I hate to do it, I must join the ranks of the whiney persecuted special interest groups because of this episode: It employed crude, broad, and from everything I’ve seen, utterly wrong stereotypes about atheists. To be as brief as I can, I don’t know any atheists who sit around breathlessly pining for a god. No god who would be at all desirable can be squared with reality as we actually find it in the universe (the “gods of the philosophers”), and the gods on offer from the major revealed religions are universally awful. The only gods that any human could want at all must be purely delusional, because any god that could be inferred from the cosmos would have to be utterly impersonal and profoundly uncaring, and the nomadic tribal gods in the Hebrew Bible and Koran are nasty and unattractive, and while some pretty words were put into Jesus’ mouth, the whole of his teachings is vitiated by the dogma of eternal punishment, and his credulity about the petty Hebrew deity. (If this sounds like I am personally bitter at a god, I assure you, I am not–any more than I’m personally angry at Hannibal Lecter.) To make it seem like atheists are just reacting to injustice and bad fortune and are actually sitting around like abused spouses ready and willing to give god just one more chance, if only he’d find some way to send us a sign…is insulting and absurd. I have the highest regard for the writers on the show. I don’t sit around judging every piece of entertainment through some atheist filter. But if atheism is being addressed directly, as it was in this episode of “House,” I expect a little sophistication and intelligence from this show, of any show. I was really let down. Why couldn’t an atheist be shown who is just, you know–relieved not to have to buy into what House called “religious hokum,” and who had learned to appreciate the hear and now, the graces and challenges of the present, and of human experiences and so forth…without all the pie-eyed contortionist debasement?</p>
              <p>John H <br>February 19th, 2009 at 12:49 pm</p>
              <p>Well, Greg, I can understand how you feel about people “employ[ing] crude, broad, and … utterly wrong stereotypes about atheists.” It’s similar to the way we Christians feel when people use words like “[not] at all desirable,” “universally awful,” “purely delusional,” “utterly impersonal,” “profoundly uncaring,” “nasty and unattractive,” and “petty” to describe the person we love most in life, and who loved us so much that he sacrificed his only son so that we could all escape that “eternal punishment,” and who allows the natural processes of this world to continue rather than stepping in and stopping all the suffering (which he could do any time he wishes), just so people like you will have every opportunity to accept that free gift before it’s too late.</p>
              <p>Greg Peterson <br>February 20th, 2009 at 11:14 am</p>
              <p>Hey, John. Fair points–I could have been more circumspect. But I would like to mention that I had a radical conversion to Christianity in my teens, earned a biblical studies degree at an evangelical college in preparation for ministry (I ultimately did not become ordained), worked for Billy Graham for a few years, and was very involved in church and parachurch ministries and loved my faith, which I honestly believed saved my life, probably more than once. I know from experience that everything you say about your faith feels absolutely true and right to you. It did to me as well, and I loved every moment of it. I never had a bad experience with the church, nor any unusual bad experience with Christians. It is simply mistaken. There is no shame in being mistaken…I am no doubt still mistaken about many things, probably most things. The word that I must, despite its negative connotation, insist on is delusional. I can only hope for you that someday you will be able to look back on what you wrote about how your god can step in and stop the suffering but chooses not to so I can have a chance to avoid eternal suffering as the silly, incoherent nonsense that it is. This is precisely why I am put off by Dr. House making moon-eyes at faith. Why? Why would anyone really wish to have that, to be infected with that sort of delusional thinking? It’s like Cypher in The Matrix who wants to live the lie of a pleasant virtual reality rather than looking reality in the eye and nominating himself to be a real hero in a real universe. Please…grow up. Our planet just cannot afford a great deal more reliance on the primitive ideas of our species’ childhood.</p>
              <p>John H <br>February 20th, 2009 at 3:00 pm</p>
              <p>Greg – well, I have to admit I was more than a little surprised to hear your life history, and now have a lot more respect for you than after I read your first post. You obviously are much more educated than I am in theology (in the literal sense – the scientific study of religion), so I wouldn’t dare to debate theology with you. However, I think I can now say a couple of things that I wouldn’t have bothered to before, because I wouldn’t have expected you to understand…</p>
              <p>Firstly, I’m sure you understand that Christianity is a personal relationship with Jesus, not a religion. Yeah, there’s a lot of religious stuff that gets attached to it (especially by the Roman Catholic Church), but the essence of it is coming to know Jesus in a personal way. Although I don’t know the details of your “radical conversion”, it seems to me that someone who has truly “met” Jesus (and I’m sure you know that that’s a spiritual “meeting,” not a physical one), could never subsequently deny His existence, any more than I could claim that one of my high school teachers that I spent years with in the classroom is merely a fictional character. So I would question whether your experience as a teenager was the real thing. In fact, from your subsequent comments, I expect that you would agree it probably wasn’t.</p>
              <p>And secondly, if in fact you’ve never been a Christian, in spite of your spending several years participating in organized religion, how can you say it’s all a delusion? One of the most basic tenets of science is “you can’t prove a negative.” Just because I’ve never met you in person, is that proof that you don’t exist, and somebody else must be authoring these posts and signing your name to them just to try to deceive me? What’s inconsistent about the position that Jesus really does exist, and you just haven’t met Him yet?</p>
              <p>And thirdly, since this is a blog about House, let me say that I don’t particularly want him to “find religion” either, and I don’t think the writers would do that in a million years, anyhow. Unlike God, House IS a fictional character, the purpose of which is to symbolize a particular set of characteristics or points of view. This is why some people have (rightly) complained that it would basically destroy the show if House “finds religion.” I think it’s much more effective and interesting for House to remain basically who he is, and have the POTWs and other characters contrast with him, so that the audience comes away thinking. I think that’s why this show is so good, it doesn’t just tell you in your face how to think, it shows you both sides of the issue and leaves it to you to do the thinking.</p>
              <p>Greg Peterson <br>February 23rd, 2009 at 10:55 am</p>
              <p>John H, all I can really say in response to what you’ve written is that if my self of about fifteen years ago had read what I wrote, I would have responded exactly as you have. Exactly. And with absolute, utter sincerity, confidence, and authority.</p>
              <p>So let me suggest to you if you harbor suspicions about my Christian experience, then to be fair you must acknowledge that it is at least possible that, despite all subjective evidence to the contrary, you might find yourself admitting some day as I do now that everything I thought I knew, everything that I fervently believed, was mistaken. Or, to give your response the respect it deserves, at least not likely to be based on demonstrable facts. On the one hand you have the subjective experience of the supernatural, which is common to nearly all religions (which cannot all be right but can all be mistaken); and on the other hand you have beliefs based on…and I’m struggling for the right word here. I don’t wish to be intentionally inflammatory. How about UNRELIABLE information? Evolution, for example, is simply a fact about life on earth. And that fact seems to game the whole “original sin” hypothesis, which makes the need for a savior appear highly doubtful. And the record about Jesus, while not filled with the large number of irreconcilable contradictions that some atheists with no religious background suppose, still has significant problems (just try to get the Easter story to work out using all four Gospels), shows all the hallmarks of mythology, and contains a fair number of other issues I don’t have time to go into. Perhaps the biggest problem for the Gospel record is that nothing attested to in it is corroborated by any secular source (and the ones ginned up from Josephus and the like are rather obvious frauds).</p>
              <p>A guy named William Clifford wrote something excellent called “The Ethics of Belief” in which he says, “This sense of power is the highest and best of pleasures when the belief on which it is founded is a true belief, and has been fairly earned by investigation. For then we may justly feel that it is common property, and hold good for others as well as for ourselves. Then we may be glad, not that I have learned secrets by which I am safer and stronger, but that we men have got mastery over more of the world; and we shall be strong, not for ourselves but in the name of Man and his strength. But if the belief has been accepted on insufficient evidence, the pleasure is a stolen one. Not only does it deceive ourselves by giving us a sense of power which we do not really possess, but it is sinful, because it is stolen in defiance of our duty to mankind. That duty is to guard ourselves from such beliefs as from pestilence, which may shortly master our own body and then spread to the rest of the town. What would be thought of one who, for the sake of a sweet fruit, should deliberately run the risk of delivering a plague upon his family and his neighbors?”</p>
              <p>I would say that whatever sense of personal relationship with Jesus you have (and I really understand what an amazing feeling that is), whatever existential answers you feel that Christianity has provided you…are in the sense Clifford writes about stolen, because they are taken on insufficient evidence. Grossly insufficient evidence. And even evidence that points in the opposite direction.</p>
              <p>John H <br>February 27th, 2009 at 8:58 am</p>
              <p>Greg – well, this is certainly getting way beyond the medical aspects of the TV show, but I’m glad Scott has allowed this thread to stay. It’s apparent that we’re going to have to “agree to disagree” here, but let me just say one thing about your last post.</p>
              <p>I’ve always felt that there are two ways of coming to accept something as true – scientific proof and faith. The two are mutually exclusive in the sense that if you can prove something scientifically, no faith is required. And I think that works the other way too – if you can accept something by faith, no scientific proof is required.</p>
              <p>Now I know right now you’re thinking, well, if I’m going to accept something as true without any scientific proof, it could just as well be the Flying Spaghetti Monster as the God of the Bible. And in one sense that’s true. People make up religions all the time. That in itself is not proof that all religions are made up, but I certainly wouldn’t disagree that most of them are. And a made-up religion (as the FSM people demonstrate so well) can be made to look just like truth.</p>
              <p>But truth is what it is, not what we make up. If you jump off a tall building, you will die no matter now strongly you disbelieve the law of gravity. That’s kind of a weak analogy because it’s pretty easy to scientifically prove the law of gravity, and thus no faith is required. But my point is that God either exists or he doesn’t, quite independently of what you or I or anyone else believes, and also in spite of the fact that there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove either way. The lack of evidence does not change reality, and the strength or weakness of anyone’s faith does not change reality.</p>
              <p>So I see our task in life simply as trying to determine what this absolute truth is, as accurately as possible, given the tools we have available (science and faith), and given that both of those tools have their limitations. It is not unreasonable for two intelligent people (and I’m unabashedly including you and me in that group) to come to two different conclusions, and it’s also not unreasonable for a person to change their conclusion over time (as you have) based on either new input or a reinterpretation of existing input. But the fact remains that truth is absolute, so we can’t both be right. It can’t be that “God exists for me but not for you.” One of us is wrong, and it looks like we’ll just have to leave it at that, at least for now.</p>
              <p>To end this post on a lighter note (and I hope this doesn’t come across as trite), I’m reminded of the reply a friend of mine from high school always gave to people with whom he had this kind of discussion: “Look me up in 100 years and we’ll talk about it.” ;-)</p>
              <p>D-r Bulgaria <br>March 2nd, 2009 at 2:29 am</p>
              <p>Unfortunately in 100 years will be a bit late for both of us no matter who is right or wrong. For men of science is harder however to agree to disagree – after all we have proof instead of faith so to admit otherwise is difficult if not impossible. And to revert to you example with gravity – even Jesus refused to test gravity when tempted. After all why – it was a choice to believe in gravity or God and he chose gravity? I shiver in terror here…. In high school one of our teachers was very religeous so we used to jerk him around with questions like – so we do not believe what will happen to us after death – hell? He said no – you will die for good while who believes will resurrect like Jesus. At this point I said – way to scare me into believing dude – it’s pretty much what I expect to happen anyway. Do you see me tremble in fear? But I got sidetracked again. My point is that while it is true that personal beliefs are something you shouldn’t mess with and we have to learn to agree to disagree it is impossible for people who know to simply be silent around people who just want it to be. It is the same with heroin or any other abused drug – it gives you fake happiness but it is a slow poison. It poisons your mind it poisons your body. And that is why I/we/Greg/all will not be silent. And House will not be silent as well for that matter :)</p>
              <p>John H <br>March 2nd, 2009 at 10:15 am</p>
              <p>With all due respect, D-r Bulgaria, you’ve missed the point. There is insufficient scientific evidence to prove that God exists, and there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove that He doesn’t. The best a pure scientist could say would be, “I have no idea whether God exists or not.” To take either position requires faith. The theists look at the available data and conclude there is a God; the atheists look at the same data and conclude that there is not.</p>
              <p>The difference is that once one accepts the existence of God through faith, something unexpected happens. We discover that something comes alive in us that wasn’t there before. The best way I’ve heard it described (although even this is not really very good) is to say that our lives take on a spiritual aspect, whereas previously we had been purely physical beings. Hence the term “born again,” which people who’ve never experienced it like to make so much fun of.</p>
              <p>Now it makes perfect sense to me (because I’ve been there) why someone who has never experienced this “spiritual birth” might think that the physical universe is all there is, that anything more is just fantasy or wishful thinking. And since science is the study of the physical universe, such a person might logically conclude that anything that can’t be proven by science must not exist. Trust me, I understand that point of view because I used to hold it myself. But like so many things in life, it’s turned out to be woefully insufficient.</p>
              <p>I had to smile at your statement, “…it is impossible for people who know to simply be silent around people who just want it to be,” because that’s exactly how I feel, too! If you’ll indulge me for a moment, it’s rather like, if one could somehow communicate with a fetus who had not yet been physically born, trying to describe the beauty of nature. You could go on and on about the majestic trees and the snow-capped mountains and the colorful sunsets, and they wouldn’t have the foggiest idea what you’re talking about, because having not yet been born, they would have no experience of the physical universe upon which to draw for understanding. It’s very similar when someone who has been “born again” tries to describe the spiritual realm to someone who hasn’t. It makes no sense because there’s no common experience there to draw on. The best I can do is to tell you that I know it’s real because I’ve experienced it every day since Nov. 10, 1978, that I totally understand why you don’t understand, and that I pray that someday God will open your eyes so that you can experience it, too.</p>
              <p>D-r Bulgaria <br>March 2nd, 2009 at 3:01 pm</p>
              <p>At this moment John H I feel pretty much like the protagonist from my favorite book “The Gadfly”. I’m ready to weep on your shoulder and I feel almost compelled to embrace you. You won me over with your christian patience and humility. Besides you make a very good point – there is insufficient proof for both. However the proof against “God(s)” is significantly more than the proof “for”. Before I continue I have to say that I actually am a believer – I believe there are things we don’t know and understand at the moment but they too will find their logical explanation in due time. There is a truth beyond the material – we’ll find it and study it when we have the tools for that. Quantum physics for example is a very good scientific explanation about the stuff we usually label “God”. It has just started – like so many sciences that have evolved over the years and even become obsolete because the human mind knows no boundaries and never gives up. We’ll have the “truth at the end – probably not in the next 10 000 years but who knows? Like most of the people who are here John, you seem educated, you try to prove your point with something more than “Because God said so!” and I respect you for that. And I am so tired of arguing with fanatics, people who know nothing about the meaning of the words “faith” and “science” but shout when you try to teach them anything beyond their narrow little view. As a man of some intellect that you certainly look like, you must know the basics of the scientific method – observation of repeating events, artificially creating the conditions for these events, successfully recreating them thus proving their validity etc. You should also be familiar with the stuff called “logic” – inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. The first gives us ideas – the second helps us prove and extrapolate from existing truths. My point is that we do not have enough proof that God exists ACCORDING TO THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE WE POSSESS SO FAR. Also WE CAN PROVE THAT HE DOESN’T EXIST, AGAIN BASED ON THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE. There may be stuff that science does not know about that can disprove that thesis but the human knowledge so far disproves the existence of god. Until new knowledge is found we have to assume that God doesn’t exist. Are you following me so far? I know it sounds confusing. The main prove that I can point out is LOGIC itself – God defies logic so he cannot be real. Until we prove that logic itself is faulty we have to assume that it isn’t. Here’s my boss’s funniest logical proof that God cannot exist:<br>1. If God truly exists the way it is described in the Bible(you can place any holy books name here I don’t mind)than he is all-powerful, all-mighty and all-knowing. There is nothing he cannot do – he can do everything<br>2. From 1. – God can create a rock so big and heavy that no one should be able to lift it – no one in the whole universe in the very existence.<br>3. Since no one can lift the said-so rock that means that God himself will not be able to lift it.<br>4. Since God can not lift this rock that means that he is not all-powerful, all-mighty and all-knowing.<br>5. We arrive at a contradiction witch means that the basic assumption is faulty. Ergo God does not exist.<br>We really, really left the original subject of this whole discussion here and I wouldn’t be surprised if D-r Scott decides to erase the whole thing that I wrote (that we religion freaks all wrote for that matter). That would be my final post on the subject and I thank everybody for the patience.<br>P.S. Galina I noticed very well the mention of Einstein in the episode, however I respect this guy way too much to dip his brilliance into the whole religious ranting. Besides we couldn’t know for sure but I think we can bravely assume he was talking about the unknown in general, the “truth” the “problem(s)” that he wouldn’t solve because he lacked time/equipment/knowledge/resources. And I seriously doubt he would have searched the answers any other way than scientifically. His reflections are proof of him being open minded, not religious.</p>

The blood stations would put the blood in a big tub, extract the plasma and then pump the remainder back into the peasants.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Everybody did it, villagers told AFP.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Almost all their mud-brick houses were built with blood money -- they used to live in one-room thatched huts. The cash also paid for kids' education, daughters' dowries, taxes and fines for violating the one-child policy</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A middle-aged woman, whose daughter died from AIDS in July and whose 29-year-old son lay dying in bed with both legs covered in dark sores, said the money seemed like manna from heaven.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"My daughter and son began donating blood when they were 15 and 16 years old. My son didn't want me to do it because my health was poor. For each time he donated blood, we bought a large wooden beam to build the roof," she said</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As people became weak the village was gripped by fear and ignorance.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"At first families would try to keep it a secret. Villagers would ask questions when they saw someone losing a lot of weight and looking sickly, but the family would say it was just a cold. No one wanted to let it out. They didn't know what it was," said a young man whose mother has AIDS.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">When several people died, villagers became scared and started avoiding families with sick relatives. Local hospitals had never seen the disease before and did not diagnose AIDS.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The only help the villagers received was from two doctors, Gui Xien and Gao Yaojie, who heard about the "mystery illness" and started coming to the village every few months with basic medicine, food and AIDS information</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The pair have often been driven out of Wenlou by angry officials, but it was Gui's tests which revealed the shocking statistic</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Their efforts have gained attention in small local papers but despite evidence of the scale of the epidemic and the prevalence of roaming blood banks, China's major state media have kept quiet.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"Just wait, one day, Shangcai will shock the whole world," Gui told the China News Weekly. Since some publicity emerged about the case, his hospital has refused to allow him to speak to reporters.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Already there are signs the problem is not isolated to Wenlou.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Two people died from AIDS last year in a nearby village, a resident told AFP before a village elder quickly tried to keep a lid on the conversation.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"We don't have many. Wenlou has a lot. Go to Wenlou," he said.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Nobody knows how serious the problem is in Shangcai as local officials have tried to sweep the issue under the carpet, fearful they will be punished for allowing the blood stations to thrive.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The central government has also yet to do a study on how many people were paid for blood before the practice was banned in 1998, but estimates run into tens of millions.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Experts warn the problem caused by contaminated blood could spread rapidly if not dealt with immediately</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">On the eve of Thursday's World AIDS Day, China conservatively estimates it has around 500,000 HIV carriers but UN experts have warned of more than 10 million cases by 2010 if the disease remains unchecked.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Zeng Yi, head of one of the two biggest Chinese non-governmental organizations devoted to AIDS prevention, said China had until now focused AIDS prevention on cities in the belief that drugs and prostitution were the major factors in its spread.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">However the majority of China's HIV carriers are in the countryside where blood selling has contributed to a rapid spread of AIDS which has gone largely unrecognized by the government, he said.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"If they don't deal with the isolated cases, it can become a big problem," said Zeng, who believes that the epidemic in Shangcai may still be isolated but could snowball out of control if policy does not change.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Dr Gui took his evidence about Wenlou to Beijing last year and the ripple of publicity has already shamed officials into some action -- earlier this week three dying AIDS patients were taken to hospital.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The health ministry in Beijing told AFP it was aware of the Wenlou problem but had not decided what action to take. The Henan health ministry meanwhile played down the problem and pointed to AIDS problems in neighboring Hubei.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In their desperation people in Wenlou have begun to speak out, pleading for medicine or information about foreign wonder drugs, but many believe officials simply hope the village will die out.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">One villager, who put her three daughters through high school with blood money, has not told the daughters, now working in Beijing, that she has begun to feel signs of the disease.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"I have a fever. It's not too high, but it's been going on for a long time. All the other people who died had this type of fever. My daughter tells me it's not AIDS, but I know my own body and I've never felt this before," said the woman.</span> </dt><dt>  </dt><dt><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"I have three daughters. They're all so young. I won't be able to see them married," she told AFP as tears filled her eyes and she recalled the brother-in-law who died several months ago and the bedridden sister too weak to move.</span></dt></dl></td>

              <p>In many ways (both technical and consciential-level wise), this is probably the best movies ever made, in the history of mankind. Despite its plot predictability (and some elements of 'cheesiness', eg. the tribal dance rituals), the idea of consciousnessess able to 'incarnate' temporarily into a physical body on another planet, to live complete lifetimes, each with its own issues, relationships and value, does do well to spark subconcious memories (of the incarnational process) for people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The implication that their Eywa/Eyra (Goddess of their Planet; their version of Gaia) is a living consciousness whose brain synapses are the trees of the forests, does well to remind people subconsciously that all planets and stars are living consciousnessess in their own right.</p>
              <p>And of course, the main issue the protagonist struggles with, is that of cosmoethics : militarily 'betraying' his own (Earth human) race to prevent a greater tragedy for both races - a direct catastrophe for (the planet) Pandora and its residents (not just the Navi people, but the flora and fauna as well), as well as a greater karmic tragedy for Earth huamns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which brings us to the idea that, hey wait a minute, that's what we're (still) doing to our own planet! At least the recent Copenhagen meetings indicate unprecendented awareness amongst world leaders and governments.</p>

              <p>Many students living in sheltered countries like Sg, are unaware of the suffering of people living in countries with more difficult conditions, largely caused by the ethically flawed economic system on the planet, fueled by unevolved human greed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The movie "Taken" starring Liam Neeson, is based on sex slavery trading systems that exist in real life, up to this very day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>--------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sex Slavery in the UK (slaves from China and Asia)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's 200 years ago this month since the slave trade was abolished in the UK. But now Britain has become the number one destination for sex slave traffickers.</p>
              <p>To crack down on the scandal, a police task force, the Human Trafficking Team, has been set up as traumatised girls as young as 14 are being auctioned for up to £8,000 to the highest bidder before being forced into prostitution.</p>
              <p>They are then ordered to sleep with scores of men in seedy brothels to make their pimps up to £1,000 a day. It was ordinary people who brought an end to the slave trade in this country 200 years ago by petitioning and making their voices heard at the inhumanity of it all. <br>But that slave trade wasn't under cover like today's sexual exploitation of Lithuanian girls, victims from China, Malaysia, Thailand, Africa, South America and the Baltic countries, who are regularly raped, beaten and held prisoner in filthy hovels, while gang bosses live lives of luxury.</p>
              <p>Just like Lily they arrive in this country with no idea where they are, unwitting victims. Many speak no word of English and are lured into the gangs' clutches by promises of work in bars and restaurants. Once here their passports are snatched before they are raped by their "owners" and told to work as prostitutes.</p>
              <p>Danielle, who features in the photographic exhibition, was brought from Lithuania at 15 under the false impression of what a "summer job in London" would entail.</p>
              <p>She says: "At the airport we were met by some men who handed £3,500 to the guy who'd travelled with me. To my horror I realised I'd been sold. I was taken to Birmingham by the man who bought me."</p>
              <p>Danielle was then raped and forced to have sex with clients in a brothel for several months, before eventually escaping.</p>
              <p>Other harrowing stories include a woman from India sleeping rough since escaping violent captivity and a young mother seeking refuge in a convent from the traffickers who have targeted her on five separate occasions.</p>
              <p>And on Wearside I met a woman who was subjected to sickening, horrific and repeated rape after she had paid to stow away on a ship to bring her to England and escape political persecution in Sri Lanka. She lost her husband and two sons to the regime and believes they are dead.</p>
              <p>As for Lily, she arrived in Britain at 15, from Uganda, traumatised after seeing her mother, father, her sisters and two of her brothers massacred by the military.</p>
              <p>"I saw everything that happened," she says. Lily hid up a tree while the killings occurred and all because her father had been deeply involved in paramilitary activity.</p>
              <p>Now at 20, she has lived a lifetime and has a child as a result of being forced into prostitution. Lily is vulnerable and pregnant again, a lonely traumatised young woman.</p>
              <p>When her family was wiped out – except for a younger brother – they ran away together and met one of her dad's friends she called uncle who brought her to Britain to a flat with two men.</p>
              <p>She has no idea where her brother is. Of the man she called "uncle" she says: "He used to go out to get me some food that I used to like, chips. So the last time he said he was going to MacDonald's, I thought he'd come back but he never came back. He disappeared.</p>
              <p>"Then those men started asking me for sex and that, and I didn't like the way they asked me so I told them no. One day when I was sleeping they tried to come on top of me so I fought and pushed them and that's when I ran out of the house."</p>
              <p>She ran straight into kids sleeping rough on the London Underground, druggies, boys and girls, all having sex for money.</p>
              <p>"They said I only had one choice to get food to survive, because they all said I had to survive. You have to have sex with men who give you money."</p>
              <p>Lily explains: "When I was like stopping men on the street and that, I started to feel sick and I stopped one man and asked him for £2 to get some tea."</p>
              <p>He was her saving grace and after Lily told him her story he gave her £20 and directed her to the Home Office.</p>
              <p>Lily was then put in touch with the NSPCC centre, with one of the few projects that supports children who have been sexually exploited and assigned an NSPCC social worker, Mandy.</p>
              <p>She has a boyfriend on and off and desperately longs for a man who will love her child like a dad.</p>
              <p>Lily doesn't want to go back to Uganda: "I would rather die. I would rather kill myself."</p>
              <p>Every day she waits for a reply from the Home Office allowing her to stay: "Then I think, not today, maybe tomorrow." Maybe.</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Zhao Xianming, liaison officer of the Public Security Bureau drug squad in Mengla County, Yunnan Province, received a call from on July 25 from a senior police officer in Phongsaly, Northern Laos about a suspected abduction from a Lao border town. The Lao officer advised Zhao to stop a bus heading for Mengla from Laos and intercept a Lao woman traveling on it with two teenage girls. She had been overhead telling them she could find them jobs in a restaurant in a nearby town, but was actually intent on selling them to a trafficking gang over the border.</p>
              <p>"Information like this from Laos enables us to intercept abducted girls at the border and send them back to Laos," Zhao said.</p>
              <p>Rife Trafficking on the China-Laos Border</p>
              <p>Mengla, a border county in Yunnan Province, is home to ethnic minority groups that also live across the Laos border. Differences between them in economy and gender ratio are main reasons why human trafficking is rife in the region.</p>
              <p>During his ten years at the Bureau Zhao has rescued dozens of abducted women. "They have mostly been girls from poverty-stricken mountainous areas of northern Laos. Traffickers lead them on with tales of lucrative work and smuggle them over the border," Zhao said.</p>
              <p>"The bureau has received 31 reports of human trafficking from Laos since 2000 and has rescued 19 victims from provinces in China including Henan, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shandong," bureau chief of the Public Security Bureau in Mengla County Wang Wei said at a cross-border anti-trafficking conference in mid-October.</p>
              <p>Chinese and Lao officials at the conference announced establishment of an anti-trafficking office 100 meters from the China-Laos border in the A-level port of Mohan. It will give Chinese and Lao police the opportunity to exchange anti-trafficking information and combine forces in trafficking down suspects and rescuing victims.</p>
              <p>International Organization Anti-trafficking Campaigns</p>
              <p>Child trafficking in China has risen in recent years. Since April 9, when the Ministry of Public Security took concerted action, China has solved 1,717 cases and rescued 2,008 children, according to the Ministry website. Although cross-border trafficking cases rise every year, they do not constitute the majority.</p>
              <p>The anti-trafficking liaison office in Mengla County is one of several on China's southwestern borders established by the Ministry of Public Security. UNICEF China office has also launched an anti-trafficking project on the Sino-Vietnamese border that has six liaison offices along China's border with Vietnam and Myammar.</p>
              <p>UNICEF has also organized investigations into cross-border child trafficking, according to Wang Daming, child protection expert at UNICEF China office. UNICEF publicizes and circulates anti-trafficking information and also offers local police officers a six-month training course in Vietnamese. Joint Chinese and Vietnamese police anti-human trafficking operations in 2005 and 2006 rescued hundreds of victims.</p>
              <p>China has also established centers for rescued abductees in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province which provide medical treatment and psychological counseling.</p>
              <p>Anti-trafficking Innovations</p>
              <p>The British charity Save the Children has been active in anti-trafficking operations in Yunnan for decades, according to anti-trafficking project manager He Ye. It began focusing on cross-border child trafficking in 2002, when girls from Yunnan Province were being smuggled into Thailand and Malaysia for forced labor or prostitution. The year 2004, and completion of the China-Laos section of the Kunming-Bangkok highway, saw a rise in the trafficking of girls from Laos into China .</p>
              <p>Save the Children has cooperated with the Yunnan Province public security bureau and local women's federation in rescuing 50 children and women from Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>In 2004, six countries, including China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region. China's public security departments also signed memorandums of understanding with Vietnam and Myanmar to promote cross-border anti-trafficking operations. These agreements guarantee effective long-term cooperation among countries in the greater Mekong sub-region, Wang said.</p>
              <p>At the end of 2007, China published the Plan of Action on Combating Trafficking in Women and Children (2008-2012). The State Council also established a joint ministry system covering 31 governmental departments and a counter-trafficking office under Ministry of Public Security.</p>
              <p>Ministry of Public Security established last May a DNA database for missing children which is available to public security offices in 32 provinces and 11 cities in China.</p>
              <p>Officer Zhao of the public security bureau in Mengla County believes the database should include personal information on cross-border trafficking victims. He has appealed for legislation that enables distinctions to be drawn between marriages for trafficking purposes and genuine cross-border marriages, and advocates simpler registration procedures for mixed ethnicity marriages.</p>

              <p>On another forum (which shall remain unnamed), Salival posted :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm here today, to seek for some comments n opinions, regarding to what had happened in one of my younger sibling's school, which had provoke me to b very alarmed, as the incident itself is very shocking.<br><br>Word of advice, the following story which i m gonna post here would b very long winded. Even so, i hope that the general community of SGClubbers would take some time to read what i hav to say, n giv ur utmost candid comment. You may want to make a cup of coffee n get some cookies to compliment with it as u read.<br><br>Alright, as we know, the sch holidays r currently undergoing now. Saw my younger bro, who's 14, going onto sec 3. having to deal with a pile of h/w. Thought to myself: Wow, thats harsh. My comment dawned appropriate on me when my younger bro sought help from me with his holiday assignment. Woah, its a 'full flagged' O lvl English comprehension, with questions that requires a high magnitude of skills to seek the fathom of the essence of the passage, in order to answer the questions. Ha, the school is sure trying incredibly hard to hone the students i guess.<br><br>I was once an alumni from his school, when i left, minor actions which affirms that the school is trying to b an 'elite' school had bcame sparsely noticeable. This fact started to enlighten on me, when i was invited to hav a 'sit down' n hear my younger bro's story.<br><br>The story is so that it happens on the last day of the school's curriculum. As all of us would know, the last day of school would b the origin of pupils having nothing on their hands, minds, and being preoccupied with anything that they r allowed to do. But... its turns out to b a different story within my younger bro. Turns out to b, on the last day of school itself, every pupils throughout all the cohorts, were asked to proceed down to the school's 'sound-clad' room. Sounds nothing malicious here, till the point as they entered the room.(Sounds like Sook Ching operation of the WWII eh?) Practically, the teachers starts to give sermons, for the misbehaves the pupils did for the year. Hadn't got the routine during my time. Apparently its something fresh. As the teacher proceeds with his sermons, my younger bro claims that one of the teacher actually used derogatory terms on the schools around the vicinity, as he's trying to make a comparison. Quote: 'THIS IS ********* SEC SCH, NOT ********* SEC SCH, OR ********* **** SEC SCH! WE EXPECT GOOD BEHAVIOR!'(Radically, comparing the sch's behavior standard with the intent of derogating other schools, with an iota of want to adumbrate the derogation of other schools.) Was pretty shocked to hav heard of this. The teacher also added on that by the start of the new sch curriculum timetable, every students is expected to show 100% perfect behavior. 0% of tolerance would b given. Thats even worst than the army imo, its overly militaresque. Even if a recruit does something wrong, at least he still does hav a chance for a recourse, b4 being admitted into 7years of Detention Barracks.<br><br>After the sermons, the teacher ordered every student to remove their shoes n socks, for the purpose to check if the students r wearing anklets, regardless if they had nail polish, drawings or watever on their feet.(LOL, but thats my bro's claim on wat the teacher said) For the purpose to eliminate the wearing of anklets, regardless of watever purpose, inclusive of religion purpose. Students r ordered to remove it, or it would cut off. Again, does sound militaresque eh?<br><br>Girls r ordered to stand up, as the discipline mistress went around to check on their skirts. Apparently, those who had 'modified' (by sewing the skirt inwards, to make it shorter : as claimed by my younger bro) would suffer the torment of the discipline mistress ripping the portion off, avow the glimpse of chance for male students n teachers alike to... u know(shan't go into details)<br><br>Thats pretty the end of the story as told by my younger bro. Was flabbergasted to hav heard wat my past school had bcamed. Apparently it sounds like a to-do (the need of 100% perfect behavior, hell, thats pretty harsh if u ask me) in order to attain the agenda of being an elite school.<br><br>If u think: strict discipline is the most important priority in a good school. What bout this? An ahbeng with an aggregate of 280, entering an elite school, despite creating trouble, does the need of advocating the whole school is needed?<br><br>N, this is the 21st century, the application of 'spare the rod, spoils the child' doesn't really exist anymore.<br><br>Still, i would like to hear ur comments on the actions taken by the school. Should militaresque discipline b applied in schools? Does discipline really counts in an 'elite' school? Is it really alright to derogate other schools? Have ur say.<br><br>This is really not a debate, jus wanna hear ur comment. The sch holidays r going to end soon, n my poor younger bro is quite xenophobic bout the new militaresque application in his school for the new year.<br><br>Hopefully, it would serves as a good closing to this matter, n givs students from other schools a heads up bout such happenings.<br><br>Thanks<br>Salival</p>

              <p>I replied :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> There is no right or wrong. Individual humans (whether teachers or students) will have individual way of thinking, and inevitably disagreements will result. <br><br>If that particular teacher (who may or may not have the explicit backing of the principal) has an idea of punishment which you deem unacceptable, the natural consequence would be to complain, either to the principal or directly to MOE or both.<br><br>Whether the principal will support/criticize the teacher, or MOE support/criticize the principal or teacher, that's another matter (politics).<br><br>Punishments will have their rationales, which may or may not be acceptable. That skirt ripping idea (as a specific example) is a ridiculous and unacceptable to most teachers as well, so there's a good chance that if what you say is really true, your complaint (if successful) will result in a change of punishment policy.<br><br>One teacher's idea for punishment is his own idea, it doesn't mean other teachers necessarily endorse or agree with it. Other teachers may (and often do) disagree, but if its minor in nature usually there's nothing much the other teachers can do. If it's major enough, then there's a quarrel/emnity/war, then it depends on politics, the power of those against vs those for, including which side the HODs and principal is on (HODs commonly disagree with each other and with the principal too).<br><br>Point being - there isn't a right or wrong (this is true for life in general well. There is no morality and immorality, only ethicality and unethicality. But that's another discussion altogether). If you disagree strongly with a policy and you think your speaking up can make a difference, then do so.<br><br>Schools disagree with each other. Principals disagree with each other. HODs disagree with the principal. HODs disagree with each other. HODs disagree with teachers. Teachers disagree with each other (I've witnessed teachers physically fist-fighting with each other; HODs verbally assualting each other, teachers/HODs/principals plotting against each other, etc). Students disagree with teachers. Students disagree with students. It's all common, natural and inevitably - neither 'good' nor 'bad' or 'right' or 'wrong'.<br><br>So 'the school' is not the one you have a quarrel with (because there's no such thing as 'the school', it is a nebulous and ill-defined non-existential entity only made up in humans' minds), it's the specific policy, and if need be, by extension, the specific teacher/discipline master behind that policy as well.<br><br>Do what you think is 'right' (ie. right by you). Do what you feel you have to.<br><br>This is true for the discipline master, it is also equally true for the student/parent who is against the policy of the discipline master.<br><br>( This is also true for criminals, this is also true for policemen. There is no right and wrong, only actions and their consequences. If you deign to judge 'right'/'wrong', 'morality'/'immorality', ethicality/unethicality, cosmoethicality/anti-cosmoethicality, then do so on a case-by-case basis. Some so-called 'criminals' and 'criminal actions' by technicality of law, may be even higher in ethicality ('morality') and human decency, than non-criminals or non-criminal actions that indirectly do harm to others but are not illegal. Case in point : <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20091222/tts-britain-religion-theft-cac1e9b.html">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20091222/tts-britain-religion-theft-cac1e9b.html</a> )<br><br>Many ideas/actions/behaviours by many teachers/discipline masters/HODs/principals are unfair, detrimental, unethical, ridiculous, inappropriate and unacceptable, just as many ideas by students/parents are equally are unfair, detrimental, unethical, ridiculous, inappropriate and unacceptable.<br><br>While there is no 'right' or 'wrong' in any action inherently, but you (whether you are a student or teacher, as long as you are a human being), you must have the courage to do what's 'right by you', what you feel is appropriate or necessary or required, for the greater good of all beings involved (what normal or religious people might call 'right' or 'moral', but these ideas are spiritually / philosophically flawed... that's another discussion altogether.)</p>

              <p>Has Google netted us all in its web? — Adam Raff</p>
              <p>DEC 29 — As we become increasingly dependent on the Internet, we need to be increasingly concerned about how it is regulated. The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed “network neutrality” rules, which would prohibit Internet service providers from discriminating against or charging premiums for certain services or applications on the Web. The commission is correct that ensuring equal access to the Internet is vital, but it errs in directing its regulations only at service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast.</p>
              <p>Today, search engines like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft’s new Bing have become the Internet’s gatekeepers, and the crucial role they play in directing users to websites means they are now as essential a component of the system as the physical network itself. The FCC needs to look beyond network neutrality and include “search neutrality” — the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.</p>
              <p>The need for search neutrality is particularly pressing because so much market power lies in the hands of one company: Google. With 71 per cent of the United States search market (and 90 per cent in Britain), Google’s dominance of both search and search advertising gives it overwhelming control. Google’s revenues exceeded US$21 billion (RM72 billion) last year, but this figure pales next to the hundreds of billions of dollars of other companies’ revenues that Google controls indirectly through its search results and sponsored links.</p>
              <p>One way that Google exploits this control is by imposing covert “penalties” that can strike legitimate and useful websites, removing them entirely from its search results or placing them so far down the rankings that they will in all likelihood never be found. For three years, my company’s vertical search and price-comparison site, Foundem, effectively “disappeared” from the Internet in this way.</p>
              <p>Another way that Google exploits its control is through preferential placement. With the introduction in 2007 of what it calls “universal search”, Google began promoting its own services at or near the top of its search results, bypassing the algorithms it uses to rank the services of other companies. Google now favours its own price-comparison results for product queries, its own map results for geographic queries, its own news results for topical queries as well as its own YouTube results for video queries. And Google’s stated plans for universal search make it clear that this is only the beginning.</p>
              <p>Because of its domination of the global search market and ability to penalise competitors while placing its own services at the top of its search results, Google has a virtually unassailable competitive advantage. And Google can deploy this advantage well beyond the confines of search to any service it chooses. Wherever it does so, incumbents are toppled, new entrants are suppressed and innovation is imperilled.</p>
              <p>Google’s treatment of Foundem stifled our growth and constrained the development of our innovative search technology. The preferential placement of Google Maps helped it unseat MapQuest from its position as America’s leading online mapping service virtually overnight. The share price of TomTom, a maker of navigation systems, has fallen by some 40 per cent in the weeks since the announcement of Google’s free turn-by-turn satellite navigation service. And RightMove, Britain’s leading real estate portal, lost 10 per cent of its market value this month on the mere rumour that Google planned a real estate search service in the country.</p>
              <p>Without search neutrality rules to constrain Google’s competitive advantage, we may be heading towards a bleakly uniform world of Google Everything — Google Travel, Google Finance, Google Insurance, Google Real Estate, Google Telecoms and, of course, Google Books.</p>
              <p>Some will argue that Google is itself so innovative that we need not worry. But the company isn’t as innovative as it is regularly given credit for. Google Maps, Google Earth, Google Groups, Google Docs, Google Analytics, Android and many other Google products are all based on technology that Google has acquired rather than invented.</p>
              <p>Even AdWords and AdSense, the phenomenally efficient economic engines behind Google’s meteoric success, are essentially borrowed inventions: Google acquired AdSense by purchasing Applied Semantics in 2003, and AdWords, though developed by Google, is used under licence from its inventors, Overture.</p>
              <p>Google was quick to recognise the threat to openness and innovation posed by the market power of Internet service providers, and has long been a leading proponent of Internet neutrality. But it now faces an interesting decision. Will it embrace search neutrality as the logical extension to Net neutrality that protects equal access to the World Wide Web? Or will it try to argue that discriminatory market power is somehow dangerous in the hands of a cable or telecommunications company but harmless in the hands of an overwhelmingly dominant search engine?</p>
              <p>The FCC is now inviting public comment on its proposed network neutrality rules, so there is still time to persuade the commission to expand its scope. In particular, it should ensure that the principles of transparency and non-discrimination apply to search engines as well as to service providers. The alternative is an Internet in which innovation can be squashed at will by an all-powerful search engine. — New York Times<br></p>

              <p>The fear of gangsters (unless you're one yourself) appears to be more prevelant in some societies, including (apparently, evidently) the one in which this video was taken in.</p>
              <p>By all appearances, this probably occurred in China, (or possibly Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea or Japan... but most likely China). The chinese text accompanying the edited video does not specify the location or country.</p>
              <p>A woman in an internet cafe next to the fast food restaurant called and asked them to deliver an ice-cream. The pregnant woman manager refused as ice-cream is not in the delivery menu. The phone was passed to the gangster perpetrator, who asked angrily why, as they were just next door. Heï»¿ started swearing at which point the manager hung up. He then went over next door to the restaurant and what happens next is shown in the video.</p>
              <p>The tragic thing was, none of the dozen employees present (including mostly male ones) dared to stop the gangster (a few made feeble attempts). Quite definitely, such social antipathy is borne out of fear of gangsters.</p>
              <p>They were in a kitchen, for crying out loud. The employees could easily arm themselves to come to her aid. Even without arming themselves, they outnumber the gangster 10 to 1.</p>
              <p>Tragic.</p>
