              <p>Hello everybody, I gotten back my prelim papers recently. I am now very worried about my o'level. These are my results:</p>
              <p>English- <strong>C5</strong> (58) .Combined Science(p,c)- <strong>A2</strong>(72) . Combined Humanities- <strong>D7</strong>(49).     E.math-<strong>A1</strong>(87) . A.Math-<strong>A1</strong>(94) . P.O.A-<strong>A1</strong>(86) . And Chinese(olevel)- <strong>A1</strong>.</p>
              <p>L1R5- 17( I think so) , L1B4- ( I still don't know how to count.)</p>
              <p>As you guys can see, I didn't do well for my languages papers. For English, it seems like it has always been this grade since I graduated to Secondary 3.   I am very worried about it, so would like to find any help or tips here. I know for English, my problem lies on paper1, I will either fail Section1(composition) and pass Section2(situational writing) or pass Section1 and fail Section2, and eventually resulted a borderline pass. Thus, I need tips for this.( For example, which question to choose for Compo?).</p>
              <p>As for Humanities, I scored 27 for SS and 22 for Geography. I more or less know what problem I have on Geography( I did not study much as I think I have 3papers on that day). For SS, I have really no idea what went wrong in my Source Essay Question.. Is it true that we are not supposed to make notes from the guide book I bought from popular?  I was so stunned when I first received my Seq paper, it was definitely not what I've expected, not even close.. because I was pretty confident that I may get at least 18 marks and above as the question was  totally identical as the question from the guidebook, so I simply copied and paste the factors and weighing of factors. Likewise, for every factor, I describe + explain.. but my teacher did not accept my factors, which ended up a L2/4.. I was so indignant and that I inquired my teacher why is it only L2, she simply just said she only accept what she thinks were right, checking of scripts is only for any addition error. I found it pointless to argue any more further, so I gave up. Now, do you guys have any tips for SS, regardless SBQ OR SEQ? If possible, I want tips for Geography too. Thanks, I will appreciate a lot.</p>

              <p>Dear Ohsobusted,</p>
              <p>I believe you are referring to ELR2B2 (entry to polytechnic/MI) is... 1st Language, two Related subjects (usually sci+maths), and two Best.</p>
              <p>Many people are confused between ELR2B2 and L1B4.</p>
              <p>Therefore, yours will be<br><br>ELR2B2</p>
              <p>Eng + [Sci(Phy/Chem) + A/E Maths] + [Best two (A/E Maths + POA)]</p>
              <p>5 + (2 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 10</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The term "L1B4" is for school's performance band grading. L1 refers to langange and best 4 any subject. This is a useful tool to determine the average academic performance of a school.</p>
              <p>Your L1B4 will then be</p>
              <p>Eng + 4 Best</p>
              <p>5 + 4 = 9</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see the difference?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hey, thanks!! I asked a teacher teaching another class, and she said actually my factors are alright and she will review my script. She also advised me to take her notes, and don't use factors from either textbook or guidebook. Well, I can only say she is a better teacher:). Because I remember I ever asked my ss teacher as how to improve on my languages, he replied, ' hmm, all you can do now is pray.'</p>

              <p>Sometimes you should not really compare your prelim grades to O Level because it is inaccurate. Schools tend to be might stricter in their own exams than O Levels and different schools have different standards.</p>
              <p>But for O Levels everything is standardized, means all scripts are marked accordingly to the standard, not by the examiner's strictness.</p>
              <p>I do have some tips for humanities, I took Combined Humanities (SS, Hist). Not sure about geography but for history it is the same format as SS, SEQ and SBQ.</p>
              <p>So what I did was I read up the textbook, exam papers and <strong>TYS</strong>! You should know how does O Level ask the questions because from past experiences I know that some questions are not so straight forward, so it is always important to know how are questions phrased, misunderstanding the question is very risky!!!</p>
              <p>My teacher also provided us with L5 answers, and I took some points out which are not mentioned in the textbook. So I compiled teacher's points and textbooks' point.</p>
              <p>I would not recommend guidebooks or model essays because some content may not be in the syllabus and if you write them it would be out of point, resulting in a low band. For more information, consult your teachers, they know what is needed best.</p>
              <p>As for English, you have to know what is your strength in the essay writing. Are you good in writing narrative, expository etc. Let's say there are 2 topics, one narrative, which ask you to write about an incident which was unexpected and another topic, titled 'Jealousy'. Which are you more confident in writing?</p>
              <p>You should try do write 2 types of essays and let your teacher mark, she will advice you which is your strength.</p>
              <p>Remember to study hard and also study smart :)</p>
