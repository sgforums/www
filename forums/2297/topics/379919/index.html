              <p>I will say lit requires a good foundation in english to score well. If i am not wrong, the difference between pure and elective lit is that the pure lit students have 2 text while the elective lit has only 1. That was during my time many yrs ago so things might have changed now.</p>
              <p>Lit requries u to understand the text very well and in a way is similar to geog n hist except the content is different. Personally i would advice geog over lit anytime.</p>
              <p>In my school last time, very few people in my class chooses to take lit and those students practically fail almost all the sch exams with a pass being top in my class already if anyone pass at all. However they all did pretty well with no failures in the O's though i would say many of them were demoralised during the process.</p>

              <p>lit is all about clarity, the way u use english to transfer the intended meaning to the marker.</p>
              <p>i taking e.lit.</p>
              <p>highest i got was like 35 /50 only.</p>
              <p>however. i got a guy in C.lit get 24/25 for 1 essay.</p>
              <p>so it all boils down to whether ur son has the 'thing' or not .</p>

              <p>Hi Etan,</p>
              <p>Although it is preferable for those taking literature to have a strong English foundation, it does not mean that those who do not get A1/A2 for English will definitely do badly for literature.</p>
              <p>As for which subject among the three is easier to score, I will say that it depends on the individual. Even though your son does not like memorising, I will advise him to take up geography and work hard on it, unless he has the confidence of doing very well for his literature.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>my father (he's 45 now) got A1 for literature in his O lvs. his english was C5. in fact his english teacher was really really very impressed (and shocked) that my father passed his english paper.</p>
              <p>i would say its about talent and hard work. if your foundation in english is poor, well, work harder, memorize more. if your foundation is great and you can understand literature very well, you can afford to spend less effort. it's all about putting in the appropriate amount of effort with regard to your amount of talent.</p>
              <p>I'm doing Chinese Studies now, and we do a lot of study on the Theory of Literature. all i can say is, literature is literature, regardless of which language it's in. At the O lvs, i took chinese literature, and that was a hell lot of memorizing. in fact, the memorizing is tougher than history's (no idea about geog, i never took it). Because literature is all about studying abstract concepts. it's very hard to understand literature fully at sec sch level, all they want is for you to memorize. so well, to summarize</p>
              <p>1. my father worked DAMN hard at O lvs.</p>
              <p>2. literature is all about memorizing abstract concepts (alternatively, memorize all the model answers from your teacher)</p>
              <p>3. history/geog is about memorizing too, but what they teach is less abstract (esp geog.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope that helped you </p>
