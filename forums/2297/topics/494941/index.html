Having already learnt from me the topic your school is about to teach, you will get to enjoy your school's lectures and tutorials because you already understand the topic, while you see the rest of your peers become confused and frustrated during your school's lectures and tutorials.

And if you haven't yet made an SgForum account, you can go ahead and do so now. Post any H2 Chemistry questions you have here in this thread.
                                                                                                  <br><br>
                                                                                                  From the number of views my H2 Chemistry threads on this forum has garnered, it's pretty clear that hundreds of lurkers (presumably and hopefully the majority of whom are actual JC students) are interested in my H2 Chemistry posts.
                                                                                                  <br><br>
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                   Well, to all you lurkers out there (especially if you're a genuine JC student), here's a suggestion : Why don't *you* go ahead and make a SgForums account so you can post your own H2 Chemistry queries here.
                                                                                                  <br><br>
                                                                                                  Just register an account with SgForums, it's easy and free (of course, asking for free online help here... or for that matter anywhere... isn't as effective as actually joining my BedokFunland JC tuition, but it's still better than having no one reliable to ask for help... or if you disagree with your own private tutor or school teacher and wish to have a 2nd opinion that's reliable and trustworthy) to ask anything relevant to H2 Chemistry here.
                                                                                                  <br><br>
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                   For instance, if you wish to discuss a TYS qn or a JC Prelim qn (eg. if you don't understand or disagree with the answer given by the TYS author, or the prelim paper's mark scheme, or your school teacher's explanation. etc), you can just specify the question (eg. "2016 RJC P3 Q2" or "TYS 2015 P3 Q2" etc) and ask your question. If it's a non-TYS qn or non-Prelim qn that involves a diagram, you'll have to use your handphone to take a photo, and upload the image to your Facebook, Twitter, blog, etc, and link to the image in your post.
                                                                                                  <br><br>
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                   New members of SgForums won't be able to start new threads until you've reached a certain post count, so go ahead and post your H2 Chem qns in this thread till then.

              You can post more Physics stuff on the forums more frequently lor. Even if they just lurk and read your posts without replying or posting, at least that may help encourage visitors (occasional visitors may not know there is a Physics expert here, ie. you, that they can seek help from) to be more willing to register an SgForums account to post and ask for help with their Physics questions here.
              <p>
              For some of you lurkers who may not know, Eagle runs his own tuition center, that you can consider if you're looking for a tuition center for your O and A level needs :</p><p>

              [Medical] - Medical Doctor David Gorski angrily disagrees with Biochemistry Professor Christopher Exley on Whether the Aluminium in Vaccines causes Autism<p>

              </p><p>
              There is no simple right and wrong. Both make valid points. There is increasing medical evidence that aluminium contributes to brain damage. What Dr David Gorski disagrees with, is whether the aluminium in vaccines is a significant source of aluminium toxicity (since some argue that aluminium exposure from foods and environment, is even worse than from vaccines), and therefore whether the risks of vaccinations outweigh the rewards.

              <p>1. Since K is soluble in KCl (l), you can try adding in Na to the molten KCl salt (~850 C). K (bp 760 C) is more voltatile than Na (bp 883 C), so it can be distilled off, and by Le Chatelier's principle, as K is being removed, more KCl reacts to form NaCl.</p>
              <p>KCl (l) + Na (l) = NaCl (l) + K (g)</p>
              <p>This is the principal method for the industrial production of K, I believe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Your second question of electrolysis of NaCl + CaCl2 is basically the Downs process. </p>
              <p>i. The mixture of the two salts can form an eutectic mixture, lowering the melting point. NaCl melts at 801 C, and by mixing in CaCl2, you can lower the melting point to a much lower temperature of around 600 C. This point matters because pure Na boils at 883 C. (see point iii below)</p>
              <p>ii. If based on the Data Booklet, Na+ (-2.71V) preferentially reduces rather than Ca2+ (-2.87V).</p>
              <p>iii. If no CaCl2 is added, then any Na that is formed from NaCl will form a metallic gaseous cloud because of the small temperature diference between molten NaCl and Na(g). This makes it hard to extract and remove the Na metal. </p>

              Yes, very good. All correct.<p>Are you a school teacher or private tutor? An undergrad or grad?
              </p><p>
              Ya know, in every instance in past years, almost every SgForums member who correctly answered my BedokFunland JC Questions (eg. the guy who correctly answered my BedokFunland JC OC Deductive Elucidation Qns a few months back), will claim they are currently just JC students (some will even specify "neighbourhood JC student" ), when I ask them who they are.</p><p>
              Obviously I know they're not JC students, but since they want to insist they are, I just play along and pretend they are.</p><p>
              So, are you going to say you're a 'neighbourhood JC student' as well? ;Ãž

              Cool. I appreciate honesty.<p>
              Assuming you'll be hanging out on the this forum (I noticed you made an SgForums account for this), mind if I ask again : Are you a school teacher or private tutor? An undergrad or postgrad?</p><p>
              Of course, you don't need to answer if you don't want to. Just that, it's nice to know who I'm talking to (especially if you'll be hanging out here).</p><p>
              And as I've stated elsewhere, I'll much prefer a fellow private tutor honestly say he's one, than masquerade as a current JC student (not you, some other chaps).</p><p>
              Given your interest in my Chem qns, it's safe to surmise you're either a private Chem tutor, or currently a Chem undergrad? Or school Chem teacher or Chem postgrad?</p>

              <p>I always find these "So what do you do? What is your background?" kind of questions like some kind of d*ck-measuring contest or pissing match.

              <p>Well, since this is the internet (i.e. we can be anyone we say we are), I taught undergraduate chemistry modules in the mecca of science that is by the banks of Charles River, and a hippie town known for drunken revelry and rioting in CA, so hopefully that qualifies me to post suggested answers on this forum!

              Appreciate your candour. Thanks for being honest about your Chem postgrad background.
              <p>As you say this is the internet (though from a review of one's postings, one can more or less deduce the truthfulness of one's professed identity, eg. nayr69sg does appear to be a real Singaporean medical doctor who is currently practicing medicine in Canada), but I still routinely ask a new SgForum member's background and current profession (which I noticed you've sidestepped, eg. whether you're currently a Chem private tutor or Chem MOE school teacher, but I'll leave it to you whether you wish to share on this), when I notice unusual posts (eg. if the content of the posts clearly indicate the poster is almost definitely not a JC student, this simple fact can be used to assess the honesty of the person by asking the person's background, and 4/5 times I get the less-than-honest response, "<i>I'm just a neighbourhood JC student lah</i>", ok lor if u say so...), and this (my asking the poster's background), is not so much for measuring dicks, but rather that, if the poster (ie. the person I'm talking to) turns out to not actually be a current JC student (the poster being a JC student is a reasonable initial assumption since this forum is for current JC students to ask me for help), and instead turns out that the poster (ie. any newcomer who responds to my Chem qns or asks me Chem qns) is actually currently an undergrad or post grad or fellow private tutor or MOE school teacher, then it would be wholly inappropriate (rude even) for me to appear condescending and 'talk-down' to the poster (ie. when discussing Chemistry concepts, eg. If I replied you with a "Go google or ask your school teacher on the definition of such-and-such, then get back to me with your revised answer", which would be pedagogically appropriate if you are indeed a JC student, on the other hand would naturally be offensive if you're an undergrad or post grad or fellow private tutor or MOE school teacher, something I'd rather avoid, which is why I ask of the person's background and current profession, and hope to receive an honest response.</p><p>
              Indeed, the 1 out of 5 respondents in past years, a mere handful, did reply me (sometimes through private messaging), to say they are currently an undergrad or post grad or fellow private tutor or MOE school teacher, I appreciated their candour. And it made me all the more willing to help them with their Chem questions, and with more level-appropriate replies, eg. "<i>I'd suggest you advise your students to do it this way...</i>".
              </p><p>
              All in all, tk2018 (whether you're currently an MOE teacher or private tutor or something else altogether), welcome to SgForums, and you're welcome to join me in advising and helping out Singapore JC students with their questions, although in all honesty, you'll probably be disappointed and bored with this forum, because business is slow (ie. not many JC students ask for help here), despite my sincere hopes that all Singapore JC students who can't afford private tuition, register an SgForums account to receive help with their JC subjects here (other than myself and Chemguide7 for Chemistry, Wee_Ws helps out for Mathematics, Eagle helps out for Physics and Mathematics, and Darkness_hacker99 helps out for Biology, but business (ie. students asking qns) has been so slow in recent years, that these folks only drop occasionally these days, if at all.
              </p><p>
              tk2018, if you do have your own Chemistry website, or blog, even if it's your own private tuition website, if it contains useful materials for students, not necessarily study notes, can be a collection of links to interesting Chemistry articles etc, feel free to post your url here to share with JC students (from the logged statistics, the vast majority of visitors to this forum are lurkers, and while there are certainly many private tutors and school teachers lurking here, I'll like to think that there are many genuine JC students visiting here as well, and would like to encourage them to register an SgForums account to get help for their A level subjects here, especially if they cannot afford private tuition).</p><p>

              <p><br> Appreciate your candour. Thanks for being honest about your Chem
              postgrad background.</p>
              <p>As you say this is the internet (though from a review of one's
              postings, one can more or less deduce the truthfulness of one's
              professed identity, eg. nayr69sg does appear to be a real
              Singaporean medical doctor who is currently practicing medicine in
              Canada), but I still routinely ask a new SgForum member's
              background and current profession (which I noticed you've
              sidestepped, eg. whether you're currently a Chem private tutor or
              Chem MOE school teacher, but I'll leave it to you whether you wish
              to share on this), when I notice unusual posts (eg. if the content
              of the posts clearly indicate the poster is almost definitely not a
              JC student, this simple fact can be used to assess the honesty of
              the person by asking the person's background, and 4/5 times I get
              the less-than-honest response, "<em>I'm just a neighbourhood JC
              student lah</em>", ok lor if u say so...), and this (my asking the
              poster's background), is not so much for measuring dicks, but
              rather that, if the poster (ie. the person I'm talking to) turns
              out to not actually be a current JC student (the poster being a JC
              student is a reasonable initial assumption since this forum is for
              current JC students to ask me for help), and instead turns out that
              the poster (ie. any newcomer who responds to my Chem qns or asks me
              Chem qns) is actually currently an undergrad or post grad or fellow
              private tutor or MOE school teacher, then it would be wholly
              inappropriate (rude even) for me to appear condescending and
              'talk-down' to the poster (ie. when discussing Chemistry concepts,
              eg. If I replied you with a "Go google or ask your school teacher
              on the definition of such-and-such, then get back to me with your
              revised answer", which would be pedagogically appropriate if you
              are indeed a JC student, on the other hand would naturally be
              offensive if you're an undergrad or post grad or fellow private
              tutor or MOE school teacher, something I'd rather avoid, which is
              why I ask of the person's background and current profession, and
              hope to receive an honest response.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the 1 out of 5 respondents in past years, a mere
              handful, did reply me (sometimes through private messaging), to say
              they are currently an undergrad or post grad or fellow private
              tutor or MOE school teacher, I appreciated their candour. And it
              made me all the more willing to help them with their Chem
              questions, and with more level-appropriate replies, eg. "<em>I'd
              suggest you advise your students to do it this way...</em>".</p>
              <p>All in all, tk2018 (whether you're currently an MOE teacher or
              private tutor or something else altogether), welcome to SgForums,
              and you're welcome to join me in advising and helping out Singapore
              JC students with their questions, although in all honesty, you'll
              probably be disappointed and bored with this forum, because
              business is slow (ie. not many JC students ask for help here),
              despite my sincere hopes that all Singapore JC students who can't
              afford private tuition, register an SgForums account to receive
              help with their JC subjects here (other than myself and Chemguide7
              for Chemistry, Wee_Ws helps out for Mathematics, Eagle helps out
              for Physics and Mathematics, and Darkness_hacker99 helps out for
              Biology, but business (ie. students asking qns) has been so slow in
              recent years, that these folks only drop occasionally these days,
              if at all.</p>
              <p>tk2018, if you do have your own Chemistry website, or blog, even
              if it's your own private tuition website, if it contains useful
              materials for students, not necessarily study notes, can be a
              collection of links to interesting Chemistry articles etc, feel
              free to post your url here to share with JC students (from the
              logged statistics, the vast majority of visitors to this forum are
              lurkers, and while there are certainly many private tutors and
              school teachers lurking here, I'll like to think that there are
              many genuine JC students visiting here as well, and would like to
              encourage them to register an SgForums account to get help for
              their A level subjects here, especially if they cannot afford
              private tuition).</p>

              You referring to your MOE school student or your private tuition student (it'll be easier to communicate if we just get this out in the open)?
              <p>
              So you teach / tutor others subjects other than Chemistry? What other subjects do you help out with? And can help out with on this forum?</p><p>
              So how would you help SgForum students "get into the better universities/courses"? You wish to offer your services in advising and counselling students on academic pathways? Here on SgForums, or specifically helping your own school / private tuition students?
              </p><p>
              No offence with all these questions, just that it would help facilitate clearer communication if we have a better idea of exactly what you're offering or intending to offer, specifically via this forum.</p>

              The following MCQ is a Cambridge A level MCQ, used in both the UK and Singapore papers.<p>
                  <i>When iron reacts with aqueous iron(III) ions, iron(II) ions are formed as the only product.
                  A final mixture, after the reaction has taken place, contains equal numbers of moles of Fe2+(aq)
                  and Fe3+(aq). Assuming the reaction has gone to completion, how many moles of Fe(s) and
                  Fe3+(aq) were in the starting mixture?</i></p><p>
