              <p>Hi Matt , </p>
              <p>By acknoweldging that you need some advice is already a first step to change . Well Done ! </p>
              <p>Did you check what the entry requirements are for <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Dipolma in Management Studies ? </span></p>
              <p>We are very lucky that in Singapore we are all spoilt for choices . </p>
              <p>I would like to share with you what actually happen to me. I re-took my A levels after failing the first time. So I have 2 certs . When I completed my studies in the university and wanted to find a job , I was rejected by most Goverment Agencies as I repeated my A levels . </p>
              <p>So the lesson is you have to be sure what you want in life . </p>
              <p>You are still young , the road ahead for you is very long . Take some time to reflect and decide where you want to do in life . Do you want to be an employee which gives you a salary and a sense of secuirty or do you want to be your own boss and worry that your staff dont turn up for work or your creditors dont pay you or the banks stop lending you. </p>
              <p>My advice for your is to finish what you are doing right now . If possible , be a top student in ITE . If you parents can send your abroad after that , then go for it . The last thing you want is to do this course half way and then another course halfway and by the time you realised , you are 30 years old . </p>
              <p>In the working world , paper qulaification is only 10% , 90% will be your ability to perform.</p>
              <p>I have seen scholars who join the working world and because they do not perform , they are left one corner to rot. Studying is not difficult. You just need to spend less time on watching TV , playing computer games and chatting with friends. You will just get used to it . </p>
              <p>If you need any further advice , just let me know .... hope I help you a liitle .... It is all up to you :) Cheers ....</p>

              <p>Dear Matt , Maths is a important component in Engineering ,Financial and Business Management ,if you dun have good grades in maths , u must at least be able to do maths like quadratic equation , functions for Bachelor Science in Management .</p>
              <p>I feel that you hate being an ITE student and yet Dip in Management with the minimum grade entice you . Beware, SIM is a everything needs money school , they dun care whether your grades is good or not . If you really like Dip in Management , go for it</p>
              <p>and brush up your maths , nobody is destined to score badly for maths ,just adopt a motivated atitude towards subject and you will succeed .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My student who were score badly for maths ,main reason is they do not grasp concept strong and spent time playing online games .</p>
              <p>sincerely yours</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's better if you retake your O levels and then pursue your diploma. Because at the end of the day, there is no shortcut in life.. Everyone's got to learn it the hard way and everyone should have screwed up at least once in their life. But that doesn't mean you have to give up. Singapore's education system is really rigid so I suggest..,at least get decent grades for your O levels. You can do it. If you need any help for e math, english, chemistry, physics, I'd be glad to help.. If you're keen on restarting from the basics for O levels, you could SMS/whatsapp me at 96662264.</p></div>
