              <p>Suggest why the size of atoms increase on going down the group. Here's taking a look at what I wrote:</p>
              <p>As we go down the group, the relative radii of the atoms increases. This is because the atoms have more electrons down the group, thus the size of atoms increases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why the size of atoms decrease on going across a period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on going across a period, the relative radii of the atoms of the elements decreases. This is due to the increasing number of protons in the nucleus. Protons make little contribution to the size of atoms, but they increase the positive charge of the nucleus, as a result, drawing the electrons into tighter orbitals. Thus size of atoms decrease on going across a period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do these suffice?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then there's another question</p>
              <p>The following results were obtained in experiment on the solubility of sucrose in water performed at T deg cel.</p>
              <p>Mass of evaporating dish = 25.0 g</p>
              <p>Mass of evaporating dish + saturated solution of sucrose = 200.0g</p>
              <p>Mass of evaporating dish + sucrose = 150.0g</p>
              <p>From these results (eh, there's also a solubility curve that tells me the solubility of sucrose in 100g of water at different temperatures), work out the value of T.</p>
              <p>I only need a rough guide on how to obtain the value of T since I can't provide you guys the graph.</p>

              <p>For the 1st question, you should include "shielding" or "screening" (ie. due to electron-electron repulsion) effect into your answer. Both down a Group (increasing number of electron shells between the nucleus and valence shell, result in increasing shielding effect), and across a period (approximately same shielding effect since they have same number of inner shell electrons; shielding effect is most significant from inner shell electrons; additional slight shielding effect from increasing valence shell electrons are outweighed by increasing nuclear charge across a period).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the solubility question, you probably want to scan and upload a graphic of the actual question including graph, to avoid any misunderstanding of any aspects of the question. Regardless, I'll leave it to others to comment on this question.</p>

              <p>I will assume the mass of water to be 50g  and amount of sucrose dissolved to be 125g base on what is given. If that is so, 100g of water will dissolve 250g of sucrose so u get the T from that amount.</p>

              <p>By the way is C60O3 a simple molecular structure made up of large molecules? If yes, it should have a high melting and boiling point... and perhaps, it can''t conduct electricity?</p>
              <p>Never heard of this substance before, so i'm quite curious about it.</p>

              <p>C60O3 is 1 molecule by itself which is a ball shape with the
              'ball' made up of 60 C atoms.</p>
              <p>C60s are relatively new in science being discovered about 20+
              years ago and research is still being done on their applications
              etc.</p>
              <p>If you are interested in them, feel free to go readup on
