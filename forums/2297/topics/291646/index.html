We were only taught Cold War and Global Economy, so questions 2,3,4 and 5 were the questions i could do. So with alot of content, it was quite easy.<br><br>Qn 2) Korean War a CW conflict, i talked about the nature and the impact of the Korean War which is similar and different to how the CW started and progressed<br><br>Qn 3) Talk about collaspe of commumism first that led to collaspe of USSR. Then talk about other reasons for the collaspe of USSR lor. (eg, US role)<br><br>Qn 4) i felt that the rapid recovery of the western economy that led to the growth of the global economy is actually the result of a few reasons such as US role, bretton woods and so on. (so u have to link it first to rapid recovery, then growth).<br><br>Then other reasons for the growth of the economy like rise of mixed economic, external circumstances and all those..<br><br>Qn 5) i didnt do it coz i forget what protectionism was.<br><br>*edit* question 4 didnt talk about recovery of Japan, only western europe and i'm not so confident about my answers either...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to lansin.party: For ur info, i'm from SRJC. Well, the tutors drill u with essay questions all the time. We do at least 3 timed-practice essay for both SEA and Int each week after prelims and after mid years, i didnt do much revision except read thru. For the last 2 weeks of official sch day, we did ALL schools prelim question, discuss them, write down main points.<br><br>Our structure of the essay is like that.<br><br>-1 background/thesis/aim paragraph<br>-6 body paragraphs<br>-1 conclusion<br>-must be 4 pages without leaving lines.<br><br>BUT they sux at spotting SBQ, totally OUT OUT AND OUT!!<br><br>I'm not smart and the teachers are not pro. The essay question just seem to be quite "expected" for me, the outline was long in my head. It is just whether my content is accurate, thats all. Don't be surprised that i only get a C grade, bcoz most of the time i got the main points and outline correct, but my content is screwed up. sometimes only less than 10 dates and no quotes at all.<br><br>*edit* oh yes and btw... we SRJCians always grumble why we have to write 6 body paragraphs while other schools do less tha I heard from my fren de...<br><br>to 798: i replied u on sms le, so no need here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh lansin.party, why not i give u a sample of the answer scheme? it will be dam hard for me to search the pile of junk that i'm gonna throw away... 4 tall stacks of it in total.. LOL<br><br>pls state that what area of the answer or essay u need. for ur info, i only learn Cold War, Global Economy, Challenges to SEA Independence and Decolonisation. I dont learn inter-state tension and religious fundamentalism thingy.<br><br>*edit* oh yes and btw, my sch doesnt normally post out the top essay, they prefer to follow their own answer scheme and make us copy the corrections during all test. The corrections are normally A - B grade but i only have 1 top essay about the Pax Americana thingy which we didnt learn and this guy just did a back-up for the whole history cohort. so u wan it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, the 24/25 essay would be super awesome if you have the time to dig through your stack! 0_0 24/25 is a super high, totally unachievable score? haha must see what godly answer they give. (pop it into my email in the profile if you can! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">)<br><br>If not, the answer schemes would be excellent too. haha just pass me as many as you are willing to scan, must see see and compare standard. Although i'm sure given how hardworking your teachers are, it'll be quite godly. haha.<br><br>Thanks so much akinos! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> is the whole SRJC that hardworking or just the history department? oh is any forum pple are reading this thread, can post about how your school studies history? we can crown the Most Champion History Mugging College award on sgforums <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
