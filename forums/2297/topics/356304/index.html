              <p>1.I have a question on finding the current flowing through each branch of a parallel circuit. Is it possible to find the current flowing through each branch using proportion method when you have the value of the total current flowing through and the resistance of each component? I tried using this method, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>
              <p>Does it work(using proportion method) if you want to find resistance when you have info. on the current flowing through and also the potential difference of whole circuit? Or is it simply that you CÄN'T use proportion method at all?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. In both parallel and series circuit, does having a<strong> higher voltage</strong> mean that that particular component in each circuit is brighter?</p>
              <p>If for example you have 2 resistors of the same resistance in both parallel and series circuit, which circuit will have the more brightly lit bulbs? (Just a query)</p>
              <p>Yea, these are all the doubts I have in my mind. Do help in wherever way possible. Having Physics Practice exam tomorrow, in real need of help. Thanks.</p>

              <p>You can use, but in an inverse way. But it is harder when we work with parallel circuits of 3 branches and above.</p>
              <p>Instead of doing that, take it as voltage is constant in all the branches, and I = V/R, to calculate. It will reduce confusion a lot.</p>
              <p>The proportion method for series circuit also stems from I = V/R anyway</p>

                                      resistance when you have info. on the current flowing through
                                      and also the potential difference of whole circuit? Or is it simply
                                      that you CÄN'T use proportion method at all?</em></p>
              <p>Ans: As eagle says, proportional method works. But it is an inverse proportion method. Let's say total current is 6A and it is split into two paralle branches, with resistance at the top branch to be y and the resistance at the bottom to be 2y (where y is any arbitiary number). I'm assuming this is the question you got without information on the voltage. What you just need to remember is that the voltage is the same in both branches in parallel circuit. Recall V=IR.</p>
              <p>Let's compare both the branches. The bottom branch has 2 times the resistance as compared to the top branch. Since V is the same, therefore it follows that the current in the bottom branch(i.e z) should be half the current as in the top branch(i.e 2z).</p>
              <p>If you're still confused,</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Top branch</strong></span></p>
              <p>V=IR=2z*y=2zy</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Bottom branch</strong></span></p>
              <p>V=IR=z*2y=2zy</p>
