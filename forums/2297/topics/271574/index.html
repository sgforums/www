            <div class='col-md body'>What has happened to me:<br><br>For my first 2 years in NUS, I was very consistent in my work. I did tutorials, attended all lectures, and make sure I understood at least 70% of the work that was taught throughout the semester.<br><br>When the final exams come, I managed to finish studying everything within a month. So I thought: well, why is there a need for consistency when I can finish studies in a month, and score well.<br><br>I didn't understood it properly, until I went for my student exchange. I travelled, toured, and played a lot. It was only 1-2 days before the exams that I studied. I could not fully understand many of the concepts, nor could I 'memorise' them because the time is too short. Yes, I passed, but it was not a good pass in my standards. I could have done better. Fortunately for me, I only require a pass for my modules during my student exchange; the grades do not affect my CAP.<br><br>I totally understood the importance of consistency ever since. It helps you understand your work earlier, and sets the foundation for a quicker and more efficient revision before exams. It also gives more self-confidence to approach exam materials. Imagine not knowing how much more time you need to fully complete your revision, the feeling of not having studied enough before enter the exam hall, and the dreadful feeling of having done below par during your exams. It was not that the modules were easy and hence I could finish my earlier revisions fast; it was the fact that I have already internalised the foundations of the modules.<br><br>The moral of the story is: Please understand your work as you go along. Working hard is important, but understanding your work is more important. There's no point working so hard with only half understood.</div>
