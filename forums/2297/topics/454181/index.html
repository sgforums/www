In sec 3 i used to be holding triple sciences. however not long after, i realised i could not cope well :( By sec 4, i dropped my pure bio. despite that, i realised things still aint going rite... my grades was horrendous. literally terrifying. most probably due to the fact that im a pretty lazy person. My chem and amath was very very weak. i really really dont want to retain, nither do badly for my o's. but is it too late now that i wanna improve? i really dont want to dissapoint my mum whom held high hopes for me...</p></div>

              <p>To be blunt about it, good tuition is the most effective way to improve dramatically in a short period of time. Of course, the best tuition in the world is totally useless, if you don't put in the diligence and effort required on your own part.</p>
              <p>And because tuition is not always feasible (eg. due to financial constraints), the next best thing is to form study groups with (reliable and committed) friends, and to (perhaps as a study group) consult your teachers for guidance on specific questions. </p>

              <p>to TS: Try to improve until everything is A2, do not think that it is impossible, it is way possible. If you can even A1 but an A2 is decent enough , 12 points which can safely go to many jcs. </p>
              <p>Chem practice TYS at least 4 rounds every paper</p>
              <p>SS as per normal, spot 3 out of 5 themes</p>
              <p>A and E maths, practice all the questions in your textbooks at least once</p>
              <p>Econs, I really pity you that you are taking such a content heavy subject in o levels, I seen the syllabus and as a JC H2 econs student, that seems quite a lot for a subject in O level as the syllabus of O level should be at least 20 times easier than A levels but for your econs, it is only 15 times easier, this goes for other electives. Understand concepts, like price elascity of demand is the percentage change in quantity (note it is quantity) demanded with respect to a percentage change in price, (certis parabus!!!!!). And please give examples, like price inelastic is rice (wide definition of good and small percentage of income spent) etc...</p>
              <p>Formulae will help in essays also. CSQ , if there is, is to answer question based on sources. </p>
              <p>HCL and English is standard testing, but for chinese I will say that to impress is for you to write grammatically correct chinese for 8 sides and sound logic will give you at least 50 /70 for essays.</p>
              <p>Physics practice again and definitions please get this correct</p>
              <p>Jiayou for O levels</p>
              <p>Speaking from past experience of O levels, A1s for all subjects except EL </p>

You need to plan your time efficiently to tackle the huge amount of required information. You need a large amount of discipline to pull this through, so you might want to ask your parents to help supervise you.</p>
