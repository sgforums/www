              <p>Thank you very much, as this helped me SOOOOOO much. Honestly, I don't like people to just give me the answer, as I somehow find it irritating and somewhat immoral. (?)</p>
              <p>The slangs are easy to get used to for me, since I'm not exactly American, and not quite as ignorant. I was born in Argentina (lol), and by now I'm fluent in a few languages (not to brag), everything pretty much falls into place for me. I was a bit puzzled about something for a bit, but then I realized that it's just a laugh. (lol) Thank you for your concern.</p>
              <p>Oh, and I do realize that in every other country, 16-year-olds know more, because Americans are retards. (Not to put anyone down, of course, but it's the truth. The sad and awful truth.) My College Chemistry book, special edition for Salt Lake Community <strong>College, </strong>didn't have anything to help me with this, even though it's for Biology. (btw, both are college classes.) (And yes, I <strong>am</strong> in high school.)(secondary education)</p>
              <p>Once again, thank you. I will have to continue studying tomorrow because right now it's 2:17 AM, and I am exhausted. (sorry if nobody cares)</p>

              <p>So basically if the element gains an electron, it has a positive charge, and vise versa, right?</p>
              <p>If this is true, does the element with the smallest amount of valence electrons always lose the one or two?</p>
              <p>For H, is it H-Li+? (subscript)</p>
              <p>And for the second part, Li, Be, Na, Mg, K, and Ca all can form ionic bonds, and H can but only if it's bonded with another metal, since it's not a metal itself, right? And out of all these, only H can form a covalent bond, because all the others are metals, and only non-metal atoms can form covalent bonds, right? (#_#)</p>
              <p>I know this isn't exactly a part of my homework, but what role does the reactiveness of an element have to do with the bonds?</p>

              <p>So basically if the element gains an electron, it has a positive
                                      charge, and vise versa, right?</p>
              <p><strong>No. If an element gains an electron, it has a negative charge, and vice versa.</strong></p>
              <p>If this is true, does the element with the smallest amount of
                                      valence electrons always lose the one or two?</p>
              <p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
              <p>For H, is it H-Li+? (subscript)</p>
              <p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
              <p>And for the second part, Li, Be, Na, Mg, K, and Ca all can form
                                      ionic bonds <strong>(when only with a non-metal)</strong>, and H can but only if it's bonded with another metal,
                                      since it's not a metal itself, right? And out of all
                                      these, only H can form a covalent bond, because all the others are
                                      metals, and only non-metal atoms can form covalent bonds,
                                      right? (#_#)</p>
              <p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
              <p>I know this isn't exactly a part of my homework, but what role
                                      does the reactiveness of an element have to do with the bonds?</p>
              <p><strong>A more reactive metal forms the bonds more easily.You'll learn more about it when you're studying properties of the periodic table.</strong></p>
