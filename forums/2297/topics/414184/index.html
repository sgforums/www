              <p>Thank you Ellissiaw.</p>
              <p>I feel grateful enough if it is considered "one of the thousands of success stories," and I never meant my story to be better than others in the first place.</p>
              <p>However, to answer your question, personally my real passion lies in 1) agribusiness, 2) inspiring weak students who have low self-esteem, as well as 3) alleviating poverty.</p>
              <p>Allow me to briefly explain #2 and #3.</p>
              <p>In United States, 80% of African American do not graduate from Highschool. The political climate is in such a challenging and dire situation because it is a really sensitive topic, and no one dares to talk about it. However, if we think about it, whose fault is it that they have been born African American? Whose fault is it that people are born to an imprisoned father or a drunken mother? It is disheartening to know that in today's society, many of the children's future had been set by the time they are born. In United States in particular, speaking about the example I mentioned it is particularly difficult for African American because the majority of the children are born to a single Mom who are 14 or 15. Many African American teenagers who go to school are also considered "acting White," going to school is just beyond their social norms. One of my professors in fact told me that the only way we can help these children is to take away their child from their parents as soon as they are born, and put them to camps - similar to those of military camps.</p>
              <p>Of course, I am ready to face many skepticisms, but since you are asking about my plan for the future, these are the kind of problems that are close to my heart.</p>
