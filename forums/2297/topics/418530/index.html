              <p>Hi Users,</p>
              <p>I'm just curious to find out if your first term GPA in june exam series is 3.7, can you improve your grades and get 4.0 GPA for the 2nd term or there's no way for you to make it all the way to 4.0 GPA. I'm a first year student and i find the Grade Point Average streaming confusing which often end myself distraught after examinations.</p>
              <p>I attained 4.0 GPA early this year and i'm worried about others whom will catch up after regretting. is there by any chance for them to get 4.0 GPA if they got a GPA of 4.0 or &lt;??. Well, i'm asking such question because i don't want those 3 pointers to be 4 pointers at the final exams because they are lazy to study for all 3 terms.. i mean it's a great insult to me if i studied hard and mantain a 4 pointer all the way till i graduate.. 4 terms in all and those 1 pointers whom laze around from June exam 2010 all the way to Dec Exam 2011 - their graduate year and suddenly become from 1.0 GPA to 4.0 GPA...</p>
              <p>Please help me with this. thanks!</p>

              <p>Look, when u graduate, (I poly student but there is nothing much difference), they look at your average GPA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yes, it is possible for someone to flunk like GPA 3.0 or even below to get things like GPA 3.5 or GPA 4.0 especially if that term is on industrial attachment / in-house project (Poly has, not sure ITE got or not) but they wont get overall GPA 4.0.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg in theoritical sense:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U -&gt; First 3 terms GPA 4.0, 4th &amp; 5th term GPA 3.9 and 6th term GPA 4.0 = 3.966666666666667 = 3.97 GPA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your friends -&gt; 1st term GPA 1.5, 2nd term GPA 1.0, 3rd term GPA 2.7, 4th term GPA 3.4, 5th term GPA 3.7 and 6th term GPA 4.0 = 2.716666666666667 = 2.72 GPA</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See the difference? But anyway, life in ITE, poly or JC is not always about grades. CCA is also important as the sense to get better chance to appeal / scholarship and such and seriously a person with better CCA / life wont be so hurt when the GPA drops, which under most people's case will face this once or twice in their ITE / poly life.</p>

              <p>Don't understand your question </p>
              <p>1. How could people not be present in an exam unless they didn't go for it?</p>
              <p>2. How could a lazy people suddenly jump from GPA 1.0 to 4.0 if they are lazy all the way?? They hack into the school system???</p>
              <p>Not to insult or critisise but if you phrase it carefully maybe i could answer it more clearlt.</p>

              <p>The GPA in each respective sem does not affect each other. Thus, you can have 1.00 for the 1st sem, 4.00 for the 2nd sem, 0.00 for the 3rd sem.</p>
              <p>However, the GPA for each sem will affect your CGPA. The CGPA is similar to your GPA, but it takes the grades of all of your semesters into calculation.</p>
              <p>Your final results are dependent on your CGPA.</p>
              <p>If you have 4.00 for all three sems of yours, your CGPA will be 4.00 when you graduate. If your buddies have less than 4.00 for any of the sems, it is impossible for them to get 4.00 for their CGPA, as all of the sems are taken into calculation.</p>
