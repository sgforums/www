              <p>hello.</p>
              <p>i need some real serious advice here.</p>
              <p>i took my o levels when i was 17 years old back in 2007,and failed. with only 2 passes (?) C5 in english and chinese..</p>
              <p>at 18,i decided to go NS first,and served my 2 years</p>
              <p>at 20,i ord. went out to work .. now i am 22.. </p>
              <p>my income is quite low,when i am working because i have no cert and i can only work as odd job,and i dont come from a good family,and try my best not to burden them with finance issues.. </p>
              <p>being 22 now,i hope to work 1 more year to save money of course,and study again when i reach 23,so that i can get a better job,with a better future.</p>
              <p>but i dont know how to go about it,do i retake O level or go ITE? </p>
              <p>i have not pick up a pen for about 5 years already,if i retake O level,what kind of subject do i need to go for a course in poly? and if i go ITE,it takes 1 extra year compare to pte o level.. </p>
              <p>also , being so old now, is there a age gap between me and those teens.. and those full time courses,does it mean that i have to be in school for a long period of time,before i can be free,and hopefully find a part time job to cope?</p>
              <p>yeah its tough and hardcore,but i really need a cert cause,i dont want to be like this forever with no breakthrough..</p>

              <p>Retaking 'O' levels as a private candidate (if possible, self-study while working part-time, if full time work doesn't allow you time to study) and then moving onto a diploma in one of the polys, is your best forseeable path now.</p>
              <p>If you wish to have as many poly course available to you, take triple pure science and double mathematics, and do well (minimum 'B' grade) for every subject. However, this certainly won't be easy, especially since as you've mentioned, you don't have the finances for tuition and have to rely on self-study.</p>
              <p>But when there's a will, there's a way. And you're certainly professing the will now, so (even if no one else makes a way for you), promise yourself you'll persevere no matter what and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span></strong> make a way for yourself.</p>

              <p><br>Sounds like you definitely need tuition to even pass 'O' levels.</p>
              <p>And to take engineering in the poly, you may need (you'll have to check this out yourself by visiting the poly websites) pure Physics and 'A' math (in addition to 'E' math). You should also want to take pure Chemistry if you want to be eligible for poly Chemistry based courses, eg. Chemical Engineering.</p>
              <p>If the polys accept combined science grade for engineering courses, most likely they'll only accept it if it's an A1 or A2 grade. Even in terms of risks of eligibility, there are pros and cons with taking Pure vs Combined Science.</p>
              <p>As for minimum 'O' level grades required for individual courses, the info should be on the poly websites as well. But there is no such thing as 'guarantee', especially for the more popular courses. If you're asking what grade you should aim for, the answer is obvious : distinction 'A' grade for every subject you sit for.</p>

              <p>91 has made valid points. It might be safer to go ITE rather than 'O' levels, but the 'O' level route is faster to a diploma. In other words, risk versus reward.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, you (syrax) have to decide what's best for yourself, and take self-responsibility for your own choices.</p>

              <p>True, there are many real-life examples of people around without an 'O' level cert, but earn well above 10k, 20k, 50k etc, being a successful insurance agent, property agent, entrepreneur, etc.</p>
              <p>Certificates and paper qualifications only prepare you to be a salaried employee. Often, the most successful people are the ones whom are their own bosses, and when you're your own boss, you certainly don't care about your own paper qualifications, but you might care about the paper qualifications of your employees.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong choice in life. You have to decide which path you wish to walk, and take self-responsibility for walking it.</p>

              <p>being own boss,need to have capital.. often i think most people will work for others first before venturing out themselves.. right now i no skill no cert,no background.. and dont have that luck or talent.. sometimes,one person will work very hard,for a company,helping a company to profit,the one that gain the most advantage is the boss,then when the company is making losses,those people,such as me,will be the first one facing the cut.. i want an iron rice bowl :(</p>
              <p>so dont think so far first.. at least i have a cert and have a safety net to catch me if i fall.. but i dont know how to do it.. i think now,if i go ITE,come out,24-25 yrs old,go poly,come out,28 years old (that makes me very very old and sad,cant compete with those 17 year old teen)</p>
              <p>that time,i dont have a choice,i cannot study for O level,due to family prob,need come out and work.. its really really f*** up.. so people please give me some good advice,i need to steer myself back on the right path again :(</p>

              <p>Go ITE without doubt. First thing you should think of is not about a poly, for you, a gpa of 3.5 is as hard as getting a full O level cert. Do you best there,  if you can get a 3.5, congratz and move to poly; if not, at least you have an ITE diploma which allows you earn at least 1.5K per month.</p>
              <p>Age in those insititutions are not an issue, in ITE and Poly, there are always adults learners like you, though minority.</p>
              <p>In fact, the pain you are suffering now is the consequence of your choice 8 or 9 years ago, isn't it. Singapore is a relatively fair society, the harder you work as a student, the easier your life will be as an adult.</p>

              <p>Those working harder to get into a poly after Os, can only start with a 1.6K-2K after graduation, what makes you think you should earn more than them.</p>
              <p>The better the qualification you are holding, the brighter your furture is. Some poly graduates starts from 1.6K but can hit 4K in 5 or 6 years time. When they start to have some spare money, they may choose to upgrade their qualification so that they can advance further. You may perfer your monthly 1.5K cash for your whole life, it is your life, so the choice is yours.</p>
              <p>CPF is not a bad thing, every $400 you pay, the employer are to deposit another $300 for you. If you do not have CPF at all, you cannot even feed yourself in your later stage of life (perhaps 20 years or even longer).</p>

              Take one step at a time. Take ITE certification first.  Easier than O level as they have teachers to teach and guide you.
