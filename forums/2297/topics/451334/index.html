                  </p><p>In my opinion people think that mathematics is the most difficult subject!! I have made an research about that what is the reason behind their thinking and I found that their basics are not so good as most of the people thought only about how to solve the problem and don't try to understand the logic behind it and most of the teachers also don't take much interest in explaining the students in simpler and different way and that's why the student feel bored in understanding it .I would love to hear suggestions from you also. </p>

              <p>Hi harun5539,</p>
              <p>  Yes, many find the subject difficult because of the typical algorithmic approach to teaching it and the lack of transparency in the thinking process behind the solution.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>

              <p>I subjects that are difficult are those that require you to really think and question about the things that you learn . It's not something that comes easily with practice.</p>Ie. Philosophy
              it forces you to think deeper into issues..not just accepting things on the surface.

              <p>For me,</p>
              <p>Maths is easy because practice makes prefect(u can get 100 for maths). Just do alot of assessment books qns(sch qns sometimes too simple).</p>
              <p>Other subject such as English is harder because practice don't make prefect. If you want to improve on english, u need to do more than mugging assessment books. Then again, it is possible to pass english even if u don't study but not for maths.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, Just Education is one of the successfully local business franchise which promote maths and other all education like English and Science although the fee are a little expensive. As from overseas schools and their maths methods, there is an well-known Japanese school called  Sakamoto <span class="st">Educational Systems : <a href="http://www.sakamoto.net">http://www.sakamoto.net</a> </span>that was popular in promoting maths follow by a<span class="st">bacus class from CMA Singapore founded by a Taiwan trainer : <a href="http://www.cma.edu.sg">http://www.cma.edu.sg</a> . so is another Malaysia abacus company in Singapore called SIP Abacus &amp; Brain Exercise, Singapore : <a href="http://www.sipbrainpower.sg">http://www.sipbrainpower.sg</a> . </span></p>

              <p>Would suggest u read 'Mathematics and the Physical World' by Morris Kline.</p>
              <p>Yes agree that Math is being taught in a colorless manner to students here. Students neither have the time nor inclination to go deeper. It's a pity a typical good A-level student can integrate this function or differentiate that function flawlessly without even understanding the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Or that he is able to apply Newton's laws efficiently to solve dynamics problems without ever enquiring how Newton arrived at his laws.</p>

              <p>I think the problem is that we either live in the wrong time/age or Singapore is not an "learning" environment for good studying.</p>
              <p>For wrong time, for example concepts like golden ratio was invented by Greek when there is no technology to assist or there is some story that they invented it to "measure" a person whether they are handsome or pretty just because they have no entertainment like TV during their time</p>
              <p>Today with modern high tech computer for area in engineering plus media like 3D LED television and movie, Internet, computer games like RPG online game, playstation and kinect, it is not surpised that people who rather place their focus in having fun rather than "crack" their brain. I bet if Albert Einstein is born in our time, you would heard that he <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">might</span></strong> be turn out to be the creator of angry bird rather than E=MC<span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 11pt;     "><sup>2. </sup></span></p>
              <p>   For Singapore environment, we all know that our country run by "meritocratic" guidelines, meaning only those who scored high marks in examination are recognized  instead of people who know how the formula work but didn't have the examination skill to compete the test on time. Again those who read Einstein 's bio know that he did not graduate with formal degrees, but due to the impact of his freelance paper "The Theory of General Relativity", Princeton University is willing to accept him in an open-mind way, but in Singapore I doubt the same situation will happen cos we know they would rather "woo" the FT and also believe in efficient without any failure.</p>

              is absolutely correct it depends on teachers  to make subject

              <p>I agree with Harun5539 that people do not learn the basics and jump into solving problems, making Maths seems so difficult.</p>
              <p>But want to add on that attitude plays a very important part.</p>
              <p>I have come across many students, who before they read the question, says "very hard", "don't understand", "cannot do".</p>
              <p>Attitude.</p>
              <p>I can teach a Pri 5, Maths from A-Level, such as Integration. But that is rare.</p>
              <p>No, the boy is not super intelligent, just that he have a keen interest in Maths.</p>
              <p>But of course, with his attitude, he out-performs his peers in most things.</p>

              <p><br>Apart from reasons from Primary School and JC aside, Maths is usefully if you are in the finanical sector like in accounting for example. If you are an stock trader, you also need maths as part of technical analysis tools like Scholastic , MACD to calculate the moving average trend to decide whether they are resistance or support before making an decision</p>
              <p>As for engineering especially in Mechanical area, you need maths to built bridge,aircraft and building etc, if you are in Navy, you need maths to read grid reference and calculated distance in the map to see how long it take to reach your destination.</p>
              <p>If people are interested to read maths in an entertaining way, I recommend another teen/adult book which is written in an amazing illustrated art books called Brainmatics written by Ivan Moscovich and published by Ullmann Publishing : <a href="http://www.ullmann-publishing.com/en/homepage">http://www.ullmann-publishing.com/en/homepage</a></p>
              <p>Finally another way to stimulate interest in maths for reader are multimedia like flash : <a href="http://www.heymath.com">http://www.heymath.com</a> or educational software e.g from Pearson School  : <a href="http://www.phdirect.com">http://www.phdirect.com</a></p>

              <p>Most do not realise having maths is an asset even in the realm of the social sciences.</p>
              <p> I would add that the way maths was taught, in such technical ways, the maths that I learnt wasn't of terrific use at all.</p>
              <p>The ability to apply, the ability to interprete, are sorely lacking in the syllabus.</p>

              <p><br>Most of the time, only the practical Maths are useful in our lives.</p>
              <p>Like when you buy a computer, how much RAM you need. Or the size of your hard disk if you are an art student, or you love to download movies. Compared to just using it for business mails and communications.</p>
              <p>Buy house, can you manage the mortgage?</p>
              <p>Fuel efficiency of your car?</p>
              <p>How to be on time for your appointment but not set off too early?</p>
              <p>Beyond that Maths is useful in Engineering, Accounting, Insurance, Civil, Statistics, Financial, etc.</p>
