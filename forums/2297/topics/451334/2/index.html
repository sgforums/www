              <p>I think Olymiad Maths is an international education event and it purpose are for exchange for maths idea around the world. If you read the history of the organization who start this, a lot of other well-known countries like US and UK are also in the list the concept just like the olymipic sport. </p>
              <p>Another point is although some of the question look like brain teasers, there are still other that are revelent to every day life and also help to develop logic skills. For example :</p>
              <p>Money :</p>
              <p>1) Barbara has 20 coins consisting of 5¢ coins and 10¢ coins. If the 5¢ coins were 10¢ coins and the 10¢ coins were 5¢ coins, she would have 30¢ more than she has now.How many 10¢ coins did she have at the beginning ?</p>
              <p>Task Calculation :</p>
              <p>A work team of 4 people completes half of a job in 15 days. How many days will it takes a team of 10 people to complete the remaining half of the job? (Assume that each person of both teams works at the same rate as each of the other people.)</p>
              <p>There was this flight of steps. For the first time, Mrs Bean walked up some steps and ran 6 steps in 65 seconds. For the second time, Mrs Bean walked up some steps and ran 14 steps in 41 seconds. How long will she take to walk up this flight of steps ?</p>
              <p>Foods :</p>
              <p>Josie has some chocolate and butter cookies. If she packs a chocolate with a butter cookie, there will be 60 butter cookies left. If she packs every 2 chocolate cookies with 3 butter cookies, there will be 50 chocolate cookies left. How many cookies does she have in all ?</p>
              <p> Finally if your rally want to learn practical maths, speed calculation would be an usefully skill. Scott Flansburg "The Human Calculator" Maths Magic methods would be a good way to learn maths : <a href="http://scottflansburg.com/">http://scottflansburg.com</a></p>

              <p>It is because Math is traditionally taught the wrng way!</p>
              <p>It should be taught with different strategies and then people ought to be able to pick which method works for them!</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE — A student from St Joseph’s Institution International has topped the Mathematics paper in last November’s Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams, beating thousands of students worldwide.</p>
              <p>  Earlier this month, Nathan Darius, 17, an Indonesian who came to Singapore two years ago, received the Top in the World award from Cambridge — an award that recognises students who scored the highest marks in the world for a single subject in the IGCSE.</p>
              <p>  The IGCSE is the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16-year-olds. It is taken in 144 countries and more than 2,900 schools worldwide annually.</p>
              <p>  He told TODAY: “I like mathematics because I can put mathematical concepts I’ve learnt into real life contexts, such as counting money. It also helps me to improve my thinking skills and think beyond what is written in the textbook.”</p>
              <p>  Nathan, who wants to be a surgeon or paediatrician, added: “I feel very proud and happy of this achievement. During the exam, I did my best and did not think about anything else.”</p>
              <p>  According to SJI International, he is the first student from the school to score the highest in an IGCSE exam. A total of 92 Grade 10 students from the school sat for the IGCSE Mathematics paper last year, of which 20 achieved the highest grade of A*.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>They learn concepts through games and pick up study and leadership skills</p>
              <p>  IT WAS a mathematics boot camp with a difference for 69 primary school pupils this week.</p>
              <p>  From Wednesday to yesterday, these Primary 4 and 5 pupils wrestled with numbers and geometry, with help from Indian self-help group Sinda. They also picked up social and leadership skills.</p>
              <p>  The stay-in camp, held at Hill Lodge in Mount Vernon Road, was part of Sinda's long-term plan to improve Indian pupils' academic performance. It was introduced after a strategic review last year revealed that one in four was failing mathematics in the Primary School Leaving Examination.</p>
              <p>  To address this, Sinda has expanded its tuition programmes to include pre-school children.</p>
              <p>  Its existing programmes - which help build a love for reading, provide small-group tuition and zero in on English, mathematics and science - aim to raise Indian students' performance by 2020.</p>
              <p>  Sinda has also been running workshops on teaching and parenting techniques.</p>
              <p>  This year, it has budgeted $16.8 million to reach its goals, which is $1.8million more than last year.</p>
              <p>  Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, speaking at last year's Sinda Youth Leaders' Seminar, said there was a need to find teaching methods that differed from conventional ones, particularly to teach those who have problems in maths.</p>
              <p>  The boot camp this week, for example, introduced its participants to mathematical concepts with applications in real life: The pupils tried out cooking with maths, and went on a geometry-themed treasure hunt.</p>
              <p>  They also learnt how to revise their school work effectively with mind maps and attended motivational workshops to boost their confidence and interpersonal skills.</p>
              <p>  Brijesh Chaube, 10, said he is more confident about applying his problem-solving skills now that he is more familiar with the way questions are asked.</p>
              <p>  He also said the hands-on activities were a refreshing change from the classroom.</p>
              <p>  The East Spring Primary School pupil said: "It was fun and engaging because we got to play games that involved maths. If you don't forget the games, you won't forget the maths."</p>
              <p>  Ten-year-old Nur Shafeeqa, from St Anthony's Primary School, said the camp helped her overcome her shyness: "I didn't know anyone at first, but I now have more than 10 new friends."</p>
              <p>  Mr Anbarasu Rajendran, the director of Sinda's education division, encouraged people to volunteer their time to help run Sinda's programmes.</p>
              <p>  He said: "We want to empower these kids to strive for excellence in a fun way."</p>

              <p><br>STUDENT Lim Jeck has become the first Singaporean to clinch the top spot in a prestigious mathematics competition.</p>
              <p>  The 17-year-old beat 547 other youngsters to rank first in this year's edition of the International Mathematical Olympiad in Mar del Plata, Argentina.</p>
              <p>  In the week-long contest which ended on Sunday, pre-university students attempted to solve six questions, each worth up to seven points. The top 9 per cent were awarded gold medals.</p>
              <p>  Jeck's perfect score of 42 was a first for a Singaporean, and the only one in this year's competition. He pipped South Korea's Kim Dong Ryul, who scored 40, and Bobby Shen of the United States, who scored 39.</p>
              <p>  The National University of Singapore (NUS) High School student's win meant he went one better than last year, when he finished second.</p>
              <p>  Then 16, he qualified for a gold medal along with three other teammates. The four-gold haul was Singapore's best showing to date, and the six-man team placed third overall. But this year, the Republic slipped to seventh out of 100 countries, with Jeck the only gold medallist.</p>
              <p>  NUS High's Ling Yan Hao, and Raffles Institution's (RI) Ryan Kor and Lee You Jun took silver, while Lawrence Li from RI and Ang Yan Sheng from NUS High took bronze.</p>
              <p>  South Korea came in first, with all six team members taking gold. China placed second while the US came in third.</p>
              <p>Singapore started taking part in the 53-year-old competition in 1988. Before last year, it had won gold only once, in 1996.</p>
              <p>  The Straits Times was unable to reach Jeck yesterday, as the Republic's team was in the midst of travelling home. They are expected to arrive in Singapore this afternoon.</p>
              <p>  Jeck's father, businessman Lim Beng Cheng, told The Straits Times that this was the fourth time his son had taken part in the competition.</p>
              <p>  He won bronze at his first attempt in 2009, when he was just 14, and silver in 2010.</p>
              <p>  Medals are typically given only to the top 50 per cent of competitors each year.</p>
              <p>  Jeck discovered his love for maths in primary school, by solving maths problems posted by others on the Internet, said his father.</p>
              <p>  He added: "We didn't train him at all, and none of our children have tuition."</p>
              <p>  Besides Jeck, Mr Lim has two daughters - Lim Min, 18, who attends RI and Lim Li, 13, who attends NUS High.</p>
              <p>  Mr Lim also praised NUS High for helping his son "build a very strong maths foundation".</p>
              <p>  He added: "Jeck's next step is to start some maths research, but because he is still very young, we will move on very slowly and not put stress on him."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The obsession with mind-bending conundrums came early.</p>
              <p>  A favourite childhood activity for Singaporean student Lim Jeck, who won the International Mathematical Olympiad last week, was to create puzzles for others to solve.</p>
              <p>  A peek into a jotter book belonging to the then 10-year-old reveals drawings of intricate mazes, ranging from squiggly lines to the three-dimensional.</p>
              <p>  Now 17, his interest in unravelling puzzles has not abated. His favourite maths topics - geometry and combinatorics, which is the study of permutations and combinations - are relatively light on theories and formulae. To excel in those areas, one needs a logical mind and problem-solving skills.</p>
              <p>  His bent in navigating spatial and logical challenges helped propel Jeck to the top of the Olympiad in Argentina a week ago, beating 547 other pre-university students from 100 countries.</p>
              <p>  He is the first Singaporean to do so. In the process, the National University of Singapore (NUS) High School student attained a perfect score, also a first for a Singaporean, and the only one in this year's contest, which attracts the brightest young mathematical minds from around the globe.</p>
              <p>  But he is not done.</p>
              <p>  He is aiming to compete again at next year's Olympiad, which will be the last he qualifies for, as he is due to graduate from NUS High next year as well.</p>
              <p>  The thought of repeating his feat does not faze him. Said Jeck: "I have one year to prepare for that and I will be ready for the challenge."</p>
              <p>  With the contest setting the hardest questions in the last two years in both his pet topics, it played to the Year 5 student's strengths.</p>
              <p>  Jeck came close last year, but missed out on a perfect score by a mere two points 'because I was not careful'. The result? He was second overall.</p>
              <p>  Even then, it was the best showing by any Singaporean, till his first place finish this year.</p>
              <p>  An interview with the Lim family at their Stirling Road condominium yesterday revealed a gifted teenager who prefers computer games to cramming for tests.</p>
              <p>  "He doesn't study too hard, but somehow manages to do well," said his mother, Madam Ng Bee Yong, 47, who runs an IT software firm with Jeck's father, Mr Lim Beng Cheng, 51.</p>
              <p>  She said his As come in maths, physics, chemistry and computing, but he gets Bs and the occasional C for languages.</p>
              <p>  Jeck, however, is reticent in person, and it was his older sister, Min, who revealed that his other hobbies are reading and watching anime, and solving jigsaw puzzles.</p>
              <p>  He was more forthcoming on e-mail. Asked who he would credit for developing his talent in maths, he singled out his family. "Without their guidance and support I wouldn't have come so far."</p>
              <p>  His sisters, Min, 18, who is in JC 2 at Raffles Institution, and Li, 13, in Secondary 1 at NUS High, are both also mathematically inclined.</p>
              <p>  The siblings are a fixture at local maths competitions, and Min also represented Singapore at the China Girls Maths Olympiad last year.</p>
              <p>  But like many boys his age, Jeck's mind these days is not on maths so much as the online game Minecraft.</p>
              <p>  The multi-player game allows players to build structures, and Jeck exploits the game's lack of limits to create complex puzzles for his friends to manoeuvre out of.</p>
              <p>  Indeed, playing Minecraft was the first thing Jeck did when he arrived home from Argentina on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>  While he has yet to decide where and what to study at university, one thing has not changed from when he was a little boy. He said he "would like to make maths, as well as computing, my career".</p>
