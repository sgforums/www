              <p><br>It appears you missed my point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The textbooks are NOT the authority. They do NOT speak for Chemistry and Biology. They are merely individual efforts by individual authors to convey concepts to students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everything you read in your 'O' level Chem and 'O' level Bio textbooks, are oversimplified. If you insist on being technical, much of what you read in them are actually wrong, but they are 'correct' for 'O' levels, which by definition is extremely basic and oversimplified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what you read about photosynthesis, about respiration, in your 'O' level Chem &amp; Bio textbooks, all actually fall short of the true picture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever your 'O' level Chem textbook book says about photosynthesis or respiration, is simply trying to convey a point, a concept, about Chemistry, to you (the student), and by itself does not accurately describe photosynthesis or respiration (you need to study these in the University to get a proper understanding, or at least 'A' levels for a preview).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever your 'O' level Bio textbook book says about photosynthesis or respiration, is simply trying to convey a point, a concept, about Biology, to you (the student), and does not accurately describe photosynthesis or respiration (you need to study these in the University to get a proper understanding, or at least 'A' levels for a preview).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will understand better what I mean when you study at a higher level.</p>
              <p><br>In the meantime, use the textbooks (or school notes!) only as a learning tool, not as any dogmatic authority.</p>

              <p>Actually that was estimate for A Math as I only track my students' estimated scores for A Math . E Math is too hard to guage accurately due to paper 1 which cannot be estimated as the questions/solutions are not available accurately immediately after the exams.</p>
              <p>But nevertheless, you definitely need &gt;80% or thereabout for an A2.</p>

              <p>hi sgstudent</p>
              <p>I particularly like this book</p>
              <p>Conceptual Physics for O levels<br>It is a red coloured book. As for the publisher, I will have to get back to u tmr cuz I left the book in office</p>
              <p>In addition, this book is a good supplement. Challenging Drill Questions, Questions from top schools. There are a ton of questions inside for practice, and I think it is quite good. The solution book is sold separately, and is quite expensive. But the questions book is at an acceptable price.</p>
              <p>Finally, do visit <a href="http://examworld.blogspot.com">ExamWorld</a> and see if it could help you a bit. It's my website, but haven't had much time to update it recently. Also, visit <a href="http://www.s-cool.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">S-cool Revision</span></a>, a UK website which is quite good as well.</p>

              <p>Hi eagle,thanks for the recommendations. Coincidentally(and fortunately), I just bought the Conceptual Physics book yesterday, is the publisher GLM? I haven't heard of this publisher before.</p>
              <p>I saw Challenging Drill questions(by cosmic services/yellow reef limited?) as well, it costs $50+, the price's kind of steep, so i didnt buy. But if it's really good, then i would exchange the Conceptual book with Challenging Drill.</p>
              <p>My friend's teacher suggested Longman Structured Questions and I have seen people using the other versions (mcqs, revision guide etc), any opinions on Longman? And has anyone heard of Red Dot?</p>
              <p>Besides physics, does anyone have any good books in mind for bio and chem? THANK YOU :)</p>

              <p>yep, it's by yellowreef/cosmic something... $50+ is the solutions book... which if u dun really need if u know how to do... The questions book is about $24 I think...</p>
              <p>my sis is using yellow reef for A lvl physics and maths, both questions and solutions book... For o levels, I use the questions book to give tuition. So I can say, it is good.</p>
              <p>Not very sure about longman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For chem and Bio, I will leave it to UltimaOnline, our resident chem and bio specialist to recommend you</p>
