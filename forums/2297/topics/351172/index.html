              <p>Hi guys i'm in sec 5 this year , i really want to do well so that i can get into the poly courses that i want . Can anyone of you please share tips on how to do well ? My common test results were just out and i didn't did that well only passing 3 subjects .i failed my maths by 2 marks and science really badly . I didn't had a good foundation for science during my sec 3 and 4 years . I'm doing ok for physics but really really bad for Chemistry . i'm trying to set a B3 as a target for my science and A2 for my maths i'm not being unrealistic as i feel this is something that i really think it's possible if there are right steps in place i'm surei can do it . Problem is i don't know how especially towards chemistry . i can't even do the basics like balancing equation right .</p>

              <p><br>It is not hard to find personal tutors rather than going to tuition centers. With NTU and NUS being the the west areas, it shouldn't be hard finding a tutor since a large number would stay on campus.</p>

              <p>Practice more on your maths because for maths you don't have to remember anything except for the formulas.</p>
              <p>And as for chemistry, it's not about memorising, it's about understanding. Don't just memorise what's on your textbook, understand them.</p>
              <p>oh yeah, if you wanna get into poly/jc, maths and science is very important.</p>

              <p>Firstly, relax!</p>
              <p>Make sure you clear all your doubts on anything first before learning new stuff that just adds on to your previous doubts. Have consultations with teachers. You might want to consider getting a tuition teacher too.</p>
              <p>Get a few assessment books once you cleared your doubts. Keep doing exercises, ten year series, and make sure you know them really well.</p>
              <p>Maths and science is really important, but do not neglect other subjects too! DO not get too stress and know how to balance your time weel between work and play.</p>

              <p>The majority of my Chemistry tuition students, score distinctions - A1 for 'O' level, and A for H2 'A' level. Your difficulty in school is that you do not understand your school teacher during class lessons, and you need a tuition teacher to give you personal attention to address your learning needs.</p>
              <p>If you find it tough to locate a suitable tutor (and you're sure you want tuition), even if you live somewhere far away, eg. in the west; it's ok as long as you are willing to make the effort to come to my place (located between Temasek JC at Bedok and Victoria JC at Marine Parade), and we can work out an arrangement suitable for you, that minimizes travelling time.</p>
              <p>For instance, you can have 2 sessions per week on the same day. Either 4 hours straight on weekends; or 1st session 2 hours, then break for lunch (you can go nearby Bedok MRT or Parkway to makan), then continue the 2nd session's 2 hours. All on the same day. Eg. Fri, Sat or Sun (since weekdays will be tough for you to do so). This would reduce and minimize on travelling time.</p>

              <p>actually my maths isn't that bad one i scored A2 for maths in N level</p>
              <p>just didn't study tho hence failing my common test . English is always consistent from B3-A2 .</p>
              <p>i just don't do well for science which i think is my weakness .(especially chemistry)</p>
              <p>i managed to scored an a2 for my combine humanities as well for the CTs</p>
              <p>i really want to get an L1R4 of 12 for my O levels .</p>
              <p>some venues u guys mention are really too far for me especially when school ends around 2-3 each day (excluding supplymentary classes etc )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>actually physics is alright cause i understand the ideas and the learning objectives .</p>
              <p>but for chem i can't even get the baisc and fundamentals right .</p>

              <p>That's great! Keep up the good work. But do not slack. The curve from N level to O levels is quite steep for 1 year worth of work. I ever had this student who got A1 for E maths for N levels, then struggled, and failed for mid year in sec 5. That was my 2nd tuition student, and fortunately, through his hard work, he managed to pull himself back up to an A2.</p>

              <p>another point : listen to your teachers in class,sometimes they will give you guides to study,and dropping hints every now and then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>ya and continue working on your past year papers.they are really useful as to how to answer the questions and all.</p>
              <p>all the best in your studies.</p>

              <p>There is no conflict between Chemistry and Biology. The only conflict is between a human being's conflicting ideas, and/or between two human beings' ideas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Photosynthesis and Respiration (whether anaerobic or aerobic) are both highly compex multi-step pathways (visit Wikipedia below) that involve dozens of enzymes; it is only when viewed from a highly simplified perspective of starting reactants and final end products, can one argue that the two reactions are, in a (simplified) sense, opposite reactions of each other. But by no means are they "reversible" or "equilibrium" reactions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Photosynthesis</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Respiration</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, no, there is absolutely no conflict between Chemistry and Biology (as a Chemistry &amp; Biology teacher, I'm living proof! And as a human being that can live, breathe and think, so are you!).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Often, students are better off in my tuition classes than in school classes... but that's no surprise (by that I mean private tuition in Singapore certainly serves a very helpful function to students, in part because of the logistical and pedagogical limitations in school due to unhealthily large class sizes burdened with distracting discipline problems, energy draining bureaucratic administrative duties, etc).</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>'I changed my plan to stay here' <br><br>I AM WRITING in response the article by Mr S Murali, 'Why pay to pit S'pore kids in islandwide tests?' (The New Paper on Sunday, 22 Feb). I am so glad to know someone shares my point of view on this.<br><br>I am a Singaporean, but left Singapore when I was still single. Now, 18 years later, I am back as a single mother of two young boys, 7 and 4.<br><br>My original plan was to stay here for good. However, after several months of being here with my boys enrolled in a local school, I had a change of heart.<br><br>I have decided to go back to where we were, a place I called home for 15 years. The reason for that change of heart is the education system here.<br><br>Before I returned to Singapore, my children used to love going to school and looked forward to it every day. But when they started attending school here, they hated it, especially my older son.<br><br>He would come home every day complaining about how the teacher scolded him for not knowing basic mathematics and getting his spelling wrong, and about classmates calling him stupid and making fun of him because his handwriting looks like a doctor's (that is what I say).<br><br>There is also all the homework they have to do. This wasn't how it used to be. Before Singapore, my son would come home running and laughing. Every day at dinner time, he would excitedly share with me what he did and learnt at school. He was always proud of what he had achieved.<br><br>But now, after less than a year of living and attending school here, I see a big change not only in his character but also his attitude towards going to school, his interest in learning and his command of English.<br><br>Adults here remark how my children are always playing with Lego, building battleships, flying saucers, robots or a big house for mum. They remark how my children are at the playground, cycling or building sand castles at the beach every weekend instead of studying, doing their homework, going for tuition, enrichment programmes or working on 'educational' games on the computer.<br><br>A parent actually commented that my older child is not computer savvy, does not have a PSP and doesn't watch TV and my younger one does not know how to read or write.<br><br>I just don't get it. Why worry about your children not being computer savvy at the age of barely 7?<br><br>Why do I have to worry that my child still cannot read or 'write' when he is only 4?<br><br>The article is right about the questions the interviewer is going to ask the applicants when applying for a job as a journalist.<br><br>Every afternoon, I take my children to the playground to play. And usually they are the only children there and I am the only parent playing with them.<br><br>You may have book-smart children who ace all the tests, but they may not be street-smart.<br><br>We are packing our bags and heading back 'home', a place where children are allowed to be children, where it is understood and accepted that children grow and learn at different paces, where parents and educators understand the importance and concept of learning through play.<br><br>FROM READER SURIANI SIVAM SHAFII <br></em></span></p>
