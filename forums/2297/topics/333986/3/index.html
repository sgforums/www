              <p>Yes.</p>
              <p>i hope this thread gives an insight view of how tutors can protect themselves from students who do not want to pay up.</p>
              <p>Besides, i always think student should be financially responsible for the tutor fees.</p>

              <p>You need to have some trust...</p>
              <p>I used to delay payment from my tuiton teacher as well....but she was patient enough to wait for my mum to get the money. Till now I think I owned her around $100++...but it seems like we never really remembered it....so just forget about it. Moreover she already stopped tuitioning and is now a mother. It was 2-3 years ago's debt. I just visted her during CNY this year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Then it was tuition centre....rushing there after school, often forgot to bring tuition fees along. The teacher was patient and waited for us....she never called us to "stop tuition" until you pay up. The most sge gave was a reminder.</p>
              <p>There was once a tuition mate that forgot to pay his fees for a long time while the teacher did not really take note...to realise he owned 1k++ for the fees. In the end the mum wrote a cheque to the teacher. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Ah well...but there are still cases of students disappearing...changed phone numbers etc.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for your kind words, Syncopation_music. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as Eage pointed out :</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuition centre, usually the tutor still get paid by the centre. It is the centre that dun get to collect the money &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, people who run tuition centers like Syncopation_music, often have a hard time being the middle-man, and often kena from both students/parents and tutors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All 3 groups (students/parents, tutors, tuition center owners) have their difficulties, challenges, and any of the 3 groups can kena scam by the other 2. So it's tough, but that's life. The same for any profession and any industry (although right now, bankers kena jialat jialat.)</p>

              <p>Hope you guys understand that there is nothing wrong with being impatient to collect the $$$. Sometimes you spend money on the understanding that you will be recieving money soon... and with a run of delay in collectiosn, you could be quite broke. At the moment I have students who are late by one month due to the fact that I didn't get to collect on time before their sec 3 exams and then I suspend their lessons to concentrate on the O level takers. Now add to the fact, I collect a token $100 for 5 full days' session for each O level takers in fees to encourage full attendence... and add in the fact, I am paying for their pizzas and burgers ( you get heartaches watching the girls order burger meals BUT don't eat the fries...sob sob) for the whole day sessions... I am running a loss for this month... and if next month the sec 3 who resume lessons are late in fees again... then I eat grass liao... &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>Just an experience to share.<br><br>I was giving tuition during my undergrad days.<br><br>There was a particular family which I remembered till now who was pretty nasty.<br><br>They were a reputable family with a certain stand in society.<br><br>But, they chose to default on a 300 bucks tuition fees which really surprised and kinda make my blood boil.</p>
              <p><br>I tried calling them, but they told me straight that they are not going to pay, I asked how could they do that, they told me how could I be a debt collector and collect from them, my own tuition fees?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mum even helped to call them, but their reply was bring me to the court if you can, I have the money and time to play with you. I have money to play, and to pay as well, but I just don't want to pay the tutor, what can you do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, there are tutors out there who really does charge fees at a lower rate.<br><br>I used to charge lower rates to students with financial difficulties; in addition to free books, materials, stationery, meals etc.<br><br>Now, after grad, I turned to volunteering work. <br><br>Ultimately, every teacher/tutor does wish to see improvements from their students, it's a satisfaction most will have.<br><br>Fees/money maybe important, but a lower fee just rep that maybe we can tune down our lifestyle slightly. <br><br>But all in all, it still depends on the tutor himself/herself to see how much he/she is willing to give.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>(",)</p>
