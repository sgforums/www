              <p>I really really need hell with my Chinese. I'm not like transfer or someone who has any reason to fail at Chinese. With this post I'll bring up the hotly contest thing know as : Talent and skill.</p>
              <p>some people are just better at some subjects than others, by secondary school I have already realized this sad truth. I. Primary school I had dreams of being a straight a* student  by primary 6, I was a normal student with As and Bs. </p>
              <p>Now in secondary school, the only subjects I'm okay in is my Math. Math has always been my passion. English I just adored because of reading. Science was really troublesome with the memorization of theory and other stuff.</p>
              <p>but Chinese. The whole thing revolves around memorizing how to write the words. I won't deny that I have never liked Chinese, nor have I ever really cared about it. Nonetheless, I can only say that among all my current subjects, the most time is spent on Chinese. For revision, test paper, practices.....</p>
              <p>but I'm still failing at it. For recent overall (CA) I failed by 10%. The thing which pulls me down is the grammar and spelling portion where I fill in the blanks when the paper gives me a clue on the phrase.</p>
              <p>i have been cutting time from the rest of my subjects to revise Chinese, and my the result ON MY OTHER SUBJECTS is very obvious. Those results are taking the plunge, but on the other hand, Chinese is just as bad.</p>
              <p>Im aiming for JC which needs a 'Pass' in my MT to even apply.</p>
              <p>my teacher has broached the subject of CLB to me, and honestly, I'm all for it. However I'm not sure how it will affect my JC entrance application.</p>
              <p>my friends say I'm worrying too early, but I know things are just going to get harder.</p>
              <p>So to sum up my problems...</p>
              <p>What should I do about my failing Chinese?</p>
              <p>Should I continue cutting time from my other subjects for Chinese?</p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p>How will taking CLB affect my JC entry application? (Even though it's not going to be in my L1R5 for sure)</p>
              <p>Please, I really need help!</p>

              <p>Hi, thanks for your replies, I considered going to poly, but I'm aiming to go for law actually... My parents are both doctors and we're really upset when they realized that none of the family(me, my big sis and my lil sis) wanted to peruse a medical career.</p>
              <p>They got really upset when they realised my big sister aimed for poly for food sciences. So she got forced into a medical sector which has gone really badly so far. It's all memorization which is an epic fail (sia) for my whole family. My sister is more of a math person, and she intended to go poly cuz there is no Chinese... She wants to get a scholarship out of Singapore and has no intention of going uni.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, I wish to peruse law in uni, and entry to uni via poly is so slim that I need to be a topper(which is not realistically possible for me) Therefore I'm still aiming for a JC which needs that irritating pass for Chinese. As mentioned, my teacher recommends me to go CLB, but I worried that CLB I either fail also, or else CLB pass is not considered as a Chinese pass for JC. according to my teacher, CLB is very basic and foundation, it should be easy to pass  however, my Chinese overall grade will drop.</p>
              <p>I just need that Chinese pass...Does CLB count? Can someone well versed in the inner workings for JC entrance tell me?</p>
              <p>lastly, going poly is my absolute last resort cos my parents are very very very very super against (in their own words) "Another one of my children go poly will make me tu xie!(spit blood))</p>

              <p>i think this is more like problems with parents</p>
              <p>probably partly their fault for your "bad" Chinese</p>
              <p>there is no shortcut to improve on the subject</p>
              <p>speak, read, write</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fail by 10% is not relli the worstest</p>
              <p>if u  bother to put in the effort, it is not difficult to get C6 oreven C5</p>
              <p>dedicate a fixed amt of time per day for the subject</p>
              <p>u definitely no have to sacrifice other subjects if u have good time management and self-discipline</p>

              <p>There is Chinese B for A Levels too. It is for those who took Chinese
                               B in secondary schools. However, Chinese B for A Levels is not a H1/H2 
                              subject and thus cannot be used for your university admission score. 
                              Passing CLB at A level would meet the university MTL requirement though.
                               Performance in CLB is just indicated as "Merit, Pass or Ungraded."</p>
              <p>University admission score (UAS) is generally as follow:</p>
              <p>A) 3 H2 subjects - 60 points</p>
              <p>B) H1 General Paper (GP) - 10 points</p>
              <p>C) H1 Project Work (PW) - 10 points</p>
              <p>D) 1 H1 subject - 10 points</p>
              <p>Total (A to D): 90 points</p>
              <p>E) H1 Mother Tongue (MTL) (optional for UAS) - 10 points</p>
              <p>Total (A to E): 100 points* (will be rebased to 90 points)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MTL will only be included in the computation of the UAS if it raises your score.</p>
              <p>For those who perform badly in other subjects but
                               perform well in MTL, MTL will help them by pulling up their UAS. But for example if you manage to get straight A's for all your other A Level subjects, then MTL does not matter 
                              for your university admission score as you would already have a perfect 90/90 UAS (you just need to get at least 'S' grade for H1 MTL or pass MTL 'B' at A Level to meet the general admission requirements)</p>

              <p>Take note of the different score weightage for MTL and MTL 'B' :</p>
              <p>The 'B' version of the syllabus has a higher weightage on the Oral/Aural (aural = listening compre) components at 50%. This means that if you can brush up on your CL speaking skills and also do well for listening compre, it is not that difficult to pass CL 'B'. Another key difference is CL 'B' also requires you to write less words for compo.</p>

              <p>Okay, I'm now very relieved.... But to answer all questions, currently I'm in Secondary 1 only, therefore becos my grades already dropping I'm worrying... As for tuition, my parents and I have considered and I am actually going for classes very soon, my big sister did their English course during her secondary school, but we are not very sure of how 'good' the tuition is, mainly because my sister just passed that years english exam (from her original fluctuating pass and fails)</p>
              <p>im like trying out but so far all its adding is extra homework, not to mention I hardly understand any of it.</p>
              <p>As for my work, my compos norm get 15-19, and rare 20-21. My Chinese teacher attributes it to my really short compos. (It shouldn't be happening, becos I know for a fact I go over the word requirement set by the teacher, 200)</p>
              <p>The time I did get 15 was due to me being out of point. I've got nothing to write, so I just write...I've been trying to solve this by reading model compos and more Chinese storybooks. All the topics assigned have never been any of those I have read or seen. Someday.......someday I'll get a topic I have read.</p>
              <p>Im weakest at my ciyu, like...I can read the word, I know the meaning, and I know which word the teacher is talking about. But I can't write it. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I do write xizi on my own every single day. But the moment I need that word, it disappears, I can't write it.</p>
              <p>My situation is ridiculous, my teacher is inclined to believe I am lying about having learned. I won't correct her anymore, because after all, if I learn and still get everything wrong, it's not called learning. </p>
              <p>Has anyone had difficulties like mine and have suggestions that worked for you?</p>
