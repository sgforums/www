              <p><br>I want to take up bio course in uni. Not really interested in engineering. So if I take H2 physics now and get into a bio course, will I be at a disadvantage with others that take H2 bio? I’m not confident that I will do well in H2 bio, with so much stuff to memorize.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Are you confident you'll do well in H2 Phys, if you're more interested in Bio Uni course than Phys?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that A level = Intro to Uni level.</p>
              <p>H2 Phys, H2 Chem, H2 Bio textbooks = Uni textbooks. Although there are A level textbooks, but most JCs will use Uni textbooks instead (kiasu lor).</p>
              <p>You and Mugger both have the same thinking : Even though both of you wanna do Bio based course (eg. Medicine) in the Uni, but both of you fear that it'll be tougher to do well in H2 Bio compared to H2 Phys.</p>
              <p>I think that's a misguided way to approach this (subject combi) decision. H2 Sciences is more or less 1st year Uni level material. It doesn't make sense to do H2 Phys when you wanna do Bio based course in the Uni (or vice-versa).</p>
              <p>How can you expect to score an A for H2 Phys if you don't have the interest in doing a Phys based Uni course? A levels is not like O levels in which you can just mug your way through without having a personal interest (ie. future Uni course) in the subject, and expect to score an A grade.</p>
              <p>FYI, in many JCs, the % of students scoring distinction in the A levels is even higher for H2 Bio, compared to H2 Phys.</p>
              <p>And Mugger, you say you're 100% sure you wanna do Medicine, yet fear you can't score A for H2 Bio. The fundamental basis for Medicine is H2 Chem + H2 Bio. If you can't confidently score A for both H2 Bio and H2 Chem, there's no way you can pass a Medicine course (whose exams' memorization requirements is a thousand times more demanding than the memorization requirements of H2 Bio).</p>
              <p>Do consider carefully. Don't choose the wrong subject for the wrong reason.</p>

              Are you confident you'll do well in H2 Phys, if you're more
              interested in Bio Uni course than Phys?</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that A level = Intro to Uni level.</p>
              <p>H2 Phys, H2 Chem, H2 Bio textbooks = Uni textbooks. Although
              there are A level textbooks, but most JCs will use Uni textbooks
              instead (kiasu lor).</p>
              <p>You and Mugger both have the same thinking : Even though both of
              you wanna do Bio based course (eg. Medicine) in the Uni, but
              both of you fear that it'll be tougher to do well in H2 Bio
              compared to H2 Phys.</p>
              <p>I think that's a misguided way to approach
              this (subject combi) decision. H2 Sciences
              is more or less 1st year Uni level material. It
              doesn't make sense to do H2 Phys when you wanna do Bio based course
              in the Uni (or vice-versa).</p>
              <p>How can you expect to score an A for H2 Phys if you don't have
              the interest in doing a Phys based Uni course? A levels is not like
              O levels in which you can just mug your way through without having
              a personal interest (ie. future Uni course) in the subject,
              and expect to score an A grade.</p>
              <p>FYI, in many JCs, the % of students scoring distinction in the A
              levels is even higher for H2 Bio, compared to H2 Phys.</p>
              <p>And Mugger, you say you're 100% sure you wanna do Medicine, yet
              fear you can't score A for H2 Bio. The fundamental basis for
              Medicine is H2 Chem + H2 Bio. If you can't confidently score A for
              both H2 Bio and H2 Chem, there's no way you can pass a Medicine
              course (whose exams' memorization requirements is a thousand
              times more demanding than the memorization requirements of H2
              Bio).</p>
              <p>Do consider carefully. Don't choose the wrong subject for the
              wrong reason.</p>

              I actually feel more confident in doing well for phy than for bio. But I do think that it makes more sense for me to take bio since Iâ€™m planning to take bio course in uni. Iâ€™ll consider what you said carefully, and thanks a lot for helping me

              Yeah you're right, I just realised that there are as many ppl who want to take phy as those who want to take bio.
