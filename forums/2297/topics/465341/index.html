              <p>Hi all, i just entered JC and have to choose my subj combi soon, but i'm lost choosing btw physics and biology. I got the same grade for both of them in Olvl. Personally, i like bio more bcos i find it more interesting, but i heard there's alot to memorise and i fear i may not be able to cope. Also, i always find bio easier than phy, but i often score better in phy. So which one will you recommend me to take?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Also, bio seems to be a more popular choice than phy, so will it be harder to score well for it? And likewise, will it be easier to score for phy in alvl? Last year's phy olvl was really tough (like always, i think) and i thought i will surely score badly for it since i did not finish the paper, but i still scored an A1 for it.</span></p>
              <p>I would also like to know, how much different are H2 bio and phy from the olvl ones?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance (:</p>

              <p>If you're like 90% of humans on this planet, then you're either more physics inclined, or your're more bio inclined (just like 90% of humans either prefer cats or dogs, few humans love or hate both equally). In other words, it's already in your DNA (or soul karma, whichever concept you prefer). It's unwise to choose based on what others say which is 'easier' for themselves, coz born biologists find biology naturally easier than physics, while born physicists find physics naturally easier than biology.</p>
              <p>So don't listen to other pple, but decide for yourself. Two things you should take note :</p>
              <p>#1 - Uni course prerequisites :</p>
              <p><img src="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/NUS_ALevels_Prerequisites.jpg" alt="" width="959" height="1575"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 - H2 Bio has more content to memorize than H2 Phys + H2 Chem <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">combined</span></strong>. I'm <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> exaggerating. Be warned.</p>

              <p>For the alevel bell curve, it's better as in more candidates can get good grades? I guess I was kinda worried that for the less popular subject, there will be fewer teachers in the sch teaching tht subj and hence few good teachers &gt;&lt; and bio is definitely more popular in my sch cos my sch mentioned that only a small class takes phy, and they recommend students to take bio too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've looked at the prerequisites for the uni courses before and those courses I'm more interested in are bio related. I really like bio but many ppl say that I should take phy instead bcos I'm good at maths and phy, unlike bio which I'd scored badly at the beginning of sec3. But Is alevel phy still maths-related?</p>
              <p>In addition, I'm not very good in English, and that's another reason why ppl tell me to not take bio cos I may have problems phrasing my answers for the essay questions correctly.</p>
              <p>Bio being content-heavy is also another concern. I often study for tests and exams t the last minute, so I'm afraid that I'll not be able to finish studying. I couldn't even finish studying for olvl bio, with a few chapters left.</p>

Scientists are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, the result is that chemistry and biology are becoming more quantitative and model-driven in their approaches.

              <p>Do you intend to eventually take up a career in science? If so,
              I'd encourage you to go for physics. Scientists are becoming
              increasingly interdisciplinary, the result is that chemistry and
              biology are becoming more quantitative and model-driven in their
              approaches. It is never easy for one to learn a new discipline, but
              it seems to me that the transition is easier for a physicist moving
              into biology than for a biologist moving into physics.</p>

              <p><br>Officially, the Medicine admission requirements (for both NUS and NTU) say either H2 Phys or H2 Bio is fine. But anecdotal evidence (ie. hearsay) suggests that the admission panel will (unofficially) favour H2 Bio students over H2 Phys students, when deciding who gets into Medicine. Majority of Medical students are Bio students, while a minority are Phys students. This could be due to either because students who are sure they wanna do Medicine would themselves be more inclined to take Bio in the first place, or it could be due to an actual bias in the admission panel, or more likely a bit of both.</p>
