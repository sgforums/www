              <p>I had many friends with similar scores, who applied to local uni with similar results and gotten admission.(though not in social sciences)</p>
              <p>I think you can still consider applying to SMU and NTU HSS under DA admission,try to put 1st choice for the courses you want and prepare for interviews if you have gotten DA admissions.</p>
              <p>At worst,you can still get to local uni but settle for other courses apart from humanities or try private uni for social science programmes.</p>

              Hi, I'm a JC graduate who has just receive her A level results. 
              I got As in GP, 4H2s and O level HCL, with B in PW. I have been considering applying for a science course in either NUS or NTU ,such as chemistry,pharmacy,life sciences etc. 
              
              1) Medicine?
              I ruled out medicine as I thought it's out of the question, as I didn't expect to get nearly straight As + my lack of good CCA records &amp;consistent CIP. However, seeing my results, my mum asked me to try for medicine, saying that I might have chance of getting in. I could only apply to NUS since I didn't take the BMAT for NTU.
              
              The main question would be of course:whether I have a passion in serving as a doctor.  To be honest, I don't really have a clear idea. I enjoyed learning the various body systems and diseases in Sec 4 Bio but have never seriously considered to enter medicine. My interest in Bio is reduced in JC as we started learning micro things instead of the human body. 
              Qn: What do medicine students really study? Would it be back to Sec4 Bio kind of syllabus but of higher level?
              
              
              I joined Red Cross as a CCA in JC because I don't really have other choices and I was slightly interested in the various first aid equipment like which is used to treat what. Throughout the 1.5 years, I've only volunteered a few times outside of school as a first aider(as I was struggling with JC academically). Seeing other fellow passionate first aiders I was inspired by their commitment. I also learnt the joy of serving as the casualty thanked me after I helped them bandage their wounds. However, I also discovered a problem with myself, that is I'm afraid to talk with strangers, let alone offering support/comfort for the casualty,using words. Although I care about them, I don't dare to show it. I have no idea why I have grown into such a shy person &lt;- this is what I heard from quite a few people. 
              
              My other concern would be my mediocre CCA record, which is quite important to enter medicine apart from grades right? I have no CCA positions throughout my life and also no stellar CIP records(as I mentioned-have to keep mugging in jc). I don't think I still have chance for medicine =_= Actually I have applied for two attachments to hospitals so as to enrich my experience in the healthcare sector and also beef up my record, sadly both were rejected,one by JC and one by RMG. Through this experience, I'm convinced that I wouldn't fit as a doctor, so I stopped considering medicine.
              
              Besides, I'm also worried about the stress of being a medical student and subsequently as a doctor. I have experienced various weird symptoms in my body due to stress since secondary school. From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine.
              
              All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that
              1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine.
              2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine??
              (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I haven't had any true research experience lol)
              
              2) Bio vs Chem
              As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)?
              
              Pardon me for the long post as I didn't really have someone to talk to...Your help is deeply appreciated!!

              You should go ahead and apply for Medicine as your 1st choice. Even with straight As, chances of entering Medicine is very low, so just give it your best shot.<p>Regardless of your initial motivation for entering Medicine, even if it's not as selflessly noble as some other applicants, what matters the most is the good you can contribute to society and to humanity as a medical doctor, regardless of your initial motivations.</p><p>There are many, many, many different roles, specialties and subspecialties, that you can take up to contribute as a medical doctor, so don't worry about that now. From frontline ER doctors and surgeons, to family General Practitioners, to backend medical researchers, you'll be able to find a role that best fits you, but all that comes after graduation, so don't worry about that now.</p><p>Between Chemistry and Biology...
                              </p><p>If you're equally interested in both, go for a double degree (hellishly demanding) or double major (very demanding), or one major and one minor (somewhat demanding), or just one major with no minor (least demanding, and the path chosen by majority of Uni students), in Chemistry and Biology. Otherwise, if you only choose one subject to read in Uni, research and check out professional career pathways for each subject major, before deciding. Besides, at Uni leve, every subject has many specialties and subspecialties, some of which you might prefer Bio, some of which you might prefer Chem. So it's not so straightforward, consider all options carefully with an open mind while applying, and after that, when choosing to accept whichever courses you've successfully applied into.

                              academically). Seeing other fellow passionate first aiders I was
                              inspired by their commitment. I also learnt the joy of serving as
                              the casualty thanked me after I helped them bandage their wounds.
                              However, I also discovered a problem with myself, that is Iâ€™m
                              afraid to talk with strangers, let alone offering support/comfort
                              for the casualty,using words. Although I care about them, I donâ€™t
                              dare to show it. I have no idea why I have grown into such a shy
                              person &lt;- this is what I heard from quite a few people.</p>
                              <p>My other concern would be my mediocre <span class="">CCA</span>
                              record, which is quite important to enter medicine apart from
                              grades right? I have no <span class="">CCA</span> positions
                              throughout my life and also no stellar <span class="">CIP</span>
                              records(as I mentioned-have to keep mugging in jc). I donâ€™t think I
                              still have chance for medicine =_= Actually I have applied for two
                              attachments to hospitals so as to enrich my experience in the
                              healthcare sector and also beef up my record, sadly both were
                              rejected,one by JC and one by <span class="">RMG</span>. Through
                              this experience, Iâ€™m convinced that I wouldnâ€™t fit as a doctor, so
                              I stopped considering medicine.</p>
                              <p>Besides, Iâ€™m also worried about the stress of being a medical
                              student and subsequently as a doctor. I have experienced various
                              weird symptoms in my body due to stress since secondary school.
                              From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and
                              sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak
                              before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the
                              stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve
                              stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised Iâ€™m a person who
                              likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I
                              wouldnâ€™t survive in medicine.</p>
                              <p>All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of
                              medicine? So that<br>
                              1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to
                              improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter
                              medicine.<br>
                              2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine??<br>
                              (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making
                              contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a
                              front-line person, although I havenâ€™t had any true research
                              experience lol)</p>
                              <p>2) Bio vs Chem<br>
                              As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus
                              is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like
                              thereâ€™s tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more
                              probably because itâ€™s easier to learn. In my case, should I apply
                              for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological
                              science)?</p>
                              <p>Pardon me for the long post as I didnâ€™t really have someone to
                              talk toâ€¦Your help is deeply appreciated!!</p>

              Required A level scores depends on popularity of Uni courses. Getting Bs &amp; Cs will only allow your daughter to enter the less popular Uni courses. Don't worry too much, in J1 most students are barely passing all their subjects anyway. They take time to adjust to the tougher JC syllabus.

              <p>What course is it by the way? Anyway, your reason is personal so it's rather hard to feel any sympathy in your case since you had 2 offers. I'm active on HWZ degree forum and there are students who are still on pins and needles since they didn't get an offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your grades probably already meet the cutoff in the first place but by rejecting it, you have put yourself at a disadvantage. I hope that very personal reason is a valid one and not "my best friend/boyfriend/girlfriend is going to NTU".</p>

              <p>What course is it by the way? Anyway, your reason is personal so
                      it's rather hard to feel any sympathy in your case since you had 2
                      offers. I'm active on HWZ degree forum and there are students who
                      are still on pins and needles since they didn't get an offer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your grades probably already meet the cutoff in the first place
                      but by rejecting it, you have put yourself at a disadvantage. I
                      hope that very personal reason is a valid one and not "my best
                      friend/boyfriend/girlfriend is going to NTU".</p>

              <p>And no its not due to having any close ones going to ntu</p>
              <p>What if I decide to wait 1 year and apply again? I know the cut off might be higher but will they reject again just because they had records of me turning down their offer previously?</p>
