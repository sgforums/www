              <p>think in terms of fractions... </p>
              <p>1) if 1/6 of A is shaded, how much of A is not shaded?</p>
              <p>2) if 1/4 of B is shaded, how much of B is not shaded?</p>
              <p>3 if 1/6 of A is 1/4 of B, what is the ratio of their area</p>
              <p>3) what is the total area of the figure?</p>

              <p>quite challenging for 11-12 years old, i must say...</p>

              <p>Question 2</p>
              <p>A box contained an equal number of 50c coins and 20c coins at
              first.Peter took out eight 50c coins,exchanged them for 20c coins
              and put the 20c coins into the box.In the end,there is the same
              amount of money in the box.Given that the ratio of the number of
              50c coins to the number of 20c coins in the box became 1:2 ,how
              much money is there in the box ?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>ratio is 1:2,       X   =   XX</p>
              <p>take out 20 20-cent, change into 8 50-cent.</p>
              <p>ratio becomes 1:1           X + 20 = XX - 8<br>                                           X  + 28 = XX<br>                                                  28  =  X</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>go solve.</p>

              <p>Q1. Don't be confused by the fractions, just treat A as a 6-units figure while B as a 4-units figure &gt;&gt; now you'll understand why 1/6 of A equals 1/4 of B</p>
              <p>1a) By right A and B when combined should form a 10-units figure. However, since there is a overlap of 1 unit, the total area of the figure is only 9-units. Hence 8/9 of the figure is not shaded. Ans: 8/9</p>
              <p>1b) since the figure has 9 units in total, 1 unit = 162/9 = 18cm2 &gt;&gt; given shaded area = 1 unit = 18cm2 &gt;&gt; Ans: 18cm2</p>
              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>1. When eight 50c coins are taken out, the total value is $4. Changing the $4 will give you twenty 20c coins.</p>
              <p>2. You took out eight 50c coins and put back twenty 20c coins, hence the new difference between the 2 type of coins = 20 + 8 = 28 coins</p>
              <p>3. Since the new ratio is 1:2, and the new difference is 28 coins, that means there are now twenty-eight 50c coins and fifty-six 20c coins.</p>
              <p>The amt of $$ in box = 28(0.5) + 56(0.2) = $25.20</p>
              <p>Counter-Check:</p>
              <p>Assuming you put back the eight 50c coins and remove the twenty 20c coins, there will now be 36 coins for each type. The total remains the same = 36(0.5) + 36(0.2) = $25.20</p>

              <p>I'm damn pissed with tutors who are unsure of concepts and go out to harm students. It's much harder to unlearn things and relearn than to learn things right the first time round.</p>
