              <p>Need help to explain this maths question to my daughter. Pls help.</p>
              <p>1) Mr Loo had to deliver 800 hampers in May. He received $4 for every hamper that was delivered successfully and $7 would be deducted from his salary for every hamper that was damaged. If his salary in May was $2,430 , how many hampers did Mr Loo deliver successfully?</p>

              <p>This question is a variation of the "Up and Down or Right and Wrong" Type of Question in the PSLE Maths Exam.</p>
              <p>Similar questions will be</p>
              <p>1.  An ant is climbing up a wall. How long will it take the ant to reach a 3m wall if the ant climbs up 3 cm and falls back 1 cm every second.</p>
              <p>2. In a multiple choice question test, there are 4 choices for each question and there are 50 questions. If a student scores 2 marks for a correct answer and 1 mark will be deducted for a wrong answer. How many questions do the student answer correctly if this student scores a total of 67 marks ?</p>
              <p>School teachers have already trained the PSLE students on these type of quesions. So, the question " Mr Loo had to deliver 800 hampers in May. He received $4 for every hamper that was delivered successfully and $7 would be deducted from his salary for every hamper that was damaged. If his salary in May was $2,430 , how many hampers did Mr Loo deliver successfully? " is not unfamiliar to the PSLE students. Indeed, an average PSLE student can solve the question easily. </p>
              <p>PS : To some, it might be a surprise to them that the famous question " There are 100 cats and hens and there are 344 legs altogether. How many cats are there ?" is a variation of this type of question and the question is solved easily too by using the method used for this type of question.</p>

              <p>1. So if the ant climbs 3 cm and falls 1 cm every second, it means that the ant climbs 2 cm every second. So 3 m / 2 cm -&gt; 150 seconds.</p>
              <p>2. Student gets 2 marks for correct answer and loses 1 mark for wrong answer, so it means that the student actually loses 3 marks per wrong question, considering the total to be 100 marks for 50 questions.</p>
              <p>Then 100 - 67 = 33. So the students got 11 questions wrong. 39 * 2 = 78, 78 - 11 = 67 marks.</p>

              <p>Glad to hear that you find that it is fun to solve the questions.</p>
              <p>Indeed, similar method is used to solve the famous question</p>
              <p>There are 100 cats and hens and there are 344 legs altogether. How many cats are there ?</p>
              <p>As usual, assume that all animals are cats ie there will be 100 x 4 legs = 400 legs</p>
              <p>Now, for every 2 legs less means 1 hen.</p>
              <p>400 - 344 = 56 legs less</p>
              <p>So, 56/2 = 28 hens</p>
              <p>Hence, there are 100 - 28 = 72 cats</p>
              <p>Check : 72 x 4 + 28 x 2 = 344 legs.</p>
