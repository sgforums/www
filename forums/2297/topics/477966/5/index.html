              <p>Hi! I got a raw score of 15 for my L1R5 and I can - 2pts from cca. (13pts) I've yet to determine what I wan to do in life yet.. So i feel that JC is a safer chioce than poly.</p>
              <p>English - 4</p>
              <p>Combine Humanities - 3</p>

              <p>Bio - 2</p>
              <p>Physic - 2</p>
              <p>Chem - 2</p>
              <p>MT - 5</p>
              <p>I've yet to determine what I wan to do in life yet.. So i feel that JC is a safer chioce than poly. Most JCs that i can go with my score is like 30 mins or more away from my home. (Why no JC in punggol T.T). I wan to go into SRJC but the COP is 12. I'm going to appeal but my sis say that the chances of geting in is very low. However my teacher say that considering i took triple sci, the chances i get in it very high. who should i believe? And since all other JCs other than SRJC is so far and i dun wan to waste to much time traveling, should i consider polys too (i can get in most courses)? If so what are the popular courses in poly?</p>

              <p>You shouldn't let slightly more travelling time (this is Singapore, how long can the travelling time be?) be the reason you decide to abandon JC and go to Poly, just because SRJC doesn't accept you (go ahead and appeal, but you'll usually stand a chance only if your L1R5 is exactly on the COP, not a point more).</p>

              <p>hello! i have a raw score of 11 for my L1R5 and after deducting 4 bonus points i got a score of 7. I would like to consider AJ or NYJC, as one of them is an english-oriented school and another is chinese oriented, i dont know which one will be more suitable for me? (i hear aj is getting unpopular these days but i kind of like their spirits) but NYJC seems more resourceful than AJ in every ways.. the facilities, buildings and it seems like a cool school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also may i know which school did better for a level results?</p>

              I come from PJC, just graduated.
              
              With your results, if you enter PJC, most likely you will become the elite of the crop instead. For being an anti-elitist, is that what you want?
              
              Are you the kind that can be easily influenced? Cause PJC students are generally lazy. It's a clear trend in PJC that those who study do well. Those who choose to slack are unable to enter uni normally.

              <p>If JJC is near your house then why not?</p>
              <p>Can save your travel time for studying. Plus since your friends are all there, it easier for you all to find time and revise together. Rmb JC is not a time to play if you want to make it to Uni, so try to make good use of your friends there and help each other advance to Uni together. hahaha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> Work hard for these two years and you can have a much easier time in Uni if your "A" Levels foundations are well-built. :)</p>
              <p>If you are still interested in finding out other JCs and Poly courses that you are eligible for, why not try these two sites?</p>
              <p><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cutoffpoint.sg/cut-off-points-for-JC">http://www.cutoffpoint.sg/cut-off-points-for-JC</a><br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cutoffpoint.sg/polytechnic-courses-cut-off-point">http://www.cutoffpoint.sg/polytechnic-courses-cut-off-point</a></p>
              <p>It would automatically show all your eligible JCs and Poly courses once you enter your COP into the system.</p>
              <p>Good Luck with your JAE! Hope you can get into a school you wish! :)</p>

              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Millennia Institute is a good option for students who really want A level certificate but are not elligible for any Junior College, yet still have the potential to do well in A level. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Millennia Institute is (only) for those whose L1R5 is above 20 and L1R4 is below 21. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">However. it is sad that Millennia Institute does not follow its cut-off-point and only wants to fill up its vacancies. There are people with L1R4 &gt; 20 who are in Millennia Institute and retainees who were actually "asked to leave". It is damn distracting in Millennia Institute. Besides, the notes and teaching quality at Millennia Institute is also not as good as the Junior Colleges. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><strong>If you can go JC, even if L1R5 is 19, just go JC. </strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em>At least the resources and the environment in JC are </em></span><em style="line-height: 1.231;">good <span style="color: #ffffff;">/ </span></em><em style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">(very m</span></span><span style="color: #ffffff;">uch) </span><span style="color: #ffffff;">better than MI.</span></em></p>
              <p>When I visited PJC during their open house last year, I came across articles featuring students with 18/19/20 for L1R5 who did very well in A level.</p>
              <p>When you are at JC, do not appeal. Just take the subjects that you can take.</p>
              <p>If possible, go look at which subjects got 100% passing and high distinction rates, and take those subjects with 100% passing and high distinction rates, that you can take.</p>
              <p>Rest assured, at Junior College, the JC Subject combinations are designed for courses in Universities.</p>

              <p>I'm from a normal neighbour hood school and gotten L1R5 of 11 for my O levels, which is actually surprisingly well for me. I have to emphasise that<strong> <span style="color: #ff6600;">im not 'smart', i worked very hard for O levels</span></strong>. However, i could not decide on which JC to go.</p>
              <p>I'm considering: NYJC / SRJC/ TPJC / MJ, these are my concerns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NYJC: </span></p>
              <p>I have<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> buses which can reach there just in about 30min</strong></span>. The school is rather <strong><span style="color: #008000;">new, have good facilities, and it offers Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP)</span>,</strong> which attracts my attention because i'm better in CL.</p>
              <p>However, my concerns is that, i have been a<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">very average student from neighbourhood school.</span></strong> Hence, NYJC seems to be <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">TOO GOOD FOR ME</span></strong>. Moreover, i heard from my friend from chung cheng high main that many of her classmates may go NYJC. Thus, i'm afraid that i <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">wont stand any chance there</span></strong>. Also, even though i had been doing well for HCL n CL in secondary school, w<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ith FTs and SAP school student , i may not continue to do well in CLEP. I am also unsure of their combinations because they does not have a list of it.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SRJC </span></p>
              <p>It's <span style="color: #008000;">nearer to my house</span>, can reach in about 30mins. However, it<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> doesn't seems like a 'good' school? It was ranked 14 among 19 JCs. </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TPJC</span></p>
              <p>45mins bus ride from my house. It has been a <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>culture for student of my school to go either TPJC or MJ.</strong></span> However, i heard that their <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>university rate is as low as 30%</strong></span>. Hence it doesn't seems good. It's ranked 15th. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MJ</span></p>
              <p>It has been a t<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>radition for student in my school to go MJ/TPJ.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It offers a subject combination <strong><span style="color: #008000;">which i'm interested in. H2 econs, maths, cl lit and H1 GSC.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1 hour trip</strong></span> and there isn't direct bus, which make it <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">very inconvinient. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Heard that students are being <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>pushed very hard there</strong></span>, and there are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>many students in JC1 being retained or kicked out </strong></span>as the school needed to maintain their standard.</p>

              <p>I am a combined science student, taking H2 sciences. It's a result of people like you that people keep coming up to me during the school's open house and have such worry about taking a H2 science subject with combined science. I got a high distinction for my promos, over all these pure science students with apparently 'greater knowledge' as the take pure science. I don't have tuition, and neither am I born smarter then any other student (This is why I took combined sciences in the first place). I pay attention to the lectures, tutorials, do my work on time, and study whenever there is a test consistently. And that's how I do well. Some people in my secondary school who dropped to combined sciences to pure still did worser than my combined science class.</p>
