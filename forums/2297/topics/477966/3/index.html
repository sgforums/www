              <p>Hi everyone here. Im new here so please bear with me, sorry for anything stupid that I might have said.</p>
              <p>Just got by my results and I was rather disappointed, I wanted a L1R5 of 9 so I could get into MJC, turns out I got a raw of 12. With the 2 bonus points from CCA, I still only have 10, so I have an extra point. The thing is, I really want to go to MJC because it is convinient and is a 'decent' JC. What are my chances if I place that as my first choice? (I know it is based of vacancies and no of people who actually got &lt;9. Im just wondering if anyone had actually got into a JC even tho their point is 1 more than their cutoff.) Or should I just opt for SRJC, which is slightly closer to my home, but none of my friends are even going there (sorry if this is a stupid reason, please bear with it). Any advice is welcomed, thanks :D</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>No chance of MJC. Go ahead and put it as your first choice if you like, no harm doing so, just that there's no chance of getting into a JC when you don't make the cut off point. SRJC is a good choice, it being close to your home, and SRJC's results have been improving every year in the last 5 years.</p>

              Millennia Institute does not even follow its Cut-Off-Point when
              accepting students into the school, and even those with 30+ points
              for L1R4 can be in this school, when the Institute of Technical
              Education is clearly better for them. I mean, Yes, Millennia
              Institute should continue to exist to give O level students who are
              late-boomers another chance to study A levels. However, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Cut-Off-Point
              should be followed (strictly)</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, so that only those
              who have the ability for A level but are just not boomed yet to be
              in a Junior College would be in Millennia Institute, while those
              who are neither boomed to be in a JC nor have the ability for A
              level should instead pursue </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">other kinds of
              education</span></strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> which </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may be</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suitable</span> for them to

              <p>I don't see what's wrong. If there are still available space, why not let people who wants to study the A level system continue in it instead of turning them away and forcing them to study in another system? We aren't communist. </p>
              <p>Of course, the system of meritocracy still applies. Those who fare better will still get priority.... the hard truth</p>

              <p>There seems to be "phantom threads" in this forum today. </p>
              <p>There was a thread asking if Mother Tounge has to be taken at Millennia Institute. Well, I would say, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">unless have Mother Tongue exemption, <strong>Mother Tongue is a</strong> compulsory subject at Millennia Institute. It's either you take MTL B, H1 MTL or H2 MTL. Actually, I think it is also a <strong>compulsory subject at Junior College</strong>.</span></p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"><span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><span style="color: #888888;"> I'm tired already. How many more times do I have to write this? </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">well, let's just finish this once and for all. I don't want to write this again.</span></span></p>
              <p>I do not encourage students to go to Millennia Institute, if their L1R4 is not even below 21 to be eligible to apply to Millennia Institute. Millennia Institute is for you, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only i</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>f</strong> your L1R5 is above 20, L1R4 is below 21 and you want to get a A level certificate</span>.</span></p>
              <p>If your L1R5 is below 21 and you want to get a A level certificate, go apply to a Junior College.</p>
              <p>If your L1R4 is slightly above the Cut-Off-Point for a Polytechnic course that you would like to pursue, go and seek conditional admission into that Poly. course, and re-take a/some O level subject(s) in your first year at Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>If your L1R4 is above 20 and no Polytechnic course has your interest, go apply to the Institute of Technical Education. It is not wise to appeal into Millennia Institute. <em>Besides,</em> I heard ITE students can go directly to Year 2 when they move on to Polytechnic after ITE.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, I need some help on whether I shld go JC or poly...</p>
              <p>My L1R5 is 14 and after deduction fromm CCA is 12</p>
              <p>The subjects grade is as followed:</p>
              <p>English - C6</p>
              <p>E. Math - A1</p>
              <p>A. Math - A2</p>
              <p>CH (Hist) - B3 (Kinda shock cos i usually can get A1)</p>
              <p>Chemistry - A2</p>
              <p>Combined Science (P, B) - A1</p>
              <p>Chinese - A1</p>
              <p>Seen the SRJC website and wanted the combi:</p>
              <p>H2-CLL H2-Math H2-Chem H1-Hist/Econs</p>
              <p><strong>JC </strong></p>
              <p>Should I try SRJC given that my L1R5 is 12 which is the COP for last year?</p>
              <p>Would a C6 for English person be able to handle GP cos I have no idea what GP is like?</p>
              <p><strong>Poly</strong></p>
              <p>If I were to go poly, I only have a limited choice to choose as I do not intend to take on math related courses like business or science related courses. I would most likely end up in humanities courses and afraid that I would choose the wrong one...</p>
              <p>So which route should I go? Really in a dilemna right now...</p>

              <p>So, maybe it is possible to appeal to the JC of your choice, if their Cut-Off-Point is +/- 2-3<em>-5</em>.</p>

              <p>Thanks. But I already withdraw from my previous poly last year. So I thought I have to apply through JAE again and I expected to see the list of courses for poly but I was pretty shocked that none of it is available for me to choose.</p>

              <p>You get to jump straight to second year, but it's expected of you to remember the poly stuff after NS. In my opinion, that's real tough.</p>

              <p>Granted, past history has shown very minimal number of poly grads to uni scoring First Class Honours. That has probably to do with the fact that Uni studies are perhaps more similar to JC than Poly.</p>

              <p>If you don't skip the first year, then you would have spent an additional one year compared to your peers from JC. One year of time.... lots could have been achieved... </p>
              <p>Uni studies being similar is just my opinion. I have never been educated in Poly, so I'm not exactly sure. But personally I find it just a minor step up from JC syllabus.</p>
