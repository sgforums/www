From what I hear it's like 10% can get A in the module tests only. Despite me getting 80++. So if my course has 40 vs 200+, will I have to be top 4 or top 20 respectively? But then again along of courses can take the same module, but how about those specific to one course only? Please advice. <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. Business administration or int. business in SP? BA intake 200+ vs IB 40. Understand IB is competitive, current year only 2 got gpa 4.00. But the rest do ok except for some 2 pts only. Not sure about BA as I didn't find out. But currently more inclined to BA <br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">3. If you happen to be in BA please advise on environment and attitude of students.

              it hard ? I don't want to play anymore and go to poly straight. My
              friend said if do very well in first semester then can go to poly
              straight.is this true ?pls help</span></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi smokey the bear i would actually advise that you retake the o levels again instead of going nitec. Let say if you were to go to nitec, you would be facing with a new ITE syllabus that you are totally unfamiliar with and, above all, have to get 3.5+ to qualify for poly. Instead why not decide what poly course to you really want to go and work towards it, since you should be more familiar with the "O" levels syllabus and hence easier. Every Poly course would have an ELR2B2 (English, 2 relavant and 2 best subjects) entry score, so go find out what are the two relavant subject your course needs and study for it.</p>
              <p>For example the R2 subjects for a Diploma in Biomedical Science in SP is</p>
              <p>Have a grade in Mathematics (Elementary / Additional)</p>
              <p>              and</p>
              <p>also a grade in any of the subjects listed below.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Biology </li>
              <li>Biotechnology</li>
              <li>Chemistry </li>
              <li>Combined Science </li>
              <li>Physical Science </li>
              <li>Science (Chemistry, Biology) </li>
              <li>Science (Physics, Biology) </li>
              <li>Science (Physics, Chemistry)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>So for your next retake you have only have to take English, the two relavant subject that your dream course requires and your other two best subjects, adding up to only 5 subjects. Focus on these five and with your new found determination to not play anymore, you should be able to get into a Poly course in no time. :)</p>

              <p>I have to agree, we get too ahead of ourselves and take Singapore for granted. Have to change that!!</p>
              <p>I think the main problem with polys is that some of the diplomas seriously way too specialised and its hard to change when entering further education and some of them theres rarely any degrees for it</p>

              Hi! I can't decide between Nanyang JC or taking Accountancy in Ngee Ann Poly. I got 10 for l1r5 and 7 for l1r4 without deducting 2 points. 
              
              EL - A2
              MT - A1
              COMBINED HUMANS - A1 
              AM - A2
              EM - B3
              COMBINED SCIENCE - A1
              BIO - B3 
              
              I am worried that I won't be able to cope if I were to go JC. I dropped from pure science to combined science during the third term of Secondary 4 so I'm afraid that I cannot catch up with those who took pure science instead.Which path do you guys think will be better for me? I really need some advice as I'm really lost right now. Thank you so much!

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">This shows that it is possible for cut-off-points to increase. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You should make Nanyang Junior College your first choice, since your L1R5 (after deduction) is only 1 point above their cut-off-point. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Their cut-off-point may or may not increase, but it is worth trying.</span></li>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Your CCA grade is probably very good. so you can deduct another two points to '6'</span></li>
