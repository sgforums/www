Thanks again because now no one can help me directly. I had needed help for my topic and you had to lock it within hours before others can give me more advices. I understand u have to control the amt of topics in the owned-website of yours but I would definitely have helped if u could pause for a few secs n consider my situation for direct feedback. Thanks again, I don't think my impression of sgforums will be great now. Thanks FireIce</p></div>

              <p>Hi constructive comment here;) have u decided which uni course u want? If so u can look at their igp and decide if u think it'll be easier to enter through jc or poly route. Keep in mind poly is 3 years n jc 2. I got l1r5 net 10 and l1r4 net 7. Any advice for me as well? Most likely poly for me.</p>

              <p>I took O level as a Special Needs candidate. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Last year, in the class tests and school examinations, I scored A2 for my Chinese but my Chinese language proficiency was, in my opinion, at sub-pass standards.</span></p>
              <p>Whereas for the other subjects I took for O levels, in school tests and exams, I scored boarder-line grades for Additional Mathematics, Geography and English. I was struggling to pass Economics. In my prelim exam, I got C6 for English, C6 for Additional Mathematics, B3 for Mathematics, B4 for Science (Phy, Chem), D7 for Combined Humanities (SS, Geo) and C5 for <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Economics (GCEO).  </span></p>
              <p>However, yesterday, when my O level results came out, I actually got B3 for English, A1 for Combined Humanities, C6 for Economics , B3 for Mathematics, B3 for Additional Mathematics, B3 for Science, A1 for Chinese and Distinction for Chinese (Oral/Aural).</p>
              <ul>
              <li>It seems that the grading for Special Needs candidates is different than the grading for the mainstream candidates.</li>
              <li>For instance, my SS and Geography has been at boarder-line standards in school tests, but at O levels, I actually got A1.</li>
              <li>Likewise, for English, my standard in school tests was always at sub-pass region, but at O levels, I actually got B3.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, I am lost. My L1R5 is 14 and my L1R4 is 11, but somehow, I do not think this is my actual results.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">By the way, I am from Westwood Secondary School. It is considered one of the <strong>lower-end</strong> schools of the better neighborhood schools in Jurong West.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When my school gave me exam papers from other sec schs to do, where some of them are at "lower rank" than my school, I actually did <strong>worse</strong> than how I fared for my own school papers.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So, no, I do <strong>not</strong> think it is because my school papers are more difficult than O levels, that's why I can "improve so much" overnight.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Otherwise, my Mathematics would have improved from B3, rather than remain at B3.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I want to know my actual L1R5 and L1R4. </p>
              <p>If you know how to convert Special Needs grading to Mainstream grading, please tell me the actual L1R5 and L1R4 points that I got. </p>
              <p>I am lost. I do not know what route to take or what school to choose. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <li>It seems that the grading for Special Needs candidates is
              different than the grading for the mainstream candidates.</li>
              <li>For instance, my SS and Geography has been at boarder-line
              standards in school tests, but at O levels, I actually got A1.</li>
              <li>Likewise, for English, my standard in school tests was always
              at sub-pass region, but at O levels, I actually got B3.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Now, I am lost. My L1R5 is 14 and my L1R4 is 11, but somehow, I
              do not think this is not my actual results.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">By the way, I am from
              Westwood Secondary School. It is considered one of the
              <strong>lower-end</strong> schools of the better neighbourhood
              schools in Jurong West.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When my school gave me exam
              papers from other sec schs to do, where some of them are at "lower
              rank" than my school, I actually did <strong>worse</strong> than
              how I fared for my own school papers.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So, no, I do
              <strong>not</strong> think it is because my school papers are more
              difficult than O levels, that's why I can "improve so much"
              overnight.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Otherwise, my Mathematics
              would have improved from B3, rather than remain at B3.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I want to know my actual L1R5 and L1R4. </p>
              <p>If you know how to convert Special Needs grading to Mainstream
              grading, please tell me the actual L1R5 and L1R4 points that I
              got. </p>
              <p>I am lost. I do not know what route to take or what school to
              choose. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi S97,</p>
              <p>my personal take is that most of the schools' examinations and teachings are at a disconnect with what is being tested at the national examinations.</p>
              <p>This is my personal observation for both O Level and A Level. And is my only explanation for the great disparity in results. You aren't the only one. I have students who have been consistently failing in school examinations getting A1s and A2s. </p>
              <p>I trust MOE will practice meritocracy, and I don't think they will give you special consideration at all, unless the subjects you took are different from the mainstream cohort.</p>

              <p>Hi s97, </p>
              <p>I don't think the grading for u is different from mainstream, becos I also had access arrangement (large print paper) but have been told there is no 'special consideration' for marks. I think the results were what you actually deserved, becos many people from my school, including myself also borderline pass for combined humanities during school exams but scored A1 in o levels.</p>

              <p>Eagle and ValluvMango are right. The grading bell curve is the same, special needs or not. Special needs students are only given very specific and limited help, if any at all, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">outside</span></strong> the grading system, such as extra time, physical help from the invigilators in performing certain tasks such as drawing, holding apparatus, etc. Your grades are not modified in any way.</p>
              <p>The reason why schools deliberately set tougher papers than the national exams :</p>
              <p>Nice reason :</p>
              <p>They want to 'wake up the student's idea' by shocking them out of complacency and motive them into working harder and scoring better for the national exams.</p>
              <p>Not-so-nice reason :</p>
              <p>The teachers are under pressure from HODs are under pressure from principals are under pressure from superintendents are under pressure from MOE HQ, at each level fearing for their (ie. the teachers') own personal grading, ranking, work reviews and promotion prospects, rather than genuine concern for the students' themselves. Hence, each school will compete against each other to set the toughest, most sadistic prelim papers (boasting and bragging rights), thinking that this will help the school's national results ranking against other schools (such ranking is of course still being done, but simply not released to the public).</p>

              <p>Hey!</p>
              <p>I need some advice on poly or JC</p>
              <p>First off,</p>
              <p>L1R4 (ELR2B2 for all) - 8 (after deducting 2)</p>
              <p>L1R5 - 11 (aft deducting 2)</p>
              <p>EL - A2</p>
              <p>Maths - A2</p>
              <p>Comb Sci (Phy,Chem) - A1</p>
              <p>A Maths - C6 (hahahaha i didnt take amaths seriously, thanks to calculus and trigo that made me flunk :/)</p>
              <p>Comb Humans (SS,Geog) - B3</p>
              <p>Malay - B3</p>
              <p>Computer Studies - A2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did some planning for what career path i should set myself and have interests on. And personally I'd love a career in <strong>Science/Engineering.</strong></p>
              <p>After much reading, I do know that the prospects of engineering degree aren't good in Singapore. (very low increment and all) But i found myself really interested in it as compared to other professions. </p>
              <p>My preferred field of engineering is Chemical, followed by Mechanical. I do know that Chemical E is not chemistry and it contains less than 40% of chemistry. I wanna work in jurong island in petrochem or pharmaceutical sectors or at the R&amp;D sectors. hahaha and CE (NUS) or cbe (NTU) is an elitist course requiring spectacular grades from A's.</p>
              <p>Well other than that my other interests are a degree in Physics/Chemistry and then getting in the education sector. (if i have second upper or first class I can apply for stat boards and govt jobs).</p>
              <p>(I'd try to get a BBA or MBA if I want to jump ship from the engineering sector to finance industry.)</p>
              <p>I know i'm stubborn and all trying to get an engnrg degree where the outlook isnt bright in Singapore but I like studying the 4-year hellish engineering degree that gives me analytical, practical and problem-solving (real time) skills</p>
              <p>My problem is I do not know to pick Poly or JC (even after much reading of forums and visiting open houses)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Poly Route</strong></span></p>
              <p>SP Dip in Chemical Engineering (COP 13)</p>
              <p>High number of grauates make it to university (as what I have heard, even from the lecturers themselves, more than half of them) Problem is i heard that even the stellar graduates (GPA &gt; 3.8) cant make it with first class in NUS/NTU chem engrng, considering that the A level graduates are really excellent. What I got from SP is that they have added in Engineering Mathematics I and II A and B yet I still have this fear that it doesnt prepare me well for university and I'd die in there. If possible, I actually wouldn't want to be exempted because of diploma as I'd enter Uni after NS (and i would forget some of the stuff in poly as the 2 years pass)</p>
              <p>My other interested diplomas are applied chem with mat science and applied chem with pharmaceutical science, from which both i can apply for a degree in applied chemistry or chemistry, for the mat science i can apply for degree in Materials Science and Engrng. OR I can get a diploma in Mechanical Engineering but i don't really know whats the outlook of Mech Engrng graduates</p>
              <p>Another advantage I have is for dip graduates to go uni, they need 20% of o level results and i think i already have it on my bag, although 8 points L1R4 isnt really good actually (or 11 points L1R5)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I love about Poly life is</span></p>
              <p>1) Practical, problem solving and real world application</p>
              <p>2) No major exams ( that doesnt mean no stress ) but all is tested on your everyday performance and a few tests here and there</p>
              <p>3) flexible and i can have study life balance with it</p>
              <p>4) No uniforms yay</p>
              <p>5) not much PE, but still have NAPFA (i'm not really sports person)</p>
              <p>6) If i fail, theres a diploma to fall back on and I can apply for overseas Uni for more exposure and such</p>
              <p>7) Internships, Industrial Training Programmes for more experience </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What I dont really like about Poly</span></p>
              <p>1) A lot of projects (Theres also PW in Uni but its only J1) - I dont want teammates who are freeloaders and make the hardworking ones do all the work</p>
              <p>2) Hard to get into Local Uni</p>
              <p>3) Less Prep for Uni </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JC Route</strong></span></p>
              <p>Easier to get into Local Uni but stress for two years!</p>
              <p>My combination that I think I'm gonna take is PCEM</p>
              <p>Physics Chem and Maths H2 with H1 economics</p>
              <p>The JCs i'm eligible for is the neighbourhood JCs,</p>
              <p>Innova,Yishun,Pioneer,Jurong, Serangoon, Tampines, Catholic(if i appeal as my COP is off by 1)</p>
              <p>If you recommend me JC, which JC do you think I should go to ?</p>
              <p>I live in woodlands btw, i can walk to innova in like 5 mins but as to what i heard innova focuses much more on sports fitness and stuff than studies itself and also heard that it is a dumping ground (NOT TRYING TO DISCRIMINATE IJC hahaha) </p>
              <p>Another JC close to me is YJC with also COP 20 but what i heard is that it is supposedly a better JC with a lower COP yet the principal set it higher to allow more people in</p>
              <p>Tampines and Serangoon are closer to my COP of 11 but tampines is really far off and serangoon one takes about an hour of travel so yeah</p>
              <p>What I'm afraid of in JC is flunking my A's, it would make my O levels redundant and also its really hard for me to go anywhere after that. My O's I studied most only on sec 4 and sec 1 to 3 i slack A LOT. I do know you cannot survive with that attitude and I will work hard. The pressure kinda helps me study but if I have too much of it I usually give up. i need to change that seriously if im going JC</p>
              <p>Subject wise I dont mind studying H2 chem and physics as I love sciences too but Maths are what I'm afraid of (considering my poor AMaths results and after looking at the textbooks) GP i THINK i'm gonna be okay with but Malay is another hurdle to overcome.</p>
              <p>I heard its really hard for comb science students to take H2 chem and physics and its on a totally diff level but I do like studying them</p>
              <p>The things that make me fear JC is the stress level being really high and also theres nothing for me to fall back on to if i failed my A levels</p>
              <p>If you recommend me JC, which JC should I go to</p>
              <p>So thats it</p>
              <p>I'm REALLY SORRY as this post is super long but I hope I can get some advices on this :) Im really grateful if you took the time to read this! </p>
              <p>THANKS</p>

              <p><br>Warning / Take Note :</p>
              <p>Many JCs will not allow O level Combined Sciences Phys/Chem students to take H2 Phys + H2 Chem, even if you get A1. The guidelines for most JCs is that if you only have combined science phys/chem, you're only allowed to take either H2 Phys or H2 Chem, but not both.</p>
              <p>This will be a problem if you wanna take Chem Engineering, which requires both H2 Phys and H2 Chem.</p>
              <p>Of course, such JC guidelines are always up to the HOD's discretion to make exceptions for students who can convince them. And some JCs are more strict, others are more relaxed, in these guidelines.</p>
              <p>Just so you know.</p>
