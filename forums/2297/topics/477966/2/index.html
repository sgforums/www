              <p><br> Warning / Take Note :</p>
              <p>Many JCs will not allow O level Combined Sciences Phys/Chem
              students to take H2 Phys + H2 Chem, even if you get A1. The
              guidelines for most JCs is that if you only have combined science
              phys/chem, you're only allowed to take either H2 Phys or H2 Chem,
              but not both.</p>
              <p>This will be a problem if you wanna take Chem Engineering, which
              requires both H2 Phys and H2 Chem.</p>
              <p>Of course, such JC guidelines are always up to the HOD's
              discretion to make exceptions for students who can convince
              them. And some JCs are more strict, others are more relaxed,
              in these guidelines.</p>
              <p>Just so you know.</p>

              <p>Hmmm Alright then thanks for the tip, any tips which of the JCs is more 'relaxed' ?</p>
              <p>Plus will it be a huge gap for a comb sci student to take up H2 Chem or Physics as compared to a pure sci student taking it ?</p>
              <p>Adding on, considering my amaths isnt good, is it going to be a struggle to take up H2 maths (I heard the criteria was to pass Amaths which i did)</p>

              So i just got back my O level results yesterday and i got 8 raw and 4 overall.. 
              So right now im deciding between hci or njc. I know i cant get into HCI with that score but im hoping to appeal in using my cca and also because i have 7A1s. On the other note, i got B3 for english and C6 for HCL. 
              What im afraid of is that NJC will reject me because I put them as second choice.
              So what are the chances of that happening?
              And also what are the chances of HCI accepting my appeal? Is it very slim?
               help!!

              <p>I came from an engineering background. I can say it really depends on which engineering route you intend to take.</p>
              <p>If it is engineering in the manufacturing sector... not very good. If the costs gets too high, these companies typically move to Vietnam or Malaysia nowadays.</p>
              <p>Engineering in govt sector, i.e. DSTA, they typically take in first class honours, pay is quite good, but hours could be real long with no OT pay.</p>
              <p>Engineering in IT Backend:  Not that good currently. Good luck... </p>
              <p>Engineering in Internet companies like Google, Facebook: Very good.</p>
              <p>Plus with the training in engineering, especially in the area of computers, if you happen to have an idea on how to make use of technology (smart phones and tablets) for business, an engineering background would help you much more than you know.</p>

              <p>The choice is yours.</p>
              <p>My only comments are based on your grades</p>
              <p>A-Maths C6: Seeing that you are exceptionally weak at Calculus and Trigo, you will definitely fare badly for H2 Maths at A Level. There's still calculus, and while Trigo is not a topic, it's still omnipresent in many of the topics. School teachers also expect you to know your O level stuff already</p>
              <p>Combined Science A1: While you may have gotten an A1, considering the academic depth and the other students within this bell curve, you probably will have big problems in both H2 Physics and H2 Chemistry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either one of those situations alone would require you to work super hard during JC. Now you are faced with both. I would say JC route would be super super tough for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poly route may be easier, but I dare say going into local university will be very very hard. Govt may say that they will open more slots for university, but they have to consider for the many numbers of A level grads each year as well, who would have nothing to fall back on if they don't qualify for Uni.</p>

              <p>Petro/Pharma is under manufacturing right? Alright will take that in mind. Is it worth it to pursue an engineering degree? I dont know to go to biz for prospects or keep to my interests in Engineering. </p>
              <p>Besides, another qn, since I want to take up Eng in U, which route is actually better in terms of preparing me for the degree itself? What I know is that the benefits of poly graduates is that since they had some exp they have a headstart but are the academics enough for them ?</p>

              <p>The choice is yours.</p>
              <p>My only comments are based on your grades</p>
              <p>A-Maths C6: Seeing that you are exceptionally weak at Calculus
              and Trigo, you will definitely fare badly for H2 Maths at A Level.
              There's still calculus, and while Trigo is not a topic, it's still
              omnipresent in many of the topics. School teachers also expect you
              to know your O level stuff already</p>
              <p>Combined Science A1: While you may have gotten an A1,
              considering the academic depth and the other students within this
              bell curve, you probably will have big problems in both H2 Physics
              and H2 Chemistry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either one of those situations alone would require you to work
              super hard during JC. Now you are faced with both. I would say JC
              route would be super super tough for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poly route may be easier, but I dare say going into local
              university will be very very hard. Govt may say that they will open
              more slots for university, but they have to consider for the many
              numbers of A level grads each year as well, who would have nothing
              to fall back on if they don't qualify for Uni.</p>

              <p>{<span style="color: #888888;">There was a thread asking if Millennia Institute should be choosen but it seems to be deleted, while I was writing my reply. So, I am writing it here.</span>}</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If your L1R5 is below 21, and if you want to get A level certificate, you should go to JC. Even the 20 points ones are better than Millennia Institute.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If your L1R4 is below 21 but you cannot go to JC, you should go to Polytechnic. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I <strong>strongly discourage</strong> students to go to Millennia Institute. </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Firstly</span>, among the JAE applicants who go into Millennia Institute, 10% are those who are eligible for Junior College. They choose Millennia Institute because Millennia Institute is the only government school that offers Business courses at A level, and/or they stay in Bukit Batok and they do not want to travel so "far" to the Junior Colleges. The 10% are the big fishes who would come in and occupy the small pound at Millennia Institute, while the 90% are the small fishes who have to struggle and fight for their share at Millennia Institute. If you are already not eligible to go to Junior College, <strong>it is going to be difficult for you to fight for a "place" for yourself in Millennia Institute, as you are competing with those who actually can go to Junior College.</strong></li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Secondly</span>, statistics have shown that among the Year 3 cohort of Millennia Institute - who are the residue after 2 years of "filtering" (promotion) -  only 30% of them can qualify for Local University with their A level certificate. As I have mentioned, 10% of the Year 1 cohort are JC-elligibles and the remaining 90% are not. That 10% of JC-elligibles already form part of the 30% who would go to Local University, if they keep up their effort. Considering that there are students who would retain or drop-out along the way, if you are the remaining 90% who are not eligible for Junior College, your <strong>chances of going to Local University is actually less than 20%, if you go to Millennia Institute.</strong></li>
              <li>In addition to the second point, students of Millennia Institute are fighting with students of the Junior Colleges (which includes National Junior College and Hwa Chong Institution), except for two A level subjects that are only offered in Millennia Institute, but there must be a reason why they were phased out of Junior College in the past (there used to be Business stream in Junior College), such as it no longer being a requirement in many University courses, etc. In reality, Millennia Institute students are actually just there to lower the A level bell curve.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thirdly</span>, Millennia Institute does not really have a cut-off point. They admit students, regardless of their L1R4, just to fill up their vacancies. As such, there are those whose L1R4 is in the 30+ range at Millennia Institute, although logically it is better for them if they go to the Institute of Technical Education. As my secondary 3 chemistry teacher told me when I was misbehaving, "your attitude translate to your results", those with very high L1R4 points are those with bad study attitude. So, regarding your question on the environment at Millennia Institute, there are many discipline cases here, as many students here do not come here to study but to create nuisance. Even those who are eligible to go to Junior College can be affected negatively by them and deteriorate. In short, <strong>the environment here is bad</strong>.</li>
              <li>Adding on to the third point, at Millennia Institute, there is no such thing as "counselled to exit". Those who are "counselled to exit"(asked to leave) are retained instead and are in Year 1 together with those who are "retained" or "advanced"(but want to change subjects or feel that they need another year). This is how bad the environment is in Millennia Institute.</li>
              <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fourth</span>, in case you do not already know, the lessons at Millennia Institute are conducted in classrooms, unlike at Junior College where lessons are conducted in lecture theatres. Hence, the classroom conditions are very hard to control as there is only 1 teacher to 30 students in a class, unlike in Junior College, where there are more than 1 teacher to many students in a lecture theatre. Besides, it is harder to disturb the class or even dose off in lectures as the teacher conducting the lecture in front can easily see every student in the lecture theatre from the stage. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Secondly,</span> unlike in Primary School and Secondary School, there is no seating arrangement at Millennia Institute; The taller ones may sit in front and block the shorter ones behind of their view of the whiteboard. Meanwhile, at Junior College, as lessons are in lecture theatres where the seats are in rows of different heights, the taller ones in front would not block the shorter ones behind. In short, <strong>the environment in the classrooms/lecture rooms of Millennia Institute is bad and hard to control</strong>.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Fifth</span>, the notes produced by Millennia Institute are (usually) inferior to the notes produced by any Junior College.<strong> The notes by Millennia Institute are (usually) brief in content or even have crucial information missed out</strong>. You would have to resort to buying notes (illegally) from the "black market" or spend huge amounts of money buying guide books that are very expensive (some are beyond $50), otherwise you would tend to lose out from those who have such resources.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <div>In short,<strong> I discourage you to go to Millennia Institute</strong>.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Don't come to Millennia Institute. It is only going to be a waste of time. Time is precious.</p>
              <p>Besides, there must be a reason why Aggregate points exist. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A level is not for everyone. If A level is for everyone, the Junior Colleges would not have cut-off points.</span></p>
              <p>There are alternatives to A level, which you can take to arrive at a course in Local University. </p>
              <p>Polytechnic --&gt; Local University</p>
              <p>ITE --&gt; Polytechnic --&gt; Local University</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em>By the way, just for your information, our Institute of Techincal Education is recognised by the international community. There are foreigners from other countries who come here just to get a ITE certificate. </em></span></p>
              <p>A level is only one of the many routes to University. You do not need A level to go to University. There are other routes to Univeristy.</p>
              <p>Please be wise in your decision.</p>

              <p>Can we <strong>not</strong> mis-lead our innocent juniors into making decisions which they may regret after making them? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sorry for being rude, but in my opinion, I feel that you probably just want them to go to a school which they have difficulty surviving, then repeat a year or so before giving up and opt for another route, so that you can have your business and make your money. You know, there are many other ways to make money for yourself, besides tricking people into taking the wrong route and have them come to you with money. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you care for them, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you should let them know the reality</strong></span>, so that they would not make the mistakes that can be avoided now, and do well in their tertiary education.</span></p>
              <p>I do not wish to see students go to Millennia Institute and realise that Junior College is better for them, or realise that the A level path is not their cup of tea. </p>
              <p>Not saying that nobody should go to Millennia Institute. Personally, I feel that Millennia Institute is only for those who <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really qualify to be at Millennia Institute</span></strong> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cannot go to Junior College</strong></span>, not for those whose L1R4 is above 20 or those who come here just because they cannot get into the Poly. course that they want (even if they cannot qualify into the Poly. course, they can always request for conditional admission, where they would re-take certain subjects at Year one).</p>
              <p>I understand the Ministry Of Education wants to give late-boomers another chance to do A levels, that is why Millennia Institute still exists. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, they should <strong>bear in mind that there are students who are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still not matured in their thinking</span> and would decide to come here <span style="text-decoration: underline;">purely based on their interest</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without considering the reality</span></strong>. Instead, MOE should treat students as children and only allow them to study what they are qualified to study, besides what they are interested to study. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do not understand why Millennia Institute does not even follow its Cut-Off-Point when accepting students into the school, and even those with 30+ points for L1R4 can be in this school, when the Institute of Technical Education is clearly better for them. I mean, Yes, Millennia Institute should continue to exist to give O level students who are late-boomers another chance to study A levels. However, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Cut-Off-Point should be followed (strictly)</span></strong>, so that only those who have the ability for A level but are just not boomed yet to be in a Junior College would be in Millennia Institute, while those who are neither boomed to be in a JC nor have the ability for A level should instead pursue <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">other kinds of education</span></strong> which <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">may be</span> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suitable</span> for them to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excel</span> in</strong>.</span></p>

              <p>Hi everyone here. Im new here so please bear with me, sorry for anything stupid that I might have said.</p>
              <p>Just got by my results and I was rather disappointed, I wanted a L1R5 of 9 so I could get into MJC, turns out I got a raw of 12. With the 2 bonus points from CCA, I still only have 10, so I have an extra point. The thing is, I really want to go to MJC because it is convinient and is a 'decent' JC. What are my chances if I place that as my first choice? (I know it is based of vacancies and no of people who actually got &lt;9. Im just wondering if anyone had actually got into a JC even tho their point is 1 more than their cutoff.) Or should I just opt for SRJC, which is slightly closer to my home, but none of my friends are even going there (sorry if this is a stupid reason, please bear with it). Any advice is welcomed, thanks :D</p>

              <p>Why not MJC first choice and SRJC second choice to try?</p>
              <p>Do you have any CCAs to appeal with?</p>
