              <p>By elimination, we should know A, B and C are wrong already. How can a molecule be less dense than its own molecule? Or larger? Or move faster in the same temperature range?</p>
              <p>Intermolecular forces (or van der waal forces) are weak for liquid, and is a reason for the molecules being further apart as compared to solids. </p>

              <p>at first I also not sure... then I think again w.r.t. to you pointing out of convection currents before I come up with a possible explanation</p>
              <p>What is important in heat transfer in convection current is the speed at which the molecules move. And temperature is sort of a measure of the kinetic energies of the molecules. So for a certain temperature, molecules will have the same average kinetic energy. A lighter molecule will thus have a speed larger than a heavier molecule for the same kinetic energy. Thus, because it moves faster, the convection current will be faster.</p>
              <p>Density doesn't matter because it also depends on volume as well. Furthermore, kinetic energy formula does not make use of density.</p>

              <p>Density DOES affect the rate of heat transfer in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Density affects both conduction and convection, the lower the density, the less likely the molecules will interact, the lower the rate of heat transfer. Hence, air is not a good conductor of heat compared to solids, and therefore does not transfer heat to another substance well.</p>

              <p>Surface area, by the means explained aboved.</p>
              <p>But mass...besides affecting the heat capacity of the substance at a given temperature should not affect the rate of heat transfer.</p>

              <p>We compare mass and density one by one while holding the rest of the factors constant.</p>
              <p>We have two objects, with identical density and colour. However, object A is twice as heavy as object B. We can now say that there are twice as many particles in A than in B, so heat transfer is definitely faster. (on a side note, surface area and volume will also increase because we assumed density constant. so more surface radiation also. but not important).</p>
              <p>As for density, I think you are a bit confused. If we say that object A is denser than object B, we actually mean that A's particles are individually heavier than B's particles. Let me make an example. If you cut out a slice of 1 cubic meters worth of uranium, it's gonna be a hell lot heavier than 1 cubic meters worth of carbon-12. Does the weight of the individual atoms in the uranium slice matter in heat transfer? </p>

              <p>I think TS didn't copy the whole question word for word, or the question wasn't set properly... Got a bit confused initially... Let me add some words:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The rate of heat transfer between an object and the surroundings
              does not depend on</p>
              <p>A colour of object</p>

              <p>C density of object</p>
              <p>D surface area of object</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is dependent on mass because heat loss = mass * specific heat capacity * change in temperature.</p>
              <p>And rate of heat transfer/loss/gain = heat loss/gain divided by time, that's all.</p>

              <p>I remember from material science module last sem: Density is explained by atomic packing factor(in 1 cubic meters of volume of space, how much the atoms actually displace). Many elements have the atomic packing factors 0.68 - 0.74. Not really a big difference on the larger scale of things (like when element A has twice the atomic mass of element B, does it matter whether A's APF = 0.68 or B's APF 0.74? If they both have roughly the same atomic mass, then B can have 8.8% higher density at most only.</p>

              I seem to differ, density of the surrounding ambience is very crucial to heat transfer under convection. Just relook at the Grashof's Number, where we relate density of the surrounding fluid to "rate" of natural convection.
