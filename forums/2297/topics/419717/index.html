              <p>Dear Judyllc, I believe you are asking this for your son. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If his O Level results do not qualify for Poly, he could retake his O Level through these two route</p>
              <p>1) School candidate (the very same secondary school, if school allow)</p>
              <p>2) Private candidate (from private schools like MDIS, BMC, citycollege, ITE General Programme night class)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He will not be able to study on his own as NS deferment requirement is a full-time study course. That left with the above two choices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand every student learn at different speed for different reasons. ITE may not seems to be a bad choice if your son does not enjoy learning textbook stuffs. Nowadays, there are many successful stories of ITE students advancing to Poly.</p>
              <p>ITE these days provide better and higher quality education. This route shall never be left out for consideration. Parents and people from older generation may have a negative stigma on ITE, but as an educator, I feel that ITE may seems to be the best choice for "late bloomers".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sit down and have a chat with your son :) Ask him which path he wish to take. Some times, you need to hear want he wants. Do not diminish his self-worth or scold him. He needs Encouragement, and only you can give him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. When I told my mum I got expelled by school, she was very dissapointed at first but supported my life decision and goals. Right now, I am still teaching and managing my own business. Technically speaking, I'm only O Level Grad, with experience to teach Poly/JC.</p>

              <p>ITE equipped its student with technical knowhow which is, in my opinion, deem more valuable than an O Level Grad. ITE grads are in high demand, and most of them secure a job within 6 months after graduation.</p>

              <p>Well, my friend take the route of O level -&gt; ITE --&gt; Poly --&gt; NUS (now studying business). But at that time, he deserved to go ITE because he is not interested in studying.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion is if you are really going to buck up, it is good to retain O level in your own school and  retake it again. </p>
              <p>If you are still sleeping and dont want to put in hard work, it is better you go ITE. </p>

              <p>What we need to do is to change that public or corporate perception - starting from how the govt recruits the best...and not necessarily must they be scholars or from top schools...if u know what i mean</p>

              <p>It's the best that you talk to your son about this. We as outsiders can only give you advice.</p>
              <p>If your son wants to man man lai want to play around first, let him go higher nitec before moving on to poly.</p>
              <p>But if your son is not satisfied with his results and want to do O's all over again with determination wanting to do well, then plead with the principal to give him a second chance, Do note this is done at the principal's discretion, or go to private institutes if the principle rejects.</p>
