              <p>It may seem unorthodox for a polytechnic student to want to transfer to a junior college but let me explain. I firmly believed that a polytechnic education is extremely relevant to real life, that it would let me have an idea of what I would do in the future. Wall of text incoming, if you don't want to read, just skip to TL;DR at the bottom.</p>
              <p>What I didn't expect is that I wouldn't be able choose coursemates. All selection is randomised. That means from now till 2014, I'll have to depend on my luck on the draw. I'm not exactly comfortable with that. Just yesterday me and another group member was finishing up on a statistic project while the other two were playing counterstrike right opposite of us (group 1) . It was essentially a two man team. Another project I had to do was basically a solo effort, though one or two did chip in a bit at the end with the powerpoints (group 2) (One member even went on holiday throughout). Group 3 didn't even want to meet up on the first week and now we're copying a previous 'A' student answer as we're short on time.</p>
              <p>I'm going to be honest, I'm not the best groupmate. I'm constantly want the projects to be done as early as possible so we can modify and improve on it later if need be. The problem with that is I'm not very tactful while doing so. I must be some flaw I have but it seems to me that the class I'm in doesn't really care about their projects. Another classmate skipped a project meeting to play pool, not from my group though. There are hardworking guys but I rarely get teamed up with them.</p>
              <p>The practicality of the year 1 course is questionable as well. I'm from year 1 Banking and finance in NYP if you're wondering. One module has us make a webpage, let's be clear about this, for a teacher who thinks coffee bean is a B grade at most. Never mind the teacher, why are we making webpages anyway? Knowing the code, I can understand. Building one, I can accept. Making a profession, aesthetically pleasing one?</p>
              <p>Now I'm considering a JC. It's not like I'm going in blind, I did attend Innova's orientation and I do know that it's really hardcore. Even in the first lecture, they started giving content heavy topics. It's no cake walk, I know that. But what's the alternative? JC opens much more  And yes, I know there's project work in JC, just not as much.</p>
              <p>Here are my grades, not pretty I know, but I want to go to Innova so it might suffice, I did get in before. It's of no consolation or point of pride but I only did last minute study with constant attention in class. Math is a weak point.</p>
              <p>English - A1</p>
              <p>CLB - Pass</p>
              <p>E.Math - C6</p>
              <p>Physics - B3</p>
              <p>Chemistry - B3</p>
              <p>Biology -C5</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities - A2</p>
              <p>I'm looking at 3 H2 1 H1 subjects being,</p>
              <p>H2 - Bio</p>
              <p>H2 - Chem</p>
              <p>H2 - Econs</p>
              <p>H1 - Math</p>
              <p>TL;DR- Poly wasn't what I thought; groupmates aren't really that interested; not sure if I should make the switch; feel JC has better opportunities; will consult textbooks to check out curriculum before ANY switch; will see poly score before switching; </p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>

              <p>Heh, good point, one I think I may have addressed, I transferred while knowing little of poly and making very many assumptions.

              <p>Everywhere you go, there will be group work, one way or the other. There is group work in JC. Lots of it.</p>
              <p>Even in university there were group projects I had to do. And yes, there were also idiots in my groups. One idiot was more interested in his part-time modelling career than his studies. Another idiot plagiarized his work from Wikipedia and conducted an online slur campaign against me when I ratted him out.</p>
              <p>If your whole reason for wanting to go to JC is to avoid group work, then you are wasting your time.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sorry if I gave the impression that it's the only reason. It's not even close. The main reasons for my want to transfer is due to my uncertainty of the job market (I'd like to keep my choice of degree as diverse as possible and I'm not sure if business is for me.) and I want to have a better shot at a university and an A-levels should give me that. If I'm any good, and honestly, that's the reason for my hesitation. The whole group dissatisfaction really just a really small reason with plenty of details. Yes, I understand JC has plenty of groupwork too and yes, I know working life/uni is rife with people who couldn't care about their work. It's human nature I suppose and I'm already dealing with it, I would think, successfully though with difficulty.</p></div>

              <p>Dear Surreptitiousartificer,</p>
              <p>I understand that you wish to transfer to JC. With your current GCE O Level results, you will not be able to get into any JC because of your grades and CLB.</p>
              <p>May I asked if you have registered for the GCE 2012 examination? If yes, I hope you included CL2 during the registration. Without a CL2, you will not be able to get into JC. If you have CLB, the maximum you can go is MI, the only institution that provides 3 year A level course.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, you are quite different from the others. Your mindset and mentality towards schoolwork and education makes you an execellent learner. You may feel that "why a Banking and Finance students is learning about making webpage", this one I can explain to you. This is call holistic multidiscipline learning. You learn a subject, and at the same time, the syllabus is designed to infuse, for this case, IT components to your learning. It's a value-added learning; you learn the core fundamental knowledge of your courses, and at the same time, you're expose to a healthy dose of other modules making learning fun. This will broaden your understanding for other aspect of learning.</p>
              <p>I used to study Biomedical Science at Republic Polytechnic till the final year before I dropped out for some reasons. I know it's stupid. After that, I took a year off from studying to self-learn IT. It's a great process for me because I learned many things that I am not able to learn in school like making iOS apps and learning databases and creating websites. No, please do not misunderstanding me. I love Biology, but I also like to try out new field of study to learn new things. Share with you a little about my dream. I have always wanted to infuse education and IT together.</p>
              <p>You're an excellent writer.</p>
              <p>The stuffs that you have described about your school project is very common issues. What I would say is "Great, you have differenciated yourself from other students". When the examination comes, ultimately, you are the one scoring higher grades. For the student who engaged lesser in the project, wish them good luck for their results. Ultimately, you're the winner of the day; you learn more new things, you understand your work better, you're a good learning.</p>
              <p>As far as I know, the grading components of the projects in NYP are based on the quality of work, individual presentations and reports, and etc. Different projects have different grading requirements, so as long as you put in your 100%, you will get the grades at the end of the day. Do let your lecture know what you're experiencing, as this will let the lecturer allocate grades on a fairer basis.</p>
              <p><br>Best regards,</p>

              <p>Additionally, I was pretty shocked when you said I couldn't transfer, why's that? I managed to get in last year and Innova does take in more than 20 pointers on several occasions. I have 20 points minus 1 from CCA would make 19, no? Unless you're privy to information that I don't know. Which is more than likely.</p>
              <p>@everyone else</p>
              <p>Thanks for your input but the major concern is that I don't have a.math, I'm not sure if banking is really the thing for me and my 'O' levels are sub-par. These are major concerns that will definitely affect my chances of getting into a uni. Ironically, the H1 math is going to help (hence relevance) in uni. </p>
              <p>Regardless, I'd like to thank all of you for your support. I was expecting a lot more angry comments but you guys have been remarably civil and I really appreciate that. Best of luck to all of you in your future endavours.</p>

              <p>Additionally, I was pretty shocked when you said I couldn't transfer, why's that? I managed to get in last year and Innova does take in more than 20 pointers on several occasions. I have 20 points minus 1 from CCA would make 19, no? Unless you're privy to information that I don't know. Which is more than likely.</p>
              <p>@everyone else</p>
              <p>Thanks for your input but the major concern is that I don't have a.math, I'm not sure if banking is really the thing for me and my 'O' levels are sub-par. These are major concerns that will definitely affect my chances of getting into a uni. Ironically, the H1 math is going to help (hence relevance) in uni. </p>
              <p>Regardless, I'd like to thank all of you for your support. I was expecting a lot more angry comments but you guys have been remarably civil and I really appreciate that. Best of luck to all of you in your future endavours.</p>

              <p>I'm a bit lag to post a reply now eh.</p>
              <p>But I am currently in a JC, halfway through my first year. So hey! we're same age, i think? </p>
              <p>But what are my thoughts of transfering. Firstly, follow your instincts, they are usually right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However i have to point out a few things. Firstly, if math is your weak point, then you're going for one horrible ride. I do not like math in secondary school, but nonetheless i did ok.. But after nine months in JC, completing Graphs, Sequences, Calculus, it is like nothing in secondary school.. Do not get discouraged though, many people that are struggling in JCs are those that had very good results. Those that did someone average, they are doing spectacular.</p>
              <p>I know nothing about bio.</p>
              <p>As for chem.... Well bout the same as math. It has changed radically.. But of course if you work hard, it will be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How's PW then?? Well.................................. If you transfer to JC due to bad members in poly, it won't get better in JC. Since you might likely to get a bad group and the whole PW system is a mess. First there is tutors. PW tutors teach PW on top of their own subject. Some of them may be really reluctant to help. If you argue that individual effort is more important than tutor's ability, well it is right, but many people will not have a clue on how to do a project and your tutors are the ones that are marking your scripts. </p>
              <p>Then PW has this weird feeling to it. It is a A level subject, but you don't carry out the full project. Your ideas belong to SEAB, seriously! they claim ownership one you submitted your work.... Then you are limited by the question. The timeline for PW is really weird, it is a coursework but you virtually submit everything at the end of the year... And then there are weird stuff that you need to do. Not to mention though it is called PW, almost 50% is individual effort. </p>
              <p>And it is really suprising how much time it takes... REALLY A LOT OF TIME</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not flaming PW though. It is a good iniative but it is one hell of a burden for many students. If you are lucky, you get an encouraging group, then good for you. haiz..... I have 2 more months to go....urgh</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you are seriously thinking of JC, why not? Make sure it is a well thought out choice and not a irrational urge. Life may get better afterwards, who knows?</p>

              <p>Because people consider "purely exams-based assessments" to be not holistic enough, which is a valid point.</p>

              H1 Maths help a bit, but help out not much as compared to H2 Maths. You can always check the NUS/NTU etc their course prerequisities website to see what subject you need to take in JC in order to get in to their course. 
              
              Grades are another thing. I hope you realised that you need v.good grades to enter uni via JC route. Still, I believe that with ur determination, you can get in to uni. 
              
              In case you are wondering where I'm coming from, I'm also currently a JC student, halfway through JC 1 also.

              <p>i was in the reverse (jc transfer to poly).<br><br>why not look at other course in poly?</p>
              <p><br>Lets do some reality check:</p>
              <p>O level:<br>CLB &gt;u will struggle</p>
              <p>E.Math - C6 &gt; u take H1 maths also will struggle<br><br>Bio - C5&gt; u take H2 bio also will struggle</p>
              <p>u are looking at:</p>
              <p>H2 - Bio</p>
              <p>H2 - Chem</p>
              <p>H2 - Econs</p>
              <p>H1 - Math<br><br>No H2 maths? Life will be very difficult if u want to enter local university without H2 Maths (i think they wont take you in for most Engineering, Science courses). H1 will not be sufficient. Ok lets say you want to take H2 maths, given that you have no Amaths background, you confirm also struggle.<br><br>So lets say you take H2 bio and H2 chem (without H2 maths), where do you want to go?<br><br>I am not giving you a cold shoulder but you have to consider this seriously. If you ever decide to transfer out, you need to work triple hard to get the foundation and content right. And i mean real solid. (i am a victim because my foundation was shaky in Maths (and i scored B4 for Amaths) and i flunk my H2 maths)<br><br>PS: if i am wrong in anyway, please correct me. <br><br>Grass always seemed greener on the other side, but not necessary tastier.</p>

              <p>Been a while since I checked back here, didn't expect this thread to still be active. Thanks LoveLoveTT for the insight, I know project work might go badly but hey, it's only one subject. In poly literally everything has some form of project work. </p>
              <p>@hiphop2009</p>
              <p>I share your concerns myself, in fact, seeing as how I feel I'm better at the humanities as compared to the sciences I decided to pick history and english literature in lieu of the sciences.</p>
              <p>As for math, I'm not too concerned about H1 as the university requirements for the accountancy courses have base requirements of H1 math. H2 does not get priority but do have a wider range of job options, as you've said. I, however, have little interest in the more mathematical occupations so it's not really a concern. </p>
              <p>As for my mothertongue, I can still pursue that at the 'basic' level, so I won't be taking the H1 version. Not that it'll be smooth sailing but from what I've heard, literally no one in Innova JC has ever failed CLB. H1 Math is probably going to be the most challenging.</p>
              <p>I don't expect JC life to be easy but life isn't easy. That's just the way of things, more so in Singapore, I feel. I could just stick to poly but I'd be fooling myself if I thought it would be easier in poly. I'd have to take up A math as a private candidate for starters. That's even before considering the limited university places for poly students and the intense competition for business courses in local universities. 23% of Singaporeans get to enter local universities, that's all the courses, mind you, not just the business ones. Limit it down to accountancy and the fact that it's an AA/B course (rumors say it'll go up), and literally ANY diploma holder can apply (combine that with around 15% poly student allocation out of 100% places in university, some say even that is pretty optimistic, that's some serious competition).</p>
              <p>Poly is a group effort and I gave this class a chance, it seems most simply don't care enough. When I approached a lecturer with my concern she told me I was "too intense", and told the group to "put up with me" and "learn to deal with people like me". There's this feeling of apathy in the air and I can't help but feel a certain sense of forboding everytime I get an assignment. </p>
              <p>I've already made up my mind. I'm still terrified of the prospect of going to a JC, but honestly, what's the alternative? It's my one shot to make it and I really hope I do. But talk is cheap, I'm reading up on economic journals, cold war texts, Charles Dickens works and gearing up for the inevitable hell they call tertiary education. Great expectations indeed.</p>
