              <p>The root of the problem is that Teachers today (not all, but most of them) are not passionate about their job. That's why end up kids dont understand their work, and cannot do the Maths.</p>
              <p>If a Tutor can do it, why cant the teacher do it?</p>
              <p>You may argue that Tutor have small group, but then the Teacher have the whole day!</p>
              <p>I ever have a Teacher advising me to arrange Tuition for my kid ??!!??!!</p>
              <p>I did not ask the teacher, but inside my head, "then what are you doing?" ; "why do I need to get a tutor to do your job".</p>
              <p>Maths is not difficult. I can teach a Pri 5 maths from Sec 4. It is a matter of whether you know or dont know.</p>
              <p>Parents find it difficult because Maths during their era is not the same as today.</p>
              <p>The Right person to teach them are their Teachers, not the Parents.</p>
              <p>Parents can help by providing a conducive environment, and ensuring their child's activities do not jeopardize their studies.</p>

              <p>It's not the fault of the teacher, it's the fault of the education system.</p>
              <p>When I was an MOE teacher, I once did suggest to a parent that she find tuition for her daughter (who was lagging behind her classmates) as an option. The parent reacted angrily, as you (StriveOn) did. But what the parent failed to understand, is that teachers are themselves the exploited victims of the MOE education system, and that in today's MOE education system, teachers are unable to focus on teaching, but are instead burdened with non-teaching duties.</p>
              <p>Every year, many of the best teachers leave MOE, because we realize we can focus better on teaching, and therefore help students more effectively, as tuition teachers rather than as MOE teachers.</p>
              <p>The shortcomings of the MOE education system (rather than the individual teachers) are why good tuition teachers or tutors, are arguably fulfilling an important and necessary service to Singapore society. Do not blame the tutors or the teachers, but the MOE education system.</p>

              <p>If the student has a clear focus on priorities and his/her future, with the will and perseverance, there are ways to overcome obstacles and personal problems.</p>
              <p>If the parents are understanding and supportive, instead of pressurizing and critical, a condusive home environment will go a long way to helping the student. If appropriate and finances allow, the parent can assist the student by engaging good tuition services.</p>

              <p>A lot of these maths qns don't make sense. Who the hell in the world will split 1/3 of his apples and pass it to the friend and then take 1/2 of the remainder to put in the fridge? Or whatever rubbish. A lot of these concepts cannot apply to real life situations. It forces people to think within the box and stifles creativity.</p>
              <p>These scholars at MOE are the very people who have been through the system and excelled at it when they were younger, no wonder we can see the direction where our curriculum is heading.</p>

              <p>On a related note :</p>
              <p><strong>Are children being stifled by ‘model answers’?“I will
              not give up the pear".<br> <br> Shin Min Daily News<br> <br></strong>A netizen recently posed a question on whether
              schools are stifling the creativity of children with expected
              answers to open-ended questions.<br> <br> The man had uploaded an image of a marked worksheet that his son
              had attempted in school.<br> <br> On the worksheet was the story of a boy named Kong Rong.<br> <br> Kong Rong had picked up a smaller fruit from a basket of pears so
              that his elder brother could have the larger one.<br> <br> The pupils were asked what they thought the moral of this story
              was. “If you were Kong Rong, what would you do?”, the students were
              asked.<br> <br> The boy who attempted the question answered: “I will not give up
              the pear.”<br> <br> This was marked by the teacher as a wrong answer.<br> <br> Wondering if there is really a ‘correct answer’ to the question,
              the boy’s father posted the worksheet onto the Internet.<br> <br> “Did Kong Rong really have to give up the pear?” he asked.<br> <br> “Are kids wrong if they don’t do the same?” he added.<br> <br> These are just some of the questions raised in the wave of
              discussion sparked by the post.<br> <br> Despite the apparent outrage, local primary school teachers all
              agree that they will similarly cross out the pupil’s answer as the
              wrong one.<br> <br> Speaking to reporters, a primary school Chinese teacher, known only
              as Ms Zhuang, 27, said, “If the pupil had also explained and
              justified why he would not give up the pear, it could be seen as an
              expression of creativity. But if it’s not justified, the answer
              will be wrong.”<br> <br> “We are looking for an answer that fits the moral conduct taught to
              pupils in the lesson. In the story, Kong Rong’s action exemplified
              the spirit of courtesy and consideration. The answer would only
              portray a selfish mindset in the pupil,” she added.<br> <br> A primary school English teacher, known only as Mr Yang, 37, felt
              that whether the answer is accepted will depend on the model
              answers provided by the examiner.<br> <br> The answer given by the boy here is, however, against traditional
              Chinese values and morals.<br> <br> “If my student gave such an answer, I may feedback to his or her
              parents about their child’s mindset,” he said.<br> <br> Shin Min Daily News also spoke to 15 primary school students to
              find out what they would do if they were Kong Rong.<br> <br> Five of the kids did not know who Kong Rong was, while the other
              ten all said they would give up the pear.<br> <br> But at least one student offered a different solution.<br> <br> “I would cut the pear in half and share it with my brother
              instead,” said the pupil.<br> <br> Source: Shin Min Daily News, 30 April 2012.
