              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>For DSA applications, is it compulsory for you to have a niche area? I think yea. My friend wants to apply for it but I told her that only students with certain specialisations can go for it. Am I right? thanks.</p>

              <p>Yes you will need to be outstanding in a certain field, be it sports or the arts ( e.g. music ). Different schools will also require you to have different minimum academic standard.</p>

              <p><br>Academic. But under AJC's column, there's this part under science research too. I think I could put that in since I have participated in some competitions which have won awards. By the way, if you go under academic category, does it mean they won't lower down the cut-off points for you as like the sports and arts area? Because after all, they are talking about academic results. So does it make it "useless" for you to apply if you go under the academic category? If yes, I'd rather not apply and save myself the hassle of going thorugh interviews.</p>

              <p>Academic and Science Research are 2 different categories.</p>
              <p>Academic is for those who have top their Sec school for the past 3 years, and/or those who top competitions like New South Wales ( Higher Distinction ).</p>
              <p>Science Research is for those who have participated in uni-level science research for at least one full month, and/or taken part in big-scale science research competition ( e.g.SYSF ). In this case you will also need A1/2 for at least 2 Science subjects and also both E. Maths and A. Maths.</p>
              <p>And you do not need to worry, even if you get a crappy 20 points for your "O" level, they cannot kick you out once they have already accepted you in.</p>
