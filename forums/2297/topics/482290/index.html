              <p>Hello, I'm quite new here.</p>
              <p>So, I'm currently an international student in one of singapore local school. I'm a sec4E student. I'm currently taking: Amath, EMath, science(chem/bio), humans(SS/geog), EL lit, Art, n of course, EL n MT (Malay) <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Well, I know that it's too soon to ask but, I just want to ask and have a solution sooner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, I'm in dilemma <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. I have always wanted to take physics if I were given a choice between physics and bio (and I did choose physics though but  the VP said that there was no vacancy for physics class for pure and combined class so I had no other choice but to just go with the flow). </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Moreover, at that point in time (last year) I was thinking of pursuing art degree in the future (as I like to draw) but then, now I'm thinking wouldn't it be better to take engineering course? I personally like to draw and that's why I take art for O level. However, for art to be my job in the future, it does not seem attractive for me anymore. Well, actually, I think that if art is going to be my job, I maybe going to hate it sooner or later and I don't want that to happen. So I'm thinking of other majors. After all, making your hobby to be your job isn't always a good idea</span></p>
              <p>*I was interested in animation and or game design</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, after doing some research (though I have always known) that engineering courses REQUIRE physics as prerequisites (be it in singapore or overseas or my home country), I begin to regret my decision of taking bio and my go with the flow attitude <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"> So, I'm wondering, if I do get into JC, is it possible for me to take physics? Be it H1 or H2, as long as I can take physics, I'll be very grateful. If anyone know, please tell me which JC it is and whether I need to take some kind of internal test? And I wonder will AJC allow it or not? (With internal test maybe?) and I'm willing to study very hard for physics to catch up and do well :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh yeah, right now, I'm very interested in computer science/computer engineering. Are these two majors REALLY NEED (and MUST HAVE) physics?(Especially for good universities)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank ni you and I'm sorry if there is spelling or grammar error <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              You can consider the following three suggestions (amongst many other possibilities) :
              <br><br>
              1) Negotiate with your HOD and Principal to let you self study (with private tuition) Physics, and register for O level Physics as a school candidate (ie. taking the O level exam at the same time as all your other subjects).
              <br><br>
              If the above fails, then :
              <br><br>
              2) Register as a private candidate for O level Physics (preferably Pure, and preferably together with Pure Chemistry), and take it one year after your O levels as a school candidate (since you're not allowed to simultaneously be a school candidate and a private candidate in the same year).
              <br><br>
              This option might appear to be a waste of 1 year (and hence most students won't even consider it), but hey, better to waste just 1 year, than to waste the rest of your life (studying and basing your career on a subject you don't enjoy).
              <br><br>
              3) Transfer to another school right now (ie. mid-term), even if it means a 'lousier' school, as long as the new school allows you to take Physics. If no school will accept you mid-term, then you have no choice but to wait 1 more year and reapply to another school (or ur existing school?) only at the end of 2014, and repeat Sec 3.
              <br><br>
              If you don't like any of these three suggestions, you could wait for other pple to advise you with other suggestions, or think of something else yourself.

              <p>Hello <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Thank you very much for replying.</p>
              <p>well, the problem is I'm now sec4 n my O level is this year so it's kinda impossible to do that <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> moreover, I'm already 17 so, by the time I get my O level certificate next year, I'll be 18 so I'll be too old <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>Also, I'm an international student. Thus, I'm not allowed to transfer school once I'm posted to a the school by MOE <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>Btw, do you think it's possible for me to take physics later in JC? (Though it's a very small possibility) and if it's a yes, which would you think will allow me to take physics?</p>

              <p>I am afraid that no JC will allow you to take H2 physics without O level physics. H1 physics I am not sure. You can surf the websites of the lower "banded" JCs and look at their subject requisites. O level physics is not really that difficult, you can take up private tuition this year too.</p>
              <p>You can try Ultimaonline's suggestions, or call up a private institute in Singapore or overseas whether they can let you do some bridging modules in physics then proceed to a private school engineering degree. But it will be costly and the degree may or may not be recognised in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p><br>This is my maiden post in SGForums Homework Section. I thought I'll give a bit of background before answering your question.  <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I obtained a Bachelor's Degree from NUS back in 2005, and also advanced degrees from other institutions. </span></p>
              <p>Your opening post tells me that you're indecisive; you wanted to pursue arts, then animation &amp; design, and now engineering. I understand that most of us do not know what we want when we're young, but the frequency which you changed your mind is alarming. </p>
              <p>Please, for the sake of yourself, keep your options open. Don't narrow down your options at such a young age.</p>
              <p>I encourage you to take Physics as a private candidate. It is essential for entry into Engineering. That said, Mathematics *IS* even more crucial. </p>
              <p>The main question is not "How" to take Physics, but whether you *should* do it. Engineering is not an easy course. It requires good foundation in Mathematics and Physics. If you want to go into it, please be prepared to brush up your foundation and work hard in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
