              <p>What subject combination are you interested in? Is it an unusual subject combination that only YJC allows?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you should also consider distance from your home as an important factor. Is YJC close or far?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding 'good' vs 'bad' JCs, remember that environment is important, but self-motivation and self-discipline is far more important.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All else equal, going to YJC is perfectly fine (if it offers you the subject combi you want, or if it's close to your home), whether you're 12 pointer, 6 pointer or 18 pointer. It's all perfectly ok (since all that matters is you).</p>

              I am nt sure if YJC is good or nt. But a 12 pointer go YJC, I am quite sure you can excel easily, you would be given a lot of opp to do other non academic things like research attachment and olympid if YJC offers.
              However, I dont really agree with UltimaOnline.. (ps moderator =x) on the point tt environment is nt as impt as urself. In my opinion, peer pressure is very strong a force. a lot of things you have been thinking and doing consciously, sub-con were results of peer pressure.
              no offences to any1. thr is a risk of excelling among those 18 and 19 pointers, it may giv u a delusion tt u are good. My sec 1 and 2 were spent in a nt so good sch, I excelled. then I transfered to another much btr sch, but is only above avgr thr. and my new classmates spured me on as they were all very hard working. thr4, environment matters a lot lot. (of cos this is on the assumption tt u are a hardworking person. if u are nt, then it doesnt matter if u are in gd or bad sch, u wont excel at all)
              
              I agree with UltimaOnline tt distance matters. in JC everyday life end ard 5 or 6. and u nd night time to do homework and revise. so pls for ur own sake choose a sch tt's near you.
              what combi r u looking for?? YJC may be e only 1 tt allow you to choose freely, but tt doesnt mean other jc dont offer ur combi. so do check w other JCs.
              
              so for now, seek as much opinion as possible, from teachers, seniors, pm moderator. then weight all the pros and cons b4 decide. 
              
              pardon me for my poor eng. =P

              <p>YJC is a fixed 20 pointer - It will never change. It do little justice to the JC itself though, not to mention that my alma mater is often known as the spoon-feed JC. </p>
              <p>As for pushing, yes, the teachers do push the students. In fact, you will often find the top JCs to be the ones who do not pushes their students and require them to be highly independent. YJC teachers are often known as some of the nicest and most diligent around, and you will often hear stories of teachers staying till 9pm+ for their students' sake.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, there is a forummer around with "O"-level 20 points and ABB from YJC, can't remember who it was.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone:)</p>
              <p>Thank you all for the advice. it was very useful. I have decided in the end to go to serangoon jc, as it is very near to my house, while YJC takes at least 30 to 45 mins to reach. I looked through the subject combinations and didnt really need the flexible combination. Thanks alot for the advice. It really helped:)</p>
