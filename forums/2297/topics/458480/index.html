              <p><strong>Banding for secondary schools and academic awards to be removed: MOE</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Education (MOE) has announced that it will 
              be doing away with both the school banding system as well as the giving 
              out of school awards based on sustained academic achievements. These 
              moves were announced at the MOE workplan seminar yesterday by Minister 
              for Education Heng Swee Keat and aim to shift the emphasis of schooling 
              away from academic results.<br><br> The banding concept, first 
              introduced in 2004, saw secondary schools being grouped with other 
              schools which achieved similar 'O' levels scores into nine broad bands. 
              This concept replaced the earlier model of school rankings, which had 
              been criticised for encouraging a single-minded focus on academic 
              achievements.<br><br> Mr Heng said that banding of schools will be 
              removed as "there is no single yardstick of to measure how 'good' our 
              schools are".<br><br> He added that awards such as the School 
              Excellence Award and Sustained Achievement Award, as well as the 
              Academic Value-added awards, will be removed from 2014. These awards, 
              which have been in place since 1998 to recognise schools for their 
              academic and non-academic achievements, will be replaced by internal 
              monitoring instead. <br><br> In order to continue to identify 
              schools for their strengths, MOE will still recognise schools according 
              to five broad categories: Best Practice in Teaching and Learning, Best 
              Practice in Student All-Rounded Development, Best Practice in Staff 
              Development and Well Being and two new categories of Best Practice in 
              Character and Citizenship Education and Best Practice in Partnership.<br><br> In line with MOE's call to involve parents in their child's 
              education, Mr Heng also launched a new Parents in Education website 
              yesterday - containing information ranging from parenting tips to 
              education initiatives. More resources will also be provided to schools 
              such as best practices on engaging parents and the community, he said.<br><br> Mr Heng, who is leading Singapore's ongoing national conversation,
               added that MOE will be holding dialogues with educators, parents and 
              students to envision the future of the Singapore's education system.</p>
