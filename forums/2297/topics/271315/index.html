            <div class='col-md body'>It had been several days since the boy's parents had passed away. Still, he could not forget the scene where his mansion was depleted by the raging fire.<br>The bleary scene that his parents were trapped in the midst of the fire still remains deep within his mind. Along with the loud and clear cries of his mother.<br>Edward had just finish celebrating his 10th birthday not long ago. And such a lamentable misfortune had fell upon him.<br>He was helpless, and was without any relatives within the country. The only person that he had could trust was his butler that had served his family for ten years.<br>Even at the age of ten, he clearly knew that his chance of tasting happiness in his future days were bleak.<br><br>He had been travelling aimlessly with his butler for days already. Switching from train rides to train rides. Oblivious of where he is heading to.<br>And before he even noticed, he arrrived infront of a tenebrous and suspicious gate, side by side with his butler.<br>Crows were singing in a raucous manner as if it was a formal welcome to them. Cold wind blew and a baleful feeling chilled down his spine.<br>Only during then, sadness was scuffed off his mind. And fear bestowed upon him.<br><br>He swallowed his saliva hard and questioned his butler in fearful manner "May I know why are we here?"<br>For each and every word he spoke, his lips trembled.<br>His butler did not answer, instead he turn and looked at him, with a insensate and cunning smile.<br>At then, Edward got the shocked out of his life. He had never witness that kind of expression from his butler before.<br>He knew something was amiss. And took a few steps back, still staring into the eyes of his butler.<br>He did not know what to do exactly within the few seconds.<br>But there was one thing he was certain of. If he fails to escape now, his life would just be concluded in a tragical manner, just like his parents.<br>He dropped the luggage that weight a ton on his right hand and ran for his life.<br>Still he was only 10 at that time. Hardly even 4 feet in height.<br>After running for not more then 30metres, he was knocked out from the back.<br><br>While Edward was un-concious. He dreamt of the paradisaic times he had with his parents.<br>His parents were both sitting close to him him, with his birthday cake right infront of him. And the huge pile of presents that were almost blocking the doorway.<br>Even if it was a dreamt. Edward could feel the warmth that his parents gave him.<br>During then, things could not get any better. How he wished that time could be travelled back to then.<br><br>Still he could not avoid reality, his dreams soon shattered like a kaleidoscope.<br>He woke up in a cold sweat. Panting in a agressive manner, unable to clam down.<br>He turned his head around, looking at the surrondings. It was all dark and cold.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br>Ish how to continue?</div>
