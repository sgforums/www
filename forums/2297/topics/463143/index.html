              <p>Self-study would be very difficult. I think you need to do ten year series for these subjects. For mathematics, you still need a tutor. English, science, maths and poa you can do 10 year series. There are a lot of things to cover during o level. I still think you need a teacher.</p>
              <p>Study every day, including holiday. IF possible from 7am to 10pm. With some rest of 8-15 mins for 1 hour study.</p>

              <p><br>2-3h a day is definitely not enough. Do consider the fact that even the best students in Singapore are taking lessons in school for around 7h a day and they also spend a few hours doing homework at night. 2-3h a day spent with a tuition teacher is probably not enough, let alone 2-3h of self study.</p>
              <p>Go sign up with a good private school that can prepare you well for the O levels. Otherwise, hire some tutors to help you in the subjects. The jump from N level to O level is huge. It's not easy to do it alone.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>The road will be very tough, considering you have dropped out of 4NA, but it's not impossible. :). You'll have to dedicate around 8 hours a day of revising at home and you gradually build up the hours (say, 10hrs 2 months prior to the o's). But it is much better if you go to a private school because you'll need some tips and notes to take on some trickier questions and if you solely rely on yourself, you might not be exposed to the curriculum fully, hence, I strongly disagree to self-studying. For science and math, the best advice is to keep doing the TYS because they always repeat exact questions (This year's Bio paper had more than 5 repeated MCQ questions). For Math, repeatedly doing the TYS is a good way to ensure at least an A2, you'll need to be extra careful to get an A1. I don't think it is very possible to get an A1 for Combined Humanities without a teacher's help as when the teacher marks your essay, he/she'll will be able to point out where you are lacking and if you self-study, you'll have no chance of identifying where the loopholes are in your learning. All in all, I believe it's best you still go to school, a private one at least.</div>

              <p>If you are already in NA, it means you are already quite weak compare to the express students. The chances is very low that you can make it through self study. At least that is what I see from the students that I am tutoring in Maths.</p>
              <p>With so many subjects, it is better for your to go for a private school. Solely private tuition may not be the best option, and self study is definitely out.</p>
              <p>I took my O Level 20+ years ago. I screw my Sec 3 badly (30+ points for 5 subjects!) so I calculated my chances and focus on 5 subjects, and manage to get to the top 3 JC. If you are desperate, you need to calculate your chances instead of taking all 7-8 subjects.</p>

              <p>If you want to take a big risk and be entrepreneurial, be an apprentice to someone, eg. hairstyling, baking, cooking, car mechanic, cleaning company, IT company, internet marketing  stuff. Then work your way up and open a company. That way, no need to read so many O level books.</p>
              <p>Or, read some financial wealth books and work in a company as a junior position overseas, then open your company.</p>
              <p>It is a very big risk, but worth taking. You either make it, struggle or become very rich. Talk with more people, your uncles, aunties, parents, older friends and also see what is your passion.</p>
              <p>I had a student in N(A) who liked aquariums and fishes. Imagine if he works in a fish shop, gain some experience, then open a fish shop?</p>
              <p>Just suggesting an alternative. Or join some less well known private school diplomas, if possible.</p>

              <p>Just my 2 cents, it's gonna to be a <strong>very demoralising and demanding lifestyle</strong> for you if you choose to self-study alone.
