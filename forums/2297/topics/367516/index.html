              <p>Hi ! Here is a Rosynth School's P6 problem sum that is to be solved using non-algebra method.</p>
              <p>Ning and Zhongwei jogged to and fro repeatedly along a straight line in a park between two points A and B. Ning jogged at a uniform speed of 4m/s and Zhongwei jogged at a uniform speed of 6 m/s. They started jogging from opposite directions at the same time as shown below.</p>
              <p>Ning @ 4m/s ----&gt;                                                  &lt;----------Zhongwei @6m/s              </p>
              <p>                              X                                      Y</p>
              <p>A ----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------B</p>
              <p>They first met one another at point X. The second time they met was at point Y.</p>
              <p>a) Given that the distance between X and Y is 160 m . Find the distance between A and B.</p>
              <p>b) If they started jogging at 8 a.m. , how long did they take to meet again for the 3rd time? (Express your answers in minutes and seconds)</p>

              <p> Distance travelled for Ning:Zhongwei = 3:2</p>
              <p>For 1st meeting:</p>
              <p>Ning travelled = AX</p>
              <p>Zhongwei travelled = XY = 160 + BY</p>
              <p>This is illustrated in yellow diagram</p>
              <p>For 2nd meeting</p>
              <p>Ning travelled = XY + BY  = (160+BY) + BY = 160 + BY + BY</p>
              <p>Zhongwei travelled = AX + AY = AX + AX +160</p>
              <p>This is illustrated in the plain diagram.</p>
              <p>LCM = 30 so converted all ratio to create total parts of 30.</p>
              <p>6 parts = 160m</p>
              <p>30 parts = 160m x5 = 800m</p>
              <p>30 parts = double the total distance</p>
              <p>Thus AB = 400m</p>
              <p> Thus we know that</p>

              <p>Actually you are wrong. For 1st meeting, distance travelled is 400m (1)</p>
              <p>For subsequent meeting, it is 800m (2) UNLESS Zhongwei catch up with Ning before Ning can turn around (3).</p>
              <p>The long working is to make sure that case (3) did not occur.</p>
              <p>In maths, it is best not to assume anything and rigorously test your reasoning process.</p>
              <p>In addition, solutions should be explain in an appropriate standard suitable for the audience. Rather long than not understood.</p>
              <p>The 400/800m thingie we can reason out... but a 12 years old kid can?</p>
              <p>Even at O level... plenty of students does not understand p increased by 300% is 4p, not 3p.</p>

              <p>You are not wrong to point out that Mikethm or me is wrong.</p>
              <p>But your attitude and tone is that of someone looking for trouble, not someone who is sincerely trying to help out.</p>
              <p>As an educator, I strongly advocate against the use of Fail ( With the exception being on exam papers, but that is a reason why we uses "F" instead of "fail" ), regardless of on a student or on others. By telling others they fail, it is as good as telling them that they are failures.</p>
              <p>I acknowledge my mistake already, and to begin with, did I say that Mikethm's new workings were wrong? I don't think so. I merely said that I might have found something which is shorter, which turned out to be wrong afterall.</p>
              <p>As for you, by using the word "seow", you are being extremely disrespectful and rude to others, and you do not think of that as a fault yourself. You merely pointed out the mistakes of others, what gives you the right to scold them? If anyone needs to apologize, it will be you for your unruly behaviour here.</p>
              <p>By telling me this : "When one makes a mistake,
                                          acknowledges the mistake and correct the mistakes and give the
                                          correct answer. This should be the spirit of learning.", aren't you saying that I should learn from you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Side Note : Eagle or Wee, "Learning is the way" has already got the correct answers from Mikethm, please close this thread before it becomes a full flaming thread. I apologize for any trouble that I might have caused here.</p>
