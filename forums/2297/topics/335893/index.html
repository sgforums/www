              <p>Hey, I am just a Sec 4 student, like you guys, so pardon me if I make any mistakes. I have returned my paper to the teacher, (she wants it) so if there's any errors from what I can recall, feel free to correct me.</p>
              <p>You can leave this thread if you feel "Aiya, SS is over la, so stfu". I made this out of my own interest, and MAYBE, for the welfare of some, that their answers are similar to someone else's, so it sort of eases them.</p>
              <p>This is from what I had analysed from past year O level papers (I can't even be sure if the discussions in class were accurate), but since those are 2190/01, the LORMS should be SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT from the 2192/01 that we're presently taking. Even the SEQs are the most scrupulous, tricky, mind-boogling questions, so don't be too confident until I get there.</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>Now to the evil SBQs (I simplified them like an O level marking scheme, so use your own discretion):</p>
              <p>a) Compare Similarity + Difference [6]</p>
              <p>Anyone with a right mind would be able to see that this is just a pure comparison question, and since it's 6 marks, TONE and PURPOSE are mostly likely NOT needed, but I'll just play it safe.</p>
              <p>Source A and B are to-the-point sources, no tricks involved.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1-2 - Compare sources based on provenance (similarity /+ difference). Invalid matching.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Both sources are made by ministers of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Source A is made by PM Lee and Source B is made by PM Goh.</p>
              <p>Source A says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans</span> back to SG while Source B does not say so (invalid match).</p>
              <p><strong>L2/3-4 - Compare sources based on content (similarity / difference). Valid matching.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Both sources say that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans overseas</span> (you are wrong if you only put Singaporeans. Credits to xgamesterz) prefer working overseas.</p>
              <p>Source A says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans overseas</span> back to SG while Source B says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreigners</span> to SG (valid match).</p>
              <p><strong>L3/5 - Both factors of L2 (similarity + difference).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L4/6 - Compare sources based on tone.</strong></p>
              <p>Source A is optimistic on attracting SGeans back to SG while Source B is pessimistic on attracting SGeans back to SG and even propose that we attract foreigners.</p>
              <p>This is just a "play-safe" scheme. I stopped at L3 in my answers, because I feel that this is the highest level.</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>b) Reliability [6]</p>
              <p>Same as above, most likely no RE, TONE or PURPOSE.</p>
              <p>BEWARE! Source C is the trick source for this year, unlike last years it was on Source E. Any mistakes here will cost you a terrible price.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1 - Describe source.</strong></p>
              <p>Source C is a source made by India.</p>
              <p>Source C appeared in a newspaper report.</p>
              <p><strong>L2/2-3 - Prove, with supporting details (Content, X-reference, OBJECTIVE tone, RE).<br></strong></p>
              <p>Source C proves because it is supported by Source B.</p>
              <p>Source C proves because it has an objective tone.</p>
              <p>This is the most you WILL go if you ever write "Source C PROVES" because it is a misinterpretation. Even if you wrote "Source C DOES NOT PROVE" later on or earlier on, you WILL still stop here. It is still a MISINTERPRETATION of the source.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/4-5 - Does not prove, with supporting content.</strong></p>
              <p>Source C does not prove because it is just an assumption.</p>
              <p>Source C does not prove because India has not succeeded.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/6 - Does not prove, with supporting X-reference to test the conclusion of "Does not prove"</strong>.</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>c) Purpose</p>
              <p>Do I have to say more?</p>
              <p>Problem - Students in SG feels that government does not care for them</p>
              <p>Audience - Students in SG (You are wrong if you wrote <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporean students</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">local students</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">international students</span>).</p>
              <p>Message - Government does care for students in SG</p>
              <p>Outcome - Students in SG stop complaining about foreign talent policy and realise that the government believes that they will succeed and cares for their welfare.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1 - Describe source.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L2/2-3 - Describe and explain source. Wrong message/outcome.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>L3/4-5 - Correct message + outcome. Wrong audience.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L4/6 - Correct message + outcome + audience.</strong></p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>d) Usefulness</p>
              <p>This is by far the easiest one to score full marks.</p>
              <p>Source E, unexpectedly, is the most straightforward source.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1-2 - Describe source with supporting content or provenance. No assertion (Useful/Not useful)</strong></p>
              <p>Source E comes from Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Source E comes from a workers' rights association.</p>
              <p><strong>L2/3 - Useful based on content.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is useful as it is from Hong Kong, hence gives me a viewpoint of an organisation.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/4-5 - Useful or Not Useful based on X-reference.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is useful as it is supported by Source D.</p>
              <p>Source E is not useful as it is challenged by Source D.</p>
              <p>This happens because there are two antagonistic source details available for use.</p>
              <p><strong>L4/6 - Both aspects of L3.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L5/7 - Not useful based on proganda purpose.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is not useful as it is from a workers' rights organisation and thus will fiercely defend the rights of SGeans workers.</p>
              <p>If you fail this because of NO ASSERTION, then you deserved it.</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>SEQ:</p>
              <p>2a) How far is the <strong>control of traffic flow in S'pore</strong> achieved by
                                          the Park &amp; Ride Scheme? Explain your answer.</p>
              <p>You must answer to this point. Start by talking about Park &amp; Ride.</p>
              <p>2b) Here are three <strong>guiding principles of governance</strong>:</p>
              <p>'Leadership is
                                          Key'<br>'Anticipate
                                          Change &amp; Stay Relevant'<br> 'Reward
                                          for work and work for reward'<br> <br> Is any one of these <strong>more important</strong> than the others? Explain your
                                          answer.</p>
              <p>Basically just talking about these points, with details (memorised beforehand) and explanation. You must answer to good governance (consistent management, sound policies, wise decisions, prosperity, etc.)</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>4a) Just link to worsening relationship. Take note you CANNOT link to conflict or war or anything else, only the straining of ties.</p>
              <p>4b) Just talk about the impacts of the various factors and discuss which is most significant. Beware of how you define SIGNIFICENCE. I discussed on the scale of affected areas, such as affecting Iraq only rather than affecting the entire world.</p>

              <p>Now to the evil SBQs (I simplified them like an O level marking
                  scheme, so use your own discretion):</p>
              <p>a) Compare Similarity + Difference [6]</p>
              <p>Anyone with a right mind would be able to see that this is just
                  a pure comparison question, and since it's 6 marks, TONE and
                  PURPOSE are mostly likely NOT needed, but I'll just play it
                  safe.</p>
              <p>Source A and B are to-the-point sources, no tricks involved.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1-2 - Compare sources based on provenance (similarity
                  /+ difference). Invalid matching.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Both sources are made by ministers of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Source A is made by PM Lee and Source B is made by PM Goh.</p>
              <p>Source A says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans</span> back to SG while
                  Source B does not say so (invalid match).</p>
              <p><strong>L2/3-4 - Compare sources based on content (similarity /
                  difference). Valid matching.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Both sources say that Singaporeans prefer working overseas.</p>
              <p>Source A says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans</span> back to SG while
                  Source B says that we should attract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreigners</span> to SG (valid
                  match).</p>
              <p><strong>L3/5 - Both factors of L2 (similarity +
                  difference).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L4/6 - Compare sources based on tone.</strong></p>
              <p>Source A is optimistic on attracting SGeans back to SG while
                  Source B is pessimistic on attracting SGeans back to SG and even
                  propose that we attract foreigners.</p>
              <p>This is just a "play-safe" scheme. I stopped at L3 in my
                  answers, because I feel that this is the highest level.</p>
              <p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
              <p>b) Reliability [6]</p>
              <p>Same as above, most likely no RE, TONE or PURPOSE.</p>
              <p>BEWARE! Source C is the trick source for this year, unlike last
                  years it was on Source E. Any mistakes here will cost you a
                  terrible price.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1 - Describe source.</strong></p>
              <p>Source C is a source made by India.</p>
              <p>Source C appeared in a newspaper report.</p>
              <p><strong>L2/2-3 - Prove, with supporting details (Content,
                  X-reference, OBJECTIVE tone, RE).<br></strong></p>
              <p>Source C proves because it is supported by Source B.</p>
              <p>Source C proves because it has an objective tone.</p>
              <p>This is the most you WILL go if you ever write "Source C PROVES"
                  because it is a misinterpretation. Even if you wrote "Source C DOES
                  NOT PROVE" later on or earlier on, you WILL still stop here. It is
                  still a MISINTERPRETATION of the source.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/4-5 - Does not prove, with supporting
                  content.</strong></p>
              <p>Source C does not prove because it is just an assumption.</p>
              <p>Source C does not prove because India has not succeeded.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/6 - Does not prove, with supporting X-reference to
                  test the conclusion of "Does not prove"</strong>.</p>

              <p>I doubt highly that that similarity is 'singaporeans prefer working overseas.' It is only a minority of Singaporeans that work overseas, and furthermore, only some would prefer to stay there (Source A mentioned that some would come back). Thus i feel that the correct common factor for similarity is: Both sources agree that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are singaporeans venturing overseas.</span></p>
              <p>Difference: Both sources disagree on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the way to solve the problem of 'brain drain</span>' ie. A says to find means to keep overseas Singaporeans who come back to stay, while B says to find ways to attract foreign talent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: it is important always to have a common factor (underlined), so that there isn't the risk of false-matching or error in comparison</p>
              <p> Also one can jump directly into content comparison (neglect L1 and L2 like provenance) and still get the marks for L3/4. I didnt do level 5 though, cos tone would take like 2-3 more mins, but only get you 1 mark, so the time spent would be more wisely used on other questions, esp. essays</p>

              <p><br>SEQ question<br><br>2a) How far is the control of traffic flow in S'pore achieved by the Park &amp; Ride Scheme? Explain your answer.<br><br>b) Here are three guiding principles of governance: 'Leadership is Key'<br>                                                                       'Anticipate Change &amp; Stay Relevant'<br>                                                                       'Reward for work and work for reward'<br><br>Is any one of these more important than the others? Explain your answer.<br><br>2a) I say COE/VQS most important as it controls overall vehicle population but also say that ERP and Park&amp;Ride is important in managing traffic flow as they also discourage people from using certain roads.<br><br>2b) I say all are equally important coz if one aspect is lacking, the governance would not be good anymore, eg, if they can anticipate change but have bad leadership (corrupt) country will not prosper.<br><br>Thanks in advance!</p>
