              <p>d) Usefulness</p>
              <p>This is by far the easiest one to score full marks.</p>
              <p>Source E, unexpectedly, is the most straightforward source.</p>
              <p><strong>L1/1-2 - Describe source with supporting content or
                                      provenance. No assertion (Useful/Not useful)</strong></p>
              <p>Source E comes from Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Source E comes from a workers' rights association.</p>
              <p><strong>L2/3 - Useful based on content.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is useful as it is from Hong Kong, hence gives me a
                                      viewpoint of an organisation.</p>
              <p><strong>L3/4-5 - Useful or Not Useful based on
                                      X-reference.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is useful as it is supported by Source D.</p>
              <p>Source E is not useful as it is challenged by Source D.</p>
              <p>This happens because there are two antagonistic source details
                                      available for use.</p>
              <p><strong>L4/6 - Both aspects of L3.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>L5/7 - Not useful based on proganda
                                      purpose.</strong></p>
              <p>Source E is not useful as it is from a workers' rights
                                      organisation and thus will fiercely defend the rights of SGeans
                                      workers.</p>
              <p>If you fail this because of NO ASSERTION, then you deserved
