              <p><br>And to disagree with you, but in some way local poly qualification is better than an distance learning degree although it take long time to complete, the reason is simple based on what I heard from a human resource company : Local Poly student (expect part-time) usually have an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">industrial attachment programme</span> at their final term and the company the student work with are those "big" brothers company like IBM, HP and other government statutory related company etc. This give them an edge in working experience when the student prepared their resume.</p>
              <p>Also if the HR company want to get "cheaper" and efficient employee, they tend to prefer poly student with industrial attachment background while an distance-learning degree is considered to be an "overhead" which give them an excuse that the job interviewer might not agree to "peanut" pay offered by the employer.</p>
              <p>Finally one advantage of public schools is that it is cheapest to study there as there are many finanical aids like scholarships,subsidy and bursary from MOE or WDA for working adult. For private school institution it is either your company sponsor you through "Skills Development Fund" (SDF) to enroll or you borrow from bank to study in their school.</p>
              <p>Do take notice that private school 's main goal is to earn an profit and there still an danger that it might suddenly closed down without warning which happen before. And trust me, most of the private school offering their private diploma course that I attend, it is the foreign students ratio more than the local students if you know what I mean if majority local will choose poly or private diploma.</p>
              <p>Still if TS want to have an faster route to study up to graduate level like Master or P.hD by all means private schools is still better.</p>
