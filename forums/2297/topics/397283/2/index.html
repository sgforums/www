It was then when the beacon of Lim Chin Siong shined brighter than Lee Kuan Yew’s. James Puthucheary, who was in charge of PAP publicity for the elections recalled the first rally held in a remote Chinese village.<br><br></span></span></div>

              </span></p><pre>In an interview, Tan Kong Wee told me that he and other Babas realised
              their "Chineseness" during the Japanese Occupation: 
              
              "The Japanese did not discriminate between the Peranakan and the
              China-Chinese. <strong>I remember my fellow Peranakans were shocked because they
              suddenly realised that there was one thing missing. They did not know their
              roots. </strong>
              
              <strong>"They could not speak Chinese.</strong> They said: 'The Japanese called me a
              Chinese. <strong>But all along, I would say I'm not a Chinese. </strong>I was 11 years
              old... it dawned upon me that I am a Chinese. For this, I have to thank the
              Japanese.' " </pre>
              <pre><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; white-space: normal; font-size: medium;"><pre>Although Tan's realisation may not have been shared by many Babas (the
              Japanese, in fact, distinguished between the Straits Chinese and the
              China-born Chinese, at least for the collection of the $50 million "gift"
              extorted by the Japanese), <strong>it is a fact that the Chinese-speaking Chinese
              were becoming more influential and insulted the Babas mainly because of
              their inability to speak "Chinese".</strong></pre>
              <pre>Consequently, many Babas made an effort
              to learn "Chinese".<strong> Whereas many English-educated Babas re-emphasised their
              allegiance to the British Empire and were afraid that full independence
              might harm their still privileged position</strong>, the vast majority of
              Chinese-educated Chinese were vehemently anti-colonial and
              anti-imperialist. </pre>
              <pre><br></pre>
              <pre><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; white-space: normal; font-size: medium;"><pre>Despite some signs of "resinicisation", <strong>many Babas tended to reciprocate
              the insults and teasing of the non-Baba Chinese by calling them "country
              bumpkins" and low-class guests. </strong>
              
              With the increased ambiguity of the status of the Babas, many of them
              neither dared to admit they were Babas nor spoke Baba Malay in public. The
              days of Baba Malay as an inter-group language of commercial value were also
              gone, and Baba Malay stagnated and became confined to the domestic domain. </pre>
