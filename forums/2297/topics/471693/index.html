              <p>I was often a perpetual procrastinator and I am very inconsistent in my revision. I always study for my exam/test the day before the actual exam where I cram for 4-5 hours trying to absorb every little piece of information and I was always troubled by the lapses of memory. These are my mid year exam grades and with these kind of grades, I don't think I am elligible for Direct-school admission where I really wanted to get into a junior college.</p>
              <p>English =C6 :( [ My essays are mediocre and I usually go for argumentative essays, my grammer editing always get like 6 or 5 upon 10, my comprehension was bad too and only listening I could score. Well everyone can score for LC....]</p>
              <p> Chinese = E8 [ I am actually a foreigner and this subject is way tooo hard for me.. I struggle a lot in memorising good chinese phrases and this subject really bugs me so much.. Next week is my olevel chinese oral and I am gona screwed it so bad ] [ Oh yeah, the chinese o level paper 1,2 is extremely tedious :'( ] <span style="color: #ff0000;">I was wondering if I can take basic chinese and still can go junior college?</span></p>
              <p> A Math = B3 [ I improved tremedously as last year i keep getting F9.. I started to do the 10 year series and thats how I earned it]</p>
              <p>E math = B4 [ Since I focus so much on A math, my grades for E math is falling apart]</p>
              <p>Pure Bio= D7 [ Last minute revision ain't gona help and I truly regretted it . I knew I have so much potential in this subject as last year I got an A2 for it]</p>

              <p>DNT (theory)= B4 [ last minute study too and I kind of want to give up  O level DNT coursework.... I am way behind time]</p>
              <p>In conclusion, I took 8 subjects and my school love to set extremely hard papers, thrice harder than O level papers. I was planning to throw away chinese and dnt and just focused on doing well for my other 6 subjects. Please give me tips on how to excel in these six subjects. :)</p>

              <p>DNT is a very very easy subject. You might want to give up on humanities, not everyone is talented in humanities subjects, some are talented in science and math. Because for DNT, you can memorise and cram the day before and still can a distinction for theory, not like SS where you need to pick up a skill and memorise.</p>
              <p>As for chinese, I wouldn't opposed that you drop it. But the problem here is that you are bad in English, you are nowhere near a distinction. Improve your goddam english or you wouldn't be able to get anywhere in JC or even Poly. </p>

              <p>I in the last 3.5 months rushed the coursework portfolio and artefact. <br>For artefact, I used all 3 materials: wood, metal, plastic. <br><br>Theory paper also just describe the processes and draw step-by-step diagrams like playing a movie frame by frame.</p>

              <p>I know that for math our teacher always give tys and practice. must practice and really do the sums to learn. Your math b3 and b4 can push up to A1/A2 with practice. I was b3 before also</p>
              <p>For English I went for this crashcourse . super fun! and the trainer teach us all the ways to score A for english :DD srsly learnt more in the course than 4 years in sec sch </p>
              <p>for chinese, just practice talking with your friends should be able to improve. </p>
              <p>for pure bio must concentrate on the concepts and then memorize. cannot just memorise. </p>
              <p>for humanities must answer the question. i used to get b4 b3 last exam cuz didn't answer the question. Cannot just put down what you know. you must answer what the question ask. After understanding this, my humans have no prob </p>
