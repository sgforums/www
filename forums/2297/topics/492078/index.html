            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you should try taking private O levels, coz if you don't, someday in the future, you'll regret not even trying. Although it might be more realistic for you to take combined science instead of pure science, as the bell-curve to get A grade for pure science is a lot tougher than for combined science.<p>If you can afford it, get private 1-to-1 tuition *in addition* to (not in replacement of) enrolling in a private school (that has laboratory lab facilities for your science practical). Because you never studied N level science before (let alone O level science), you're gonna need all the help you can afford.</p><p> Unlike A levels (which require subject specialization due to much higher difficulty level), it's possible to find O level private tutors who can teach you 2 or even 3 sciences, all at the same time, saving you money. One such private tutor is <a href="http://lmstuition.weebly.com/my-rates-and-available-time.html">Mr Jeremy Ow (who covers double math + triple science)</a>.</p></div>

              <p>Yes, you can try taking private O levels to save time.</p>
              <p>The private institutes usually conduct crash course in science so I suppose you will need tuition.</p>
              <p>However, jobs in biomedical field are not so easy to find. You may work as a lab tech in a life science lab. Medicine is one of the toughest discipline one can ever find on planet earth. I wonder if you are intending to be a nurse or an allied health professsional.</p>
              <p>The biology field usually needs a PhD (at least 9 years in university) to do research. A basic degree or poly diploma in biomedical science offers  job opportunities that come with glass ceilings.</p>
              <p>You really need to work very hard to get an O levels and a biomedical diploma.</p>
              <p>There is MDIS which offers a foundation cert in life science and a diploma in biomedical science.</p>
              <p>I would suggest looking at other options, if possible.</p>

              <p>O level science consists of two disciplines, and you need to take at least five O level subjects to enter a Polytechnic course.</p>
              
              <p>It may be better for you to take N level science, pursue a Bio-Medical certificate at ITE, and use your GPA at ITE to enter a Bio-Medical course at Polytechnic.</p>
              
              <p>Since you have taken some N level subjects before, you only need to take N level science. It is much easier to take N level science than to take O level science and around four other O level subjects.</p>
              
              <p>By the way, why must it be Bio-Medical? Bio-Medical is not the only industry in the world. Besides, the pay of nursing jobs is petite.</p>
