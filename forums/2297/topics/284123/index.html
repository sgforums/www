Thats more like everything. And there are so many qns that are simliar, some even require the same knowledge (PEE) just that Link would be diffferent....<br><br>Back to topic, for elaboration, its about being able to UNDERSTAND in and out the pts and chapter as a whole. Only then would you be able to explain with the flow of thought. With this flow of thought, you wouldnt really need to memorise anything at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>(4)How were the Nazis able to consolidate their power and rule Germany effectively?<br><br>(5)''Hitler was a great leader who led Germany to its status as a global power''To what extent do you agree with this statement?<br><br>4) First of all, Hitler was a very charismatic person, you can see him in his public rally speeches. He always talks with passion and energy. I think that was what attracted people to Hitler.<br><br>They used propaganda and occult idealogies. They made the German people think that they are part of the Aryan race, a race that is the purest and most intelligent.<br><br>The Nazi party burned down the Reichstag (Parliament) and put the blame on the Communist party that was also contesting for power. This allowed Hitler to declare a state of emergency and gain total control.<br><br>Economy wise... Hitler brought Germany out of poverty, he gave people jobs by starting up his war factories and breaking the Treaty of Versailles.<br><br>5)This is how i would write.. Hitler was a great leader whom managed to unite battered Germany which had been shamed after signing the Treaty of Versailles. The poverty stricken country which was near bankruptcy, was saved by Adolf Hitler through the breaking of the treaty of versailles and starting up his war factories, creating his war machines. This gave people jobs and hope.<br><br>But however, we must not overlook the atrocities that he had committed during the time he was in power. He passed the nuremberg laws which deprived German Jews of their rightful citizenship and authorised the numerous extermination and labour camps across Europe such as Aushwitz. Millions of people died through the systematic "Final Solution to the Jewish Question". Gas bunkers and incinerators are purposely built to gas Jews, gyspies and others that were considered unpure or not aryan.</div>
