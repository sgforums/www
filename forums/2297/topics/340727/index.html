              <p><br>Unfortunately, the percentage of neighbourhood secondary school students who go on and "proceed to exel in their studies in JCs and universities" vastly differs from those students who're from non-neighbourhood secondary schools.<br><br>The number of students from top schools failing in JCs is smaller compared to students from neighbourhood secondary schools failing in JCs (or even, not being able to enter a JC).<br><br>Therefore, a good school equates to a better opportunity to excel in the education system.<br><br>Reality is just so harsh.</p>

              <p>If your PSLE score is 260, you might be able to squeeze into RI/RGS/HCI and probably be the lowest score student in these top secondary schools.</p>
              <p>Do you think you have any chance to rise to assume leadership position (eg head prefect, head or president) in any clubs or student organisations so as to learn and practise leadership skills ?</p>
              <p>However, if you are in a neighbourhood secondary school, you will be likely to be the highest score student in the school and every opportunity will be provided for you to develop your full potential.</p>

              If your PSLE score is 260, you might be able to squeeze into RI/RGS/HCI and probably be the lowest score student in these top secondary schools.
              
              Quoted from Lee012lee.
              
              As far I know, 260 is not enough for RI/RGS. Their COP 2008 are 262/263 respectively.Not sure about HCI though and does anyone knows? Anyway, there is a 2nd intake after S1 posting exercise which is also known as appeal for these mentioned schools.
              
              Not sure about  the cut-off ponit for EESIS this year. Even if you are able to squeeze in through appeal but not qualified for EESIS, you have to pay for the high school fees in these independent schools .Their miscellaneous fees, enrichment programmes costs plus others do not come cheap either.
