            <div class='col-md body'>My teacher say can compare with several criteria in the last paragraph.If i rmb correctly...<br><br>State and explain which factor is more long-term/lasting, and which is short-term/temporary.<br><br>Eg in the short term senior citizens are a help as...however in the long term they are a hindrance as the country's resources....<br><br>State which 1 is the root cause,giving way to other factors<br>Eg.Discovery of a new trade route is the most important factor as it leads to new competition of trade rivals..<br><br>State which 1 causes the most damage.<br><br>Eg The 1964 Federal election in Malaya is the most important factor as it had caused the most repercussions,paving the way for seperation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main thing is to have yr criterion of comparison clear.Look at the question. Should the conclusion be based on time scale(Long/short term)?Or root cause leading to other factors?</div>

But the vital thing is that you must justify your choice, by arguing about the greater impact of your factor, while downplaying the impact of the other factors that you have mentioned in your answer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Xephone_xenon</strong>: OO?! that's a total new one. I've never heard that before. about writing 2 points about it. i thought only need to write 1 for given factor and alternative factors? Or that's why i have always been doing.<br><br><strong>77th Cloud</strong>: I'm one of the selected students which my teacher had picked to coach L5. She said that many other better schools are doing L5, so she's picking afew talented one to do it too, to better secure our A1s-Just in case we infer wrongly for our SBQ. But i'm baffled by the various answers i got from various people. Till now, i still have not got an unanimous agreement on what to write for L5 ( aka conclusion ).<br><br>Anyone could better enlighten me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont listen from here if your coached from your teacher. Every teacher asks us to answer in different ways. But most would give you a distinction if you are good enough. However, if you take tips for many different people, strategies from different teachers, you'll end up mixing all of them up and boom!</div>
