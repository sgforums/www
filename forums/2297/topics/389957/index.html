              <p>Hi! I do have questions on stoichiometry too. But before that, may I ask, what's the meaning of "1/12 the mass of a C12 atom"? Is it '1' since 1/12 of 12 is 1? And what is it TS's formula cannot be used to solve the question? <a href="/users/134754">Darkness_hacker99</a>'s method is similar to that used in Secondary syllabus and is the 3:1 ratio compared to a value of 100%? That's why it's 0.75 and 0.25.</p>
              <p>Ok my questions...</p>
              <p>Which of the following contains 1 mole of the stated particles?</p>
              <p>A Electrons in 1g of hydrogen gas</p>
              <p>B Ions in 100g of calcium carbonate</p>
              <p>D Oxygen atoms in 1 mole of oxygen gas ( i know it's obviously wrong but is there any way to prove that it's wrong? i mean, how do i present workings to validate my claim?)</p>
              <p>Answer being A, I chose B. <strong>Why is it that the reference to 'electrons' is accepted?</strong> For option B, am I wrong because CaCO3 is insoluble and thus cannot dissociate into ions? (I think it's this case, hahaha)</p>
              <p>2. Which statement(s) about a 12.0g sample of 12C are correct?</p>
              <p>There is this statement which I marked as 'correct' when in fact it is wrong...</p>
              <p>"The no. of atoms is the same as the number of atoms in 2.0g of 1 H2..." (1 is written as a top subscript)</p>
              <p>I mean the no. of moles of H atoms will be = 2.0 / (1+1)</p>
              <p>                                                                        =1 mol</p>
              <p>So isn't no. of moles = 1 X 6.02 X 10^23, same as that of 12.0g sample of 12C?</p>
              <p>3. Lastly</p>
              <p>How many moles of fluoride ions are there in 20g of aluminium fluoride?</p>
              <p>my workings: no of moles of AlF3 = 20 / (19 X 3 + 27) = 0.238095 mol</p>
              <p>so no. of fluoride ions = 0.238095 X (3/4)</p>
              <p>                                      = 0.179 mol (3 s.f)</p>
              <p>As to why I multiply by 3/4, well aluminium fluoride is made up of the ions</p>
              <p>Al3+ + 3F- .... a total of 4 units. that's how i kind of worked it out, though i'm not sure of the accuracy of this method.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>B is wrong because you only considered moles of the ionic compound, not moles of ions within the compound. You have to consider both cations and anions. Just because CaCO3 is insoluble in water does not mean cations and anions are not present. Just because you can't separate your hands from your body does not mean they are not present and that you needn't count them.</p>

              <p>Thanks <a href="/users/124947">UltimaOnline</a> for the clear explanations :)</p>
              <p>I've 2 questions which I'm unsure of. So, if there's anyone who can solve them, feel free to help me out.</p>
              <p>1. When 1.01g sample of potassium nitrate is heated above its m.p, oxygen gas is evolved. The mass of the sample decreases by 0.16g, suggest the identity for the residue and hence construct a balanced equation for this decomposition reaction.</p>
              <p>[K = 39.1; N = 14.0; O = 16.0]</p>
              <p>I'd guess the identity of residue to be potassium nitride but I don't know how I get prove this with workings. (this hasn't been taught yet but I just wanna try out the question and see the steps involved in solving it)</p>
              <p>2. Sulfur and chlorine can react together to fom S2Cl2. When 1.00g of this sulfur chloride reacted with water, 0.36g of a yellow ppt of sulfur was formed together with a solution containing a mixture of sulfurous acid, H2SO3, and HCl acid. Use the above data to deduce the equation for the reaction between S2Cl2 and water. [ S =32.1; Cl = 35.5]</p>
