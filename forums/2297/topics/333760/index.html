              <p>The question requires that find all the angles between 0deg and 360 deg.</p>
              <p>So, when your answer x = -24.20 ie a negative angle needs to be converted into a positive angle ie 360 degrees - 24.2 degrees = 335.8 degrees, you get the other answer. Your answer is actually correct, you just need to do the conversion.</p>

              <p>Hi <a href="http://schoolwork.sgforums.com/users/210425">bonkysleuth</a>,</p>
              <p>The conversion of negative angle to positive angle has nothing to do with ASTC or second round ie between 360 degrees and 720 degrees.</p>
              <p>The question requires us to find all the angles between 0 degree and 360 degrees.</p>
              <p>Since one of the answer is - 24.2 degrees, a negative angle, there is the need to convert it into a positive angle 360 - 24.2 = 335.8 degrees and the angle 335.8 degrees is between 0 degree and 360 degrees. So, the other answer is 335.8 degrees.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>ahm97sic</p>
              <p>PS : <a href="http://schoolwork.sgforums.com/users/210425">bonkysleuth</a>, it seemed that you have not practised trigonometry questions on negative angles. There are questions that asked students to find all the angles between - 180 degrees and 180 degrees. Please refer to Shing Lee Add Maths Textbook Page 173 Exercise 6D Question 6(a) to 6(f) for more practices.</p>

              <p>OK you run a modelling agency and your client tell you "I want models between 170cm and 180cm to model my 10cm high heel shoes."</p>
              <p>You then put a model on the 10cm shoes and measured her... ok 174cm. Satisfied the requirement of 170 to 180cm tio bo?</p>
              <p>Then your client kpkb at you... because the range of height WITHOUT shoes is 170 to 180. The range of height WITH shoes is ACTUALLY 180 to 190cm.</p>
              <p>You got  sqrt. 5 sin(x +63.434) = sqrt. 2.</p>

              <p>No I am not wrong.</p>
              <p> sin x + 2 cos x = sq.rt 2</p>
              <p>sin x + 2 cos x = sqrt. 5 sin(x +63.434)</p>
              <p>sqrt. 5 sin(x +63.434)  = sq.rt 2</p>
              <p> sin(x +63.434) = sq.rt (2/5)</p>
              <p>Basic angle = sin-1 [sq.rt (2/5)]</p>
              <p>                      = 39.232</p>
              <p>Solution is in 1st or 2nd quadrant since sin is +ve</p>
              <p> Since 63.434 &lt; x + 63.434 &lt;423.4</p>
              <p>We will reject  the 1st solution of 39.232 (not in range), accept 140.768 and the 3rd solution of (360+39.232 aka 399.232)</p>
              <p>Thus (x+63.434) = 140.768 or 399.232</p>
              <p>x = 77. 334 or 335.798</p>
              <p>x= 77.3 or 335.8</p>
              <p>In addition, we do NOT ever check solutions by using equations we form (mistakes might already have been made along the way). Always use the original equation which is  sin x + 2 cos x = sq.rt 2.</p>
              <p>I have a &gt;90% distinction rate with students who have been tutored by me for more than a year before their O levels. A 100% B3 or better for those tutored for &gt;0.5 years. This is based on a brain dead list of standard approaches for 30 questions which will definitely cover 80% of the allocated marks... and the R formula is one of them (prior to 2002 and happily again from this year on). Those longer than a year manage distinctions because if we have time, then I encourage them to think why why why which better their chance of answering the thinking questions (20%)...</p>
              <p>By the way, practically all my students failed their A Maths before I tutor them. I like to tutor students who failed because it is fun and challenging.</p>
              <p>Oh did I mention no one ever failed on me in more than a decade of tutoring despite me being stubborn and not ever giving up on any student at all (except those who want to turn up less than once a week).</p>

              <p>I agree that brain dead training is useful for desperate situtations, but if you have &gt;0.5 years with them, that shouldn't be the way. This method might kill them in A levels if they go JC, or if it doesn't kill them at A levels, it will kill them at O levels. Many a times, I have seen students who struggled at A levels because their foundation at O levels wasn't well set; O levels is just too easy to score (for maths and physics).

              <p>Well you gotta understand why I said what I said then. Those R formula questions are so "dead" that it is insulting to imply that anyone can get them wrong.</p>
              <p>And even if I have &lt;0.5 years with them, I will not resort to brain dead training solely. I always explain the concepts (hastily) even if we are damned desperate.</p>
              <p>Tuition is a game to me. The game of trying to get 100% distinctions for a year. Which I had failed to so far... best record was 10 distinctions outta 11... sob sob. Thus I will never resort to 100% brain dead training. Anyone who is brain dead will NEVER get a distinction. Which is why I always tell my students... any distinction you get will be because of you and not because of me.</p>
              <p>However, if you think throughout the entire 2.5hrs exams... you are looking for trouble as well as you will be mentally exhausted near the end.  Which is why I insist on don't think if you don't need to, think only when necessary.</p>
