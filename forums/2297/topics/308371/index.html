              <p>Not anyone that I know of. But I do know that many MI students aren't as hardworking as their peers in JC perhaps because they thought that since MI is a 3-year A-level route which is one more additional year as compared to JC's 2 years, they can afford to slack. if you were to go to MI, you would really have to be very hardworking and disciplined. I know of someone who graduated from MI who scored straight Bs for his subjects and was offered places by SMU Econs and NTU Econs. So, nothing is impossible as long as you put in sheer hard work and consistency in your studies.</p>
