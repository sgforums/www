              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I'm posting this on behalf of my aunt's friend's son who is currently in primary one and the he has come up with a problem sum that he cannot solve at all. In desperation, my aunt asked me to try to help himwith one problem sum that even an O Level graduate like me couldn't solve it without using algebra. Is there anyone willing to help this boy? Thanks in advance.</p>
              <p>Here goes the question:</p>
              <p>Kim, Mei and Yanti collect stamps. Kim and Mei have 220 stamps more than Yanti. Yanti and Mei have 140 stamps more than Kim. Kim and Yanti have 500 stamps. How many stamps does Mei have?</p>
              <p>My answer is 180, using System of Linear Equations</p>

              Silly Singapore PSLE Math that force you not to use algebra. Whatever works most efficiently is by definition the best method. This is why I teach A levels, not PSLE. So, while I can't help you out with a non-algebra method, this confirms your final answer is correct.
              <p>
              
              K + M = 220 + Y</p><p>
              Y + M = 140 + K</p><p>
              K + Y = 500</p><p>
              Sub K = (500 - Y) into 1st eqn, we get : 2Y - M = 280, hence M = 2Y - 280</p><p>
              Sub K = (500 - Y) and M = (2Y - 280) into 2nd eqn, we get : Y + (2Y - 280) = 140 + (500 - Y), hence 4Y = 920, ie. Y = 230</p><p>Concordantly, K = 270, and M = 180.

              <p>Actually I find that this question is more like A Levels where one is expected to solve 3-variable simultaneous equations (not taught in secondary school). And I agree with you in terms of not putting such extreme stress at such an age becuase of the reason you pointed out plus it causes one to lose interest in studying at such a young age.</p>

              <p>100% sure. Despite the fact that it is a primary 1 sum, I couldn't even draw an appropriate model to represent this question... so I had no choice but to use algebraic methods. Plus this boy mentioned at the top of this topic is a Primary 1 kid now.</p>

              By the way,
              
              Model is primary 2 work.
              
              Multiplication is primary 3 work.
              
              Fraction is primary 4/5 work.
              
              Ratio is primary 5 work.
              
              Algebra is primary 6 work.
              
              Primary 1 is only addition and subtraction, and shape recognition... 
              
              (ah. those days when Maths was so easy...)
              
              The objective of lower primary is not really about the academic, but about the character development, learning life skills, make friends, have fun, and so on.
              
              Let your child have a childhood first, then talk about the exam results, when he is in primary 3/4.
