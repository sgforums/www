              <p>However, I really wanted to know from the current or postgraduates about this...regarding the prospects and also the stress level too... (Many said that jc is more stressful)...</p>
              <p>and lastly, does anyone from the SP  dmb?</p>
              <p>I would like to know about it.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>First of all I think you need to consider <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is your interest?</span></strong><br><br>If you specifically know that you like accountancy or business, you may consider business courses in Poly directly.<br><br>However, if you are unsure what you want to do, you may want to consider JC which offers a broad spectrum of education..<br><br>I don't agree JC is more stressful vice-versa. Stress is given by yourself. If your ultimate goal is to enroll into local university, you will have to work equally hard regardless in JC or Poly.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Jeffrey</p>

              <p>Both equally stressful.</p>
              <p>JC have to learn the concepts and apply them during A level, a consistent effort is needed to master the concepts.</p>
              <p>Poly have tests every now and then, these test consist of practical tests, quiz, group work, final exams, etc. You have to attend all these 'tests' and do all these 'quiz' and 'group works', as they will be counted towards your final GPA. You have to put in consistant effort to ensure you score the highest possible mark for these assesments so you don't short change yourself due to laziness.</p>
              <p>GPA is grade point average, the average of all the subjects(called modules) you took from year 1 to year 3. <br>So if your year 1 GPA is 3.0/4.0, you need to get very good results in year 2 and 3 consistantly to pull it up to maybe 3.5<br>If your year 1 GPA is 4, and you slack for one semester(half a year), your GPA can drop to 3.5 suddenly</p>
              <p>Can go to poly open house and ask the students the course people there about that course</p>

              <p>Dear Skylarskies,</p>
              <p>This is my own take of the of the issues from the point of practicality.</p>
              <p>"A" levels is continuing basic education (thus the school uniform) to set you up for higher education (i.e university).</p>
              <p>Polytechnic is tertiary education (capping of your education) that is specializing you for the job market (thus no school uniform). There are instances of course where people went from poly to uni but this is much fewer than the "A" level route and it cost a year extra.</p>
              <p>I think "A" level is more stressful because it is only 2 years. If you take out enrollment and holidays, there is only slightly more than 1 year of schooling to prepare. Comparing the level up from kindergarten to primary to secondary, there is much less time to adapt to this higher level.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"A" level being a basic education has also a streaming function therefore the failure rate is higher compared to tertiary education. Meaning there is higher chance of failing "A" levels than university or polytechnic, the latter two's purpose being specilization.</span></p>
              <p>"A" level runs a higher risk of being stuck should you fail or your results is not good enough to take you anywhere except private further education, due to lack of specilization, you are also not ready for job market. Whereas with poly, passing chances are high and you will be ready the job maket in the industry that you trained for.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you should ask yourself if you like to study some more for a higher level (and accept the risk or failure or being stuck) or prefer to start out career a few years earlier but with a lower base.</p>

              <p>Just to add, fewer poly students can go to local uni cos of current educational policies.</p>
              <p>Poly diplomas and uni certs are very common nowadays, so many poly grads go overseas or local private unis (read: expensive) to further their studies.</p>

              <p>Unlike many others, Im going straight to the point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want to go Local university anot?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want, Just take the JC path.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you don't want, Poly will do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its easier to enter JC via A levels than diploma. Why? Because an average JC student can go to a local university, whereas a average poly student can't. You do the maths and ratio. And see which route is more logical. </p>

              <p>Hey there! Awesome that you're seeking others opinion!</p>
              <p>Now, it is true that both sides have the chance to lead to a University.However there is a point which hasn't been brought forth.</p>
              <p>The type of University that you'll be attending. Whichever choice you make, it all depends on how hard you work and score, this is because getting into high-ranking Universities that are recognized locally and both internationally is very important.</p>
              <p>Personally on several occasions I'd be floating around other forums and speaking to people whom are already in the industry, many of whom highlighted that the university you are going to needs to be recognized by employers, which is the risk that some (not all) poly and jc graduates face if they do take overseas education. As those whom seek out universities that are not well known and return to Singapore with their degrees will realize that in the eyes of employers, its as good as printing paper. Harsh but true, hopefully you keep this in mind when selecting your uni!</p>
              <p>All the best!</p>
