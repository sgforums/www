              <h1 class="storyheadline">Tuition industry lacks regulation</h1>
              <p>I WAS surprised and relieved to see the article on Sunday ('Is your 
              child's tutor qualified?').</p>
              <p>I am the chief executive officer of the Australian Tutoring 
              Association (ATA) and last year, while in Singapore, I met two large 
              tuition companies here to speak about issues that the tuition industry 
              could address.</p>
              <p>These issues included:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li> Tutor qualifications; </li>
              <li> Child protection; </li>
              <li> Truth in advertising; and </li>
              <li> Consumer protection.
              <p>Both businesses expressed interest in forming an association
               similar to the ATA. However, neither has acted despite both recognising
               serious issues in the industry.</p>
              <p>In Australia, the ATA has given consumers a choice between 
              those places offering accountable, honest and open tuition, and those 
              that do not.</p>
              <p>We do this by having members agree to abide by our code of 
              conduct, which is available online to consumers and to which all members
               are accountable.</p>
              <p>Why isn't there a tuition association in Singapore which 
              benchmarks minimum standards for all tutors?</p>
              <p>Why is the industry unregulated?</p>
              <p>Who is most vulnerable?</p>
              <p>A responsible industry has a representative body. It seems 
              odd that in Singapore, where there is a real focus on education, the 
              private sector is not called upon to demonstrate more initiative with 
              regard to consumers.</p>
              <p>The worst aspects of the sector in Australia are similar to 
              those that occur here: Online tuition and the use of agents (in the case
               of tuition agencies that are not registered with the Ministry of 
              Education).</p>
              <p>I think serious questions should be asked about the tuition 
              sector in Singapore, and all related businesses should be subject to 
              greater consumer scrutiny until there is a representative body that is 
              prepared to publicly call for minimum standards and work with the 
              Government as well as consumer protection and educational bodies.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Weigh the costs v benefits of tuition regulation</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Thursday's letter by Mr Mohan Dhall ("Tuition industry 
              lacks regulation").</p>
              <p>Regulation does not come free. It involves a lot of time, 
              hassle and money. These costs would eventually pass down to consumers. 
              The tuition industry has created lots of part-time jobs for many, 
              including students.</p>
              <p>Secondary school students can easily differentiate between a
               good and a bad tutor with one lesson. Hence, they can choose to 
              discontinue the tuition, if they find the quality not as expected. The 
              loss is minimal.</p>
              <p>Parents of young pupils can monitor the progress of the 
              tuition closely and similarly choose to discontinue at any point.</p>
              <p>Parents and students can also request for information or ask
               as many questions as they wish before hiring a tutor or registering for
               lessons. Some tutors have websites which explain and elaborate in 
              detail about themselves and their lessons.</p>
              <p>The costs versus benefits of regulation should be carefully 
              weighed.</p>
