              <p>Q: "How are wealth and inequality related to each other? How does globalization fit into the relationship?"<br><br>Is this really within the history syllabus for Sec 4 in Singapore? Unbelievable! The answer given is about economics, not history. Even the professors in Harvard cannot answer definitively. So how are the 16 years-old suppose to answer; unless there are paragraphs within a recommended textbook that deal exactly with such topics and the students faithfully memorized and reproduce them to score marks. Is such "education".<br><br>It is better to teach the Bible version that, because of the original sin when Eve offered Adam the forbidden fruit, man is punished thereby having problems after problems for all their life living in this world - uneven wealth distribution, laboring the soil to eek out a livelihood, etc. Nothing to do with globalization! A punishment from original sin!<br><br>Who knows? Those very poor textile slave laborers "exploited" by the multinationals might have met their savior in the rich capitalists, otherwise they could have died early and be out of the national statistics.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Chan Rasjid.   <br></p>
