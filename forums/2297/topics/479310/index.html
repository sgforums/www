              She does't want to stayback in her secondary school. As private

              <p>If $$ is a problem, then secondary school offers the cheapest way to take O Level, provided they will take her.</p>
              <p>It is no longer a question of want or not want to stay back. It is not a question at all, it is a necessity, unless other secondary schools will take her too.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes, tell her to stay back in secondary school. True is hard to accept the looks by other students but think about it, would you rather waste hell lot of $ and get private Os cert or just stay back a year in express stream? Just tell her to treat herself as a NA student loh, taking the 5th year now. I saw a lot of retainees and they are doing fine now, so, staying back in sec sch will be the cheapest, easiest solution for her, if she doesn't want to ruin her face or some sort like that. Think about it, if she rather go ITE, then I prefer she just retake O levels. From express to ITE, I wouldn't say that it's a shame but more of a waste.</p></div>

              <p>Your sister should retake O levels again in secondary school. <br><br>There can be many factors why she doesn't want to do it in her secondary school, could it be the environment? <br><br>Or is there someone she doesn't like in secondary school? Or is she just 'paiseh' to stay back? Ask her about this issue too.</p>
              <p>If i am her, i will not bother about others. I will convince my principal to allow me to retake O levels, and get more help in weak academic areas, and advise her not to slack off, as this could be the only chance. <br><br>Get an adult to talk to the principal, it will be harder for a principal to reject a parent.</p>
              <p>O level results in general are important, university admissions takes O levels result into account. <br><br>Ask her to do something about her studies now, it is a very important stepping stone, she will never regret having a good O level result, many courses use O level results as an entry requirement. <br><br>Do not have the mindset to stop studying at Poly/ITE, go to a local uni, or if not a better overseas univerisity.</p>
