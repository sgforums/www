              Thks for comments/responseâ€¦seems NUS Eng is a better option. But I get worried on seeing below article/discussion. 
              
              Engineering sunset industry 
              http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=32221#1
              
              
              Additionally, I gather NUS Eng is a much tougher course than SMU Biz. So much effort and in the end may not be so rewarding. Anyway NUS openhouse on 16 Mar, will make the important decision after that.

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A MOMENTOUS phase in a student's life when the big decision on one's future career needs to be made.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The routes are quite clear, but what choice to make that's hard part.</p>
              <p>   Experts we consulted offered some advice:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Students who prefer more structured learning styles may be more suited to local university studies or overseas, while those who want to get their degrees quickly and prefer a mix of structured and experiential learning may be more suited for the private school route.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Students should choose a course only after researching the repute of the qualifications offered and that of the education provider.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Students should talk to industry practitioners to find out about the rewards and challenges of the job they are aiming for, the qualities required for success, and criteria that will help them advance in the industry.</p>
              <p>   While a place in a local or overseas university, is still the first choice for most, the PEIs have a strong case to be considered too, and it's a path that's becoming increasingly popular.</p>
              <p>Here are some reasons:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>The opportunity to study courses not available at local non-private universities</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Being able to pursue a degree course although the A-level results are not good<br>enough to get admitted to a local university</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Getting a degree from a prestigious overseas university at a lower cost and<br>without leaving Singapore</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Being able to graduate with a degree in a shorter time than their peers in local or<br>overseas universities.</p>
              <p>   As you flip through the pages of this A level GO Guide, the sixth in the series, you will come across a range of success stories of several students who have taken the PEI route. SAA Global Education's Kenny Lim is one.</p>
              <p>   He did not allow himself to be deterred by a lacklustre A level performance. Instead, he pushed himself and ended up an award winner, receiving the annual Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore Outstanding Achievers Award for excelling in his exams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">PASSION</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   lt's worth taking note of what he has to say: "Some people think attending a local<br>university or going overseas is always the best choice, even it they don't get to study<br>what they really want to.</p>
              <p>   "I think you shouldn't give up on your passion. You can still strive hard to excel and get a good degree at a private institute."</p>
              <p>   Agree? Then check out this guide for more detailed information on the how, what, why of pursuing your further studies in a PEI.</p>
              <p>   For many, the big leap into the future could be through the private school route. The PEI Advantage may make the difference.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 16pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">AS PART of their aim to provide a wider range of academic choices to students, private education institutions (PEIs) offer some courses that are not offered by non-private universities. (This list does not include UniSIM, which is the only private university in Singapore).</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Ms Yeo Ai Ling (left), Head of Business and CAT Programme, SAA Global Education (SM-GE), said: "We introduced the University of Plymouth courses as the university is ranked among the top 10 modern universities in the UK and is known for its entrepreneurial spirit. lt also has an up-to-date and practice oriented curriculum, involving consultancy simulations and real life business case studies, among other things.</p>
              <p>   "The Singapore Qualification Programme (SQP) for professional accountants will be launched later this year. Under this framework, it allows degree holders to enter the profession.</p>
              <p>   "So doing the top-up degrees awarded by the University of Plymouth enables them to leap ahead of their peers."</p>
              <p>   Dr Lissy Vadakel (right), Head of School, MDIS School of Life Sciences, said: "At the MDIS School of Life Sciences, our aim is to provide the opportunity for our graduates to acquire the knowledge and skills that will enable them to pursue life-long careers in the Life Sciences sector. Advances in Biotechnology have been following an upward trend for several years now."</p>
              <p>   She added that the courses complement science courses offered in the universities here.</p>
              <p>   "In Singapore, Novartis has just announced the setting up of a US$500 million ($620m) state-of-the-art biologies plant in Tuas, highlighting their plans for 250 new hires for the plant that is expected to commence operations by 2016.</p>
              <p>   Said Dr Vadakel: "This follows an earlier announcement by Amgen in January to build a US$200m biologics plant in Singapore.</p>
              <p>   "With at least 500 new job prospects in biopharmaceutical manufacturing expected to be created over the next few years, Biotechnology graduates could look forward to rewarding careers in this burgeoning sector," she said.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>JCU Singapore offered a unique fast-track course that was more suitable for me. Many business entities have a growing awareness for the environment. They are concerned abou reducing their carbon footprint and cutting down on environmental pollution.</p>
              <p>   With a degree in Business and Environmental Science, I will beat an advantage compared to just a Business degree (holder). I can work as a<br>business consultant for environmental science-related industries, like fisheries or horticulture. Alternatively, I can work with government bodies on conservation projects.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 24pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">FLEXIBLE TIMETABLE</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have had a keen interest to work in the media industry. since I was young. I feel that going to a private education institution helps me achieve this goal faster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   In addition, SMF Institute's flexible timetable enables me to stUdy and work at the same time to gain work experience.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I chose Kaplan as I wanted to pace my learning the way I wanted.</p>
              <p>   I am getting a quality education in a much shorter time than if I had gone to a local university.</p>
              <p>   I was also thrilled that Kaplan offered a degree in Psychology which is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council and recognised by Australian Psychological Society.</p>
              <p>   This was what I had wanted to pursue.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>After finishing my A levels, I applied for the Business Studies course at Nanyang Technological University.</p>
              <p>   Unfortunately, I could not get into the course and qualified for Sociology instead. To<br>choose a course I was interested in, I rejected the offer and decided to go to a private<br>school.</p>
              <p>   One of my friends studying at SAA Global Education (SAAGE) told me about the course she had taken there. I chose SAAGE because it offered the course I wanted and is also conVeniently located in town.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>After getting my A-level results, I visited the various Open Houses to learn more about their programmes, rather than just focus on the ones offered by local universities.</p>
              <p>   When I wentto the one at SIM Global Education (SIM GE), I discovered its partnership with University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.lt left a deep impression on me.</p>
              <p>   lt gives me the prospect of working with faculty members from the US campus, research opportunities, an interaCtive and flexible academic programme and accessibility to graduate studies in the US.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I chose private education because my A-level results were not good enough. SAA-GE's classes are small, the location is central, and the lecturers are approachable and willing to give us their email addresses.</p>
              <p>   My advice to all A-Level holders is that if you don't get a place at a local university, don't be discouraged. And don't study something you don't like just because you want to go to NUS or NTU.</p>
              <p>   Employers look at your abilities and grades. Study something you like so you won't regret it later.</p>

              I suppose some business modules like human resourse management, organisational behavior. basic psychology will help in handling office politics...smoozing ? sounds like more marketing related (too general). From the SMU brochures, probably strategic financial analysis wud be more useful. 
              
              Research Engineering ? Sounds interesting according to a research engineer I met recently... but need to upgrade later to go further.
              
              Went to SIM UOL presentation as well... this option only viable with a scholarship..n application cannot be accepted before going NS.

              Hi guys, I received my A level results last month and I got AAB /A. I am deciding between NUS Economics and SMU business LKCSB. My dilema: I am planning to start a business of my own in the future..but I want to be a secondary school teacher too.  SMU requires students to be vocal and they have lots of project work which makes the course really stressful. However, NUS has a better reputation.
              Which is a better option?

              <p>First thing first, congrats on your score. Its pretty good.</p>
              <p>Secondly, go to NUS/FASS if you appreciate freedom of learning and academic depth.</p>
              <p>But be forewarned that SMU has the edge in biz fluff, because their focus is less on those qualities I just mentioned. And that SMU way-of-learning is also useful in itself. So it depends on what you want.</p>
              <p>You have any idea what Econs in NUS is like?</p>
              <p>Its math, math and more math. With the exception of a couple of professors, the vast majority love to bamboozle students with math.</p>
              <p>Absolutely nothing like JC Econs. Be forewarned again!</p>

              <p>Good thing that I warned you then.</p>
              <p>Its a pity that its taught this way at NUS. But it can still be a rewarding experience because the econometrics modelling and the crazy algebra can be complemented by the other social science modules offered by FASS.</p>
              <p>And, one more thing, do not think for a moment that the "soft" sciences have zero math.</p>

              Thanks for the prompt reminder! From your detailed description of NUS economics, I pressume you are a graduate of NUS FASS?
              How is Sociology like in NUS? Does it hinge heavily on language skills?
