              <p>Hi Llbros545,</p>
              <p>Literature is indeed more difficult at the upper secondary level, but since you are doing very well now, there is no reason why you will not continue to do so as long as you are willing to work hard.</p>
              <p>Rather than choosing which of the humanities to take up purely base on your results, I advise that you also think about where your interests lie, and which subject you are more capable of handling.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p><br>You topped the level in literature?</p>
              <p>Congratulations.</p>
              <p>My advice is, do not take elective literature.</p>
              <p>Unless you are prepared to really study and memorise a truckload more information than lower secondary Geography, do not take upper secondary Geography.</p>
              <p>Two years ago, I scored A1 for both Literature and Geography (76 and 76). I opted for pure Geography, found out it was too much memory work, and switched over to pure Literature via appeal.</p>
              <p>Worked out pretty well. Never scored lower than A2 for pure Literature since then, and I believe i'll score at least an A2 for O' Level literature too.</p>
              <p>Though if it's a choice between pure History and pure Literature, I would go for pure History as it's easier to score for most students.</p>
