              <p>hi, thanks for reading this</p>
              <p>what im not sure is that in my textbook, they gave an eg of a book resting on the table. then they say it has a foece weight acting down on the table then there is a contact force acting against the object. so when i read this, im thinkin this is e3rd law as its an equal n opposite reaction and they act on different bodies. so how can this be,  eg a boy kicks off a wall in a pool with 10N then he was sent away with 10N by contact force with the wall. i know this would defy everything, but then y wouldnt the book just fly up! thanks for helping me </p>

              <p>3rd law applies.</p>
              <p>The free body diagram of the book is as follows:<br>Downwards force: Weight of book<br>Upwards force: Contact force by table</p>
              <p>The free body diagram of the table is as follows:<br>Downwards force: Weight of table  +  contact force by book (by N3L)<br> Upwards force: Contact force from ground</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the book is at rest or travelling at constant velocity, resultant force = 0, or downwards force = upwards force. Thus, the contact force by the table is equal to the weight of the book. BUT this is not an application of newton's 3rd law.</p>
              <p>Newton's 3rd law is applied when we say the</p>

              <p>If we were to apply newton's 3rd law on weight, it would be:</p>
              <p>the force of the earth on the book (weight of book)<br>equal<br>the force of the book on the earth (Book exerts a gravitational force on earth as well, and this is covered in greater detail at A levels)</p>
              <p>Weight and contact forces are forces of two different nature. Newton's 3rd law is about action reaction forces, and the two forces must be of the same nature/type.</p>
              <p>It's quite tough to explain based on text. You have to draw out the free body diagram, or get with your teacher or tutor to draw the free body diagram in front of you for explanation.</p>

              <p>0 acceleration means 0N resultant force. <br>4m/s2 acceleration means 20N resultant force.</p>
              <p>This is always correct. Downwards force is not zero. It is the resultant (or vector sum) of the different forces that is zero.</p>

              <p>oh ok thanks for the help. i think ill get my tutor to explain the first one. for the second one when calculating the forces y dont we include weight as a downwards force? </p>
              <p>n so sorry to bother u bt i have one last qns about tension. for eg, load of 20N is hung on a wall with a string and a spring balance. the load will cause a downwards force all the way tp the top of the string, then will there be a tensioal force which has the same magnitude at the top of the string at the ceiling place? then becquse the tensional force n the downwards force cancel each other out, there eould be one extra downwards force which is the load which causes net force of 20N downwards. then if 2 men pull at each end with 20N would it be 0N becauae when they pull there would be 2 opposite force that would cancel each other but also tenaional force at the two opposite side too. so the force pulling is 40N at both ends which totally cancel each other out so if there wqs a spring balance it would record 0N?</p>

              <p>It appears that you do not know how to draw a free body diagram, nor do you understand the significance. All these begin from knowing how to draw the free body diagram, so I see no point in continuing to ponder over these questions without first understanding the significance of the free body diagram and it's applications.</p>

              <p>Your application of newton's 3rd law is wrong because we have to consider a force acting on an object itself.

              <p>oh ok thanks for the help. i think ill get my tutor to explain
              the first one. for the second one when calculating the forces y
              dont we include weight as a downwards force? </p>
              <p>n so sorry to bother u bt i have one last qns about tension. for
              eg, load of 20N is hung on a wall with a string and a spring
              balance. the load will cause a downwards force all the way tp the
              top of the string, then will there be a tensioal force which has
              the same magnitude at the top of the string at the ceiling place?
              then becquse the tensional force n the downwards force cancel each
              other out, there eould be one extra downwards force which is the
              load which causes net force of 20N downwards. then if 2 men pull at
              each end with 20N would it be 0N becauae when they pull there would
              be 2 opposite force that would cancel each other but also tenaional
              force at the two opposite side too. so the force pulling is 40N at
              both ends which totally cancel each other out so if there wqs a
              spring balance it would record 0N?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tension is the force of the string pulling back at each man. In this case, tension of string is still 20N if the pulling force on both sides is 20N.</p>

              <p>so does tht mean that there is a net downwards force on the

                                              of the contact force on my hand n not because of weight since
                                              weight is acting on the object?</p>
              <p>cos of that when n object is hung
                                              on the ceiling, there is no net force, but when i put my hand over
                                              to touch the base of the object i experience contact force but its
                                              not heavy? im assuming this as what u r sayin is that weight acts
                                              on the object, n the floor has a contact force on the weight thus
                                              cancellin them out but then there is still a contact force acting
                                              on the ground by the object so naturally id think that thungs are

                                              there is a contact force on the ground, would there be a net
                                              downwards force?</p>

              <p>I did some paragraphing in the quote.</p>
              <p>When you find (or rather, you feel) it heavy, yes, it is the contact force acting on your hand.</p>
              <p>The weight of the object acts on the object, and not on your hand.</p>
              <p>Here's a question to test your understanding. If a book is on your hand and both your hand and the book are accelerating downwards at 10m/s2, what is the contact force of the book on your hand?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In physics, we don't talk about whether things are heavy. Heavy is a subjective word. Instead, we talk about forces. What is the force of something acting on a body, etc.</p>
              <p>When something is on the ground, <strong>and not moving</strong>, by newton's second law, there is zero net force. There is no net downward force as there is no resultant downwards acceleration. You may treat the ground as a totally immovable object for O levels.</p>

              <p>Yes. You have to draw the free body diagram of the object with it's weight and being supported by the tension in the ropes.</p>

              <p>Yes, the reaction force pushes the person off the pool's wall. This is a horizontal force.</p>
              <p>Weight is acting downwards, and this is balanced by upthrust from the pool's water. Hence, there is no net movement in the vertical direction, and the net force on the person is horizontal. You may treat upthrust as an upwards force due to principles of floatation. The real explanation and idea of upthrust is in A levels.</p>

              <p>hi eagle so what u r sayin is that weight does not exert any downwards force but when it hits someyhing the reason y it hurts is because there is a net force downeards of contct force on the hand? so there is always a net downwards force when its on something? lastly is that contact force the same aa weight i think it is as weight is countered by contact force on the liad itself n there is one contact force on the ground so if weight was gone it would be a 3rd law case n the object will fly up so is that true? eagle is this the correct working taking the object to be 10kg.</p>
              <p>F weight=10x10=100N F contact:=100N</p>
              <p>so all the forces on the object would be weight and contact force on hand is contact force on it</p>
              <p>so is the reason on y it falls unlike earth the hand is a movable object and thus it move down with a force of 100N which qas exerted by contact force on the hand by the book. as its a third law case as now its 2 objects. the objects are the hand and the book but because the cointact force on the book is cancelled  out by the weight so there is a net force downwards by contact force from book on hand?</p>

              <p>I think you need to improve on your English. Not very sure what you mean here.</p>
              <p>The reason why things fall at increasing speed is either due to zero upwards force or an upwards force that is much smaller than its weight. This results in a resultant downwards force, and hence things accelerates downwards.</p>
              <p>However, things can still fall at constant speed (terminal velocity) with downwards force (weight) equals to upwards force (air resistance). There is zero resultant force here. The upwards force of the air on the falling object equals to the downwards force of the falling object on the air (Newton's third law).</p>
              <p>The key point here to take note is <strong>resultant force</strong>. Only with a resultant force would you have acceleration (Newton's 2nd Law). With zero resultant force, you have zero acceleration (Newton's 2nd Law). As a result, objects would either remain stationary or continue in the same velocity as before (Newton's 1st law).</p>
