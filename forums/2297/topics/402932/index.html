              <p>English is a subject that is easy to learn BUT difficult to master. Proper methodology in learning it will be needed. It 's not a subject that you can just read a couple of books to get the proper hang of.</p>
              <p>If you can afford, get professional help. It will be worth the investment, particularly when your entire working life will depend on your English proficiency..........</p>

              <p>i'm highlighting these mistakes not out of mockery; i mean well. it's important that you have a good grasp of grammar first. once you have it, your vocab will come naturally. you'll never need chim words for essays, because language is something to be understood, not flaunted.</p>
              <p>reading papers, magazines and books help because you get to learn how other people structure sentences. using them for your essays will help. personally, i think it's more effective than tuition.</p>
              <p>comprehension, as the name suggests, tests how well you comprehend things. answer whatever the question asks, never be afraid that your answer is too short. too many people plonk down irrelevant chunks and got themselves killed.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>I can tell you how to do well in English: read a lot of good English books, and make the effort to speak good English at every opportunity. When I say 'at every opportunity', I am saying that you should put in the effort to speak in proper formal English even when you're talking to your friends, and to not use shorthand lingo in your SMSes.</p>
              <p>While you're at it, put in the effort to write use proper English when you're putting up posts in sgforums. I'm not kidding.</p>
              <p>At all costs please do not bother trying to memorize lists of 'cheem' English words. That will not help you at all, and may in fact prove to be counterproductive. A poor understanding of those words may simply lead you to using them in the wrong context at the very least.</p>
              <p>At the very worst, you may end up writing an essay full of high-level words but riddled with simple grammatical errors - that doesn't reflect very well on you, does it?</p>

              <p>well,i am pretty weak in comphrehension,those "in your own words" questions,and summary,summary because i always find it hard to simplify the words using my own words to shorten the summary and it always ends up having more than 150 words,and in your own words questions,cannot think of vocabulary to replace the words.....thats why i always get 24/50,23/50 for my comphrehension,yet i can score a B3 for my paper 1, which makes me have a C grade for my english.</p>

              <p>Like I said, one of the things you should be doing is to use proper English wherever possible, starting with posts in sgforums. Read your last post and tell me whether you are putting in the effort to do so. I doubt that you have.</p>
              <p>So, how about writing your next post (and all subsequent posts) in grammatically-better English?</p>
