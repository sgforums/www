              <p>Its good to find students who are willing to learn on their own
              since that solves alot of discipline and attitude problems you get
              from them. I only get such students when i give volunteery tuition.
              Most of the jobs you can get from tuition agencies are parents who
              requested the tuition which normally means the child is less than
              cooperative at times... </p>
              <p>The times u were in sec sch is very different from now and alot
              have changed even if its just a matter of 5-10 yrs. The school you
              are in might also have effects since in the past tuition is more
              for the weaker students but these days even top school students are
              requring tuition because they are afraid of lossing out to their
              peers.</p>

              <p>U need a large pool of contacts and good credibility to get students on your own which unfortunately i have not managed yet but i feel it more enjoyable doing volunteery tuition than paid tuition which is sometimes felt like wasting 1-2 hrs a day just to earn some pocket money since the student doesn't care anyway...</p>

              <p>Extra lessons in school will almost always be group base and
              parents pay for tuition so that their child can get private
              attention and have someone to plan the lesson base on the
              capabilities of their child and not the level of the entire

              <p>There are no 2 people with exactly equal learning ability so as long as its a group, you will not be able to satisfy the needs of each and every individual who might differ in their understanding.</p>
              <p>Class sizes have been decreasing all the time and its still in the process due to the lack of teachers which is why MOE is constantly hiring.</p>
              <p>The tuition school and a 1-1 tuition caters to different needs of parents whether its just a more general tuition with maybe tests etc that tuition schools can provide or a 1-1 private coaching that some students might need. Different people have different requirements and excel in different ways.</p>
              <p>These days, even uni have lots of peer tutoring programme or seniors mentors to help the weaker students. There are even uni students who ask tuition agencies to help them find tutors since i have seen such jobs every so often for uni level modules. What made you think that someone who can enter uni means they would definitely not need tuition or help?</p>
              <p>You live in a country where paper qualifications is important so you cannot blame parents for being anxious. Its been instilled into most if not all parents that the best way for their children to have a good future is through education and finally getting the piece of paper call a degree.</p>

              <p>Custom tailored lessons is different from spoon feeding. Different learning setting have different advantages and disadvantages. And different people learn better under different environments. Different knowledge are better imparted under different environments.</p>
              <p>Different people take different amount of time to master certain stuff. Else how would you explain the gap between elite and neighbourhood schools? Streaming and school allocation roughly group students with peers of equal abilities but that is not always accurate. I happen to be tutoring a kid in a decent school who is very fast at thinking but very bad at memorising due to inattentiveness to details. Do you expect his teacher to keep the rest of the class waiting for him?</p>
              <p>1-1 learning in Uni? When 1:20 class size cost $30K already? What? You want to raise uni tuition fee to $600K per student? Knowledge acquired from a 1-1 situation is knowledge which is not acquired?</p>
              <p>In a 1-1 setting, the message (knowledge) can be tailored specificially to the interest/experience of the learner so that it get thru. In addition, the teacher can observe closely the stumbling blocks which is hindering the learning process and correct it immediately.</p>
              <p>You can tell me that in general, a student scoring 90% grade actually understand less about the subject than someone with just passing grade? That being the case, you might as well explain the superiority of elite schools vs neighbour schools in performance away to grading inaccuracy (aka luck).</p>
              <p>Instead of exams, we should just see whether the guy or gal good looking or ugly can liao.</p>
              <p>In most cases, class size here is dictated by resource allocation and not effectiveness. Our classes are at 40:1 because it is the optimal class size?</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that the optimal class size in most situation is 1:10 where you have the best of both worlds.</p>

              <p>"Custom tailored lessons is different from spoon feeding" that i agree. But is it a real need? Beside, custom tailored is just a step short of spoon feeding and it doesn't promote independence nor self reliance. Self acquiring of knowledge is as equally important as gaining knowledge and what most lacking here is the emphasis on the use of knowledge gain.</p>
              <p>Most tution center are cater to teaching of how to improve the student scoring in an exam rather then on understanding and application of the knowledge gain. How else why the high sales of10yrs series text?</p>
              <p>most of the time, ppl that step into the working life, seldom used the knowledge they acquired in class, but rather, the sourcing skill and analytical skill acquired are very much desire and applicable at a later stage of their life.</p>
