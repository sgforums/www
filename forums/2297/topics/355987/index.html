              <p>I refer to last Sunday's article, 'Tuition fee subsidies for the needy'.<br><br>It seems to me that the intention of establishing the Community Tuition Fee Subsidy Scheme is to provide additional academic assistance for students outside of the formal education system.<br><br>While I applaud this effort, I wonder if this measure actually allows us to address the root cause of the situation - the quality of education in schools.<br><br>I acknowledge that in a minority of cases, the extra help from tuition lessons is necessary as some students genuinely need more time to learn.<br><br>However, the need for tutoring outside of formal education could also point to either the schools or the students themselves being inadequately equipped to fulfil their roles.<br><br>If the problem lies with the school system, a better solution would be to target the issues that teachers have been raising for years, such as reducing the student-teacher ratio from the current 40:1 to a more manageable 20:1.<br><br>Alternatively, having later school starting times to give students more time to rest could result in greater attentiveness in class, as studies have shown.<br><br>If it is the case of students being inadequately equipped, then they and their parents could consider alternatives to formal education.<br><br>For example, students could consider home schooling, or even taking 'gap years' - an extended time-out from school.<br><br>The Community Tuition Fee Subsidy Scheme should not be seen as the be-all and end-all of our education woes.<br><br>Rather, the stakeholders in education - students, parents, educators and policymakers - should be proactively exploring ways to improve, or provide alternatives to, formal education in Singapore.<br><br>This will definitely be a better way to use our financial resources in the current downturn.</p>

              <p>the phenomena of the tuition rage in singapore is not just about the `gaps'  in  the quality of education. in most instances, singapore would probably rank highly as having as good an education system anywhere in the world both in terms of mindware and hardware. </p>
              <p>it is also about the uneccessary focus on exam grades as a main determinant of success in one's education life; peer pressure amongst parents and school friends, the kind of competitive learning environment instilled by the government coupled with the early `boxing' of students in their early formative education lives where the so-called `good' are seperated from the `averages'. all these fans the fervour towards tuition as a `solution' to solve the `big singapore education puzzle'. kiasu parents hence would rely on tuition as a major filler to any gaps that their children have on their school subjects for they know too, if you don't do well in singapore, they is no future for them. and there is no way out for most of them. overseas education or private/foreign school education in singapore is not an economic options to most of us. </p>
              <p>my sis-in-law(sil) has a psle son last year. that chap is bright no doubt, but he (still) has to endure tuitions 4 days a week for a year last year, including double science and maths tuitions to drill him into shape in time for his psle. this is not helped by my sil telling everyone she meets that her son aspires to go to nus high school. i am not sure if this is his aspiration or hers. when the results was out late last year, alas, his grades were not good enough (for nus high school) and he has to settle for a neighbourhood school near where he lives. i was told by my wife that the parents were devastated. however, i think it is a great load of pressure off the poor kid's shoulder. he didn't do all too badly but obviously not up to the lofty expectations of his parents. i still think he will do well later in his life.   </p>
              <p>singapore is still stuck with the `sweat and toil' mentality. the reality of it is so much mobility that if the singapoe govt so craves for smart people, they will come if the condition and price is right. in fact, singapore's immigration policy is already in the mode of readily admiting talents. so, there is no need to over-do its education policy where younger singaporeans go to school not to get a life's education, but to fulfill a government's agenda. the kids should be able to enjoy their education in their formative years(primary and secondary), and if there are genuises in the midst, i am sure they will surface in good time for them to be groomed to their fullest potential.</p>
              <p>in that respect, i think tuition is over-glorified in singapore.    </p>

              <p>Tuition is not useless yet because the school education system is insufficient. Tuition helps the bright ones learn even faster (that's where the advantage lies) and the not so good ones better off.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, it's all about speed and efficiency. In that sense, tuition fits in by accelerating the student's path to achieve his/her potential.</p>

              <p><br>In short, tuition is like a catalyst. Without it, you still can reach the ending point (results), but slower. With it, you can reach it faster.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Interestingly, our education minister was being interviewed (on TV in 'Good Morning Singapore') and he questioned about the use of marks in assessment which merely ranks students rather than provide specific feedback on areas for improvement.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>on another hand, consider abt the workload of teachers concerned. I had a lot of remedial in other subjects (i had maths tuition outside school at that time) during my secondary school days.</p>
              <p>The ironic thing is this, spend too much time in school (remedial, and stuff), parents complain student go home late. Spend too little time in school, parents say school are not doing enough and therefore sending their kids to tuition.</p>
              <p>As i said, mindset of parents must be CORRECT from the start. I understand that different parents have different expectations of their children. But if the children can cope and do better than their peers WITHOUT tuition, then why send the kids to tuition? My brother did not even need any tuition since young and he did very well in his A-level examination.</p>
              <p>Heard of law of diminishing marginal returns?</p>

              <p>I would say some of the tuition my friends and i are taking now are such people. The parents made it clear that they just want us to try our best and if their children don't want to work hard, theres nothing much they or I can do but they hope that during the few hrs spent each week, their child can manage to learn and remember abit and hopefully 'wakeup'</p>

              <p>Furthermore, with so many other admin things to do, also CCAs and sai kang projects to take care off, teachers commonly work till 12 midnight daily.</p>
              <p>Thing is, students only see what they can see, but don't think of the amount of work teachers have to put in behind the scenes.</p>

              <p>Its good to find students who are willing to learn on their own since that solves alot of discipline and attitude problems you get from them. I only get such students when i give volunteery tuition. Most of the jobs you can get from tuition agencies are parents who requested the tuition which normally means the child is less than cooperative at times... </p>

              <p>The times u were in sec sch is very different from now and alot have changed even if its just a matter of 5-10 yrs. The school you are in might also have effects since in the past tuition is more for the weaker students but these days even top school students are requring tuition because they are afraid of lossing out to their peers.</p>

              <p>Extra lessons in school will almost always be group base and parents pay for tuition so that their child can get private attention and have someone to plan the lesson base on the capabilities of their child and not the level of the entire group/class</p>
