            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, I'm currently in Sec 4 this year and I've already gone through 2 prelims. We were only tested on a few chapters for Prelim 1 and I did quite well for all three sciences. But for prelim 2, I scored B4 for pure chem, C6 for for pure phy and F9 for pure bio. For pure chem, my teacher told us that the grade would probably be 2 grades better than what we got for prelim 2. For physics I would probably get B3 for o'level but if I push harder, I may get A2. For pure bio, 2/3 of my class got F9 so I guess there's nothing much to say about that. I'm really in a dilemma of whether to drop to combined science (chem and phy). I admit that I didn't really study enough for this prelim. I only started chem 2 days before, phy about 2 days before and bio the day before. If I drop to combined science, I would definitely get an A1. So I'm not very sure.. What is most important is to get the best scores for o'levels right? But I'm want to be a doctor in the future. I am really lost now.</p></div>

              <p>Keep to Pure Sciences. Unless you screw up your 'O' level results, keeping to Pure Sciences will allow your options (and your Medical ambitions) to remain a lot more open and feasible.</p>
              <p>Dropping to Combined Science is riskier in that if you (unexpectedly) don't obtain an A grade, most JCs will not allow you to take H2 Sciences, which are necessary for all Science degrees in the University (including of course, Medicine).</p>
              <p>Since you're interested in Medicine, you might wanna bookmark / add to favourites the "Helpful Links for JC students interested in Medicine" on my webpage :<br><a href="http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Medicine">http://www.infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Medicine</a></p>

              <p><br>Thanks Eagle, but I actually teach only Chemistry these days. When you've the time, could you please update my link on your website to specify that I teach only Chemistry, and not Biology? Thanks again, Eagle! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>depends on ur prelim, do u think u have enuff subjects and score to enter JC or atleast a good score for poly med courses?</p>
              <p>if yes, then u shld continue but gotta work harder... U cannot tell urself that u get bad result becoz u didn't study enuff, rather, u have to do achieve it and not making excuses... sorry but I do not how to exactly make the previous sentence sounds better &gt;__&gt;</p>
              <p>if no, then u shld drop... my friends used to get D7-E8 for their pure, but after go combine science, become A1-A2... Not sure if they "wake up" or izzit really standard difference...</p>

              <p><br>It's more the 'bell-curve' difference than the 'difficulty of questions' difference. To get 'A' grade  for pure science requires over 85% raw score, but for combined science only need over 70% raw score.</p>

              <p><br>The bell-curve varies every year for every subject, and SEAB will never release actual bell-curve data.</p>
              <p>But logically speaking, the top 1/3 of the entire Singapore cohort are taking Pure Sciences, and therefore more of these students will score higher for the Pure Sciences compared to Combined Sciences. Since the A grades are limited to the top xxx%, therefore it's harder to score A when your competitors are better, in the Pure Sciences.</p>
