              <p>hey guys,</p>
              <p>I'm from normal tech... i've just graduated from ITE, anyway i've decided to take private o level... because my current gpa is not good enough to get into poly and i don't want to waste anymore of my time... since i'm already 18... going to be 19...  so yea.. just sat for entrance test for mdis not long ago. btw... i've got 1 and a half year not studying with books... so it's a little tough i know... and not to forget i don't have science base either... i've also been studying science and maths tremendously for the past few months to be able to get back on track faster... anyway... i'm intending to take the following subjects</p>
              <p>: English Language, Chinese Language, Additional Mathematics, Elementary Mathematics, Combined Science (Biology, Chemistry) and Combined Humanities (Social Studies/Geography)</p>
              <p>to be honest... i really wanted to take pure science instead but i know i'll need lab practicals right? should i apply for mdis or private home study instead? i need some advice guys thank you. </p>

              <p>Correct. Because previously you have not taken combined science (biology, chemistry) or Pure sciences, you are required to attend practical lessons from an institution. You need to attend science practical lessons before you can take the exam. MDIS offers science practical lesson in their science programme.</p>
              <p>May I know if your planned 6 subjects is going to be a one year or two year programme?</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, the workload is huge. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"> If you're doing this over two years, then you can try taking Pure sciences, chances are you will be able to graps the concept better at a comfortable pace. If you're doing this over one year, due to the time limitation combined sciences would be a better option.</p>

              <p>yea but mdis only offers combined science ... i'm actually aiming for pure science because my goal requires it. (even though it's tough...)</p>
              <p>erm... i planned to study the 6 subjects within 1year (as a try first)... but if cannot then i'll try 2years... can i ask you... if want to study pure chemistry, and pure biology ... i'll definitely need a lab practical lessons right?</p>
              <p>and ya... i know. i've been tution-ing and studying these few months... fully understand that it's not easy...</p>

              <p>Go and work. And take up private part-time diploma at PSB or other private schools if you want. Harsh words but good for you.</p>
              <p>An NT student only learn less than 10% of what a pure science-streamed express 'O' level student learnt. So it is almost impossible to catch up at all. Even for a N sec 5 to take O level, it is already challenge.</p>
              <p>Besides, you dont need to take redundant subjects to earn yourself a diploma in a specialised field.</p>
              <p>Dont waste your time to take up O level!</p>

              <p>Sorry for replying late in this thread.</p>
              <p>There are few schools which offers Pure Sciences.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.smartlab.com.sg/sps/">SmartLab Education Private School</a> is one of them. So far we have not received any comment or feedback from students from smartlab. Public perception towards SmartLab Education is positive as it's managed by very capable people.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
