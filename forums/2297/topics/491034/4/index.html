                          <p>Yes. SP Engineering courses prepares us for the work, the world and the future.</p>
                          <p>Recently, at the lecturers' level, the lecturers were told to work on their competency. Already, MST/Exams must not have so much repeated questions; must have new questions. The modules are becoming more difficult.</p>
                          <p>The lecturers are on alert for any update. Previously, it was the change of colour code. Soon, some ISO standards will be updated/Introduced.</p>
                          <p>The students are equipped with the latest knowledge and the relevant skills for work. Hence, if they come out to work upon graduation, they have an edge over other new workers in the industry.</p>
                          <p>However, the negative aspect is that it is becoming more hard for SP Engineering students to get high GPA. Previously, there is already this ATS nonsense. Then, it is MST/Exam have to set new questions. Soon, it is about raising competency. It is only going to become harder and harder.</p>
                          <p>This is why just now I wrote a post to advise my juniors to opt for polys that are average, instead of polys that are well-known. I admire my friends at NP, NYP and RP. TP I heard their engineering is about the same as SP Engineering. The people at NP, NYP and RP who study engineering have a easier life. I guess it is easier for them to get high GPA.</p>
                          <p>What to do? This is life. Life is not fair. :(</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Actually, I was wondering, if students really want to work immediately after graduating from Engineering course in Poly, why not straightaway from O level go to the technical schools to attend technical courses, to become LEW  (Licensed Electric Worker)?</p>
                   <p>Anyway, after one graduates from Poly with engineering diploma, he still cannot be electrician yet, until he gets the LEW certification (which takes around/at-least two to three years). So why not straightaway go study and train to become LEW, if they really want to work immediately after graduating from Poly Engineering course?</p>

              <p>Anw I want to go to Uni in the end to get a degree, and I was
              all out at first to go to poly but however I realised only 20% of
              students who get admitted to Uni are poly students, and you have to
              do exceptionally well. So I wanted to go for the science stream in
              JC. My Cop is 12 points, minus bonus 2 points from cca, 10. However
              the problem I have is that I did not take A Maths and this is
              really affecting my decision making as most JC require you to take
              H2 Maths if you want to go to the science stream. I really want to
              go thru the science stream but I am really confused as of now.

              <p>Not much choices here bro. I would suggest u to go poly as your subject combi is severely limited. For schls like srjc or mjc if u dont meet their criteria they will put u to art stream instead of science (unofficially).</p>

              <p>Hi guys, not sure if i should attend a JC or a polytechnic. My
              grades are as follows.</p>

              <p>I got a CCA grade of B4 so my net R4 and R5 is 7 and 10
              respectively. I am currently looking at international business and
              tourism&amp;resort management for my poly courses and i am
              currently thinking of entering CJC or SRJC science stream. Does
              anybody have any advice in general? or can somebody tell me if it's
              wiser to take H2 physics or H2 chemistry. Thanks!</p>

              <p>Poly since you only can take combine science. Many jc dont allow you to take h2 sciences unless u go those lower end jcs such as tpjc/pioneer/yishun.... sry to be harsh. Also it is difficult to cope. Guys just a tip, if u all nvr take Amath or pure sciences and insist to go JC(sci), go those lower end jcs cause they are more lenient and have bridging programs. Unless u want to take the risk(beware risk is very high, no joke)....</p>

              <p>Without Amath you will have a hard time doing H2math. I am not kidding. There are topics such as trigonometry (not the one u learn in emath but a more advanced version), logarithm, modulus and calculus which they assume that you already learned it in Amath. I rather you enter Poly (if you are into sci) where you choose the more general engineering courses or you go to jc art stream. If you insist on going to jc (sci), I advise you to choose jcs such as Yishun Jc or Innova as they are more lenient in their criterias for taking H2 Maths (although I dont recommend that)</p>

              <p>The only reason why one may find it easier to score is that the bell curve will be more in your favour. But that only applies if you are able to do the more in depth and tougher questions well.</p>

                                  <p>You may want to use maps.google.com directions service to see which JC is more accessible (eg. more bus routes going there) and/or nearer (ie. shorter travel time) to your house.</p>
              <p>I feel that it is better to go to a school that is nearer to your house, so that you have more time to study.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I know of people who stay in Jurong West (at Pioneer) and went to Nanyang JC (at Lorong Chuan). He is now at NUS.</p>

              <p>I was from JJC and made it to Nus :)</p>
              <p>Yes Jjc is quiet,compared to the lively atmosphere in Pjc.That's what made me chose Pj over Jj.Too bad,got rejected.</p>
              <p>Jj is stagnating compared to Pj,just look at the annual cut-off each year. Pj was on par with Jj the year before I entered(2013),now it is 2 points ahead.Not only,is it better academically but also atmosphere.</p>
              <p>If you want to have a better shot in uni,choose pjc. Jjc is also notoriously poor with Gp.There are numerous failures for Gp in Jj. </p>
              <p>Likewise,don't expect a miracle for A levels if you fare badly in prelims,because the standards of the paper are roughly scaled to A levels,not harder.</p>
              <p>To add on,the top 55% can qualify for local uni,(smu,nus,ntu) but that's for my year.</p>
              <p>Of the 55%,you can expect the next 20% to be eligible for courses that they have no control over.(nursing,engineering,maths in ntu)</p>
