              <p>hi ppl!! my Son had scored a raw score of 14 ,after bonus points
              of 2 he has 12. He plans to aim for a Jc but do ur have any
              recommendation as to where he shd consider ? He is fairly int in
              srjc but he miss the cutoff point by one mark. is it still
              adviceable then to put srjc as first choice ? He is currently also
              looking at some poly courses with cop ard 8/9 and his R4 after
              minusing is 9. does this mean the chances of him going to those
              courses are harder cuz he is like on the dot . pls anyone help!!!!
              it will be greatly appreciated </p>

              <p>Hi, there are actually two questions in your post. Will try my best to answer both to my knowledge:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For JC</p>
              <p> Miss cutoff by one mark, probably can't get in. Best is to also go to the school to appeal as well, especially if your son's CCA can help contribute well to the JC too. SRJC put as first choice will be good as there is still a minor chance of being posted there without appeal, but the probability is low.</p>
              <p>If really want to go JC, then second choice probably good to put a jc that the L1R5 can qualify.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Poly</p>
              <p>I gather from your post that your son has decided to put JC as the initial choice and poly as a fall-back.</p>
              <p>Based on this, the poly choices will not be on the first choice, and your son probably may not stand a good chance vs candidates with exact scores (there are definitely many) and applying for the same courses as the first choice.</p>

If you put it at 1st choice, and another applicant with 11 pts puts it at 12th choice, he or she will still get it before you. This is what is meant by merit. So use last year's LAS as a guide only.

              <p>Hello. Firstly, congratulations on your O Levels.</p>
              <p>Do you want to consider taking H2 Maths? Yes, without A Maths you have to work extra hard to close the gap, but it will greatly open up your choices when it comes to university.</p>
              <p>Take a look at <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/ALevel/Min_Subject_Requirements.pdf">this</a>. It is the Minimum Subject Requirements the courses in Nanyang Technological Univeristy. H2 Maths is required in most Engineering courses and some Science courses.</p>
              <p>You don't need even need H2 Maths to become a doctor!</p>

              <p>I believe YJC allows you to take H2 Maths without A Maths. Had a student from there once who took H2 Maths with no A Maths background.</p>
              <p>But you will need to work doubly hard to catch up with the rest of the students whom took A Maths. The student I mentioned score A in H2 Maths eventually with his tremendous hard work.</p>
              <p>You could check out the other JCs and ask the teachers in charge. </p>

              <p>JCs who offer H2 Maths without O Level Maths: JJC (15), YJC (17), IJC (20).</p>
              <p>You can consider these JCs, they offer H2 Maths with H2 Chemistry &amp; H2 Biology &amp; H1 Humanities, which matches up nicely with your O Level Subject combinations.</p>
              <p>Of course there are other factors to consider here, for example travelling distance, enivronment, your family's opinion etc..</p>
              <p>But for me the most important factor is what do you really want? Are you interested in an engineering career? Business or accounting career? That will guide you in your decision making.</p>

              <p>Thank you Athulican, most JCs requires me to take H2 Maths to
              proceed on to the science stream which I can't as I did not take A
              Maths. I only know that JJC, YJC and SRJC offer science stream
              classes which does not require you to take H2 Maths... But I'm
              really very confused to as of whether I should go to YJC (I'm
              afraid of the environment and my parents want me to choose the JC
              that is nearest to my score 12 (10 aft cca bonus pts). So is there
              any way to getting around this? Thank you </p>

              <p>Hey there! I'm from Yishun JC, and i'll address your concern about the environment in YJC + other stuff from our school</p>
              <p>In YJC, the environment is quite conducive (air-conditioned library is one of my favourite place to study) even though our facilities is quite limited.</p>
              <p>If you wish to do well, you'll have to do alot of independent learning and be consistent. (that's like the advice for all JCs) Do your tutorials, go for consultations and you wont have to panic for your promotional exam.</p>
              <p>YJC-ians are quite slack in nature, but there's also many hardworking ones. It varies from class to class. It really depends on who you mix with.</p>
              <p>As for subject combination and promotional criteria - subject combination is really flexible, as you know. You can take double H2 science + H2 Mathematics without a problem. Promotional criteria is a minimum of 1 H2 'E' grade, 2 H2 'S' grade, H1 'S' grade and GP 'S' grade. Not very difficult.</p>
              <p>If you're choosing between SRJC, YJC and JJC, do try to consider the distance/time taken to travel to the school. JC curriculum is quite packed and it's advisable for you to go to a JC nearer to your home.</p>
              <p>And yeah i forgot to mention, there's a YJC Scholarship offered to newly enrolled JC1 students who have chosen YJC as their first choice and has an L1R5 of 12 and below, along with a cca grade of B3 and better, and a conduct grade of very good and excellent. These students will most probably (if im not wrong) be offered the ESP programme in our college, which opens the door for further leadership opportunities. Just to clarify i'm not in the ESP programme but i do have classmates inside :)</p>
              <p>If you do have anymore queries do feel free to ask. Have a great day ahead :D</p>

              <p>One advise I can give, based on my own experience as a second year EEE student at Singapore Polytechnic:</p>
                  <p>The modules in a course are not only taken by students in that course. Most of the modules are taken by students across many courses.</p>
                  <p>I am in a course that has high COP (around 24 points). So far, most of the modules I take are also taken by other courses, and most of them have lower COP. The stress is there.</p>
                  <p>When I take modules "PEEE"/"PEEE2"/"CTA" (basically about Circuit Theory Analysis), the top scorers are usually from school of MAE.</p>
                  <p>Well, be prepared. Although the COP is high and your L1R4 is lower than the COP, it does not mean that you will do well in that course. The high COP is because there is strong demand in the industry for engineers, that they want as many students as possible, that's why the COP is high.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, just work hard and play hard, and you will be alright. When there's homework, you do. When there's test/exam, you study. Have fun and enjoy life. :)</p>

              <p>I am from MAE!! Yes I can attest to that. But we dont have a module called "PEEE", but instead we have EEP and EEP2 (Electrical Engineering Principles)</p>
              <p>I would say SP Engineering courses are quite tough but nothing is impossible as long as you are consistent in doing tutorials, attending class and have a good time management. I must really stress that a good time management is extremely important in poly. </p>
