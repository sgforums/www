I am desperate for information about getting into a JC or MI when I have failed my English and Humans shockingly. I have plans on retaking my Os, studying a course in Poly, or both. I got D7 my English and Combine Humans (SS +history) but both my L1R4 and L1R5 are still below 20 after deducting CCA points. I wonder if there is any chance of me being able to get into a JC or Millennia Institute despite failing English. I know that the doors of JC are shut and I could hardly appeal for it if I got D7 for my English. The reason that I wanted to take A levels after this is that I feel that I am capable of studying and giving JC or MI a shot. I think my performance for my English for my O level was not an accurate measure of my usual skills as English was one of the first few papers that I did in O level and I was really nervous when doing it. Furthermore Combine Humanities is a tough subject especially it's a combination of SS and history thus it is the norm to fail it in in my usual school exams. I did not take any pure science so i guess i have lesser advantages but I got 2 for my combine science. I know that it is hard for me to be able to get into JC now but I wonder if i could still try Millennia Institute. A friend told me that I am still able to get into Millennia Institute as long as my L1R4 is below 20 although she is unsure whether I could still get in if i failed my English. I have considered retaking my O level English and probably Humanities this year so that I could have better choices to make. I have heard that it is possible for Millennia Institute to accept such students if their L1R4 is below 20 and they can re-sit for their English O level paper and if they met the criteria they'll be able to stay in the school.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">I don't know much about MI as I seldom heard any teachers talking about it, I knew about it only on the day of the release of Os result. I went home to research about it and it feels like a place for those students who didn't do as well for their O level to get into JC but wanted to pursue their Education to A level.</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">So basically my Os result was:</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">English: D7</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">Combine Humans: D7</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">Chinese: A2</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">Combine Science: A2</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">A Maths: B3</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">E Maths: B4</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">Design and Technology: B3</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">My L1R5 (before deducting CCA points): 21</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">L1R5 (after deducting CCA points): 19</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">L1R4 (before deducting CCA points): 17</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">L1R4 (after deducting CCA points): 15</span><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;">I got A2 for my CCA so could I still minus my CCA points which is 2 points when I sign up for Millennia Institute as like any other JC/Poly?</span></p></div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.56px; line-height: 23.184px;"> Hi all, I am currently a student who has graduated from Secondary
              School in year 2015 after taking my Os on the same year. I am
              desperate for information about getting into a JC or MI when I have
              failed my English and Humans shockingly. I have plans on retaking
              my Os, studying a course in Poly, or both. I got D7 my English and
              Combine Humans (SS +history) but both my L1R4 and L1R5 are still
              below 20 after deducting CCA points. I wonder if there is any
              chance of me being able to get into a JC or Millennia Institute
              despite failing English. I know that the doors of JC are shut and I
              could hardly appeal for it if I got D7 for my English. The reason
              that I wanted to take A levels after this is that I feel that I am
              capable of studying and giving JC or MI a shot. I think my
              performance for my English for my O level was not an accurate
              measure of my usual skills as English was one of the first few
              papers that I did in O level and I was really nervous when doing
              it. Furthermore Combine Humanities is a tough subject especially
              it's a combination of SS and history thus it is the norm to fail it
              in in my usual school exams. I did not take any pure science so i
              guess i have lesser advantages but I got 2 for my combine science.
              I know that it is hard for me to be able to get into JC now but I
              wonder if i could still try Millennia Institute. A friend told me
              that I am still able to get into Millennia Institute as long as my
              L1R4 is below 20 although she is unsure whether I could still get
              in if i failed my English. I have considered retaking my O level
              English and probably Humanities this year so that I could have
              better choices to make. I have heard that it is possible for
              Millennia Institute to accept such students if their L1R4 is below
              20 and they can re-sit for their English O level paper and if they

              <p>You have to re-take English this year, regardless of whether you go to JC, Poly or MI. Do not worry la. English very easy to pass. Perhaps you should go back to your secondary school and ask your English teachers on what they think you should work on for English, and improve from there.</p>
              <p>With DnT background and good grades for Physics and Mathematics, I feel that the Engineering courses at Polytechnic are suitable for you.</p>
              <p>If you want to go to the University, choose the Polys that are average in Engineering, as the content is easier and it is easier to get high GPA.</p>
              <p>AVOID the best poly known for Engineering because their content is the hardest and you would probably struggle to even pass the modules.</p>
              <p>Be smart. Take the easier route to get high GPA. Choose the easier polys (Ngee Ann, Nanyang, Republic), <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">since your grades are not that good anyway</span>.</p>

I do not know.

              <p>the chances of him going to his third choice is very high although he is going to appeal into srjc. so wld ur recommend that he choose 1 or 2? from wat I heard  the ppl don't seem motivated at tampjc n My Son like to study in an environment where ppl are more motivated.then since the course that his int are like the lowest cut off point in poly(8/9), the ppl are more likely to work harder so he doesn't know whether to put poly or tampjc aft his first two choices . these are wat I heard from other ppl but if ur from poly courses like Psy ,biomed, biotech or tampjc pls feel free to share ur exp !! thanks and I greatly appreciated if u guys can give some advice </p>

              <p>ppl please help and give ur input !! my Son has a score of R5 of
                  12 aft minusing his bonus points . 4 A2s and 4B3s.  he is int
                  in srjc but he missed the cut off point by 1 mark so wat are the
                  chances or him getting in and if he fails, will appealing help him
                  ? the chances of him getting into mjc sci ( cop of 10) is not high
                  either rite ?</p>
              <p>1) srjc&gt; mjc&gt;poly&gt;tampjc </p>
              <p>2) srjc&gt;mjc&gt;tampjc&gt;poly?</p>
              <p>the chances of him going to his third choice is very high
                  although he is going to appeal into srjc. so wld ur recommend that
                  he choose 1 or 2? from wat I heard  the ppl don't seem
                  motivated at tampjc n My Son like to study in an environment where
                  ppl are more motivated.then since the course that his int are like
                  the lowest cut off point in poly(8/9), the ppl are more likely to
                  work harder so he doesn't know whether to put poly or tampjc aft
                  his first two choices . these are wat I heard from other ppl but if
                  ur from poly courses like Psy ,biomed, biotech or tampjc pls feel
                  free to share ur exp !! thanks and I greatly appreciated if u guys
                  can give some advice </p>

              <p>What is his subject combination? Based on your L1R5 if your son insist to enter a jc I suggest that you put tpjc as your son's first choice as the chances of him getting into srjc or mjc is really very minimal... especially so for mjc. Plus actually tpjc is not really bad a schl. It actually depends on which class your son go to. Usually those who take double h2 sciences tend to be more hardworking (generalising here) than those who do not. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poly is also another good choice in my opinion since there is an increasing amount of seats given to poly students to Uni. Poly is also getting more popular too, where many single pointer go into Poly. There are also more generalised courses(usually engineering courses allow you to transfer to business courses in uni...)such as chemical engineering, mechanical engineering etc if your son is still unsure of his future.</p>
              <p> PS: Appealing in this case is also very difficult unless your son's results are exactly the same as the cut of point of the JC</p>

                      <p>Might as well, since it is easier for A level candidates to enter the local Universities (eg. NUS and NTU). I heard that the top local universities are gradually increasing their intake of A level holders, and gradually reducing their intake of Diploma holders.</p>

              <p>This is only because there are new universities (eg. SIT and SUTD) set up, which take in only Poly graduates.</p>
              <p>If you are talking about top universities like NUS and NTU, they are cutting down on the vacancies for Poly graduates, and increasing the vacancies for A level holders.</p>
