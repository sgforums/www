              Wait for Mon's O level results.<br><br>
              
              If your L1R5 allows it, apply for IJC / YJC.<br><br>
              If your L1R4 allows it, apply for MI.<br><br>
              
              If above fails, you make a decision to either go the Poly route, or stick to A levels route.<br><br>
              
              If A levels route, you make a decision to either retake your O levels (so that you can move on to IJC / YJC / MI the following year), or take A levels as a private candidate (which you'll need lots of private tuition and hence lots of $$$ for that).<br><br>
              
              If taking A levels through the private route, check with Ministry of Defence about your National Service liabilities.

                  subjects.</p>
              <p>My predicted results for L1R4 would be slightly below 20 and for
                  l1r5 would be slightly below 27. <br> <br> Due to my realisation of poly not being a good choice for me in the
                  long run, I wanted JC (Basically A lvls), my only option would be
                  MI, but after hearing such rumours about it, things like " It'll be
                  tough to do well in MI cause the environment sucks" or " MI mainly
                  consist of a lot of trouble makers that slack", stuff like that,
                  I'm having serious considerations about even going there, thus I
                  decided to post here for advice.</p>
              <p>I want to know your opinions, if I should go to MI, is MI bad?
                  If I did the same kind of mugging for my math in MI/JC would I be
                  able to score well also?</p>
              <p>btw my CCA grade is A2.</p>
              <p>If I miraculously get below 20 points for my L1R5, would you
                  suggest a low JC like IJC/YJC since JC is apparently JC? </p>
              <p>Thanks for your time to read this unnecessarily long post.</p>

              <p>From what u said,i personally think ur o lvl l1r5 and l1r4 will be better than ur prelims,as you are not the only one who felt that way.I was also like you before Os and also during o levels,lazy and anyhow study,and ended up screwing up 5 subjects,namely English,Chemistry,Additional Maths,Combined humanities(ss+hist) and Geography.</p>
              <p>I agree with the facts regarding how poor the environment of MI is,as the students there are rather slack,unmotivated to study hard and have a high retain rate at end of J1.But as long as you mix with the hardworking students,and you have a passion for mugging and studying real hard,then you should really consider MI too.Poly if you prefer a more self-directed,practical and hands on learning.</p>
              <p>All the best to your o level results tomorrow!I'm also collecting mine tomorrow too</p>

              <p>If your L1R5 is less than 20, apply to the JCs with cut-off that is more than or equal to your L1R5.</p>
                          <p>If your L1R5 is equal to 20, apply to the JCs with cut-off at L1R5 twenty points.</p>
                          <p>If your L1R5 is more than 20, you are better off pursuing a diploma at Polytechnic.</p>
                          <p>If your L1R4 is around or more than 30, you are better off learning a technical skill at ITE.</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>As much as possible, avoid MI. JC has better resources to prepare you for the A levels.</p>
                          
                          <p>Also, there could be a JC near your house, unlike MI which is at Bukit Batok. Why travel so far to MI when you can go to a JC nearby? Still, even if you stay in Bukit Batok, there is JJC, PJC, AJC and IJC nearby.</p>
                          
                          <p>If your L1R5 is more than 20 but L1R4 is less than or equal to 20, maybe MI is for you. But you have to know you are competing against the people at JC. So, maybe Polytechnic is better for you instead.</p>
                      
                      <p>Polytechnic also three years. It is more expensive. Do not worry about having to learn independently. The work load is about the same as secondary three work load. Most year one students are around sixteen years old. The lecturers are all university graduates and are professional in their field of study. If you can qualify for Poly and you study hard, you can get a high GPA and enter university.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Imo, i believe it is better for a student to apply for a jc that is more than his/her l1r5,in this case for students with l1r5&gt; 9, unless he can go into the top 5 jcs. Most likely he will do better than his/her peers and thus the school will channel more resources to the student and he/her may be chosen for academic programmes or competitions such as olympaid which is very good and important for his/her portfolio. Also the school will also likely to give him 4h2 subject combinations, which is advantageous to application of scholarships. </p></div>

              <p>Hi, so i'm going to be receiving my O level results tomorrow but i'm currently still undecided on whether i should go to a JC or a Polytechnic. I don't really have a strong passion for any courses in a polytechnic, but i'm afraid i can't do well in a JC due to my secondary school subject combination.</p>
              <p>I took combined science(phy,chem) and combined humanities(ss,geog) in secondary school. i would like to ask if it is recommended for a combined science student to take H2 physics in JC? or would it better for me to take H2 geography instead.</p>
              <p>I would also like to know if it's more advisable for me to enter a JC or a Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance for any replies!</p>

              <p>Combine science/without Amath limits you to very little subject combinations for science stream. If you are interested in science and math i would rather you take a general engineering course in poly such as common engineering which you can later choose to specialise in a different course such as chemical engineering... If you really insist in going to a jc you can choose yishun or innova jc which usually have a more lenient subject combination conditions. (Need to work very hard)</p>

              <p>I forgot to include in my post that i take Amath, my apologies. I've read that most JCs only allow combined science students to take 1 H2 science, so it is limited but i should be able to find a suitable subject combination for me. So would polytechnic or JC be a better choice for me? </p>
