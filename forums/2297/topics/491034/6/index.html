              Your son needs to (sooner or later) cultivate self-motivation and self-discipline and not rely on others around him to motivate him. I maintain my stand that since it's the same A level exam paper at the end of 2 short years, which JC you get into really doesn't matter all that much (actually the only real, valid, and practical reason why the choice of JC matters is travelling time and sleep sufficiency vs deprivation).<br><br>Besides, there are hardworking students in every JC, including TPJC. Furthermore, (if you insist on letting your peers affect you) it's healthier for your / your son's self-esteem to be a bigger fish in a smaller pond, rather than vice-versa. Moreover (again if you insist on comparing JCs) TPJC is considered a mid-tier average JC, so it's really quite ok (that's the thing about "average" : everyone wants to be above average, but by the very definition of "average" it means half of everyone will compulsorily be below average).<br><br>Also, on a related note (this isn't about student peers, but about school teachers), getting a good private tuition teacher matters a lot more than getting a good subject teacher in school, due to the limitations of the school system.

                                  <p>My lecturer at Poly. He say he went to one of his ex-student graduation ceremony at NTU. That ex-student told him that uni work load is many times harder than poly work load. He told us that someone working in the uni (NUS/NTU) want him to let us know that the uni (NUS/NTU) is increasing intake of A level holders and cutting down on the intake of Diploma holders, that we must have higher Poly GPA if we want to go to their university. The reason is because they want to cut down on foreign talent in the local university.</p>
                                  <p>Personally, I feel that this is to correspond with the new universities set up to receive only poly graduates. The top universities like NUS and NTU are gradually shifting to receive only JC graduates.</p>
              <p>Well, I am sure there are newspaper articles and statistics to support what I say. Otherwise, you may ask the people working at the NUS/NTU.</p>

              <p>Hello there Gdmom67. Very sorry to burst your bubble, but your son has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very little</span> (or zero) chance to enter SRJC via appeal by academics. if you wish to enter srjc, you should appeal via CCA achievements (sports/performing arts)</p>
              <p>I personally witnessed a similar situation last year when some of my classmates had 12nett and 14raw for o levels last year and didnt manage to enter SRJC. Out of the many that appealed in, only one manage to appeal in via CCA achievements. The others went to tpjc, and is doing relatively fine there. Like what Ultimaonline said, TPJC isnt that bad of a school. Do tell your son to be mentally prepared if he is posted to TPJC <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>They appealed in via academics, one had 4A2 and 4B3s, same as your son's.</p>
              <p>It wasn't that hard to adjust, orientation was relatively fun (i heard). Many of their classmates put SRJC as their first choice and didnt manage to enter, and ended up in TPJC haha.</p>
              <p>I myself missed TPJC cop by 1 point last year. A little regretful i didnt manage to enter TPJC, as it's relatively close to my place. I'm sure your son will manage to do well in JC if he chooses the right subject combination and put in consistent effort in his studies. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> I had a hard time accepting the fact i was not accepted by TPJC, but eventually got over it during my JC1 year.</p>

H2 Chem or H2 Econs or H2 Phys or H2 Maths, then his school will force him to drop his weakest subject to H1 level after his J1 end of year Promotional exams.<br><br>But if he intends to study any Science (eg.

              <p>Actually, the people who are most knowledgeable are the teachers in the JCs, and their principal. You should have went for the open houses and asked the questions that you have.</p>
                      <p>Well, I guess you can write an email to the JC principal and/or the Heads-Of-Department (HODs) to ask the questions you have.</p>

              If her son's L1R5 doesn't permit taking 4H2s, then he has to make a decision on the 3 H2 + 1 H1 subject combination based on his intended future Uni course in turn based on his intended professional career.<br><br>As long as you / her son intend/s to do Science related courses, then H2 Chem + H2 Physics is strongly advised. And if your / her son's favourite science is Biology (*and* intends to do Science in the Uni), then take H2 Chem + H2 Biology. If you / he doesn't intend to do Science in the Uni, then you don't have to take H2 Chem at all.

              <p>Since that covers all courses within NUS , then I should definitely go to the science stream right? Because this will allow me to take subjects that I have to pass in A levels to make the cut for application for these uni courses.

              <p>Those people who have higher scores than tpjc cut off points usually appealed in thru their cca. This may sound harsh but your chances of entering tpjc (dont even talk about srjc) is very slim. U can try but i suggest u to put tpjc as first choice and forget about srjc since it would be more realistic. Btw it may also be hard for you to take H2 math since you fail Amath(at least for tpjc and srjc), so you may not be able to choose the science stream since you are ineligible for any subject combination that have H2 math. If you have an A1 in emath, only yishun jc/innova/jurong jc will allow you to take h2 math so your choices are seriously quite limited here.</p>

              Yes, for everyone : unless you're already very certain you wanna do a non-science type of career profession in the future, otherwise (if you wanna keep your options open, or if you're already certain you wanna do Science, eg. Medicine or Engineering), as long as your L1R5 allows you to do so, you should take Science subjects in JC, especially H2 Chemistry and H2 Physics, arguably the 2 most important subjects in JC.

              Ask CKTR correctly said, even if your L1R5 is exactly the same as the COP, your chances of entering the JC is very slim. Distance to the JC (ie. travelling time) is the most impt factor, as JC students (and teachers too, which is why I left MOE) are perpetually sleep deprived, which causes accumulative brain damage, which can potentially lower your A level exam grades.
