It corrects his grammar/vocab<br><br>From <a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2007/06/singapores_top_.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2007/06/singapores_top_.html</a><br><br>When you need to make it as a model or you are looking for talent, try Steven Lim's talent page. Here are some of the descriptions found on his models page. Mr Tan and I spent a pleasant evening dissecting the descriptions:<br><br>"Linda got the sad sad cute puppy look eyes n demure n pretty. All events including modeling. Linda n Xiu Mei r frenz 4ever!"<br><br>"Xiu Mei is a very spirited, bubbly adorable girl that is quick on poses. All events including modeling, photo shoots (casual).

Great for modeling, photo shoots including bikini, commercials."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">For those bikini charity photo shoots?</span><br><br>"Helen is a pretty pretty pretty, n figure is slim."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">We're missing a noun here, I think.</span><br><br>"Cherise Khit looks like Hong Kong movie star."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Jackie Chan?</span><br><br>"Bao Zhen is such a sweet cutie! Her face like one of the members of 5566."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Waitaminute, isn't 5566 a Taiwanese BOY Band?</span><br><br>"Beverly Teo is looking good without wearing her glasses."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">What happens when she wears them?</span><br><br>"Rebecca is an Eurasian! Eurasian always looks good n unique. East mix west look."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Win liao! Eurasian exclamation! Eurasian is AUTO WIN.

He also an expert in setting up stage n props for any good events."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">You have to pay him one fee to hire the hair, and another for the setting up of the stage?<br></span><br><br>"Gina Mackay is hot stuff from Scotland UK.

She got x-factor, nice personality n mesmerizing smile. A face that only looks better every min. All events including modeling. A small body compared to her head with 25 inches waist."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">That is a good score, 6.3, though I am not sure what it is for. And a face that looks better every minute means you have to wait maybe half an hour before you snap? Head to body to waist ratio is of course, always important. You don't want big headed models.</span><br><br>"Talents: (Cheryl) got super nice singing voice! Can sing for all events except bikini (wasted)"<br><span style="font-style: italic;">No bikini singing events please. Wasted indeed.</span><br><br>"Great experience in Dancing (esp. in hip hop) n acting, gorgeous lady.

She has no bikini experience? What?</span><br><br>"Boyish Girl Role. Various events/ acting except wearing skirt roles."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">None of that feminine role nonsense.</span><br><br>Edit: Include italics</div>
