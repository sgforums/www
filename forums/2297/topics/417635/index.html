              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Just a quick post here cos im fed up of typing everything again...i created the topic just now and the post didn't show up in the forum :S</p>
              <p>Not sure which forum I should post this under.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well.. I have just finished my UNSW (University of New South Wales) foundation studies in Sydney and obtained quite a decent GPA. I can now choose a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Law (BCom/LLB) double degree at UNSW which is my first choice. Initially I wanted to choose the normal Bachelor of Commerce major as I doubted my own ability to get into law school.. but now I've achieved what I've always been eyeing..</p>
              <p>btw the link is here</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/future_students/undergraduate/index.asp">http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/future_students/undergraduate/index.asp</a></p>
              <p>The thing is should I go for it? It is a 5 years degree program.. For the first 3 years, I will be taking commerce and law concurrently. After 3 years, I will be awarded a Bachelor of Commerce degree with my area of specialisation (e.g. Finance). For the 4th and 5th year, it will be concentrated solely on Law.. for example Criminal law, Torts, etc.</p>
              <p>One of the major things that I'm concerned about is that I'm not sure whether an aussie law degree is recognised in Singapore as I'm sure that employers will definitely favour local grads from NUS or top law schools from the west.. therefore im not sure whether this long 5 year road is worth it. And also I heard that you got to undertake some kinda test in order to practice law in singapore if your degree is from overseas.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the commerce degree from UNSW is highly reputable and sought after as its by the Australian School of Business which is arguable one of the best in Australia. And if I choose to drop law halfway, I will still be awarded the Bachelor of Commerce degree.</p>
              <p>Interest wise, I've always been wanting to do a commerce degree.. and it is my dream to be a banker or something that has to be in the corporate world. However, after taking legal studies (kinda similar to law) in foundation studies, I've found law to be very interesting and had aced all the exams and presentation on it..thats why I chose the Bcom/law degree. However I know that legal studies is over simplified and the actual law degree is much more complex than it, and I'm aware of what is expected of me..</p>
              <p>My parents are pretty supportive of me and I'm free to choose whatever I want to take, but they want me to give it serious consideration as its alot of $ and 5 years is a long road. Money wise they are able to afford the tuition fees and expenses. And personally, even though I find this road a long one, I feel that it will definitely be rewarding and pay off in the long run as I'm not in a hurry to get married and to 'feed' my family by getting a job.</p>

              <p>hoever who edited my topic.. i think its abit inappropriate. Cos its a double degree, Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Law (BCom/LLB). 5 years course.</p>
              <p>I can't choose solely law, but I can combine it with my commerce major.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@Toofree: yes it can admit me to bar and corporate.. the degree is versatile.</p>

              <div>Hi,<br><br>I've posted here before but now I'm back again.. somestimes I find that when you are lost, its quite a good idea to get feedback from strangers from the internet, haha.</div>
              <div>I'm a 23 year old Singaporean male this year and have just been offered a Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Law combined degree(5yr course) from the University of New South Wales in Sydney. However, I've yet to accept my offer as there are still some issues I'm unsure of which is holding back my decision..<br><br>Don't ask me why I'm starting my undergrad studies so late.. to cut the story short I took a worthless diploma, served NS, then went on to complete the UNSW Foundation program with decent enough grades to get into law school.<br><br>My main concern is whether it is worth it for me to take up this 5 years combined degree as by the time I graduate, I'll probably be around 27. I consider that really old as most of my peers will be already working and probably scaling up the corporate ladder.<br><br>My next question is how this Australian law combined degree compares to Singapore uni grads, in terms of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">job prospects and salary wise</span>. From what I can see most of the legal practitioners in sg are from NUS and UK law schools.. I've not really known of anybody from Aussie law schools yet. This comm/law combined degree is definitely more valuable and relevant in Australia than in Singapore. However, I'm not implying that UNSW is a lousy school as its well known internationally especially in Asia, and is also a G8 uni in Aus. It's Commerce faculty (Australia School of Business) is also arguably one of the top in Australia.<br><br>If I do not choose the Commerce/Law degree, I'll opt for the double major Bachelor of Commerce which can be completed over 3 years FT or even less than 3 years if I take summer course. On the other hand, I can only opt for one commerce major for the 5 years Comm/Law degree.<br><br>This is how it goes.. If I choose the Commerce degree, it will be double major over a course of 3 years. For the combined degree, the first 3 years will be on Commerce and Law concurrently and I'll be awarded a Bcom degree (1major) after 3 years. The 4th and 5th year will be solely concentrated on Law elective units.<br><br>I aspire to work in the Banking industry, or even become a corporate lawyer (thats if I can make it) and I think that a commerce/law degree is as valuable as it can get. But the age thing is turning me of..<br><br>Sorry for the lengthy post and thanks for reading <img title="Smile" src="http://forums.salary.sg/images/smilies/smile.gif" alt=""><br><br>Hope to hear valuable feedbacks from you (experienced guys) out there</div>
              <div>not4rent: u guys have probably heard this many times but i find that getting a bachelors is the safest way.</div>
              <div>fcuckpap: pls excuse my ignorance but whats PEQ?</div>
              <div>The main reason why I'm holding back my decision is that if I take the Commerce degree, I will be out in the working world earlier and gain invaluable experience. If i take the combined degree, I will have to spend another 1-2 years to become a fully qualified legal practitioner.. thats about 28year old + already.</div>
              <div>So thats a difference between 25 or 28+ when I'm out in the working world.</div>
              <div>However, a law degree is still a law degree.. it might seem impressive but I personally think that starting work at 28year old+ is abit too old.</div>

              <p>It depends on whether your Law degree is recognized in Singapore or not.  You still have to be called to the  barr to practice.  </p>
              <p>Do pursue your dream job.  It is worth it.  But make sure you pursue it practically by spending your time on recognizable degree etc.</p>

              <p>Shotgun: Yes, the UNSW law degree is recognized in Singapore and is one of the approved universities under the Ministry of Law website. Just that the age thing is a big turn off..</p>
              <p>However, what you said really made sense and perhaps shone some light on my decision.. yea I should pursue my dream job and I only got one shot at it even if I will be in a different industry next time.</p>

              This kind of double degree is worthless. It get you to nowhere.
              
              A lawyer is a professional job, with a registration number. If you are working on the law side, you need to undergo understudy for 2 years to be a registered lawyer. You need to find a good mentor to guide you. And who cares about your degree when you win your first case. 
              
              If you dont do the apprenticeship, then you are just a normal law executives which is no better than an business office administrator. If you are working on the commerce side as an executives, you still need to pass your work to a lawyer to sign and stamp. My suggestion is take one, either commence or law but not both.
              
              It is not that I look down on you. Since, you are not those RI, RJ fellow, I think your English is only half-way and logical thinking is less quick and sharp. It is difficult to survive in the law industry. How much material you have, you should know by now, right? The fact is that you are asking us commoners about this question in sgforums. This meant that don't have good networking either.
              
              Being a lawyer is not easy and they get high pay for what they deserved. Have you find out what they exactly do?
              
              The fact that you are a poly guy . This meant that  you are really not a paperwork person. I question if you can sit in the office all day on the desk.

              <p>Double degree nowadays for Law, to be admitted they will look at the number of actual law papers u took. Try and take more laws instead, cross credited into your commerce degree than the other way round, unless you are not that keen to be a lawyer.</p>
              <p>And age is not a factor when admitted into bar nor is it a factor when doing tutelage/apprenticeship, if you are good... they will know u are good. And after a few years, paper counts for jack. Its experience, and see which field of law you are specialised in.</p>

              <p>BadzMaro brought up a good point on admission into bar. From my understanding, Double Degree Law graduates need to apply for special consideration from Minlaw while pure Bachelor of Law graduates do not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BadzMaro, you seem to know abit about the process since you mentioned they consider the number of law papers taken. Do you have more details on this, and the success rate of Double Degree holders getting admitted?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ask because I'm in a similar dilemma, but one between doing an LLB v.s LLB/BCom. Thanks!</p>
