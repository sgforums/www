              <p>Of course, that's precisely what I have been recommending poly students to do, all this time. Especially poly Science students (where taking H2 Sciences as a private candidate would be very valuable in many ways).</p>
              <p>I've tutored A level H2 Chemistry to Chemical Engineering polytechnic students, who have found that taking A level H2 Chemistry helps them achieve excellent GPA scores for their chemistry-based poly courses. </p>
              <p>You can register as soon as the A level results are released on 1st of March.</p>

              <p><br>If you do succeed in getting straight As for H2 Phys + H2 Chem + H2 Bio + H2 Maths (you get to screw the ridiculous 'contrasting subject' requirement) as a private candidate, it might actually work in your favour during the application process, precisely because it's tough to achieve straight As on your own as a private candidate (though great tuition always helps).</p>

              <p><br>It doesn't matter what your O level subject combination was. A level begins afresh, at much higher difficulty levels.</p>
              <p>If you're determined to do Medicine, the only helpful subject combination is Triple H2 Science and H2 Maths. H1 GP will be necessary, if you intend to formally use your A level certificate. H1 Literature is utterly useless for Medicine (Medical literature is scientific, not artistic).</p>
              <p>You should start by obtaining for yourself relevant study materials, and do consider tuition for your H2 Sciences (solo if you can afford it, group/class if you're on a budget). Also, don't forget to register your A levels next month. You probably want to retake your A levels 3 times, 2013, 2014, 2015 until you get all Distinction A grades.</p>
              <p>Recommended H2 Chem materials are listed on my website here (a pre-Med student should obtain all the Uni level Chem textbooks that I've listed therein) :<br><a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry</a></p>

              <p>For GP there are plenty of GP publications out there (eg. at Popular). You can visit JC bookshops to buy that particular JC's GP publication, or get friends to buy them for you, or buy them online on various 'marketplace' forums.</p>
              <p>If you feel you need additional help, there are plenty of GP tuition centers in Singapore, such as the (arguably the single most) popular<a href="http://www.school-of-thought.com/land/"> School of Thought</a>.</p>
              <p>Try going it alone without tuition for the 1st year, and see your 1st year's A level results. If you decide you need additional help, you can always seek tuition in Year 2 and Year 3 (since Poly courses are 3 years, you have 3 years to retake your A levels 3 times).</p>

              My poly student says he is so busy with his projects and homework, and he is only in his first year in poly. It will be very tough to cope with both poly and A level studies, as both are very demanding.
              
              You have to maintain a poly GPA of at least 3.6 - 3.9 to get into some courses in the uni. You need to think about CCA records too.
              
              Usually, it is the top JC students with 6-8 distinctions and excellent leadership CCA records who get into Medicine, with some exceptions of some neighbourhood JC students getting in.
              
              Those who become doctors have no life; they are practically sold to the job and encounter many strains of bacteria and viruses and maybe infectious diseases everyday. Burnout rate is very high amongst doctors.

              <p>Yes, Chemguide has pointed out a prudent caution for the TS.</p>
              <p>Ideally the poly student who wants to take private A levels should also be doing a closely related course. For instance, I have tutored H2 Chemistry to Chemical Engineering Poly students, who have found that the A levels complements and supports their poly course studies, helping them achieve excellent GPA scores.</p>
              <p>So ideally, the TS should be taking either a closely related poly course (eg. biomedical, chemical, etc) to his A level subjects, instead of something largely unrelated, eg. business. Or the TS may find it a struggle to cope with two unrelated, and similarly demanding studies (particularly if he wants to get a perfect GPA and perfect A level grades).</p>

              <p><br>You may be disadvantaged, depending on which course in which Uni you're applying for. Some admissions offices for some Uni courses, upon learning that you did private A levels and hence do not have PW, will not penalize you for it. But some admissions offices for some Uni courses may not be as understanding.</p>
              <p>I suggest you contact (eg. email, or call, or visit in person) the admissions office of the Uni courses you're interested in, and ask them about this.</p>
              <p>Also, clarify with them which subjects you need to take (including GP, 2nd language, etc) to be eligible to apply for the course you're interested in.</p>
              <p>As a guide, these are the subject prerequisites for NUS courses :</p>
