              <p>Another of your well-written questions, <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/279500">Kahynickel</a>. I particularly like your table testing the student's familiarity with Group VII chemistry.</p>
              <div class="name">However, if I may be frank, I have some reservations and doubts on your part (c) question. The student may not know how exactly to interpret your question. Is it asking about Group II reactivity versus Group VII reactivity, or asking about why Group II metals have increased reactivity down the group, while Group VII halogens have decreased reactivity down the group.</div>
              <div class="name">If the latter, then the expected answer should include :<br></div>
              <div class="name">When Group II metals react, they lose electrons and are oxidized. Down the group, due to increasing atomic radius and increasing shielding effect, electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and valence shell electrons decreases, hence going down the group, Group II metals have smaller (ie. less endothermic and thus more favourable) ionization energies and thus have increased reactivities.</div>
              <div class="name">When Group VII halogens react, they gain electrons and are reduced. Down the group, due to increasing atomic radius and increasing shielding effect, electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and valence shell electrons decreases, hence going down the group, Group VII halogens have smaller (ie. less exothermic and thus less favourable) electron affinities and thus have decreased reactivities.</div>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The answer was A.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>D</strong> CCl4 has VDW
              forces while ethanol has H-bonding so they don’t mix therefore no heat is
              evolved. H-bonds are stronger than VDW forces in CCl4 consequently heat must be
              added to make them mix. You can say that in the context of this question
              intermolecular forces are not broken. [Is this right]<span>  </span><span> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>C</strong> propanone
              has permanent –dipoles as compared to VDW forces in CCl4 again the same

              <p class="MsoNormal">In <strong>A</strong> the
              intermolecular forces are same in both cases. Propanone has, however, stronger
              permanent-dipoles forces than CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> because of the high
              electronegative O atom against the low-electronegative C-atom. The
              intermolecular bonds /forces formed here are strong permanent dipoles (I don’t
              think that VDW forces have a role to play here albeit CH2Cl2 has more electron
              than propanone.) so heat is given out.</p>

              <p><br>Btw and Fyi, the Singapore-Cambridge exams are only offered in November. We do not have June papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've little to add to your excellent explanations on this particular MCQ question, except on two minor points :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) For options B, C and D, although the two species listed are generally not miscible (due to reasons you've given), but due to favourable entropy, they will be a slight measure of mixing. Moreover, the question specified, "when the two species are mixed", which you may take it to mean "forcibly mixed" together, eg. by mechanical means. In which case, your structured or open-eneded question, may require the student to take this into consideration.</p>
              <p>For options B, C and D, when mixing does occur, no heat is evolved, because the newly formed inter-species (solute-solvent) interactions are permanent dipole - induced dipole van der Waals (Debye) forces, which are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weaker</span> than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces (option B &amp; C) or the hydrogen bonding (option D), that must be overcome as part of the mixing process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) For option A, as you've pointed out, since the new interactions are of the same type as the old interactions, ie. permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces, we cannot be sure, without carrying out the relevant experiments, that A will definitely give out heat. But because this is an MCQ question, we can eliminate B, C, D as the answer, and therefore A is the only remaining viable answer. But if you were to phrase your structured or open-ended question to guide the process, eg. "In the table above, which experiment would be the most likely to have an exothermic reading?" and "For the experiment you identified, suggest with explanation at the molecular level, why this experiment might have an exothermic reading."</p>
              <p>Then perhaps the molecular geometries and sterics might play a part. Dichloromethane is tetrahedral, while propanone is trigonal planar. Perhaps the student can score credit if he/she writes along the lines of, "<em>due to sterics consideration of the molecular geometries involved, the newly formed permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between dichloromethane and propanone, might be stronger than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between dichloromethane and dichloromethane, (but not necessarily stronger than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between propanone and propanone)."</em></p>

              </p><p>My query pertains to the following question which apperaed in A-level [CIE]

              <p><span style="color: blue;">Ethanolamine and phenylamine are two organic bases
              that are industrially important.<br> Ethanolamine is a useful solvent with basic properties, whilst phenylamine is
              an important<br> starting material in the manufacture of dyes and pharmaceuticals.<br> The following table lists some of their properties, together with those of
              propylamine.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333300;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My answer</span></strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333300;">This is a comparison question. Both propylamine
              and ethanoloamine have hydrogen bonding but prophyl amine has a dominant non-polar
              propyl chain which minimizes the effectivess of hydrogen bonding. In
              ethnoalmine there are two hydrogen bonds per molecule via nitrogen and Oxygen
              atoms resulting in extensive hydrogen bondind as comapred to propylamine.</span></p>

              Your answer is perfectly fine, and in complete accordance to the Cambridge mark scheme. Personally, I would say that "ethanolamine has more extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding compared to propylamine, because ethanolamine (per molecule) has two functional groups (NH2 and OH) capable of both donating and accepting hydrogen bonds, while propaylamine (per molecule) only has one functional group capable of donating and accepting hydrogen bonds."
              <br><br>
              I would advise students to draw 3 ethanolamine molecules as you suggested, illustrating at least 2 of the 3 different *additional* types of intermolecular hydrogen bonding that ethanolamine has, over propylamine.
