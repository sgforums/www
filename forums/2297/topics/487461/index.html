              <p>I barely got promoted to j2 but i feel that im not ready for the A levels. I come from a 2nd tier JC, got 11-2 for L1r5 and my subj combi is PCMe, overall grades SDDE and C for GP last year.</p>
              <p>I dont have any interest towards chemistry anymore and am thinking of requesting to retain in j1 and take up a new subject combi of ELMp. I know that my career prospects will be limited in the arts faculty but i really have an interest towards lit, having scored an A1 for Os. Do you think i should go through with the year and get bad grades for As or start afresh on a clean slate and possibly do better?</p>
              <p>Please help my mom is very sad that i'll be wasting a year and i hate having to see her like that, i really want to make her proud and happy. Im also considering poly, maybe socal work, psycology or banking/accounting but given that i wanna enter local uni it may not be the wisest choice.</p>
              <p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Ive been so depressed and suicidal these few weeks im in desperate need for help. Thank you so very much.</p>

              <p>If you are having emotional problems, please see a counselor at Family Service Centre or your JC counseling centre.</p>
              <p>If you still cherish JC environment, then maybe you can repeat JC1 with different subjects. JC2 chemistry stuff is much tougher than JC1 chemistry.</p>
              <p>Or you may have a fresh start in a poly with much hands-on. Poly is also very rigorous nowadays.</p>

              <p>Don't factor in your worry about your mum being unhappy now.  She is just kind of worried for you.  I heard that there is this Millennium institute that does a three year JC.  It worked for my friends whose children cannot get into the other JCs.  Just think what sort of work you can live with.  There is no promise land at the end of uni.  Take your time, it is just one year in your life time.  A whole life time ahead.  If you like, you can work a little or do some practice because you are under water, to improve your well-being.</p>

              <p>You can enter local Uni even with Poly. These unis even include SMU. Many of my friends did it, but you have to be pretty good at it.</p>
              <p>Jobs are pretty difficult. Must graduate from local uni (NOT UniSIM) or local poly and get good grades or else your future is bleak. Again, MUST HAVE GOOD GRADES.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. Seriously, I would still continue the science route. Get your arse into a Radiology course in Poly with your JC marks (I would assume ain't that good). Then gain enough radiology experience, then gain sonography grad dip, gain exp, then go to Australia. Complete a degree which may only be a 1 year. Since you already have exp in sonography, easily you get accreditation. Lots of $$$. Any already companies are willing to sponsor you as they are not willing to train their own local grads.</span></p>
              <p>2. if not JC, then ?Maritime Engineering in Poly ? complete dip, then head to Australia to complete a Maritime Engineering with specialisation degree for 2 years only since first 2 years exempted. Aim for subsea or any in demand. lots of $$$.</p>
              <p>3. No point Arts in local uni where jobs are scarce unless ya get fantastic grades but yet have dirt low wages. Only Law is worth it. As for Accounting, you can easily do the ACCA as the big 4 recognises it. You can even get into big 4 with a banking degree. They are mainly looking for people who can endure the hardship. This can be proven with any jobs you do previously. I know 2 people personally who started off in call centres at banks. </p>
              <p>No matter what you do, always figure the jobs prospect first. There are no 2nd chances in Singapore. Job experiences are very important. Losing one year is really nothing, may work for you as luck works in mysterious ways e.g. graduating in a time that you don't compete with dragon born graduates, or you may graduate in a time not in recession.</p>
              <p>4. If all else fails, I do hope that the govt is serious in adopting a German style trade course in ITE with affilications to industry through apprenticeships. I would certainly like to be a Plumber in Singapore.</p>

              <p>same situation as u last time, kinda but worst lol</p>

              <p>i think for your case dont think too much. your results actually not too bad, can go to j2 and prepare to slog it out. alot of ppl with ur this kind of result eventually also end up at nus one. just need to slog for another year</p>
              <p>but my case i went poly but in the end also end up at ntu now (but take longer)</p>

              To do Psychology or Accounting, JC Science or Arts subject don't matter (just need H2 Math for Accounting). And JC Science subject combination opens more doors for you in the Uni, should you change you mind and wish to reconsider doing other subjects in the Uni. As for your H2 Chem, you probably lost interest because you haven't been doing well, in turn probably because you don't understand it well. Give it a shot to re-learn Chemistry on your own terms (don't follow your school if you don't like their way of teaching Chemistry). Self-learn Chemistry (eg. using the internet), and/or with the help of a good Tuition service (group vs solo, pros and cons). <a href="http://alevelchemistrysg.blogspot.sg/">Mr Chong</a> specializes in tutoring weaker students.

              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>I think probably you should find your JC tutor or a former JC lecturer to give some consultation to both you and your parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on my experience, more than half of the students who barely get promoted into J2 ended up below decent A level grades. This is because they lacked the foundation skills and knowledge and J2's pace may be faster as most JCs aim to complete the syllabus by July. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I always adviced my former students that repeating J1 is another chance given to them to excel. Once they pass A level with say Ds and Es they cannot enroll into JC to repeat A level, might as well start all over again at J1. Take 1 more year as an investment for good grades.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My students got S for math and under my supervision and repeating J1's his math is now As all the way as he is studying it a second time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you need any help or advice feel free to contact me at ang.alevelmath@gmail.com or whatsapp 94385929. I believe being a JC teacher I can provide you insight which people not in the profession may not know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: I am lecturing at poly now I can tell you that the chances of going the big 4 universities through JC is still higher than Polytechnic. Also if you are not disciplined, it is highly likely you might not do well enough for university as the lecturers there do not monitor you as closely compared to JCs.</p>
