              <p>2) A fruit seller had 2 crates of fruits. Each crate contained mangoes and pears. The ratio of the number of mangoes to the number of pears in crate A was 5:4. In crate B, the number of pears was  2/5 of the number of mangoes. The fruit seller transferred half of the pears from crate A to crate B. In the end, the total number of fruits in crate A became 105 and the ratio of the number of mangoes to number of pears in crate B became 7:4.</p>

              <p>3) Joyce had 42 more beads than Selina. Each of them gave away some of their beads to their friends. The number of beads Selina gave away was 4/7 of the number of beads Joyce had at first. The number of beads Joyce gave away was 2/3 of the number of beads Selina had at first. Both had an equal number of beads left. How many beads did Joyce have at first?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It is not suitable to solve simultaneous equations at P6 level.</p>
              <p>  For Q1, we could draw a table like this:</p>
              <p>  Scenario               Black             White          Ratio</p>
              <p>  Add 15 white         65%               35%            13 : 7</p>
              <p>  Add 40 black         75%               25%            3 : 1 = 21 : 7</p>
              <p>  Now 21u - 13u = 8u</p>
              <p>  8u -&gt; 40</p>
              <p>  1u -&gt; 5</p>
              <p>  7u -&gt; 35</p>
              <p>  Number of white counters at first = 35 - 15 = 20.</p>
              <p>  There were 20 white counters at first.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>P.S. It is not encouraged to present the steps like in the answer sheet.</p>

              <p>After reading through and learning from Mr Wen Shih's link, I have used the model method to solve the "fiction and nonfiction books" question. I have listed down my thought process as well. Really helps me to think from a non algebra method</p>
