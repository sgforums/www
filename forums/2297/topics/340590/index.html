              <p>i'm going to give chinese tuition to two P5 students, was wondering if anyone can share some tips on how i should go about? I'm not a singaporean, have no idea of the syllabus and what they are learning in singapore school. I could get these from students during first meeting right???</p>
              <p>Normally what are the tutors doing during tuition sessions ya?  get the students to do assessment books, then go through and discuss? </p>
              <p>For the first meeting, i read from another post suggesting that it would be better not to buy them assessment books, but to establish rapport first. I was thinking might try to get an idea of how they are doing in school first. but what should I do after that if not doing the assessment? How to spend the 1.5 hr session? anything i can do with the students?</p>
              <p>Sounds like silly questions ya...hah<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> hope to hear from anyone who is experienced~ ^^</p>

              <p>FI: x2. Totally agree.</p>
              <p>TS: I'm just appalled at your complete loss. If you dont even know how to execute your lessons, why did you even take up the assignment in the first place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Let others who are up to the mark to take up the assignment. Please dont let your poor tutees die badly under your "care". And your è„¸çš®å¾ˆåŽš, ask people to do the preparatory work for you. Are you going to share your tuition earnings with others then?</p>

              <p><br>true ma. if everybody also dun dare step out first step or dun wan take first step, den next time will be severely short of tuition teachers.</p>
              <p>anyway, i also believe that while everybody has first time, it is also the responsibility of first timer to be keen in learning how to teach, as well as seeking advices from those very experienced tuition teachers. Not just only forum but however if first timer has chances, he or she should go look at how tuition teachers give tuition and sought useful pointers.</p>

              <p>Definitely everyone had their "first time". However, it comes across to me as downright unethical to accept an assignment when the tutor does not even know the syllabus, and seemed completely clueless as to how to conduct a lesson. A responsible tutor must first familarise himself/herself with the syllabus, then do sufficient research on how to conduct a tuition session efficiently, then apply for any assignments, based on the tutor's capabilities, prudently. From what I perceive, TS just <em>suka suka</em> apply for tuition assignments first, before desperately asking (or should I say, making use of) people for advice on how to conduct a lesson. How opportunistic can that be?</p>

              <p>Okay, i am not any professional tutor or wad, i just finished my o levels</p>
              <p>From p5 to P6 is onli 1 year, depending on the student's ability and current grasp of the subject-which is the language chinese. WIth &lt;1 year i think the possibility of getting the student to score is quite high, first thing is to make the student believes he can do it(i know it is easy to say than to be done).</p>
              <p>As a student, i think the tutor needs to be very familiar with those freaking questions where most will find it ambigious, and fall in a state of "Should i take this answer or that?" Thus, you need to go to the popular book store and look at the textbooks, for primary 5. Do note the different 'syllabus', if i remember correctly, during my time, there are 2 textbooks</p>
              <p>After that, take that textbook and look at the past exam papers, and see if there are any patterns. Like for the comprehension, the level of difficulty of the text itself to the text passages in the textbook</p>
              <p>AFter that, compare the past exam questions to those of the assesment books, depending on the student's ability, you might wants to try to get easy questions at first, than slowly move on to the normal questions, after that buy assesment books that have questions that are slightly more difficult than the current PSLE questions</p>

              <p>It's not the case that I dont know how to conduct lessons, I DO have teaching experiences in my home country.

              <p>Irregardless of whether you had conducted lessons in your homeland before, the fact remains:- <strong>you are clueless on the syllabus and the subject requirements in the Singapore context.</strong> To top it off, knowing your gross lack of knowledge in these areas, you decided to pounce blindly on any tuition assignments that come along your way, hoping that any kind souls on the forum will offer you good advice thereafter. It's analagous to taking up a job without knowing the job requirements, then ask others for advice on how to do your job well! No one is going to spoonfeed you. :)</p>
              <p>Pardon me for being blunt, but I feel that you are implicitly taking a dig at Singapore's complaining culture, if that culture even exists in the 1st place. If you haven't stayed in Singapore for a reasonable timespan, or if you havent fully intertwined yourself into the Singapore society, I guess, its better to hold your tongue and refrain from criticising Singapore, lest the overall impression of such foreigners in Singapore deteriorate even further. </p>

              i think u guys have been too harsh on the TS. i dun think he/she is in a complete loss. and there's nothing wrong in asking and sharing tips on how to conduct tuition.
              
              but TS, i do think that you should find out the syllabus first. and it's damn malu to ask the students about it. cos students will naturally think that their 'teacher' knows everything.
              
              fyi, malu = embarrassing

              <p>Simple ones, I used them to drive in concepts.</p>
              <p>Those with more challenging questions, i.e. Yellowreef books (I like them), are used to challenge the students to move on to the next level</p>
