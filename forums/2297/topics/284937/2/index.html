Notice the arrow showing Energy different of the reactant and product. It is a down arrow. Meaning there is a loss of energy, and it's in the form of heat, during the reaction. This explains why there is an increase of temperature at first.<br><br>The second sentence which says that product/mixture losses heat to the surrounding as it cools again. This is simple. Just like a cup of hot milo, it'll eventually cool down to room temperature after some time.</div>
