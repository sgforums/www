And qn25 lol yeah I spent so much time on it only to realise after that they're asking for directions. Oh and for question 12, shouldn't it be a maximum radius instead?  I worked it out to be r&lt;=v^2/g. Cos minimum then can be zero what? Lol what are your opinions guys?</p></div>

              <p>yeah I put B too cos it's the only right answer.. but any idea why it explains the weightlessness?</p>
              <p>haha but then still it's r&lt;=v^2/g right? or did I do wrongly hmm</p>
              <p>for qn 9 I got 40. first find the engine force at v=10 by F=ma+friction. then find the power using P=Fv. then max v is when F=friction (acceleration is zero).</p>
              <p>Qn 16 is just the graph for a less damped oscillation no? which is B</p>
              <p>26 I got D, not sure lol though. I thought cos I=Q/t, so it's the charge passing through a point per unit time, which is just charge of electron x frequency? not sure though cos I didn't use the radius :/</p>
              <p>hmm my two cents' worth not sure how reliable haha</p>

              <p>Q11. yeaa but why does having the same centripetal acceleration as the capsule mean that contact force is zero? :O</p>
              <p>Q9. hahah I think you think too much! they also never say about efficiency so should be constant output power ba..</p>
              <p>Q16. A has a different amplitude at f=0, while B the same. correct one is B</p>
