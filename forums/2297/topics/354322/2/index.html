              <p>Haven't apply uni ah? After A's can apply le mah, every yr just try your luck applying, 1 yr don't go in still got the next. Furthermore you pay the fees according to the year of admission so even if the uni fees rise, u don't pay the higher fees.</p>
              <p>My english also bad wat. C5 in O's and went poly partly cos i worry GP will fail and still can get into uni so whats so why bother english lousy or not?</p>

              <p>When we talk about acid, according to Arrhenius definition, acid is a substance that produces <span style="font-family: Calibri;">H<sup>+ </sup></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">ions when in aqueous state. So this definition limits acid to substances that can dissolve in water.</span></p>
              <p>According to Bronsted-Lowry definition, acid is a proton donor. Acid is said to be dissociated after donating the proton (<span style="font-family: Calibri;">H<sup>+</sup></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">). So it encompasses acid that doesn't dissolve in water. But doesn't it also means that this definition limits acids to substances that contain the proton? Then what about those acidic oxides (non-metal oxides)?</span></p>
              <p>Cl2O5(s) + 2NaOH(aq) ----&gt; 2NaClO3(aq) + H2O(l)</p>
              <p>I suppose the Cl2O5 is in solid state to start with. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a substance is able to conduct electricity, it must contains ions in it that can carry the electric current, or charge carrier.</p>
              <p>Deionized water is so-called pure water, that does not contains any ions, like calcium ions or magnesium ions, in it as compared to normal drinking water. And given that the dissociation of water is very low in normal room temperature, does it mean that deionized water cannot conduct electricity or has low electrical conductivity?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Methylamine is more basic than trimethylamine, less basic than dimethylamine. Electron-donating group on the N makes the electrons more available for protonation, so with an increase in the number of electron-donating group, it makes the amine more basic. Instead, trimethylamine is less basic than methylamine though it contains more methyl (electron-donating) group.</p>
              <p>I remembered it has something to do with trimethylamine not being able to form hydrogen bonds with water thus the lower basicity. Or is it due to steric hindrance?</p>

              <p><br>An acidic oxide is not an acid by itself (depending on which definition of acid you use). To be precise, an acidic oxide undergoes hydrolysis to form an (Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry) acid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In your case, the hydrolysis of dichlorine pentoxide Cl2O5 yields chloric(V) acid HClO3, which then reacts with NaOH in a typical proton transfer acid-base reaction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of Arrhenius,</p>
              <p>HClO3 (or Cl2O5) is the Arrhenius acid, while NaOH (or Na or Na2O) is the Arrhenius base.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of Bronsted-Lowry,</p>
              <p>HClO3 (from Cl2O5 + H2O) is the Bronsted-Lowry acid, while OH- (from NaOH) is the Bronsted-Lowry base.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of Lewis,</p>
              <p>H+ (from HClO3) is the Lewis acid, while OH- (from NaOH) is the Lewis base.</p>

              <p>The stability of a conjugate acid (ie. when a base is protonated), depends on stabilization by induction, resonance, and solvation (hydration).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recall that bond forming is exothermic (ie. products less energy hence more stable than reactants; energy lost to surroundings), and therefore favourable (enthalpic) intermolecular interactions such as ion-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, all stabilize the species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of ammonium and alkyl ammonium cations (eg. protonated conjugate acid forms of methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine), there is no resonance stabilization to speak of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Purely in terms of induction effects (ie. the electron donating alkyl groups (in turn because C is more electronegative than H) stabilizing the positive formal charge on the N atom (a Grp V element with 0 lone pairs and 4 bond pairs) after protonation of the ammonia or alkylamine base), the greatest stabilization conferred by induction would be experienced in the tertiary alkyl ammonium cation, followed by secondary alkyl ammonium cation, followed by primary alkyl ammonium cation, and lastly the ammonium cation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Purely in terms of solvation (hydration) effects, specifically hydrogen bonding with water molecules, the greatest stabilization conferred by solvation would be experienced in the ammonium cation (4 H-bonds), followed by primary alkyl ammonium cation (3 H-bonds), followed by secondary alkyl ammonium cation (2 H-bonds), and lastly the tertiary ammonium cation (1 H-bond).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Note that hydrogen bonds rather than ion-dipole interactions, exist for the protonated cation in aqueous solution; the positive formal charged N atom is surrounded by hydrogens and/or alkyl groups tetrahedrally, preventing effective ion-dipole interactions with the polar water solvent molecules.)</p>

              <p>Just as in real-life, it is often the (fascinating) case in Chemistry, that we have to consider opposing patterns/trends (for instance, solubility of Grp II compounds, boiling points of hydrogen halides, etc), and apply our theoretical conceptual understanding to explain observed experimental data.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other words, based on experimental evidence, we know that such-and-such principle outweighs such-and-such principle at such-and-such a point. (A good case in point would be enthalpy vs entropy in solubility of Grp II carbonates - theoretically, enthalpy dictates carbonates become less soluble down Grp II; theoretically, entropy dictates that carbonates become more soluble down Grp II; based on experimental evidence, we know that enthalpy effect outweighs entropy effect from Be to Sr, and entropy effect outweighs enthalpy effect from Sr to Ba.

              <p> </p>
              <p>The stability of a conjugate acid (ie. when a base is protonated), depends on stabilization by induction, resonance, and solvation (hydration).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recall that bond forming is exothermic (ie. products less energy hence more stable than reactants; energy lost to surroundings), and therefore favourable (enthalpic) intermolecular interactions such as ion-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, all stabilize the species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of ammonium and alkyl ammonium cations (eg. protonated conjugate acid forms of methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine), there is no resonance stabilization to speak of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Purely in terms of induction effects (ie. the electron donating alkyl groups (in turn because C is more electronegative than H) stabilizing the positive formal charge on the N atom (a Grp V element with 0 lone pairs and 4 bond pairs) after protonation of the ammonia or alkylamine base), the greatest stabilization conferred by induction would be experienced in the tertiary alkyl ammonium cation, followed by secondary alkyl ammonium cation, followed by primary alkyl ammonium cation, and lastly the ammonium cation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Purely in terms of solvation (hydration) effects, specifically hydrogen bonding with water molecules, the greatest stabilization conferred by solvation would be experienced in the ammonium cation (3 H-bonds), followed by primary alkyl ammonium cation (2 H-bonds), followed by secondary alkyl ammonium cation (1 H-bond), and lastly the tertiary ammonium cation (No H-bonds).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as in real-life, it is often the (fascinating) case in Chemistry, that we have to consider opposing patterns/trends (for instance, solubility of Grp II compounds, boiling points of hydrogen halides, etc), and apply our theoretical conceptual understanding to explain observed experimental data.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other words, based on experimental evidence, we know that such-and-such principle outweighs such-and-such principle at such-and-such a point. (A good case in point would be enthalpy vs entropy in solubility of Grp II carbonates - theoretically, enthalpy dictates carbonates become less soluble down Grp II; theoretically, entropy dictates that carbonates become more soluble down Grp II; based on experimental evidence, we know that enthalpy effect outweighs entropy effect from Be to Sr, and entropy effect outweighs enthalpy effect from Sr to Ba.

              <p>Anyway, for white ppt to be formed with ammonia, 1 of the metals can't be a transition metal i think.</p>
              <p>Cu is not the only compound that gives blue salts, Ni and some other ions give blue solutions as well but i don't remember too much.</p>
              <p>Fe is 1 of the most common reddish brown ion i can think of but if theres metal iron in the coin, shouldn't it form Fe2+ before being oxidised to Fe3+ since the metal in an alloy should not be in its charged form.</p>
              <p>Cu and Fe seems like the most ideal combination but the white ppt would be unaccountable.</p>

              <p>Alright, then how do I explain experiment 3? Simple displacement reaction?</p>
              <p>Wait, that doesn't explain why Cu is able to react with nitric acid. =S</p>

              <p>Just displacement. Cu is slightly more reactive than Ag.</p>
              <p>Nitric acid is a very strong oxidising agent and thus will oxidise the Cu to Cu2+</p>

              <p>Haha. Some interests just have to be cultivated. With reference to your edited away sociology. <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p>And thanks, I forgot that nitric acid is oxidizing. That explains the use of sulphuric acid to acidify oxidizing agents. If I didn't remember wrongly.</p>
              <p>Erm, looking back again, I see some contradiction. I meant why Zn is able to form ZnSO4 but Cu cannot form CuSO4. If you say HNO3 is strongly oxidizing, then experiment one would fail. Am I right?</p>
              <p>CuSO4 is blue solution if I'm not wrong. But in experiment 2, the solution is colourless due to the ZnSO4.</p>

              <p>When you clear your AHSS PEs then u can try to enjoy, some courses are interesting, some are nice to know bad for exams, some are downright there to just create vacancies...</p>
              <p>H2S04 is mostly use for acidifying things since it doesn't have the strong oxiding characteristics that HNO3 has which might affect reactions.</p>

              <p>Question: What is means by hydroxy group on the phenol is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strongly activating</span> due to the delocalisation of lone pair of electrons on oxygen into the phenyl ring.</p>
              <p>As in activate is an English term used here? Means to start something?</p>
              <p>Question: I remember iron (III) chloride can also be used to distinguish between phenol and phenylamine. The phenol will form a violet complex with Fe3+, but what colour is phenylamine's complex.</p>
              <p>Or I remembered wrongly?</p>
