              <p>1) a b c are all alkanes with the formula CnH2n+2 but d has the formula of an alkene which is CnH2n thus its different from the other 3. However i would say the word isomer is misleading.</p>
              <p>For your info, c has 7 C not 5 cos pentane is a 5 carbon straight chain with 1 carbon on top n 1 below the 2nd carbon</p>
              <p>2) You can just write out all their chemical formula and all 4 seems wrong.</p>
              <p>3) D. Cracking gives you smaller molecules and thus they are more volatile as they have lower boiling points. A and B is definitely wrong </p>
              <p>4) Yes. Moltan electrolysis will get u Cl2 and Na metal. Concentrated NaCl will give you H2 and O2 as products of electrolysis.</p>

              <div class="name">Helpful <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/60883">dkcx</a> is correct for almost everything, other than one little point for #4, which is that in "concentrated" (ie. at what is called "concentrated" at 'O' levels; note though, that this adjective "concentrated" isn't quantitative on its own and thus is technically an unfair question, unfortunately like so many questions in exams taken at 'O' levels and 'A' levels) NaCl(aq), you will indeed obtain chlorine gas at the anode.</div>

But the adjective "concentrated NaCl(aq)" implies that the molarity of Cl- greatly exceeds OH- ions, possibly by more than 100 times (since OH- is present in very low molarities in a relatively non-alkaline solution at initial conditions; reduction of protons at cathode notwithstanding).</div>
              <div class="name">Consequently, at such differing molarities, Cl- would have a greater oxidation potential a compared to OH-, and oxidation of Cl- at the anode occurs.</div>

              <p>5. So I suppose carboxylic acid is more acidic than alcohol.</p>
              <p>Let's see, because of the oxygen (highly electronegative) that is double bonded to the carbon, increase the extent of the negative charge of the carboxylate ion, thus stabilizing the ion in aqueous state.</p>
              <p>Alcohol has a ethyl group attached directly to the oxygen, dispersing the negative charge, thus destabilizing the alcohol ion.</p>

              <p>Sorry to ask but what sort of isomerism (of pentane) do these two exhibit?</p>
              <p>b) 2-methylpentane (branched chain) and c) 2,2-dimethylpentane (a cross shaped molecule with 5 carbons).</p>
              <p>They can't be functional group, structural or positional isomers, can they?</p>
              <p>Additionally, 'Alcohol has a ethyl group attached directly to the oxygen, dispersing the negative charge, thus destabilizing the alcohol ion.' is wrong as the positive inductive effect of the electron donating alkyl group will actually intensify the negative charge on the O atom, making the conjugate base ion for ethanol less stable. I think. :p</p>

              <p>2-methylpentane and 2,2-dimethylpentane are not really isomers of pentance since they differ in the number of carbons and that by itself does not make them isomers. Rather, they are just different types of alkanes. </p>
              <p>The answer as given in the book d which is a cycloalkane has the general formula simiar to that of an alkene which is in a way something totally different from alkanes and the more odd 1 out in the 4.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, i do not agree with the use of the word isomers in the question since that is wrong to me.</p>

              <p>Aluminium chloride is a well known example of a compound that is predominantly covalent but with ionic character, due to the relatively small electronegativity difference between aluminium and chloride.

              <p>8) Find the number of moles of Cr2O3 in 76g and multiply it by the Mr of Cr. Should be an easy question</p>
              <p><strong>I got 52 but there's no 52 in the multiple choices answer. Relatively easy but the answer are really driving me crazy and making me doubtful of my knowledge.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>9) Reduction is a loss of oxygen, gain of hydrogen or decrease in oxidation number.</p>
              <p>Ag(0) - Ag (+1) <strong>So why is it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ag</span><sup>+</sup> 0 instead of +1</strong><br>N(0) - &gt; N (-3)</p>
              <p>Maybe you should get a new book since this seems to be loaded with a number of errors in their questions itself.</p>
              <p><strong>Then I wouldn't recommend this book published by EPH Pte Ltd, author is Bob Ryan - O Level Chemistry guide (Orange in colour).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I thought EPH books should be quite good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></strong></p>

              <p>I would have got 52 as well and i don't think Cr2O3 has water of crystalisation etc and it would be pathetic if there was and the question didn't mention. Whats the available answers?</p>
              <p>Sorry, i see the question wrongly and thought it was Ag + Cl and not Ag+ Cl- .</p>
              <p>Thats makes it Ag (+1) -&gt; Ag (+1) and no change at all cos its not a redox reaction at all. No change to the final answer anyway.</p>
              <p>Why are u using an O's guide? I thought you were already done with O's</p>

              <p>Yup, I got 52 too. Means that book is screwed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Waste my money.</p>

              <p>You entering uni to do chemistry? Which uni?</p>
              <p>Unfortunatley i'll have to say most of the things you study in O's A's turn obsolute very fast once you enter Uni since its sort of a different level and sad to say alot of the earlier information becomes redundant cos what they teach u isn't use that much in uni.</p>
              <p>Sad to say being a chemistry undergrad, i would say half the things you been asking you might not really see or touch on in uni which is partly why i don't really know some of the answers or i should say won't be used by you within your 1st 2 years of chemistry degree education :p</p>
              <p>An eg is the electronic configuration. O's study it as 2,8,82 etc while A's study it as spdf. The 2,8,8,2 etc is more to make it eaiser to understand but after that everyone uses spdf and thats the same for quite a number of topics from the O's and A's syllabus.</p>
