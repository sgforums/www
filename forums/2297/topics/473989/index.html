              <p>I think at this point in time, you should try to work towards the requirements that the other forumers have kindly given.</p>
              <p>But do not also forget that education is more than just a means to the end. Education never really stops even after you graduate and education may not just be found in the formal education sector.</p>
              <p>Therefore you should also keep an open mind towards learning, e.g. stats, arts, social science, engineering etc etc. Interests may be uncovered when you least expect as well.</p>
              <p>A well-rounded doctor, who also has good E.Q, will always be a welcomed addition to society, more so than one who is just very good in surgical practices.</p>
              <p>Still, good to know that you have a target to work towards. You can also up your ante by trying to secure a scholarship if you can. </p>

                  <p>And you will be fighting with people from the top JCs who all have perfect As, simplyy perfect scorecards. You will need to be perfect in your academics. And also, please remember to get your NYAA Gold membership, it's important to show the people interviewing you and you have a passion for serving the public, and at the same time have perfect academics.

              <p>Dr Richard Teo Keng Siang's story @<a href="http://www.heavenaddress.com/Dr-Richard-Teo-Keng-Siang/424153/379719/content"> <br>www.heavenaddress.com/Dr-Richard-Teo-Keng-Siang/424153/379719/content</a></p>
              <p>A very meaningful speech by Late Dr Richard Teo, R.I.P. <br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLkfADe17s">www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLkfADe17s</a><br>å¼ åº†ç¥¥åŒ»ç”Ÿ - å…³äºŽç”Ÿæ´»ï¼Œè´¢å¯Œï¼Œæˆ�åŠŸå�Šå¹¸ç¦�çš„å‡ ç‚¹æ€�è€ƒ ï¼ˆä¸­æ–‡å­—å¹•ï¼‰</p>

              <p>What really brought me joy in the last 10 months was interaction with
               people, my loved ones, friends, people who genuinely care about me, 
              they laugh and cry with me, and they are able to identify the pain and 
              suffering I was going through.</p>
              <p>I was being trained as a doctor, to be compassionate, to be able to empathise; but I couldn't.</p>
              <p>As
               a house officer posted to the oncology department at NUH, every day, 
              every other day I witness death in the cancer department.</p>
              <p>When I see how they suffered, I see all the pain they went through.</p>
              <p>I
               see all the morphine they have to press every few minutes just to 
              relieve their pain. I see them struggling with their oxygen breathing 
              their last breath and all.</p>
              <p>But it was just a job. I do it, I get out of the ward, I can't wait to get home, I do my own stuff.</p>
              <p>I
               did not know how they feel, not until I became a patient. And, if you 
              ask me, would I have been a very different doctor if I were to re-live 
              my life now, I can tell you, yes I will. Because I truly understand how 
              the patients feel now. And sometimes, you have to learn it the hard way.</p>

              <p>If many other healthcare professional careers, any other healthcare workers', paramedics' jobs are of no interest to you/ don't respect them in their healthcare careers, then you are not so right-mind/ suitable to be in the healthcare sector <em>anyway</em> since they are all saving human lives and helping people.</p>
              <p>Other than just medical doctors alone, every other healthcare workers are step-by-step links interlocking in the patient care chain. We just hope that in the near future, you are just not yet another stuck up/ snobbish medical doctor (or another job, in case if you can't get in) who look down on others.</p>

              <p>The <strong>Hippocratic Oath</strong> is an oath historically taken by <a title="Physician" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician">physicians</a> and other healthcare professionals swearing to practice medicine honestly. It is widely believed to have been written by <a title="Hippocrates" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>, often regarded as the father of western medicine, or by one of his students.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The oath is written in <a title="Ionic Greek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek">Ionic Greek</a> (late 5th century BC),<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> and is usually included in the <a title="Hippocratic Corpus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a>. Classical scholar Ludwig Edelstein proposed that the oath was written by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pythagoreans" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreans">Pythagoreans</a>, a theory that has been questioned because of the lack of evidence for a school of Pythagorean medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Of historic and traditional value, the oath is considered a rite of 
              passage for practitioners of medicine in many countries, although 
              nowadays the modernized version of the text varies among them.</p>
              <p>The Hippocratic Oath <em>(orkos)</em> is one of the most widely known 
              of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear upon a 
              number of healing gods that he will uphold a number of professional 
              ethical standards.</p>
