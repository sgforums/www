              <p>3 would be wrong since same Mr means same number of H and C which would make it similar to 2 and 4. Do note that empirical and molecular formulas are not the same so 1 and 2 are not the same.</p>
              <p>I would choose 1 as the answer since % is just used to calculate empirical formula and 2 compounds having the same empirical formula can have different molecular formulas.</p>
              <p>Eg. C2H4 and C4H8 will have the same empirical formula but different molecular formula, molecular mass and structural formula.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>C should be correct for this question. Nitrates will give off NO2 when heated strongly i believe. (long time never did such expts)<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>As fermentation occus, the glucose is broken down to ethanol and there are byproducts being formed such as CO2 if i didn't recall my biological chemistry wrongly so the losses of CO2 causes the molecular mass of the compound to decrease as the compound now has less 1 C and 2 O.</p>

              Group 1 metals (with the exception of Li; think about why?) do not sufficiently polarize and distort the nitrate(V) anion electron charge cloud to allow for decomposition.
