              <p>Hi, I need help from the more experienced people on how to help a student go from a fail grade to at least a B3 in O level physics and Amaths. The student is now in sec 4 and has not been doing well for quite some time already. I think drowning the student in problems after problems is not a good idea (at least for physics), for firstly it is route learning and secondly the student might just hate the subject more? Given that there is not much time left to the 'O' levels, I cannot think of any fast paced methods other than to have mostly route learning and lesser understanding.</p>
              <p>What sort of advice/tips should I give to the student? And what efficient methods of teaching should I use to garuntee reasonable grades?</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance! And sorry if I posted what other people might have already asked countless times!</p>

              <p>You have to catch which area he is weak in in physics ,get him to memorise key definition and attempt tough physics paper and O level Papers</p>
              <p>Give him an insight how he/she should answer in accordance to Cambridge</p>
              <p>Do not let him/her feel demoralised ,just tell things will change,</p>
              <p>like i know my classmates got c6 for prelim but B3 for O level</p>
              <p>this is the way as a tutor should be ,encouraging and inspired</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe can PM me and we share ideas thru msn or something</p>
              <p>i teaching physics also</p>

              <p>I can't really help you out on physics, but as for A. Maths, it is mostly building up on E. Maths and questions-munching.</p>
              <p>The student must learn to work hard regardless of whether he likes the subject or not, as he must understand that he does not have a choice in taking the "O"-lvls or not, but he has the choice to enter a better JC/Poly or an average one.</p>
              <p>If you make the student memorise the work instead of understanding it, if he ever panic in the exam, he will sure die, as everything will fall out of his brain. This is no joke.</p>
              <p>Besides encouraging the student and praising him when he do reasonably well, you should also let him understand the importance of "O"-lvl. It is not just nagging and nagging, you should tell him to think about his future career, and which path he wants to take after the "O"s.</p>
              <p>For Physics and A. Maths, the best way to score reasonably well is to focus on the 'common' topics, meaning those which always appear. Looking at the pinned-up threads on this forum might give you a better idea.</p>

              <p>1. Identify what is causing the student's poor result.</p>
              <p>It could be many reasons. Careless? Lazy? Lack of encouragement? Dun understand the concept well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Suggest a solution and design a learning method for that particular student.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. AAR. After action review. See whether the newly implemented method works on the student or not.</p>

              <p>So I guess I will start out by doing baby questions from the TYS first, to identify his weaknesses which I think is the root of the problem.</p>
