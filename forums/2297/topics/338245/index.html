              a stronger educational programming in these schools where all students

              In addition, it will also reduce the waiting time for some ‘O’ level

              The common holiday periods of 1 week each in March and September, 4
              weeks in Jun and the remaining weeks at the end of the year, will
              enable families with children studying in different educational levels

              <p>The H2/H3/H1 system and syllabuses, is unique in the world, only Singapore has it. No other country in the world (including USA and UK) takes the H2/H3/H1 syllabus, they all have a more standardized 'A' level syllabus, even across examination boards (ie. the 'A' level syllabus for Cambridge, Oxford, AQA, EdExcel (the 1st 2 are UK, the last 2 are USA) are almost all the same, and quite significantly different from the H2/H3/H1 syllabus that Singapore candidates experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All of this is thanks to the farsightedness of the Singapore Government, who has decided that being extra kiasu in training our students, will give Singapore a competitive edge over other countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Subjects wise, the H2 syllabus differs most significantly from the rest-of-the-world 'A' level syllabus, for Biology (and to a lesser extent, for Chemistry and Physics).</p>

              <p><br>That's a very accurate picture of what happens in every JC. Which is why a <a href="/users/124947">supportive tutor</a> who is willing to encourage the student to truly understand and appreciate the science for what it really is (regardless of silly syllabus limitations) can be tremendously helpful to the student's enjoyment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, not everyone has the time or money or opportunity for tuition. But how it goes on in schools, both secondary schools and JCs, doesn't look like it's going to ever be changing for several reasons :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) MOE teachers are severely overworked (but again, 'tong ren bu tong ming', just like in the SAF, for instance, some pple slack, some pple kena crap-work all the way. So *many*, not all, MOE teachers are severely overworked. Others just backstab to take credit, for instance). So they won't have the time or energy to give every student full support, like a private tutor can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) The syllabus, curriculum and system, is superficially results oriented, rather than true results oriented. True results, includes the student truly understanding and enjoying the process, so that he/she may have the motivation to contribute to humanity with his/her own unique insights, research and exploration. But being superficially results oriented, the JC teachers feel their priority is just to get students to blindly memorize to get marks. A good tutor, has the time and opportunity to help students to understand and enjoy at the same time as also memorizing to get full marks. </p>

              <p>3) There are many teachers out there (both Sec sch and JCs), who do not themselves have a healthy mindset or attitude towards teaching and the students' learning. Every teacher, like every human being on this planet, is unique. I've met many colleague teachers whom I disagree on their teaching (content, method, style, etc). And students from other classes have said they wished I was their teacher instead. (this isn't so much about ego or advertising, it's to make a point - there are all kinds of teachers (just as they're all kinds of doctors, psychologists, philosophers, religious pple, etc), it's errorneous to overgeneralize to say most MOE teachers are horrible, or most MOE teachers are wonderful. They are individuals, with all individual kinds possible.) </p>

              <p>how many people are going to end up in bio-med science, bio-engineering?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>By that reasoning, the syllabus doesn't really matter, whether old 'A' level or new 'H2', because arguably, University (and internship, or industrial attachment, or on-the-job training) is where the true learning (eg. for medicine, engineering, etc) begins.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But the new H2 Biology syllabus is at least more interesting than the old 'A' level Biology syllabus. What's unfair about the new H2 syllabus, is that it tries (and fails miserably) to syncretise 'A' level syllabus with University syllabus, and the result of it is JCs just photocopy University textbooks and dump them on students as notes to memorize. An insanely ridiculous, and unproductive to understand, unwieldly amount of crap to memorize.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last year, Cambridge folks came down to the JCs to check out their JC Notes used for the new H2 syllabus. As far as H2 Biology was concerned, their findings was that all the JCs were simply kiasuingly dumping on their students waaay too much details which would never be actually required in the H2 exam. But the JCs will continue their kiasu ways. Because they're kiasu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, as far as you (students) are concerned, focus on your own future. Plan for yourself, your career path, and work towards that now. Be in medicine, engineering, psychology, business, proactively seek out more learning, employment and career opportunities now. If you don't start to plan for your own future and take care of yourself, the Universe can't do much to help*.</p>

              <p>*It's like this story of the religious man who was drowning in a flood. He had to climb onto his roof, but the rains continued and the water levels were rising rapidly. A rescue boat came by and said, "Climb aboard, we'll save you!". But the religious man said, "No need. I'm praying to God. He will save me." So the boat left. The waters continued to rise. Then a rescue helicopter came by, "Climb aboard, we'll save you!". But the religious man said, "No need. I'm praying to God. He will save me." So the helicopter left. The waters continued to rise and was now up to the man's neck. A UFO came by and the aliens said, "Climb aboard, we'll save you!". But the religious man said, "No need. I'm praying to God. He will save me." So the UFO left. The man drowned shortly thereafter. In the afterlife, he met God, and cried, "God! I prayed devoutly to you! Why didn't you save me? How could you forsake me?!?". To which, God replied, "Well let's see. I first sent you a boat, then a helicopter and then a UFO. Duuuuuuuude."</p>

              <p><br> That's a very accurate picture of what happens in every JC. Which
              is why a <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/124947">supportive
              tutor</a> who is willing to encourage the student to truly
              understand and appreciate the science for what it really
              is (regardless of silly syllabus limitations) can be
              tremendously helpful to the student's enjoyment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, not everyone has the time or money or opportunity for
              tuition. But how it goes on in schools, both secondary
              schools and JCs, doesn't look like it's going to ever be
              changing for several reasons :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) MOE teachers are severely overworked (but again, 'tong ren bu
              tong ming', just like in the SAF, for instance, some pple slack,
              some pple kena crap-work all the way. So *many*, not all, MOE
              teachers are severely overworked. Others just backstab to take
              credit, for instance). So they won't have the time or energy to
              give every student full support, like a private tutor can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) The syllabus, curriculum and system, is superficially results
              oriented, rather than true results oriented. True results, includes
              the student truly understanding and enjoying the process, so
              that he/she may have the motivation to contribute to
              humanity with his/her own unique insights, research and
              exploration. But being superficially results oriented, the JC
              teachers feel their priority is just to get students to
              blindly memorize to get marks. A good tutor, has the time
              and opportunity to help students to understand and enjoy at the
              same time as also memorizing to get full marks. </p>

              <p>Hi,<br><br>  Our H1/H2/H3 may be unique in the world but there is a similar system with a different name in UK, i.e. AS/A/AEA (Advanced Subsidiary/Advanced/Advanced Extension Award). The basic idea for introducing this approach, I believe, is to create diverse learning paths for students with varying learning abilities. This is rather desirable. Such an objective may look great on paper but the approach may not deliver good results if implementation is not properly carried out by teachers who just teach students to pass exams :P</p>
              <p>  There is hope if some teachers care for what students take away from their lessons :) Let me share with you a positive true story that took place during one of my lessons.</p>
              <p>  H2 maths student: Cher, why must X, Y be independent in "Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)?"</p>
              <p>  Me: If they are not, the result will not hold, as we will have something called a covariance of X, Y.<br><br>  H2 maths student: My 'cher never say that leh. Ask us to memorise only. Can you go on to explain?<br><br>  Me: Erm, that's out of syllabus. Since you are interested to know, I just mention simply. Covariance is a quantity that establishes a relationship between random variables X, Y. You will study that if you continue further education in university. At our level, we will just need to know that the covariance of X, Y is zero when X, Y are independent so that we have the result in your school notes.</p>
              <p>  H2 maths student: I can relate better now...I go share with my friends can?</p>
              <p>  Me: Better do that. Knowledge is always out there waiting to be shared.</p>
              <p>  H2 maths student: No leh, different schools do different things to outdo one another.</p>
              <p>  Me: What to do? Competition in Singapore is stiff mah.</p>
              <p>  H2 maths student: Still, we can share what?</p>
              <p>  Me: Then you start loh.</p>
              <p>  H2 maths student: Must ah!</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
