              <p>You will have to learn to cope without friends around. In future, you all will still split up in JC/poly/uni and work as well. Learn to be more independent and be able to do things on your own. You do not always have a chance to decide the people you work with in future so you'll have to learn to work with all sorts of people in future.</p>
              <p>Friends etc are still in the same school with you so you can still hang around them during recess and after school etc if you miss them.</p>

              <p>Yup, simply because they are ahlians doesn't mean you have to take extra care to stay away from them. The most important thing is to remain yourself, and not follow whatever they might do blindly. You don't have to act ahlian just to fit into their cliques.</p>
              <p>As for reading..there is really nothing to be afraid of. Project your voice, enunciate clearly, and take extra care to pronounce words that are multisyllabic in nature. Also remember your "th"s, like "this", "that". Singaporeans tend to pronounce it as "dis" and "dat".</p>
              <p>That is all I can remember. Technically speaking, reading aloud should be a natural thing since it has been incorporated into primary school education, i.e. oral reading examinations.</p>

              <p>Don't get distracted by your peers. Your future is faaaaaaaaaaarrrrr more important. Focus on doing well in your studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, if you're the type easily influenced by peers, it would be prudent to hang out with (make friends with) others who are similarly like-minded who realize the importance of doing well in your studies for the sake of your/their future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make it a point to encourage your friends (the ones you choose to hang out with) to have as a focal point of your interaction, your studies. Friendly competitiveness for studies, but with willingness to help/tutor/support each other in your work/assignments/tests, can go a long way toward helping you focus on your studies, and significantly contribute to your results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, what do you mean you're distracted by Ah Lians? Distracted because you're feeling sexually attracted to them (regardlesss of your own gender), or because they make too much noise with their cacophonous (some would say 'melodious') chatter so you can't focus on listening to the teacher?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming the latter, you can always ask your form and/or subject teacher to allow you to sit in front of the class. Explain to them you feel you need to be near the front to concentrate, and they will mostly be supportive of your good learning attitude.</p>

              <p>This is something I do when I've to memorize chunks of text for presentations, not sure if it would work on reducing the effects of nervousness, but it does help in reading.</p>
              <p>Grab a piece of text, and recite it in front of the mirror. If you stumble over a word, mark it with a pencil, skip it and continue on with the passage. Re-read the entire passage while taking great care to pronounce the words marked earlier on properly. A full-stop warrants a 1 second pause; 0.5 seconds for a comma.</p>
              <p>As for them being distracting, I can understand what you are going through especially when you are trying to concentrate. I had a classmate throw eraser bits at me for an entire semester, just so you know. Just block it out, and concentrate on the task at hand. If need be, approach your teacher after school/during break time to clarify your doubts. You can also make use of this opportunity to raise the issue of your classmates being too distracting during lessontime.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Regarding reading aloud, speech, accents and pronunciation, you might find it helpful to watch videos that provide exposure to properly enunciated English, in a variety of accents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point, isn't to 'show off' speaking English in some foreign accent, but to find some fun, to enjoy the process, of speaking English. It is always an entertaining bonus, if you're versatile and able to speak in a variety of accents. Any intelligent person (Singaporean or otherwise) will know how to appropriately switch registers (ie. use a different accent or style, when speaking to different people).</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Be mindful of your feelings.</p>
              <p>  Recognise that it is only natural for you to<br>  - feel lost,<br>  - get distracted,<br>  - become nervous<br>  in those situations.</p>
              <p>  Instead of reacting negatively, find concrete ways to change your responses so that things may become better.</p>
              <p>  You can become a better individual by being proactive and positive.</p>
