              <p>The question says that a solid W is formed, that glows. As far as I know, a reaction between magnesium and steam produces magnesium oxide and hydrogen. And in this reaction a "glow" is seen. Since magnesium is about the only substance I know that glows in a reaction, I chose that as the answer. I didn't know CaO glows! Haha. Anyway, may I know how you can identify the right choices smartly when you meet such ambiguous questions?</p>

              <p><br>Any substance, when hot enough, glows (some of the heat energy is transformed into light energy). And the question states "at high temperature".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel the question is ambiguous, you'll have to state all possible answers, conditionally. See the 1st post of my thread here (<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/320107">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/320107</a>).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for questions in which you have unknown compounds A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc, and are asked to identify them, you'll have to use elimination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on the info given in the question, start thinking of all possible compounds that could be A, B, C etc, and as you consider the rest of the info, start eliminating the possibilities until you end up with the most likely answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, you were right that it could be mangesium (carbonate, oxide, hydroxide, etc), but the last sentence of the question reveals it to be calcium. So you eliminate magnesium (or barium, or whatever other metal it could possibly have been, from the earlier info in the question).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Qualitative Analysis (Q.A.) is a fun topic, and the questions are like puzzles for you to solve. Of course, in order to have fun with them, you must first be familiar with your "identification of cations, anions and gases".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Organic Chemistry (O.C.) can also have similar questions, of unknown compounds X, Y, Z, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, one fun question I give my students :</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;    "></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;    "></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;    "><span style="color: #000000;">Compound A liberates carbon dioxide gas with calcium carbonate, but produces only a small percentage of carbon dioxde gas (when reacted with calcium carbonate) as compared with hydrochloric acid (of the same molarity as an aqueous solution of A). Compound B decolourizes acidified potassium manganate(VII). Both compounds A and B have a molar mass of 74g each, and both compounds contain only 3 elements. When an equimolar mixture of A and B is boiled (together with a few drops of sulfuric acid as catalyst), an equilibrium mixture is obtained, which contains a new compound C, which is sweet smelling.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;    "></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;    "><span style="color: #000000;">Draw compounds A, B and C.</span></span></p>
