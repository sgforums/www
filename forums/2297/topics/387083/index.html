              <p>Hey all!</p>
              <p>I just finished my NS and is enrolling to NUS accountancy in Aug. Since it's still far from Aug. I plan to do some study on my own b4 uni starts, however not exactly sure what kind of course I could attend.</p>
              <p>I was doing a little research online and saw this CAT (Certified Accounting Technician) that could be done in a quite short period of time. however I am not sure is this CAT going to be useful to me?? since I am going to study a degree in Accountancy..</p>
              <p>And the more research i did the more I realise I know little about Accounting carreer path.. there seems to be a lot of programmes like ACCA, GMAT and so on.. (I only know that usually after uni acct degree ppl will go for ACCA, but tt's all i noe... so..)</p>
              <p>I really wish I could use this time b4 uni to do something constructive.</p>
              <p>Any advice (on CAt or anything related to accountancy exp or career path and so on)is appreaciated! pardon me for my poor english. tyty~</p>

              <p>NTU Acct is still better than NUS :p</p>
              <p>It would be better for you to work instead since i don't think most of the short courses will overlap too much with uni courses while ACCA etc though possible to do without degree are easier to manage after you have obtained a degree.</p>

              <p>When I talk about the basics, I am referring to the accounting equation and double entry system. No matter what level you talk about N, O, A or tertiary... this is an essential aspect of accounting. If you master this before you start lectures and tutorials, I dare say you have more mental time to digest other aspects of the subject matter such as the proper treatment for specific transactions? It is akin to not having to worrying about whether (2)(3)= 6 when you are differientating y = 2x^3. Isn't it harder to differientate if you are unsure about what (2)(3) is?</p>
              <p>Well, things might have changed since I studied in NTU accountancy more than a decade ago. Maybe they decided not to use the accounting equation and the double entry system as it is outdated after centuries of usage?</p>
