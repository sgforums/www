I shall use a straw as my illustration.<br><br>For example, if one holds a straw in the air without sucking it or sumthing, there are already air particles coming in and out of the straw. However, the rate of air molecules coming in must be the same as the rate of air molecules coming outso as to maintain the atmospheric pressure of 1 atm.<br><br>If now, I place one end of the straw in my mouth and I suck it, covering the hole on the other end. I am taking away air from the straw, and thus the pressure too. There is a pressure difference now and hence the straw is compressed by external forces.<br><br>Now, if I move my hand on the left and right such that there is a small hole at the end of the straw, air will quickly go into the small hole to fill up the vaccuum. A sucking sound will be heard. Pressure inside the straw will increase.<br><br>What I get from this illustration is that, since there is this small hole in the partition and there is an initial pressure difference of p between the two parts, similarly, air will rush in from Part B to Part A until an equilibrium is reached when pressure difference bet Part A and B is zero. <strong>And if I am not wrong, this equilibrium refers to the steady state in eagle qn. </strong><br>However, the total pressure for Part A and Part B will be higher.<br></div>

I have forgotten by making the straw illustration, I have made an assumption that the temperature is constant. I apologise for the mistake. Anyway, I am thinking that with regards to the above mentioned eqn, how cum v on both sides are the same since temp is different? Please kindly enlighten me.<br><br>Or is it a case of water tank? Imagine the air molecules as volume of water in the tank. Pardon me for the poor illustration.<br><br>For part B, I attach a tap to pump in water to it and for part A, I attach another tap for drainage to it.<br><br>If Part B is heated up from 300K to 600K, it is like pumping in more water into Part B. Pressure in Part B will increase by 2 times as shown in Ideal Gas equation assuming that the gas is ideal. While thinking abt this illustration, I will like to ask whether the temperature of Part A of the vessel is strictly at 300K.<br><br>2 Scenarios<br><br>1. If Part A temp is strictly at 300K, it means that something is there to cool it. Using the water tanks illustration, it is akin to putting a drainage tap onto Part A. Water will be pumping in to Part B, flows to Part A and drains out. Hence, there will be a constant pressure difference between the two parts.<br><br>Regards to the experiment, if Part A temp is strictly controlled at 300K, the flow of faster molecules at B to A is higher than the flow of slower molecules at A to B. Thus, like what you have said earlier, heat is lost and gained by external sources. Thus, there will be a constant pressure difference.<br><br>2. If Part A temp initially is at 300K, and there is nothing to control it. Using the water tanks illustration, water is pumped into part B. There is a initial pressure difference. Hence, water will gush into part A. Volume of water in A increases rapidly at first but becomes slower to the end.<br><br>Regards to the experiment, if Part A temp is not strictly controlled, similarly to the case above, the flow of faster molecules at B to A is higher than the flow of slower molecules at A to B. Think abt this. Faster molecules at B to A and meanwhile there are also slower molecules in A to B. Molecules get heated up at B. Overall, the average K.E of the molecules is higher. Thus, by right, the temp of Part A will also increase since average K.E. in A is higher now due to higher temp environment in B. There will still be a pressure difference. However, it will not be constant anymore. It will be like a y= 1/x curve. The pressure difference will be high at first then, it got slower at the end.<br><br>Lastly, pardon for the long reply.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> And thanks for the wonderful qn that makes all of us think.<br><br></div>
