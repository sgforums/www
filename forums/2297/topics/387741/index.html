              <p>I've received O Level results today. Now I dont know which Jc i should apply for.</p>
              <p>I've got 8 points after the cca deduction(-2).</p>
              <p>I live in eastern part of Singapore so I wanna go to one of JCs near Bedok ~ Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>But the problem here is I can't find a suitable Jc from those jc in this area.</p>
              <p>I wanted to go to Temasek JC science but its COP is bloody 6 points man. Then I have Meridian and Tempines to choose from. But I don't wanna go to Tampines JC. So I've been left with Meridian actually.</p>
              <p>Now I looked for more jcs in other areas which are suitable for my points. I found St. Andrew's JC. But it's bloody far from where i live now. So I kinda need to decide on either Meridian or St. Andrew's JC now.</p>
              <p>So my 1st choice is Temasek ( for appealing) 2nd choice either meridian or st andrew's.  </p>
              <p>Knowing that i won't be successful in appealing with academic results, I'll appeal to Temasek JC with CCA , though. Can anyone give any tips in appealing using CCA? And I'm going to appeal with experience in a concert band i think.</p>
              <p>So the question here is either Meridian or St. Andrew's. Which JC do you think is the better?</p>
              <p>Pls help me out here. I'm kinda stuck here.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>hi. i shall try to help u.</p>
              <p>appealing with cca... u can appeal using cca if u are outstanding in cca..like represent sg in sea games or band major in band, or student council chairman in student council...then maybe u stand a chance... or other things that are outstanding.</p>
              <p>if u ask me i think saint andrews is better. my fren studied there b4, he enjoyed his stay there...so..yea...up to u to believe.</p>

              <p>hey firstly congrats on ur good results. having gone thru jc i would suggest u go to MJC. why?</p>
              <p>1. Proximity to ur house : this is a very important factor. shuttling between home and school can be very tiring if your school is far. been there done that. use to stay at Clarke Quay area but study at Jurong JC. u will be damn tired after reaching home from school in the end, no energy to do revision.</p>
              <p>2. MJC teachers i would say push their students more as compared to SAJC. The school academic system i would say is very good in ensuring students are always on their toes when it comes to academic results. </p>
              <p>3. unless ur key appointment holder in ur CCA, can forget about appealing via CCA. nt very effective i would say.</p>
              <p>just my 2cents tots..hope it can give u some inspiration on which jc to choose. =)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have to agree with what most people say here. MJC is a mugger school. And they are proud of that fact. That is why they all do so well. I don't know much about SAJC's A level results but it is true that they are very "happening". But I know of a friend who did well too in there. But since you live in the East, I would advise you to go to MJC. Travelling the distance leads to fatigue and that plays a huge factor when you go to school and come back from it...</p></div>

              <p>It appears many students are having a similar dilemma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another forum thread, I just posted :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The less time you spend travelling, the more time you have for your homework, study and for yourself. Besides, you'd have less risk of being late (eg. traffic jam) during the crucial exam periods.<br><br>There is also another 'advantage' of going to a JC that's significantly 'below' your personal academic performance (as indicated by your L1R5), would you rather be the 'worst of the best' or the 'best of the worst'? (or put in another way, 'small fish in a big pond' or 'big fish in a small pond'?). Which would be more self-encouraging for you?<br><br>Ultimately, it's all about personal self-motivation and self-discipline. Yes environment matters, but nowhere as much as personal self-motivation and self-discipline matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go for the JC that's nearer your home. Time is a luxury you can't afford to waste during your 2 short JC years.</p>

              <p>I agree on the part about self-discipline and self-motivation. But I would say that in the teenage years, the peers will play a very important role in one's academic performance because of the wanting to be part of a group. I actually think it's better to go to the 'best' JC that one can get into.</p>

              <p>I will not say that is definitely impossible, but your niece's chances of entering Accountancy in a local polytechnic is extremely low.</p>
              <p>You may wish to have a look at the cut-off points for each polytechnic here:</p>

              <p>hi guys i need help in choosing JCs also T_T I die die also wan to go to Science stream.</p>
              <p>my L1R5 is 9 and after CCA bonus deduction, it will be 7. I'm kinda stuck between MJC and TJC even though I probably can't get into TJC. Here's my subject results:</p>
              <p>English: B3</p>
              <p>Pure Physics and Chem,POA: A2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Combined Humanities, Emath and Amath, Chinese: A1</p>
              <p>Both JCs are kinda near my house. Taking just one bus near my block will reach TJC. As I live in Simei, I can just reach Pasir Ris MRT station quickly to the Pasir Ris Bus Interchange to take a bus to MJC also...So, TJC is considered nearer..</p>
              <p>But I prefer to be a "big fish in a small pond", somemore many of my friends choosing MJC. MJC's math department looks fun too...</p>
              <p>So, should I  try to go into TJC or put it as my 1st choice? I scared MJC don't let me in if i did not put it as my 1st choice... :/ my cousin say it might happen.</p>

              <p><br>Put MJC as ur 1st choice. Forget TJC. There will be many pple with L1R5 exactly on their c.o.p. appealing in (with stellar CCA or other performances). If your L1R5 isn't exactly on the c.o.p., appealing is useless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least putting MJC as ur 1st choice should get u in, with ur L1R5 score.</p>

              <p>gt this urban legend that if u nv put as 1st choice, den the posting will be screwed up and u'll go to your like last choice or smth.</p>
              <p>regarding big fish small fish theory, depends, somehow i think the company matters.</p>
              <p>maybe u shld discuss with your friends also? maybe they have this dilemma also.</p>
              <p>all the schools are gd schools... my friend had 6pt and he went MJC... no big deal... è¿˜æ˜¯ä¸€æ�¡å¥½æ±‰ï¼�</p>
              <p>don't choose sch purely based on distance factor, you can also ask ur seniors who are there how the school is like generally, whether your friends are oging there (it helps to have some company to adjust initially), so that if at the end you regret going there, u wun blame yourself "orh just because i lazy i anyhow choose nearby one" den gg.</p>
              <p>make a good decision! =)</p>

              <p>hey firstly congrats on ur good results. having gone thru jc i
              would suggest u go to MJC. why?</p>
              <p>1. Proximity to ur house : this is a very important factor.
              shuttling between home and school can be very tiring if your school
              is far. been there done that. use to stay at Clarke Quay area but
              study at Jurong JC. u will be damn tired after reaching home from
              school in the end, no energy to do revision.</p>
              <p>2. MJC teachers i would say push their students more as compared
              to SAJC. The school academic system i would say is very good in
              ensuring students are always on their toes when it comes to
              academic results. </p>
              <p>3. unless ur key appointment holder in ur CCA, can forget about
              appealing via CCA. nt very effective i would say.</p>
              <p>just my 2cents tots..hope it can give u some inspiration on
              which jc to choose. =)</p>

              <p>i guess you dont know sajc well enough...</p>
              <p>students are being driven more intensively with each new year as the principal is nothing like the previous one (who paid more attention to CCAs)</p>
              <p>its rather sad to see so many people out here who are so damn ill-informed about sajc</p>
              <p>however i do agree that mjc does drill its students hard</p>
