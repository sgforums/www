              <p>Actually the government's policies are already very lenient. our local universities are already relatively easy to get in already.  they accept like 20% -30% of the entire cohort. in fact, i think they should limit to 10% or less. because if everyone has a degree, then the importance and privilege of having a degree is reduced greatly. the worth of certificates is less. so please don't complain. i'm not pro-government, i'm just saying that if you work hard, there's no reason why you can't even get into the basic universities </p>

              <p>for other universities like SIM for example, they do not enjoy the experience of SMU students. i.e. seminar style teaching and world-class professors. it's true that students from other universities can  speak well, but speaking well and rationally with persuasion is something which distinguishes nus, smu students from the rest of the smaller universities</p>
