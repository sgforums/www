              <p>Lol i get A1 for geography and C5 for history same lv as sec 2... funny huh but i hate remembering all the past item for history i mean remember for what? what the use... learn other people past and apply them to our lifes? School already teach us right and wrong and yet we still have to learn history for example japanese hit SGP is wrong... all this everyone know what. What crap is all this abt.</p>
              <p>i think to score well not only must u have the knowledge but also the ability to write them down in perfect english tone convincing the marker that you have a good knowledge on history tt how i impress the teacher for geogrpahy. this also applies to ur geography.</p>
              <p>You know i used to called history as his story infront of tt teacher because I hate it and trying to telling him tt we are actually memorising his story. Dun be like me okay? Although i scored rather well for SA1</p>

              <p>Wah Rednano u teacher? Sound so profounded.</p>
              <p>Well I must agree with u rednano. History is needed and to be learnt for the sucess of ourselves. But in my opinion learning history is useless and pratically applying them in real life is not so much of use. U see how many times do we look back at our forefathers whether this thing is done correctly or wrong? Very seldom isnt it?</p>
              <p>Let me give u an example, I am currently secondary 2 and study maths and just finished the algebra topic. Do we ever say things when we purchase item say I want to factorise 2 potatoes and 8 sweet potatoes. We pratically do not apply them in life! So I really dont understand why are we learning all this and all this is compulsory in MOE syllubus. If u are an teacher I will hope that u will feedback this to MOE.</p>
              <p>Recently Cambridge has gone stricter. My teacher say one, they now want u to write statement and reason but the past A and E math O level paper dun have all this! I mean wtf do we have to write reasons? Just working will be enough right I mean how many percentage of the time do u do a working out of luck. Kind of extremely rare isnt it? Help me feedback to MOE abt this too if possible.</p>

              <p>Algebra is used in almost all higher level maths topics and have a much much greater usage than what you have learnt in sec 2 or even the entire O's. Do not underestimate the use of it just because you are not using them to do word problems or any type of problems that seems applicable in life to you.</p>
              <p>If you are strong in maths, you should know what you are doing and not be getting answer out of pure luck or at least some idea what you are doing if not its quite surprising you can get much marks in your maths paper if you depend on luck.</p>
