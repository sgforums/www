              <p>Heyy guys, so as you've probably known from my thread title, I have just collected my "O" level results and I am currently contemplating between Pioneer and Jurong JC, and I need some help clearing up any queries before finalizing my choices. Before I go on any futher, here are my results.</p>
              <p>English : B4.</p>
              <p>Chinese : B3.</p>
              <p>Elementary Mathematics : A2.</p>
              <p>Additional Mathematics : A2.</p>
              <p>Biology : A2.</p>
              <p>Chemistry : A2.</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities (SS, H) : A1.</p>
              <p>Principles of Accounts : A2.</p>
              <p>CCA : A1.</p>
              <p>L1R5 (without CCA reduction) : 13.</p>
              <p>L1R5 (with CCA reduction) : 11.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, travelling time. I'm living near Chua Chu Kang, and obviously Pioneer is closer to my house (5 minutes walk), rather than Jurong JC, where I have to take the MRT (CCK-&gt;Jurong-&gt;Boon Lay) everyday. This is, of course, one of my concerns. But if Jurong JC is better for me, then I would consider it.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I have read about this Sirius Scholars' Programme available in Pioneer JC. I'm very interested in this and would like to know more regarding the requirements to get in. (COP minimum - I heard that it was like 11..? or certain grades on certain subjects). Also, I would like to know more about this Programme, for example, what do you experience or participate when you're involved in it. Pioneer JC attracts me mostly because of this course (simply because if I do get in, I get to experience something (ie, overseas study trip, CIP, ect) that others don't, and of course, this gives me an advantage when proceeding to University). I do know that there's this Scholars' Development Programme in Jurong JC which is similar in nature to Pioneer's Sirius Programme, but I don't think that I would be able to get in with my measly score...</p>
              <p>Thirdly, subject combinations. I was intending to take up H2 Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and either H1/H2 Economics. But for Jurong, in order to take up H2 B,C,M,E, I would need to meet the requirement of having a L1R5 of 10 or less (which I have not met). And for some particular reason, there isn't a subject combination for H2 B,C,M, and H1 Econs. (but there is for Physics, ie, H2 P,C,M and H1 Econs). For Pioneer JC, what I have gathered is that there isn't any pre-requisites for any subject combinations. I'm not sure about this and I need someone to clear this up.</p>
              <p>Another thing, I'm also interested in taking up H3 Biology, because I really do have an immense interest in Biology (I'm going to take up Biology courses in University anyway, so this should put me in good stead). I understand that both JC offers H3 Biology. But for Pioneer JC, I would be able to take up university-taught courses such as NTU Molecular Biology, and Research courses such as NUS-MOE Science Research and NTU Science Reseach. Of course, this sounds a lot better and more exciting than studying Proteomics (H3 Biology) in Jurong JC. There isn't any pre-requisites stated for the above in the JAE Information Booklet, except taking up H2 Biology (for NTU Molecular Biology), and either H2 Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics (any 2), for NUS-MOE Science Research and NTU Science Research. Is it really that easy to get in? I mean, no COP minimum or a certain minimum grade for a certain Science or Mathematics subject? I need someone to compare which H3 Biology course is better (in Jurong or Pioneer), and also clear up the pre-requisite questions above. Oh and, is taking up a H3 subject really tough? I seem to hear people complaining about it everywhere. o.O</p>
              <p>Another important thing is the quality of teachers, facilities, good conduct, ect, in each school. Without a doubt, it will directly affect my studies and I need feedback from actual students themselves (or anyone that knows anything about this).</p>
              <p>Lastly, there is a good lot of enrichment activities in Jurong JC (eg, Overseas Experiential Learning Programmes, Entrepreneurship Programme, Character and Leadership Development Programme, International Talents Management Scheme, Research and Development Programme), which sounds interesting (and likely to put me in good stead) wheres those of Pioneer JCs' bore me, no offense o.O. (eg; GP Enrichment Talks, Night Study Programme, Arts and Aesthetics Programme, ect). Anyway, those are found in the JAE Information Booklet and there might be more which are not stated. And also, not all of the above are for everyone (might be restricted to certain subject combinations). Thus, I need some advice on this.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm intending to go to a good overseas university (no kidding...) in the future and of course I would like to know everything there is to put myself in the best light possible. I need someone to break it down for me section by section, and of course,  advice me on which JC would put me in better stead when poceeding to University.</p>
              <p>Also, I'm not sure about the admission system for Universities. I mean, what is the maximum amount of subjects that we're able to take in JC, and how many subjects are actually included in the calculation of our scores (eg, in Secondary School we have L1R4, L1R5, ect,), and how does the calculations works (I mean, there's H1, H2, H3, which one does the system takes? I read somewhere that if you do take up H3 subjects, they will convert it to that of H2... someone please explain, or provide a link, because I can't really find it).  </p>
              <p>Of course, I'm still open to choices currently, and I might consider other JCs (if they have something better than my current choices).</p>
              <p>I'm sorry if I have bombarded you with my string of questions above, and thanks in advance for helping a lost person. :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>In reply to: Also, I'm not sure about the admission system for Universities. I mean, what is the maximum amount of subjects that we're able to take in JC, and how many subjects are actually included in the calculation of our scores (eg, in Secondary School we have L1R4, L1R5, ect,), and how does the calculations works (I mean, there's H1, H2, H3, which one does the system takes? I read somewhere that if you do take up H3 subjects, they will convert it to that of H2... someone please explain, or provide a link, because I can't really find it).</p>
              <p>  H1 subject - 'A' grade is 10 points. H2 subject - 'A' grade is 20 points.</p>
              <p>  Consider taking the norm combination, i.e. GP, MTL, PW, 3 H2 subjects and 1 H1 contrasting subject. These give a maximum of 100 points.</p>
              <p>  No point thinking about H3 subject as that is offered later in JC 1, when a student shows potential in excelling the subject, say from his/her MYE showing.</p>
              <p>  Every school will give a detailed briefing to incoming JC 1 students concerning the above, so do not worry.</p>
              <p>  Make the right choice of JC first, good luck!</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>
