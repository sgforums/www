              <p>May I ask serveral questions to clarify?</p>
              <p>From what you have writen, I can tell that there are two groups of students. 1) Those who qualify for A-maths and read the subject with school's resources, and, 2) those who did not qualify for A-maths, but where able to read A-math (privately, without school resources). Is this what you are trying to say?</p>
              <p><strong>Allocation of precious resources</strong></p>
              <p>Regarding about the criteria (to get an average of 75%), there is this criteria because of the school's limited resources thus only offer A-maths to students who are above average achievers because 1) students are likely to cope with the additional subject better, 2) precious resource are allocate to students who can perform in the exam and this explains why so much resources are focus on the top 25% of the corhort in good schools.</p>
              <p>And to register for GCE O Level Mathematics, the school set a criteria such that, a student should attain a pass in all subjects and pass in A-maths for the Secondary 3 End-of-Year exam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>My view on this issue is</strong></p>
              <p>The school may want to discourage students who are unable to or could not handle additional subjects not to take up A-maths. The student will then be able to make use of the available time to focus on weaker subjects. Stress during O level exam period is inevitably high, so it could affect any student. If the student is doing poorly for the other subjects because the student had A-math, then it will not do the student good.</p>
              <p> Advice to you, have an open mind be willing to look at all side of the coin. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> A coin has 3 surface.; top, back, and edge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may wish to escalate this matter to the cluster superintendent. For more information, please click <a href="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/schoolclusters.asp">here</a>.</p>

              <p>1.  to address the first question ask, there are actually 3 groups of students. <br>the first type of student is those who qualify to be in the top 2 classes which is under the resources of having an additional mathematics.</p>
              <p>the second type of student is those who fulfill the "the school set a
                                      criteria such that, a student should attain a pass in all subjects
                                      and pass in A-maths for the Secondary 3 End-of-Year exam." Those student are not allocated any classes in additional mathematics and will have to SELF STUDY on their own.</p>
              <p>the third type of student is those who cannot fulfill the above requirement. Apparently, from what I have known, there are about 12 student who cannot fulfill the requirement, either they did not passes all the subject or fail additional mathematics. Either way, most of them in those group are good at mathematics scoring A1 in E maths but is rejected. <br><br>I have spoken to two of the students in the third type and tutor them before. Both are really good at mathematics. One of the students told me that he is going to take it during poly days. <br><br>My question here is that why is it that Additional Mathematics is not offered to those who are good in mathematics but to those who can score well farely well in all other subject not related to mathematics. <br><br>The reason you gave was what the school had replied. I understand that having an additional subject will posted more stress on a student but if the student was love the subject and are able to score well in that area. Why isn't he given a chance? <br><br>What those two students request is not asking the school to allocate resources to teaching them. They are just asking for a chance for them to take O level additional mathematics in O level. But what their HOD and principle reply was, if I had to let you take this subject, many others will follow and that will be too troublesome to handle. They kept saying that they had to be fair to others. But have they really be fair to the students?</p>
              <p>According to my students, the criteria that they set in secondary 2 does not have enough students to enroll and they compromise the criteria to let some of those student to enroll in the classes. One of my tuitee told me that he is just behind by 1 mark. <br><br>If passing all the other subjects was a criteria, why this is not imposed on the first two classes student. And even passing all those harsh condition, students are not even allocate resources to help them in additional mathematics. No classes and expected the student to continue hiring tutors. </p>

              <p>I don't quite get the point as well.</p>
              <p>Are you saying the school did not allow this group of students to attend A Maths lessons in school, so that some of these students were doing A Maths from private tuition?</p>
              <p>According to my knowledge, it is not possible. School students can only sit for the examination of a subject in O levels if the school allows them to do so. Will the school allow them to sit for the paper in O? If yes, won't this practice ruin the performance of the school; If no, how can the school tell the students to do A maths privately but in the end, not allowing them to take?</p>

              <p>Ok, sorry now I understand, so you mean all students had no formal A maths lesson in sec 3, and only those who cleared the end of year exam in sec 3 would be allocated to an A maths class in sec 4.</p>
              <p>This is another possibility other than what you have stated: the school may only have 1 teacher who is qualified to teach A maths, and the workload will be unbearable if the teacher is to teach several classes from both levels at the same time... So the school has to practise it until it gets a new teacher.</p>

              <p>Yah. Sometimes it was even spread to CCA, which is tragic, when students can't choose to do the things they enjoy outside the classrooms. </p>
