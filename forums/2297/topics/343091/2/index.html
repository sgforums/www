              <p><br>Yo HipHop (owner of this HomeWork Forum, in case some of you guys are new here), so you're doing Biomedical Engineering, which I see from SP's website says will prepare its Biomedical Enginnering diploma holders for "<strong>healthcare industries</strong> such as hospitals, medical equipment manufacturing, servicing and sales companies, and medical research centres."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you learn all about "theory and application of sensors, biosensors, biopotential electrodes, measurements of biopotential signals including electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG)", how to interpret "vivo signals generated from skeletal &amp; muscular, cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory and urinary systems", and to operate "equipment used in 'Operating Room', 'Intensive Care Unit', 'Radiotherapy', 'Cardiology', 'Neurology' sections, physiotherapy and rehabilitation departments".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all this, HipHop can produce, direct and star in his own medical drama series which takes place in SGH, "Dr HipHop" (ala "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Seasons-1-4-Collection/dp/B001AV3BY0/">Dr House</a>"). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm still in secondary school. How come that's not listed? Or is this a thread restricted to the homework gurus? <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> I just get on once in a while to beg for homework help.

              <p> </p>
              <p>"Seniority has its priviledges!" Heh, just kidding lah. I didn't include that option only because, initially, I started this thread to ask specifically only a couple of individuals that I know are either JC or working adults, but I wasn't sure which. But I later decided it was a good idea to open up this thread to everyone else to share about themselves, but I just didn't change my initial options.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, all of you here (the fact that you come to HomeWork Forum, eager to do your homework and progress academically) will surely move on beyond 'O' level qualifications soon, so everyone on this forum who are currently secondary school students, you are in truth JC-&amp;-Poly-&amp;-University students in-waiting! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Engineering Diploma ^^ &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not revealing which field of engineering eh? It's ok, I can understand why you have a shroud of secrecy (macham I.S.D.) about yourself, afterall, your name is...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Yo HipHop (owner of this HomeWork Forum, in case some of you guys are new here), so you're doing Biomedical Engineering, which I see from SP's website says will prepare its Biomedical Enginnering diploma holders for "<strong>healthcare industries</strong> such as hospitals, medical equipment manufacturing, servicing and sales companies, and medical research centres."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And you learn all about "theory and application of sensors, biosensors, biopotential electrodes, measurements of biopotential signals including electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG)", how to interpret "vivo signals generated from skeletal &amp; muscular, cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory and urinary systems", and to operate "equipment used in 'Operating Room', 'Intensive Care Unit', 'Radiotherapy', 'Cardiology', 'Neurology' sections, physiotherapy and rehabilitation departments".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all this, HipHop can produce, direct and star in his own medical drama series which takes place in SGH, "Dr HipHop" (ala "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Seasons-1-4-Collection/dp/B001AV3BY0/">Dr House</a>"). <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Ahh, first person on this thread to post his blog urls (two blogs, too!). And his first post on SgForums, too!</p>
              <p><br>Hello Doc (say, what's your PhD in?), welcome to SgForums! You're a lecturer in which American University? Lecturing in which subjects?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your blog appears to indicate your subjects to be Physics + Chemistry + Biology + Mathematics + Economics + History. You've multiple degrees in multiple disciplines? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, you've a nice post here about multiple disciplines :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><em>One of your colleagues is measuring the temperature of a plate of metal placed above an outlet pipe that emits cool air. The result can be well described in Cartesian coordinates by the equation<br><br><em>T(x,y)=k((x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>)</em><br><br>where <em>k</em> is a constant.<br><br>If you were asked to give the following function, what would you write?<br><br>T(r,<span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span>)=?</em></blockquote>
              <p><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; The above is a problem whose answer tends to distinguish engineers and physicists from mathematicians. An engineer or physicist who works regularly with polar coordinates is likely to give the response <em>T(r,<span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span>) = kr<sup>2</sup></em>, a result obtained by assuming the variables are related by the familiar polar to Cartesian relation <em>r<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></em>. A more mathematical colleague is likely to respond, <em>T(r,<span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span>) = k(r<sup>2</sup> + <span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span><sup>2</sup>)</em>. The function is defined mathematically by saying, “Add the squares of the two variables and multiply by <em>k</em>.” <br><br>The engineer will object. “You can’t add <em>r<sup>2</sup></em> and <em><span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span><sup>2</sup></em>! They have different units.” The mathematician might reply, “No problem. I see what you mean. You just have to change the name so that each symbol represents a unique functional dependence. For example, you could write <em>T(x, y) = S(r,<span style="font-family: Symbol;">q</span>) = kr<sup>2</sup></em>.” Unfortunately, your more concrete friend (imagine a chemical engineer at this point) is still unlikely to be satisfied. “You can’t write the temperature equals the entropy! That will confuse everything.”<br><br>Many engineers, physicists, and mathematicians are surprised by this story. Each side believes that its way of using equations is the “obvious way” and that surely even a mathematician (or an engineer) would agree. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Each group strongly prefers its own interpretation of how to write an equation.<br>These two examples dramatically illustrate that in science and engineering, we tend to look at mathematics in a different way from the way mathematicians do. The mental resources that are associated (and even compiled) by the two groups are dramatically different...using math in science requires the blending of distinct local coherences: our understanding of the rules of mathematics and our sense and intuitions of the physical world. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, another interesting post of yours about a Mythbusters' episode on Diet Coke + Mentos :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The Mythbusters correctly identified potassium benzoate and aspartame as key ingredients in the Diet Coke–Mentos reaction. (Static water) Contact angle measurements were used to show that these ingredients reduce the work required for bubble formation, allowing carbon dioxide to rapidly escape from the soda. The small amount of caffeine in Diet Coke is unlikely to contribute significantly to the reaction. <br><br>2. The Mythbusters also correctly identified the roughness of the samples as one of the main causes of the reaction. The importance of sample roughness was shown by comparing SEM and AFM images of the samples to the explosive power of the reaction. Increased surface roughness implies a higher surface area to volume ratio, meaning that more growth sites should be present on per unit volume.<br><br>3. Samples which encounter less viscous drag and hence fall more quickly through the soda will cause a more explosive reaction. Also, for the same amount of mass lost, the eruption will be more dramatic when the reaction takes place over a shorter time. <br><br>4. Finally, hotter beverages result in a more explosive reaction. (A direct illustration of Henry's law and Le Chatelier's Principle) &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
