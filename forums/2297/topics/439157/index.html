              <p>Simplified Chinese Character is culturally deficient as it destroys a lot of Chinese cultural meaning. So learning it can only rely on memory work. Unlike Traditional Chinese Character, you can still make out the pronunciation of it through some radicals éƒ¨é¦– using the technique of å½¢å£° (loan of sound , i.e. taking the pronunciation of some radicals) and even writing the traditional Chinese character can be done using a construction of the radicals éƒ¨é¦– by meanings (which does not rely on memory work). But in simplified Chinese character, it simply isn't possible or in fact quite difficult. Ironically, Simplified Chinese character just makes Chinese more difficult to learn. Learning traditional Chinese character is on the contrary easier (athough there are more strokes).</p>
              <p>For your case, to read those simplified Chinese words you don't understand, there is no other way except check dictionary more often for its pronunciation (pinyin) and its meaning.</p>

              <p>languages are complex and dynamic, esp chinese.<br>there is no 1 + 1 = 2 rule<br>i cant say all æ��æ‰‹æ—� is related to hand/arm actions<br>i cant say all ä¸‰ç‚¹æ°´ is related to water<br>i cant say all è¨€å­—æ—� is related to talking/speech <br>as characters went thru a lot of revolutions, they may not be relevant<br>but <em>most</em> can still be <em>inferred</em> by æ—�ï¼Œè¾¹ï¼Œä¸Šï¼Œä¸‹ï¼Œé‡Œï¼Œå¤–<br>may not be 100% accurate but shd be about there bcos u need to have knowledge of tt term first before u can infer.</p>
              <p>sometimes a word/term can be a noun, an adjective, a verb, depends on wat context, wat sentence structure.</p>
              <p>this character match with other characters will form diff meanings<br>(one char is å­—, 2 or more char together form a è¯�)</p>
              <p>even at my level, im still always learning new words and taking initiative to check dictionaries and the net</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>nowadays the news got chi subs. <br>u can listen to how they pronounce and match with the words.<br>every nite 15 mins will do (those not so important news no need to listen is ok)<br><br>they go a bit fast sometimes but u just need to get used to it.</p>
              <p>generally, a local sec 3 student can oredi understand most of the terms used in local chinese media <br><br>but i found tt recently they kinda use quite a few big words and words not acquired into our standardised usage yet. due to trying to follow China........<br>any realised Australia is no longer æ¾³æ´² but æ¾³å¤§åˆ©äºš? New Zealand changed from çº½è¥¿å…° to æ–°è¥¿å…°......<br>but it's ok, tts oni like maybe 3.543134% of the whole news.</p>

              <p>stick to ur textbooks (if any) and readings and ç¬”è®° (hope u at least copied some during lesson)<br>burn and put in water and drink it all up. of cos not literally.<br><br>(and refer to my suggestion previously)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for compo, write in short simple sentences.<br>try not to think in english first then translate to chinese as the syntax is different</p>
              <p>i dont want to go into the theory. here's some examples.<br>How are you? --&gt; ä½ å¥½å�— (subject goes in front). <br>There is a school near my house. --&gt; æˆ‘å®¶é™„è¿‘æœ‰ä¸€æ‰€å­¦æ ¡ã€‚<br>The school is near my house --&gt; å­¦æ ¡åœ¨æˆ‘å®¶é™„è¿‘ã€‚<br> <br>and not every english term has an equivalent in chinese (as well as other languages)<br>and sometimes one term can have many equivalents due to locale or context. like bicycle can be è„šè½¦ï¼Œè„šè¸�è½¦ï¼Œè‡ªè¡Œè½¦<br>internet used to be ç½‘é™…ç½‘ç»œï¼Œ taiwan call ç½‘è·¯ï¼Œwe now call it äº’è�”ç½‘<br>blog is éƒ¨è�½æ ¼ or å�šå®¢ï¼Œ some places use ç½‘å¿—<br>rice -- before cook is ç±³, cook liao become é¥­<br>and since chinese not good oredi, u most prob wun wat the term is in chinese<br><br><br>it's ok if u dont use big words or cheem phrases. as long as u can express properly, u at least get a good pass.<br>memo a few "standard phrases" to use. mainly for intro and conclusion.</p>
              <p>to expand your vocab and make sure u remember, try writing the terms on a piece of paper (preferably post-it) and stick it around the house<br>write Fan é£Žæ‰‡ feng1 shan4 and paste on your fan<br>write Laptop/Notebook ç¬”è®°åž‹ç”µè„‘ bi3 ji4 xing2 dian4 nao3 and paste on your notebook<br>so u know wat tt thing is called. <br>other items/nouns not tangible in your house, just write and randomly paste on the walls<br>everyday u walk past, look and read and remember.<br>and everytime u learn a new word, write a new piece and paste.</p>
              <p>quite glad tt u recognise the importance of the chinese language for future career use<br>but business chinese is another matter altogether<br>and if u are toking abt going to work in China or work with the China Chinese, it's again another story<br>so, u need a good foundation in the lang itself plus the initiative to keep on learning and remembering<br>bcos if u dont use it regularly, it will be eroded<br>even i will oso forget some words sometimes </p>

              <p>i know u are trying to learn it the technical way<br>but this method can oni get u to a certain level (which is like, pri 4 standard oni)<br>and it's only one part of the whole lang system<br></p>
              <p>there are many exceptions as 1 character can have a few meanings (å¤šæ„�å­—)<br>and some characters are "borrowed" to use as something else<br>like "è¢«" is blanket<br>but we use as "been, being" as syntax<br>the apple is being eaten by her. --&gt; è‹¹æžœè¢«å¥¹å�ƒäº†</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one word can have a few sounds too (å¤šéŸ³å­—), and of cos, diff meanings</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not just the character alone bcos it will not make sense<br>u need to know the term (è¯�) and how it fits in the sentence (context)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, if u are comfortable with this way of learning and is confident tt it will help u for your papers, then go ahead. </p>

              <p>I think Fireice means 10,000. 4K in pri and 6k in sec. Chinese isn't a major sub in JC, they don't expect much improvement from sec sch standards, just maintain. I personally didn't give a shit, I don't do what I'm made to do except on pain of imprisonment.</p>
