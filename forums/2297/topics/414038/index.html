              <p>Hey guys, i'm a JC1 student, just received my promo results, and found out i'll probably get retained. Not sure if there is a chance for conditional promotion but most probably i doubt so..</p>
              <p>So i was thinking, i never really got used to the JC environment, i have to be honest i only started studying a month before my promos, and everything was from scratch, i did improve quite a bit but it was not enough, consistency was what was required from the start and that was not the case with me :(</p>
              <p>So i was thinking..</p>
              <p>1) should i continue with JC? I know if i work harder i will make it through, but it's another 2 years, and 2 years of NS topped with that is 4 before University :(</p>
              <p>2) should i take private A's? And if so, where? I heard about MDIS, i'm really keen on knowing more about it from you if you've ever been a student of it or if you had a friend who was..</p>
              <p>I know either option i take, it all boils down to my on discipline and how i work hard next year,i'm really determined to do so. i regret starting to work hard too late this year but i've learnt my lesson. I would really appreciate some suggestions, and also a bit of information regarding private 'A' levels since i don't really know much about that.</p>
              <p>thanks alot guys :)</p>

              <p>Take it as a lesson learnt.</p>
              <p>Just remain in your current JC, and work your ass off next year. Heck, make use of the upcoming holidays to revise your Yr 1 work so that you can wallop the next batch of students next year.</p>
              <p>No point going to MDIS or anything like that..... it'd certainly be more expensive, and I'm not sure what their standards are like.</p>

              <p>"i have to be honest i only started studying a month
                                      before my promos"</p>
              <p>This was the main problem. 1 month is not enough; this is JC. You need even more discipline when you go to uni, so do treat this as a learning experience.</p>
              <p>What subjects did you take? And what's your grades???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My suggestion is if you want to continue with A levels, it would be better to stay in school for another year; you did not even do J2 work yet. Work hard at being consistent this time round, and get help when you need it.</p>
              <p>Another suggestion: start revising now. The school might consider letting you have a re-paper to determine if you should retain; but that's on their sole discretion. You can ask for it, but don't expect much.</p>
              <p>Study hard now, talk to your teachers about your concerns and plans, and your possible actions, talk to your principal if necessary. That's the best way to attempt to salvage now. All is not lost yet.</p>

              <p>Like I said, let your Day 1 start from when the holidays start.</p>
              <p>Revise your work over the holidays so that you will have a head start when you redo your Yr 1 next year. That's the best thing you can do.</p>
