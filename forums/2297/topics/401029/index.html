              <p>Jc is like secondary school, but at a higher level of course, poly is 3 years, less stress maybe, perhaps. If you work hard, it doesnt matter poly or JC.</p>

              <p>JC = Advance O level, u learn about maths, eng, chinese, physics, science again, at a higher level.</p>
              <p>Poly is really depending on wad course u choose, im taking engineering course, and i still learn maths, physics, electronics, electrical stuff</p>
              <p>Poly is not stress until u get projects, group works, etc etc. Every lab session in my course is counted towards my overall GPA, so u can say the stress is distributed out, only sometimes it accumulates. SOmetimes a few test in one day, then stress free for a few more weeks, then exam again</p>
              <p>There is a lot of debate over whether diploma is better or A level is better, but i believe no point arguing about it</p>

              <p>If you are talking about dip or a levels, dip is better. Look at the newspapers alllooking for dip. Gpa must be maintained over 3 years, if you work hard its no problem. But having a a level would be better in some cases like tuition teaching for example.</p>

              <p>So if you like medicine,take some course about science then,
              biomedical science works as well. Ifyou want medicine, need full gpa,
              or at least very good, 3.8 at least. Recomendation letters from your
              teachers, good cca records, a port folio of yourself maybe also, and a
              interview.</p>
              <p>anyway just to add on, the difference of 2 years and 3 between them. If you are willing to work harder for 2 years, choose jc</p>

              <p>End route of poly is a job in the industry, getting into a Uni is ususally not the primary focus.</p>
              <p>End route of JC is only getting into the Uni.</p>
              <p>The main idea here is getting clear of what you want to do with your life, once you figure it out, choosing will be easier because some courses are only available in Uni and some exclusively at poly. Some job you are aiming needs a degree, some needs a diploma, etc.</p>

              <p>The main idea here is getting clear of what you want to do with your life, once you figure it out, choosing will be easier because some courses are only available in Uni and some exclusively at poly. Some job you are aiming needs a degree, some needs a diploma, etc.</p>

              <p>It really depends on what you want</p>
              <p>If you are already very sure on what you want to do, (eg chemical engineering, or a certain course), you can go to poly. BUT you must be VERY sure. Because once you choose that certain course in poly, you will have to take similar courses in uni. (for eg, if you take engineering in poly, it would be diff to change to business in uni). You must also take note that there are those with good O level results who go to poly route. So those popular courses are taken up by them. So if your results are not good enough to get the course you want but you can go to JC, I would advise JC.</p>
              <p>However, if you are not sure, then you can go to the JC route. The advantages are that, (if you take a science course), you can go to almost any course you want in uni, including arts courses. I must say JC is tough academically, but it is a sure way to uni if you are not too bad. Over 90% of JC students can enter uni in avg JCs.</p>
              <p>One thing to note, the 2 years in Jc and 3 years in poly doesnt really matter when you go to uni. If you take the same course in poly and uni, you can skip the first year and go to the 2nd year. In the end its the same. But this does not apply to all courses. You have to check carefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Erm I think its quite confusing up there so I would summarise in the following points.</p>
              <p>Choose poly if:</p>
              <p>1) You are very sure of your course, (you wouldn't want to regret later)</p>
              <p>2) Your O levels results are good enough to get the most popular courses (of course must be the one you want)</p>
              <p>Choose JC if</p>
              <p>1) You are not very sure of your course yet</p>
              <p>2) You want to go into Uni</p>
              <p>Common misconceptions:</p>
              <p>1) Poly is slacker than JC. (Wrong, if you want to go uni. You still need a near perfect GPA in poly to get into popular courses.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I see that you are interested in the medical field. If you want to be a doctor, I would recommend JC. If you want to make medicine (pharmacy i think), you can choose the poly route with related subjects, but I think JC would still be better. Same reason, higher chance.</p>
              <p>Note: I am not against poly people or what, but from what I heard, statstics show that currently, there are more JC grads entering uni than poly grads.</p>

              <p>To be qualified as a doctor, one requires either a MBBS or a MD from a recognized medical school. MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery; it's like a double degree though only 1 degree is conferred.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's better to go to a JC. I've got qualms with regards to teenagers having a few peircings, dying their hair etc.</p>
              <p>The standard pay difference for a diploma graduate and a university graduate is visible</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A first: Poly grads accepted into NUS' medical school<br></span></strong><em>Two chosen out of 32 from polytechnics who applied for admission</em><br><em>By Jane Ng<br></em><br><strong>THEY OPTED FOR POLY ROUTE: Mr Ng and Mr Soong both qualified for JC but chose to enter Ngee Ann poly.<br></strong><br>FOR the first time, two polytechnic students here have been accepted into what is possibly the toughest university course here to get into - the medicine faculty of the National University of Singapore (NUS).<br><br>The Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, which will take in 250 aspiring doctors this year, received 32 applications from poly students and selected Mr Soong Jun Wei and Mr Ron Ng, both 20, from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br><strong>Mr Soong graduated with a diploma in biotechnology, while Mr Ng, has a diploma in biomedical laboratory technology.</strong><br><br>Unlike junior college (JC) students, who apply with A-level results, <strong>poly students are assessed on their poly results and O-level grades.<br></strong><br>But like all other applicants, they had to take an essay test and go through two rounds of interviews.<br><br>On Mr Soong and Mr Ng, an NUS spokesman said: 'Their outstanding academic track records, coupled with their strong interest in research and their achievements in co-curricular activities, set them apart in the selection process.'<br><br><strong>The medical school spokesman said they had been been exploring the idea of admitting poly diploma holders for some time, and it recently approved 16 diplomas, including physiotherapy, biomedical science and nursing, from the various polys.</strong><br><br>It was Ngee Ann's biotechnology course that convinced <strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Soong, who qualified for JC with nine points for his O levels, to opt for the poly route.</strong> 'I didn't get to take biology in secondary school so I wanted to do it in poly,' said the youngest child of a production supervisor and housewife.<br><br>It was not easy initially, recalled the former Fuhua Secondary student, who hopes to specialise in orthopaedics in future.<br><br>'The lecturer talked about the fundamentals of cells, and everyone seemed to understand because they were nodding their heads. That was when I realised I had to work very hard to catch up,' he said.<br><br>For Mr Ng, being in a polytechnic pushed him to work harder. 'I knew the chances of poly students entering university were slim, so I pushed myself to do even better,' said the younger son of a taxi driver and secretary.<br><br>The former Outram Secondary student<strong> had qualified for JC with an O level score of 10, but decided to focus on his passion for biology as 'being in a JC would mean having to take other subjects as well'.<br></strong><br>He had his heart set on medicine and made it his only choice in his university application, confident that his industrial attachments at polyclinics and hospitals would give him an edge.<br><br>Welcoming the duo's admission into medicine, Dr Sushila Chang, Ngee Ann Polytechnic's director for the school of life sciences and chemical technology, said: 'Our education is broad-based and there's depth. They do a lot of team work and research projects - all skills needed in medicine.'</p>
