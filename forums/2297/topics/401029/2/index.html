              <p>If you do well to maintain your GPA (Grade Point Average) over staggered exams over a 3-Year period as compared to 1 single major A-Level exam, you can even get direct 2nd Year entry into a local university... For foreign university, it's either 3rd Year direct entry or Final Year.</p>
              <p>The GPA (Grade Point Average) are also used in universities. It's the norm.</p>

              <p>Actually its wrong to say poly is not as stressful as jc. Both institutions are equally stressful. It depends on each individual as to how far they want to go or can go. If they are slackers, no matter where they go, life is as free as the wind! </p>
              <p>If you want to go poly, then to uni. It is not impossible. Just ensure that your GPA is 3.6 and above. Otherwise, its pretty difficult. In fact, according to my circle of friends, i feel that universities have opened up much more places to poly grads as compared to my seniors with comparable results. </p>
              <p>For people who talked about hands on being more in poly. It only applies for certain courses. I'm from a Poly Business school. As compared to my engineering counterparts, I don't feel like we engaged in a lot of hands on. In fact majority is more of the theoretical parts. </p>
              <p>So do look more specifically into your learning style and interest before deciding whether poly or jc would be better for you. </p>

              <p>Haa. It does work the other way round too. There are poly grads who has people with degree working under them. It depends on the company culture. I know of companies who trust a lot of ppl with a dip-uni (even if its from SIM) rather than A lvl - Local uni. These are the companies that values experience more than certification. </p>
              <p>My advice to TS is go where you think is more suitable for you. Find out what is your learning style. If TS is lazy, she got bad A's results/ bad Poly results also won't make a difference. =P </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It does matter if you go poly or jc. In jc,
                  everything is based on individuals which is to say if you work hard, you would
                  probably receive good results. However, this is not the case for poly students.
                  In poly, you have to complete lots of project works. If your group has some
                  lazy people whom always never do their part and you do not wish to compromise
                  your GPA grade, you will end up doing all the works. This is common in poly as
                  this has happened to many of my poly friends, maybe any current poly student
                  could share your views on this.</span></p>

              <p>Poly is lepak if you do not study and just target for less than 3.0 GPA to get into workforce or just take up SIM in future.</p>
              <p>Considering your ambition is biomedical, I think going JC is a much better path for you. You just got to have no life and stick with it for 2 years =)</p>
              <p>Poly again might be lepak, stressful during projects, there are other factors to consider such as environment and the type of friends/people you will meet. Some friends in poly might just bring you astray in my opinion, not the right company that you want if your ambitions is high.</p>

              <p>I'm repeating this again, applies for engineering degree.</p>
              <p>The main disadvantage of going from poly to uni (if u going uni) is that you will not get to score on the easier first year modules to build your uni GPA. Your GPA starts from the 2nd year modules, which are tougher in nature as compared to the first year modules which have been skipped. For poly guys, after NS, the content in the first year modules, some of which is required for 2nd year and 3rd year, will likely be forgotten.</p>
              <p>Yet if you decide not to skip the first year modules, you will be spending an extra year in studies. Especially for guys, this is a super disadvantage. Imagine pple in other countries graduate from uni at 21 yrs old.</p>
              <p>Either way, for the degree of engineering, poly would be a tougher route. It's not about the quality of any student, but the fact that the route is harder for poly grads.</p>
