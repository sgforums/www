              It's obviously trigonal planar, 120 degrees. Think of it as a ketone, with the 2 alkyl groups replaced by Cl atoms.<p>Best answer is to combine both, ie. <b>decomposition via elimination</b>. When in doubt as to which answer Cambridge wants, write both answers. As long as your answers don't contradict, Cambridge will credit the required answer, and ignore the other answer. BFJC ftw.</p>

                  What do you mean, "how does it undergo intramolecular nuclophilic substitution?". It undergoes because of the mechanism, that's how (by definition)!<p>If you mean "how do you know" then it's because the no. of C atoms in A and D are the same, and the degree of unsaturation increases by 1 (due to formation of cyclic ring), that's how you know.</p>

              Because adding equal volumes of both reactant solutions, doubles the volumes, hence halves the molarities of the aqueous ions.

              For A level purposes, the expected answer remains at 120 degrees, ie. Cambridge will award full credit (of 1 mark) for 120 degrees. In actuality, or at Uni levels, the bond angle in phosgene is 112 degrees, but Cambridge won't require this value for A levels.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Phosgene-dimensions-2D.svg"><br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene</a></p><p>At most, Cambridge may ask, "Suggest a reason for the slight deviation from the 120 degrees as predicted by VSEPR theory", to which there are several contributing reasons (beyond the A level syllabus), one of which is as you mentioned (the greater repulsion of the double-bond).</p><p>If the A level candidate wishes to incorporate such contributing factors that result in a deviation in the basic bond angles as predicted by VSEPR theory, the candidate (if he is exam-smart and wishes to safeguard his marks) must do so with a written explanation, first giving the basic bond angle of 120 degrees (with brief explanation), then make mention of factors which cause deviation, then suggest a concordantly modified bond angle.

                  The amide group isn't hydrolyzed in the reaction, rather the N-H group is being deprotonated, ie. removal of H+, leaving behind a uninegative formal charged N atom as illustrated in the question.<p>The mechanism is significantly beyond A levels. For A level purposes, use simple pattern recognition and mathematics. Based on the original reaction equation given, and based on the new reactants of ethanoate and methanoate ions in a 1:1 ratio, let A = H atom, B = methyl group, we mathematically obtain carbonyl molecules with AA, AB, BA and BB groups, hence we obtain a 1:2:1 ratio of methanal, ethanal and propanone. Notice that Cambridge isn't asking for an explanation, but merely "suggest the products formed and the ratio they're obtained".</p><p>KMnO4 oxidizes methanal to methanoic acid to carbonic(IV) acid, which decomposes into CO2(g) + H2O(l), with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change (since CO2(g) is gaseous), and as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle, since CO2(g) leaves the reaction solution, pulling the position of equilibrium over to the RHS.</p>

                      Singapore JCs often use electronegativity to explain the deviation from the basic bond angles of period 2 elements as predicted by VSEPR theory, when discussing period 3 elements. Other than cases involving electronegative F (eg. why NF3 bond angles deviate from NH3 bond angles), using electronegativity to explain the deviation is actually incorrect, or rather, only a secondary factor (Chemistry, being a microcosm of real-life, is multi-factorial).<p>The more important reason, is due to the significantly lesser extent of orbital hybridization (which requires energy, and thus only thermodynamically justified for less diffused valence orbitals of period 2 elements), due to the significantly lesser extent of electron-pair repulsions, due to the significantly more diffused valence orbitals (which the lone pairs reside in, or the bond pairs are formed from the overlap of) of period 3 elements.</p><p>Consequently, the atoms of period 3 elements use their mostly unhybridized orbitals for their lone pairs to reside in, and for overlapping head-on or end-on to form sigma bonds. In the case of C-S-H, the S atom uses it's mostly unhybridized p orbitals to overlap head-on or end-on to form its sigma bonds with the C and H atoms, as well as for 1 of the lone pairs to reside in, with the remaining lone pair residing in the mostly unhybridized s orbital. This results in the C-S-H bond angle (with 2 orthogonally oriented p orbitals used for head-on or end-on overlap with the C and H atoms) being close to the unhybridized p orbital bond angle of 90 degrees.</p><p>So you're partially right that it's about the size, though you'll need to elaborate (as I did) to secure your marks. Your school (and Singapore JCs in general) aren't entirely wrong, it's just that electronegativity isn't the most important contributing factor here (unlike in cases such as NF3 vs NH3).</p><p>However, all this discussion may be moot, because as far as A levels are concerned, Cambridge won't require the student to give any answer other than the basic bond angles as predicted by VSEPR theory for period 2 elements, ie. just state 104.5 degrees as if the S atom were an O atom, and include the usual explanation about the S atom having 2 lone pairs and 2 bond pairs, and that lone pair - lone pair repulsions &gt; lone pair - bond pair repulsions &gt; bond pair - bond pair repulsions, that would gain you full marks.</p><p> After writing the basic answer above, if you like, if you have the time, or if (unexpectedly, though I'd see it as a pleasant surprise) Cambridge specifically asks you to explain why the C-S-H bond angle deviates from the C-O-H bond angle, then you can elaborate further to why the C-S-H bond angle is actually less than the C-O-H bond angle, giving either my (more correct) explanation, or your school's (less correct) explanation, or both. But again, because asking this would be beyond the A level syllabus, it is rather unlikely for Cambridge to ask why the C-S-H bond angle deviates from the C-O-H bond angle for the actual A level exam (ie. your question, which you presumably took from your school's mid-year revision package).</p>

In this particular question, the forward reaction is more thermodynamically feasible than the backward reaction, but for the sake of elucidating J, we'll imagine the backward mechanism here.<p>Br- attacks C, NRH gets kicked out as NRH-, gets protonated as NRH2. Another Br- attacks the other C (of the R group), NH2 gets kicked out as NH2-, gets protonated as NH3. What's left behind is J, which includes the 2 Br atoms.

              In an octahedral complex, the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals have a higher energy level compared to the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals.<p>Since n = 4 (ie. 4 unpaired electrons) is calculated from the formula given, and since Cr2+ is [Ar] 4s0 3d4, it means that all 4 electrons of the Cr2+ ion are unpaired, which in turn means the Cr2+ ion in this particular octahedral hexaaquachromium(II) coordination complex must be high spin (ie. small magnitude of energy gap between d-d* orbitals). This is consistent with H2O being a (relatively) weak field ligand.</p><p>On the other hand, if the 6 ligands were stronger field ligands, eg. cyanide CN- ligands in the octahedral hexacyanochromate(II) coordination complex, then you would expect to calculate n = 2 (ie. 2 unpaired electrons), which means that all 4 electrons of the Cr2+ ion must occupy the 3 lower energy  dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals, which in turn means the Cr2+ ion in this particular octahedral hexacyanochromate(II) coordination complex must be low spin (ie. large magnitude of energy gap between d-d* orbitals). </p><p>To show the electron distribution in the transition metal within the coordination complex as required by the MJC question, check out the low spin vs high spin electron distributions for the Fe3+ (ie.

              Cambridge could use this question as a challenging (ie. A grade) A level H2 Chem exam question. Your submitted answers would score : zero marks and zero marks.

              Still zero marks. Your formula is wrong. From the graphical data given, you need to be able to ascertain the exact formula of the coordination complex.<p>Use M to represent the metal ion, and L to represent each ligand. Write the formula of the coordination complex in terms of M and L, and leave the ionic charge of the coordination complex as an unknown n-.
