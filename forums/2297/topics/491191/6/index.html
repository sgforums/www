              2 separate points :<p>The amino group is electron-donating by resonance, hence destabilizing the negatively charged sulfonate group in the conjugate base. In addition, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid exists as a zwitterion in aqueous and solid states, and because ammonium groups (ie. conjugate acid of amines) are very weak acids with small Ka values, hence zwitterionic 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is a much weaker acid than non-zwitterionic benzenesulfonic acid.

              Because it has been experimentally proven that the amounts of pure solids and liquids in heterogenous equilibria (that involve solvated reactants and products), do not affect the ratio of molarities of solvated reactants and products at equilibrium.

                  Because partial pressure = mole fraction x total pressure. As inert gases are introduced, the mole fractions of the active gases decrease, while the total pressure increases, hence mathematically cancelling each other out.<p>If you're asking why the position of equilibrium doesn't shift, it's because the molarities of the active reactants and products (of the reaction) doesn't change upon addition of inert gases, so neither Qc nor Kc changes, hence the position of equilibrium doesn't shift.</p>

              Not so simple. At O levels, everything is simplistically 'always'. At Uni levels, nothing is simplistically 'always'. A levels is between O levels and Uni levels, expect anomalies and having to examine case-by-case.<p>'Like dissolves like' is usually applicable for most cases, but the question can add in more variables to get you to discuss relative solubilities of a polar solute in 2 or 3 different solvents, all of which are polar (for example).</p><p>Not all ionic salts are soluble, hence you have Qsp and Ksp. But species like phenylammonium ions and phenoxide ions, are indeed more soluble than their molecular conjugate acid/base forms, due to ion - permanent dipole interactions which are stronger than hydrogen bonds (provided the formal charge is on a small period 2 atom).</p><p>Even if a molecule can form hydrogen bonds with water, it may not be very soluble, because of the non-polar parts of the molecule (eg. benzene ring) thermodynamically preferring to form van der Waals forces with the non-polar parts (eg. benzene ring) of the other solute molecules, while the snobbish water solvent molecules thermodynamically prefer to form hydrogen bonds with other water solvent molecules. Hence, aqueous solubility of alcohols decrease with increasing length of its non-polar hydrocarbon chain.</p><p>So once you see it as a beautiful complex spectrum of solubilities, rather than an oversimplistic black-and-white binary system of just 'soluble' or 'insoluble', you can let go of your frustrations and it will finally make logical sense for you.</p>

                              <p>Also e.g say when an amine is added into HCl, the solution

              the acid which permanently changes its chemical formula and not
              dissolving ? compared to maybe amine being dissolved in water which
              only forms hydrogen bonds with water and does not react. </p>

              Yes, it is reacting with the acid to be protonated, and it's formula changes from its conjugate base form to its conjugate acid form, and its conjugate acid form is more soluble than its conjugate base form, because ion - permanent dipole interactions are stronger than hydrogen bonding, as long as the formal charge is on a small period 2 atom.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone">Hormones may or may not be protein in nature</a> (H2 Bio students have an advantage over H2 Physics students for this topic). Only proteins are polymers of alpha-amino acids.

              Yo Gohby, good to have you back.<p>VJC/Prelim 09/P1/38, all 3 options are correct, including the ester, which as you pointed out will be hydrolysed to a carboxylic acid and a primary alcohol, which will be oxidized by the K2Cr2O7.</p><p>Apple juice qn : the given answer is correct, because as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle, additional H+ from the weak acid will dissociate to oxidize the Zn to Zn2+, and be reduced to additional H2(g).</p><p>DHS qn : you're right, the answer should be A, not B.

                  Yes of course, if using KMnO4 (but not K2Cr2O7).<p>The =CH2CH2= group will be oxidized to ethandial, then ethandioic acid, then 2 mol of carbonic(IV) acid, which decomposes into 2 mol of CO2(g) + H2O(l), with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change (since CO2(g) is gaseous), and as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle, since CO2(g) leaves the reaction solution, pulling the position of equilibrium over to the RHS.

              It means the dipole moment (in Debye units) has a larger magnitude. The larger the magnitude of electronegativity difference between the 2 atoms of different elements, the more polar the bond, the larger its dipole moment.<p> Eg. the dipole moment in H-F is 1.91 D, which is larger than the dipole moment in H-Cl which is 1.08 D, which is larger than the dipole moment in H-Br which is 0.80 D.</p>
