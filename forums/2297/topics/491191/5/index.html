                      Let x be the C-H bond formation enthalpy in CH4. Drawing the enthalpy cycle and applying Hess Law, we have (718) + 4(218) + 4x = -100, hence x = -422.5, and therefore C-H bond dissociation enthalpy in CH4 = +422.5 kJ/mol.

              Br- has lower anionic charge density compared to Cl-, hence forms weaker ion - permanent dipole interactions with water, hence hydration enthalpy for Br- will be less exothermic compared to hydration enthalpy for Cl-.

                  The alpha C atom is itself electron-withdrawing by induction, thus increasing the acidity of alpha groups over R groups, and decreasing the basicity of alpha groups over R groups.<p>If you understood what I've just said, you will be able to figure out the answer to your question.</p>

              1st qn : because OH- is able to deprotonate phenol (google up on how the conjugate base phenoxide ion is stabilized by having its negative formal charge delocalized by resonance over the O atom and the ortho, para, ortho C atoms of the benzene ring).<p>2nd qn : because carboxylic acid is far more acidic than phenylamine (which is in fact, far more basic than it is acidic ; to deprotonate phenylamine, you need an extremely strong base such as LDA, which is beyond the A level syllabus), and hence, OH- deprotonates carboxylic acid instead of phenylamine.</p><p>MrWorry, no offence, but from your questions, it's evident that your fundamentals (in what makes something acidic or basic) is severely lacking. If you're taking your A levels 6 months later this year in 2016, you might wish to engage private tuition asap.

            <div class='col-md body'>To add 2 points to MrWorry's questions :<p>#1 - You're expected to be aware that you have to use excess NaOH(aq), heat under reflux, to carry out hydrolysis or ester or amide groups. Since NaOH is in excess, deprotonation of acidic groups such as COOH or phenol will occur.</p><p>#2 - To *fully* understand the reaction (including the exact structure of the products, including protonation/deprotonation), you need to draw out (or at least view) the full curved-arrow electron-flow reaction mechanism. If your school teacher or private tutor don't want to teach you (I teach my BedokFunland JC students these mechanisms), google them out yourself.</p></div>

              No marks awarded in A levels for your answer. You have to draw out both phenol and phenylamine under acidic pH, and separately under alkaline pH, to understand the correct answer.

              You got the idea, but getting the idea is not equivalent to getting the marks. In the A levels, you need to draw out the products, and explain why the product is water soluble.

                  The topic of complex ions is actually more complex (pun intended) and cannot be fully understood at A levels. At A levels, you only need to know the basic principles and concepts, and you've to memorize the coordination numbers, geometries and colors of the commonly encountered coordination complexes.<p>For A level purposes, 3 simple concepts are relevant here : size of metal cation (if small, ie. period 2, only 4 ligands are possible, due to lack of vacant, energetically accessible d orbitals to accommodate an expanded octet), size of ligands (eg. water ligands small, so 6 are possible ; chloride ligands large, so only 4 are possible, to avoid excessive steric strain caused by van der Waals repulsions), charge on ligands (eg. water ligands neutral, so 6 are possible ; hydroxide ligands are negatively charged, so only 4 are possible, to avoid excessive steric strain caused by anionic repulsions between ligands).</p><p>Beyond these A level concepts, University level chemistry such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahn%E2%80%93Teller_effect">Jahn-Teller effect</a>, will be required to explain deeper questions on coordination complexes, eg. why [Cu(NH3)4]2+ has a square planar geometry instead of tetrahedral geometry.</p><p>Solubility is also a complex issue spread over several topics in the H2 syllabus, eg. chemical bonding, thermodynamics, solubility equilibria, Group 2, electrochemistry, organic chemistry, etc. The required answer at A levels depends on the context and H2 Chem syllabus topic that the question falls under. So there's no simple way to predict solubility (simple ways are for O levels, A levels are preparation for Uni level, in which everything becomes increasingly complex*). For the particular question you mentioned, falls under electrochem : only the oxidation potentials of Mg, Zn and Al, but not Cu, are sufficiently positive for their oxidation into aqueous and soluble metal cations when reacted with H+ from HCl (aq), to be thermodynamically feasible.</p><p>* In primary school, you thought you already knew everything in the Universe that could be known. In secondary school, you begin to realize you don't everything, but you still feel confident that you know almost everything. In JC and poly, you begin to understand that you don't really know all that much, and that the Universe is more complex than you thought. In University, you're humbled by the understanding that the Universe is so infinitely complex that you, and all sentient beings on Earth, actually know almost nothing relative to the infinitely vast Universe, but we know just enough to begin to appreciate and respect its beauty and complexity.</p>

              Being able to solve A level questions is necessary but not necessarily sufficient. If you stick to doing A level papers only, without Prelim papers, you may or may not get A grade. Of course, just by doing Prelim papers (with or without A level papers) is by itself no guarantee that you'll get A grade either. Every year, there are dozens (sometimes over a hundred) of unfortunate students who do worse (eg. B grade) for their A levels compared to their Prelim exams (eg. A grade).<p>My advice would be to focus on the style of A level papers, but at the same time broaden your understanding by learning from the "ridiculously" difficult questions and mark schemes from the JCs. Unless of course, you already find A level papers difficult, in which case confusing yourself with the even tougher Prelim papers would be counter-productive.</p>
