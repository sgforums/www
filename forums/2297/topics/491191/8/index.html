              Shifting from 2s to 2p orbital will not give such a large increase in I.E, as the difference between an outer electron shell and an inner electron shell, is much larger than between an p orbital and an s orbital of the same electron shell.<p>The difference between p orbital and s orbital is testable specifically under the anomalous pattern of Be to B, and Mg to Al.</p><p>Unless the question tells you specifically that the electrons are removed from the same electron shell, you needn't worry about that possibility, and focus on difference in electron shells, not difference in orbitals within the same electron shell.</p>

              Why? Because in the first place, both SPA and P5, being a practical component, is difficult (in some ways impossible) to prepare for. So you should focus on preparing yourself for your theory components (ie. P1 P2 P3), because that's you can productively prepare for, and that's what can help pull up your grade (even if you don't do well for SPA or P5). As long as you do very well for your P1, P2 and P3, you can get a good overall grade, even possibly an A grade.<p>But if you're still worried for P5, go download the UK Cambridge A level papers (go search online), and study their Practical Paper : depending on different syllabus in different years, their Practical Paper could be P5 or some other paper no.</p>

                  Chemistry is a microcosm of Real Life. When there are opposing factors, in some cases the 1st factor wins, in some cases the 2nd factor wins.<p>Considering K vs Ca, the factor of increased nuclear charge outweighs the factor of inter-electron repulsion, consequently ionization enthalpy for Ca is more endothermic than for K. Considering P vs S, the factor of inter-electron repulsion outweighs the factor of increased nuclear charge, consequently the ionization enthalpy for S is less endothermic than for P.</p><p>In Chemistry, including for A levels, you can only show your understanding of both (or all) opposing factors, then carry out experiments to determine which factors outweigh which. To discuss this deeper at higher levels (beyond A levels), yes it's possible to show with more involved calculations why this factor outweighs that factor at this point in the periodic table, but these would not be relevant or useful for A level purposes, and would only confuse the A level student and is therefore counterproductive.</p>

              Hi, qn1: while hcl reacts readily with alkenes under normal conditions, hcn does not. Explain using chemical bonding?
              i am not very sure but i think it has something got to do with extent of orbital overlap. C-hdond have greater extent of orbital overlap, stronger bond, require more energy to break, in order for the alkene to be protonated??
              
              Qn2: explain why cr(nh3)6 3+ is coloured.
              as i explain, should i state in cr3+, the 5 d orbitals have the same energy level....
              or should i state in cr(nh3)6 3+, the 5 d orbitals..... which phrasing is correct?
              
              qn 3: why doea cr3+ on reaction with na2co3 gives co2?
              is it because cr(h2o)63+ have high charge density, high polarising power, undergoes cation hydrolysis by polarising oh bond in h2o, causing h atom to ionise to form h+. Since solution is acidic it undergoes acid base neutralisation with na2co3 to form co2

              Q1. The C-H sigma bond is strong due to sp-s overlap, but more importantly, HCN is a weak acid because the conjugate base is significantly unstable due to the relatively low electronegativity of C atom that bears the negative formal charge (it is only the sp hybridization that just barely allows the C atom to bear the negative formal charge). The weakness of HCN as an acid results in high Ea for the alkene to act as a Bronsted-Lowry base to abstract the proton from HCN, hence the relative inertness.<p>Q2. You can go straight into "In the presence of the 6 NH3 ligands, the d orbitals become non-degenerate... etc etc".</p><p>Q3. Yes, that's correct. But in addition to a textual explanation, you also need to write out the relevant balanced equations to obtain full marks.

              Compared to most other C-H bonds which are 2sp2-1s or 2sp3-1s overlap. H-Cl bond is even weaker because it is 3sp3-1s overlap.<p>Orbital hybridization applies for all molecules, eg. 3sp3d2 hybridization for octahedral centers (eg. PCl6- ion).</p><p>If you draw out the mechanism (for the reaction that does not readily occur due to high Ea required), you'll see that you're breaking the 2p-2p pi bond of the alkene (ie. the weak Bronsted-Lowry base), as well as the 2sp-1s sigma bond of the H-CN (ie. the weak Bronsted-Lowry acid).</p><p>I don't want to elaborate further on these questions, so don't ask further. If you still don't understand, go ask your school teacher or private tutor. Besides, edart sterces.</p>

              Yes, obviously. The only thing Singapore students must be familiar with to do this question, is British to American units, ie. cm3 = mL, and dm3 = L. And of course (even if not required for this question, you should still know that) molarity = M = mol/dm3 = mol/L.

                  Halogenation via electrophilic aromatic substitution.<p>As long as you correctly substitute the incoming electrophile onto an available ortho or para position relative to the phenolic group, Cambridge will accept.</p><p>Diazotization and diazonium coupling is not in the Singapore H2 syllabus. If you're interested, go read up on it yourself.</p><p>Acyl halides are electrophiles attacked by the most nucleophilic group, ie. amine on L-Dopa, and phenol in Vanillin.</p><p>Fe3+ (in neutral solution, can't be too acidic or too alkaline, interested students can ponder over why, and check your answer with your school teacher or private tutor) coordinates &amp; complexes with phenolic ligands to generate a violet coloured coordination complex.</p>
