              For A level exam questions on adding NH3(aq) to Cu2+(aq), requiring you to explain first the formation of the blue ppt, following by dissolving of the blue ppt to form a deep blue solution, this is exactly what Cambridge requires you to write (see bottom of the linked webpage) :<p><a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/complexions/aquanh3.html">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/complexions/aquanh3.html</a>
              </p><p>OH- ligands are negatively charged, as such few coordination complexes will have 6 OH- ligands (due to destabilizing inter-anionic repulsions), with the notable exception of Cr(OH)6 3-.</p><p>It's true that Cu+ compounds are mostly insoluble, unless complexed with negative ligands, eg. [CuCl2]-, but Cu2+ in the form of Cu(OH)2 is obviously a solid ppt, as are all d block hydroxides (only Group I / 1 hydroxides are soluble, and solubility of Group II / 2 hydroxides increase down the group), such as Fe(OH)2(s).</p><p>Finally, at A levels you only scratch the surface of transition metals coordination complex chemistry, which is more complex (weak pun I know) than can be handled at A levels. Why does Cu2+ form Cu(NH3)4 instead of Cu(NH3)6, and why is Cu(NH3)4 square planar instead of tetrahedral? These are due to Uni level concepts including the Jahn-Teller effect, which will not be asked at A levels.</p><p>For A level purposes, you are expected to memorize a list of common transition metal coordination complexes (including their geometries and colours) that Cambridge can set questions on. Even if your school didn't give you such a list, you can look it up on the internet, or in Chan Kim Seng's and George Chong's H2 Chem books.</p>

              Hi Gohby,<p>
              1. N11/P3/5d(i). Here, "limited NaOH(aq)" should be specified to get J (ie. just enough to deprotonate the aryl NH3+, but not enough to deprotonate the aryl OH), followed by "excess NaOH(aq)" to get K.</p><p>2.  N13/P3/5d. Yes, graph paper is provided.</p><p>3.  N15/P2/4b(i). It's not about electronegativity, but about formal charges. Take the average of the formal charges on that atom, in the reactant (ie. just before the transition state), and in the product (ie. immediately following the transition state).
              </p><p>No prob, Gohby!</p>

                      Because that's the definition itself. For ionic compounds, enthalpy of hydration refers to the heat change when forming ion-permanent dipole interactions between gaseous ions and water solvent, ie. enthalpy change when state symbol changes from gaseous ions to aqueous ions.

                  IEn, this is the last question I'm answering. I'm logging off after this, and may not revisit the forum again until after the Paper 2.<p>
                  
                  "Electron cloud" is too vague, and is more relevant for intermolecular van der Waals interactions, which is relevant for simple molecules, not giant covalent structures like C, Si and Ge.</p><p><i>Edit : you mentioned "distortion of electron cloud", that phrase is relevant specifically for trends of thermal stability (ie. temperature required to thermally decompose) for Group II compounds (eg. nitrates, carbonates, etc). Don't confuse this concept with trend of melting point and covalent bond strength down Group IV or 4, it's a totally unrelated matter. You need to revisit your CS Toh notes on Group II or 2 regarding "distortion of electron cloud"</i>.</p><p>You *must* use the key phrase "effectiveness of orbital overlap" when answering such questions about bond strength.</p><p>However, when explaining "why the melting point decreases from carbon to germanium", you first need to specify that C, Si and Ge are all giant covalent lattice structures, and melting each of them involves breaking of the multitude of covalent bonds in this giant covalent lattice structure.</p><p>Then proceed to explain that going down Group IV or 14, atomic radii increases, hence bond length increases, hence electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the bond pair of electrons, decreases. In addition, the valence hybridized orbitals used to form the sigma bonds between the atoms in the giant covalent lattice structures, become increasingly diffused going down the Group, hence effectiveness of head-on or end-on overlap to form the sigma bonds, decreases. Hence bond strength decreases, from C to Si to Ge. Hence melting point decreases.</p><p>Ok, logging off liao, will be back on the forum after Paper 2.

                  Sean, are you a student or a teacher? Your solutions machiam professionally prepared mark scheme! Even use software to draw out all structures somemore! Sean boleh!<p>
                  Q18(c) is a terribly phrased question. Just identifying the major product (for exactly which reaction isn't specified by the question either) is only worth 1 mark. Since 3 marks are given, the student is expected to give reasoning and justification.</p><p>
                  The major product for the halogenation free radical reaction is C6H5CHBrCH3, because it involves the significantly more stable benzyl radical (whose free radical character is delocalized by resonance over 4 atoms : the benzylic C atom, and the ortho, para, ortho C atoms of the benzene ring), hence lower Ea, hence faster rate of reaction, leading to the major product.</p><p>As for alkaline hydrolysis of both products, SN2 predominates for the primary alkyl bromide (but since the reactant is achiral, so is the product), while SN1 predominates for C6H5CHBrCH3, due to both steric hindrance as well as the resonance stabilization energy of the benzyl carbocation. Since the halogenation via free radical mechanism generates a racemic mixture, so the final product for this pathway (involving mostly SN1 with a little bit of SN2, depending on molarity of OH-, solvent and temperature) will also be racemic.</p>

                  Yo Sean, impressive, professionally done mark scheme for a student... until the last few pages for Q19. Lol!<p>For Q18, I'd advise my BedokFunland JC exam-smart students to write out all possible answers with qualifications. In other words, since the question is ambiguous, write "If this, then this.

                  <p><br> Yo Sean, impressive, professionally done mark scheme for a
                  student... until the last few pages for Q19. Lol!</p>
                  <p>For Q18, I'd advise my BedokFunland JC exam-smart students to
                  write out all possible answers with qualifications. In other words,
                  since the question is ambiguous, write "If this, then this. If
                  that, then that." to cover all bases. Which for this question, is
                  unfortunately quite a handful, since there are several possible
                  reactions involving several different reactants and products. No
                  choice, it's the STPM question setter's fault.</p>
                  <p>Q19 isn't tough at all, just that there will be several possible
                  alternative answers (including yours), which might confuse the
                  student into erroneously thinking there's only 1 correct answer and
                  there's some trick to the question (but there isn't, just another
                  lousily phrased STPM question).</p>
                  <p>In addition, your E2 mechanism is a bit wrong, but the question
                  didn't ask for the mechanism anyway.</p>
                  <p>Q20. This one more jialat, got more errors.</p>
                  <p>Since the question states "a bright coloured product is formed"
                  implying that azo coupling has occurred, you're wrong to say in
                  your mark scheme "Allow : Bonding between aromatic rings".</p>
                  <p>In addition, "either 2 OR 3 Position on Z" is also wrong,
                  because of both electronics (OH is a stronger activator and
                  ortho-para director than the tert-butyl group, because OH donates
                  electrons by resonance, while tert-butyl group donates electrons by
                  induction) and sterics (tert-butyl group poses significant steric
                  hindrance).</p>
                  <p>Finally, and this last error is either your fault (you typed out the question wrongly) or the STPM
                  question setter's fault. If the question really specified "optical
                  isomer", then there isn't any simple chemical test, but rather a simple
                  physical test : just use a polarimeter. But there isn't a chiral C atom in X, so either the question was wrong to say "optical isomer" or you typed out this part wrongly.</p>

              <p>I understand that Xenon has a lower first Ionisation Energy as compared to the other noble gases. I find that there can be multiple reasons for which this happens( better shielding by inner shell electrons/ lesser attraction to nucleus due to larger atomic size)</p>
              <p>So if a question were to ask for an explantion of why Xenon has a lower first Ionisation Energy as compared to other noble gases, should I put both of the reasons stated above or it can be a case of either/or </p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>

              <p>Hello, I have another question regarding Ionisation Energy</p>
              <p>For noble gases, as to why they have the highest Ionisation Energy among the elements, is it because they are at the end of the period(where they have increased nuclear charge) or is it because they have a stable electronic configuration hence making extraction of electrons difficult</p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>
