              <p>And I like Kindaichi (both the earlier music group KinkiKids actor as Kindaichi, and the later music group Arashi (Arashi performed "Jidai" used as Kindaichi soundtrack) actor as Kindaichi).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only other Japanese drama serial as good as Kindaichi is Trick (I like Chihiro Onitsuka's 3 songs used as soundtracks for Trick Season 1, Trick Season 2 and Trick Season 3).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comparing the two drama serials, Kindaichi had the edge of being a suspenseful who-did-it murder mystery feel, while Trick had the edge of how-they-do-it puzzles, humour and romance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both are fantastic drama serials. Fantastic.</p>

              <p>You sure you wanna know? Ok, since someone asked, here goes... (not say i want to say one ah)</p>
              <p><br>Alcoholism, like other similar self-destructive cultural and societal abusive habits of pre-Serenissimus humans, including drug abuse (of drugs synthetic and natural), smoking, clubbing/pubbing, prostitutes and sex-crime, religious dogma, wall-street banking, etc; these are all quite inevitable and natural. But by no means desirable or healthy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a little known fact, that getting drunk results in pyschic 'tears' or 'holes' in the protective energy field or aura or etheric field (which every individual human and living organism has at multiple levels or frequencies; one function of which is akin to a psychical immune system; some aspect which may be observed by certain technologies), at regions located at the back of the physical head (this can be observed clairvoyantly, and again, by certain technologies). The effect of this, is openess to intrusion (the more extreme forms of which, include the phenomenon commonly known as 'possession', usually by psychotic post-mortems, commonly known as 'ghosts', minds/consciousnessess whose physical body has died, but are often unaware and uncaring of this fact, which keeps them earth-bound and incapable of moving on to higher vibratory frequencies and onward into the intermissive period (the period in between lifetimes), commonly perceived as 'the Light' in Hollywood productions such as 'Ghost Whisperer').</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This ('tear' or 'holes', coupled with the fact that drunkards and alcoholics frequent places and more importantly have low vibratory habit patterns, psychological dysfunctions and damaged self-esteems, alcoholism related karmic issues, relationship difficulties, personal life management issues, etc; all of these result in a greater frequency and occurrence of intrusion by psychotic post-mortems and other types of intruders (of which we won't go into in this discussion here).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like cigarette smoking and other similar self-destructive behaviour, the solution does not lie in enforcing (legally or otherwise) abstainance from alcoholic beverages, but in the individual's own willingness to heal him/herself and his/her issues, to want to achieve more for him/herself in his/her life and existential program (the objectives/purpose of one's lifetime, planned by one's own soul in collaborative discussions with one's guides, helpers, elders and evolutionary orientors; the existential program is of course dyanmic and subject to free will, but central to the successful execution or completion of which, has largely to do with relationships (how you choose to relate to others, to interact on a deeper and more meaningful level with other souls, particularly those with whom you have more intimate karmic relationships with, but of course with the entire human race and all other beings on the planet), and of course the twin goals of any incarnation or experience as exemplified by the question often posed in some way or other after one's life is over, "What have you learnt and whom have you helped?").</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For individuals ready to move on in their lives, willing to recognize that alcoholism (or drug abuse, etc) robs them of valuable and precious time and opportunity (to subconsciously want to be in drunken stupor is escapsim from life and one's issues, responsibilities and relationships; alcohol is the one that is manipulated by the alcoholic, not the other way around), particularly opportunity and time to be spent responsibly and meaningfully with loved ones, family and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Support groups and counselling may be helpful, but only so much. The non-judgemental understanding but healthy support and persuasion by friends to the individual to let go and move beyond such unhealthy self-destructive habits, will be more greater effective value and motivation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One final suggestion, for any and all individuals who are stuck in their various issues, but have the willingness and the want to move on in their lives, to evolve past old limiting habit patterns and destructive (both to self and to others around them) behaviour - google the enlightening work of "Byron Katie"; her work on Clarification (whilst not the only model or approach on Clarification on the planet, happens to be a particularly effective one), is one's best defence and solution to pain, suffering, self-destructive patterns and relationships, and even psychic self-defence (firs and foremost from one's own destructive habit patterns, and consequently to external influences and intrusions, as well).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, be sure to keep up your intake of a healthy diet (google the work of "Aajonus Vonderplanitz", whose all-natural dietary principles has had a 90% success rate against all diseases, including cancer), especially in lieu of a potential upcoming global pandemic outbreak of the new 'swine' influenza virus. </p>

              located at the back of the physical head (this can be observed
              clairvoyantly, and again, by certain technologies). The effect of
              this, is openess to intrusion (the more extreme forms of which,
              include the phenomenon commonly known as 'possession', usually by
              psychotic post-mortems, commonly known as 'ghosts',
              minds/consciousnessess whose physical body has died, but are often
              unaware and uncaring of this fact, which keeps them
              earth-bound and incapable of moving on to higher vibratory
              frequencies and onward into the intermissive period (the period in
              between lifetimes), commonly perceived as 'the Light' in Hollywood
              productions such as 'Ghost Whisperer').</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This ('tear' or 'holes', coupled with the fact that drunkards
              and alcoholics frequent places and more importantly have low
              vibratory habit patterns, psychological dysfunctions and damaged
              self-esteems, alcoholism related karmic issues, relationship
              difficulties, personal life management issues, etc; all of these
              result in a greater frequency and occurrence of intrusion by
              psychotic post-mortems and other types of intruders (of which
              we won't go into in this discussion here).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like cigarette smoking and other similar self-destructive
              behaviour, the solution does not lie in enforcing (legally or
              otherwise) abstainance from alcoholic beverages, but in the
              individual's own willingness to heal him/herself and his/her
              issues, to want to achieve more for him/herself in his/her life and
              existential program (the objectives/purpose of one's lifetime,
              planned by one's own soul in collaborative discussions with one's
              guides, helpers, elders and evolutionary orientors; the existential
              program is of course dyanmic and subject to free will, but central
              to the successful execution or completion of which, has largely to
              do with relationships (how you choose to relate to others, to
              interact on a deeper and more meaningful level with other souls,
              particularly those with whom you have more intimate karmic
              relationships with, but of course with the entire human race and
              all other beings on the planet), and of course the twin goals of
              any incarnation or experience as exemplified by the question often
              posed in some way or other after one's life is over, "What have you
              learnt and whom have you helped?").</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For individuals ready to move on in their lives, willing to
              recognize that alcoholism (or drug abuse, etc) robs them of
              valuable and precious time and opportunity (to subconsciously want
              to be in drunken stupor is escapsim from life and one's issues,
              responsibilities and relationships; alcohol is the one that is
              manipulated by the alcoholic, not the other way around),
              particularly opportunity and time to be spent responsibly and
              meaningfully with loved ones, family and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Support groups and counselling may be helpful, but only so much.
              The non-judgemental understanding but healthy support and
              persuasion by friends to the individual to let go and move beyond
              such unhealthy self-destructive habits, will be more greater
              effective value and motivation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One final suggestion, for any and all individuals who are stuck
              in their various issues, but have the willingness and
              the want to move on in their lives, to evolve past old
              limiting habit patterns and destructive (both to self and to others
              around them) behaviour - google the enlightening work of "Byron
              Katie"; her work on Clarification (whilst not the only model or
              approach on Clarification on the planet, happens to
              be a particularly effective one), is one's best defence and
              solution to pain, suffering, self-destructive patterns and
              relationships, and even psychic self-defence (firs and foremost
              from one's own destructive habit patterns, and consequently to
              external influences and intrusions, as well).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, be sure to keep up your intake of a healthy diet
              (google the work of "Aajonus Vonderplanitz", whose all-natural
              dietary principles has had a 90% success rate against all
              diseases, including cancer), especially in lieu of a potential
              upcoming global pandemic outbreak of the new 'swine'
              influenza virus. </p>
