              I pointed out you said "threads" (plural) because it means you really love Chemistry and dug up my post-paper discussions for more than 1 year (eg. 2013 + 2014 and now 2015), which shows your passion for Chemistry, especially if it turned out you were already following my threads back in 2013 and 2014 when you were only in Sec 4 or JC1.
              <br><br>No worries about derailing the thread. The thread is still young, there's still P3 and P1 to go. You can look forward to these papers (and how they might affect the bell-curve), and (all JC students do feel free to) share your thoughts on them in this thread after each paper! :)

              Cannot, because unlike AgX where the precipitates are white, cream and yellow, for PbX2, the precipitates are white, white and bright yellow. Cambridge isn't a 3 year old kid (Chinese saying), they already sneakily took into consideration that students would simply replace Ag+ with Pb2+ and use the (otherwise) same method.

              Impossible is nothing. If you can get a high A grade score for P3 and P1, you can still pull up your overall to an A grade. So prepare well for P3 and P1, and be careful not to make any careless mistakes.

              Feel free to discuss the P3 questions here in this thread after the paper tomorrow! As always, I'll only comment on your answers, instead of giving out full model answers. Because the question paper for P3 can be taken back, within hours many JC teachers and private tutors will be releasing their own solutions. You can always check against their answers, and any questions or concerns, you can ask me here.
              <br><br>
              Have fun with P3 tomorrow! ;Ãž

            <div class='col-md body'>So did you find P3 easy or tough? How about your classmates / schoolmates? Which question did you skip?<br><br>Overall, I'd say this P3, like P2, is neither particularly easy nor tough. So the A grade boundary thus far (excluding P1) should be approximately 72.5%, give or take 1%. If P1 is surprisingly easy or tough, then the A grade boundary may be increased or decreased, up to 2% or so.</div>

              A common groan I hear from students is, "Q5 looks tough at first glance but only after the paper then I realized it's actually the easiest question! So wasted!". True, but one little risk with Q5, is that there are parts d &amp; e, hidden on the last page (ie. the qn looks like it's 2 pages long, but it's actually 3 pages long), and some students didn't realize this, skipped parts d &amp; e, and lost 7 marks.
              <br><br>
              Some students found P3 easier than P2, while others found P2 easier than P3 (mainly because for many students the time constraints pose more of a problem for this year's P3 compared to P2). I'd say overall P2 and P3 are both of average difficulty.
              <br><br>
              
              So weaker students are now hoping P1 will be easier, so it'll be easier to pass. Stronger students are now hoping P1 will be tougher, otherwise the A grade boundary may increase from 72.5% to closer to 75%, and it'll be more difficult to get an A grade. 
              <br><br>

                          This is indeed the trickiest question out of the entire P3 (and arguably P2+P3 too). Well done, your mechanism is correct. The thing you now need to figure out is, do you know why your mechanism obeys 1st order kinetics for both H+ and HMF? ;Ãž
