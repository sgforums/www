              <p>Hello!</p>
              <p>Thank you so much for doing this :)</p>
              <p>I would like to check with you:</p>
              <p>1) For the distinguishing test between HCl and HBr, I used acidified potassium dichromate solution. HBr would turn the solution from orange to green and there will be no decolourisation for HCl (I wrote down the E values).</p>
              <p>2) For the Sn2 reaction, my product contained a NH3+ and I neutralised it by adding OH- to generate RNH2 and a water molecule. Is this correct or do I get HI instead (the lone pair of electrons from I- coordinates with the H+)</p>
              <p>3) For the ionic equation for the redox half reaction (Ag2O), I wrote my reduction equation as Ag+ plus e- -&gt; Ag as I thought that the ionic oxide will dissociate fully into its constitutent ions in aq soln. Is this correct?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time!</p>

              <p>I believe that to distinguish HBr and HCl, we can make use of a displacement reaction since both are strong acids which dissociate fully to form Br- and Cl- ions. </p>
              <p>Bubble Cl2(g) into both solutions.</p>
              <p>For HCl, the solution will remain colourless</p>

              <p>I got 3.87 for the energy released per dm^3. <br><br>My workings: <br><br>At 25 C, 101kPa, it releases 0.03xx MJ of energy per dm^3. Under these conditions, the amount of fuel in moles must be a particular value, say X.<br><br>So, X mol produces 0.03xxMJ of energy.<br><br>Calculate the volume of X mol of fuel at 26.8MPa. Since temperature and X remain the same, we know that p and V are inversely proportional.<br><br>From here, we can deduce that at 26.8MPa, X mol of fuel occupy 0.00407 dm^3.</p>
              <p>Thus, energy released per volume = 0.03xx/0.00407 = 3.87.<br><br>(Not sure if 3.87 is the answer I obtained in the exam, but the thought process which I did here is the same as what I did during the paper.)</p>

              <p>Hi Ultima,</p>
              <p>Really appreciate all the advice and help you've rendered to us on this forum!</p>
              <p>I have some questions on today's paper:</p>
              <p>1. For the question on carbon monoxide and how it inhibits the transport of blood, will it suffice to just elaborate on the strength of the ligand, formation of dative bonds and ligand exchange? Or is further elaboration on "binding irreversibly" required?</p>
              <p>2. For the question on the reagents and conditions (for nucleophilic addition), Step 1, is it required to indicate 10-20 deg C for HCN and NaCN/KCN trace catalyst, or is room temperature sufficient? This is because I recalled some reference literature not specifying temperature conditions.</p>
              <p>3. For the question on why a brief exposure to light is sufficient, will it suffice to elaborate on how the presence of reactive free radicals due to initial homolytic fission of Cl-Cl propagates a chain reaction or must we elaborate on the regeneration of free radicals?</p>
              <p>4. For the question pertaining to the reactivity of Br2 with H2 compared to Cl2 and H2 (with reference to Data Booklet bond energies), will it suffice to discuss about the exothermicity of the formation of H-Br and H-Cl (based on Bond Energies) only or are candidates expected to discuss the overall enthalpy changes of the reactions? I felt that since the latter requires a consideration of the Bond Energies of Br-Br and Cl-Cl, and since the BE of Br-Br is less endothermic than that of Cl-Cl, does it really explain why Br2 is less reactive than Cl2 if its bonds are easily broken?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time!</p>

              A grade still depends on P3 and P1, as P2 wasn't particularly easy nor tough. A grade boundaries are usually between 70% to 75% for most years, after bell-curve moderation.

              All the hydrohalic acids are acidic enough (even the weaker HF acid) to protonate CO3 2- ion to generate H2CO3, which decomposes to H2O(l) and CO2(g) (observed as effervescence).

              Nope, can't. For the redox reaction to occur between HBr and H2SO4, both must be  concentrated, but the question specified "dilute aqueous". Hexane wouldn't oxidize Br- to Br2 (you started with Br-, not Br2).
              <br><br>
              The question is a bit ambiguous on this requirement, but it would have been better to play it safe and draw out the entire structure, as the question specified "displayed (structural) formula". Nonetheless, it's possible you could still get all of the marks, due to the ambiguous phrasing of the question which is open to interpretation.

              Because it is the only symmetrical isomer and hence it doesn't matter where the NO2+ electrophile was substituted on.

              Not acceptable, because you should always reduce your numbering by choosing the right C atom as carbon #1.

              <p>Thank you so much for doing this :)</p>
              <p>I would like to check with you:</p>
              <p>1) For the distinguishing test between HCl and HBr, I used
              acidified potassium dichromate solution. HBr would turn the
              solution from orange to green and there will be no decolourisation
              for HCl (I wrote down the E values).</p>
              <p>2) For the Sn2 reaction, my product contained a NH3+ and I
              neutralised it by adding OH- to generate RNH2 and a water molecule.
              Is this correct or do I get HI instead (the lone pair of electrons
              from I- coordinates with the H+)</p>
              <p>3) For the ionic equation for the redox half reaction (Ag2O), I
              wrote my reduction equation as Ag+ plus e- -&gt; Ag as I thought
              that the ionic oxide will dissociate fully into its constitutent
              ions in aq soln. Is this correct?</p>
              <p>Thank you for your time!</p>

              Q1. Very good. Correct! ;)
              <br><br>
              Q2. Unfortunately, the question asked for any by-products of the original reaction; you're not supposed to add NaOH. But you'll still get most of the marks.
              <br><br>
              Q3. No cannot, you need to write it as Ag2O --&gt; Ag and balance it accordingly.

              If the 3 Cl atoms are adjacent, and all 3 are ortho-para directing, it's possible to get 2 different positional isomeric mono-nitrated products.

              <p>I got 3.87 for the energy released per dm^3. <br>
              <br>
              My workings: <br>
              <br>
              At 25 C, 101kPa, it releases 0.03xx MJ of energy per dm^3. Under
              these conditions, the amount of fuel in moles must be a particular
              value, say X.<br>
              <br>
              So, X mol produces 0.03xxMJ of energy.<br>
              <br>
              Calculate the volume of X mol of fuel at 26.8MPa. Since temperature
              and X remain the same, we know that p and V are inversely
              proportional.<br>
              <br>
              From here, we can deduce that at 26.8MPa, X mol of fuel occupy
              0.00407 dm^3.</p>
              <p>Thus, energy released per volume = 0.03xx/0.00407 = 3.87.<br>
              <br>
              (Not sure if 3.87 is the answer I obtained in the exam, but the
              thought process which I did here is the same as what I did during
              the paper.)</p>

                  <p>Really appreciate all the advice and help you've rendered to us
                  on this forum!</p>
                  <p>I have some questions on today's paper:</p>
                  <p>1. For the question on carbon monoxide and how it inhibits the
                  transport of blood, will it suffice to just elaborate on the
                  strength of the ligand, formation of dative bonds and ligand
                  exchange? Or is further elaboration on "binding irreversibly"
                  required?</p>
                  <p>2. For the question on the reagents and conditions (for
                  nucleophilic addition), Step 1, is it required to indicate 10-20
                  deg C for HCN and NaCN/KCN trace catalyst, or is room temperature
                  sufficient? This is because I recalled some reference literature
                  not specifying temperature conditions.</p>
                  <p>3. For the question on why a brief exposure to light is
                  sufficient, will it suffice to elaborate on how the presence of
                  reactive free radicals due to initial homolytic fission of Cl-Cl
                  propagates a chain reaction or must we elaborate on the
                  regeneration of free radicals?</p>
                  <p>4. For the question pertaining to the reactivity of Br2 with H2
                  compared to Cl2 and H2 (with reference to Data Booklet bond
                  energies), will it suffice to discuss about the exothermicity of
                  the formation of H-Br and H-Cl (based on Bond Energies) only or are
                  candidates expected to discuss the overall enthalpy changes of the
                  reactions? I felt that since the latter requires a consideration of
                  the Bond Energies of Br-Br and Cl-Cl, and since the BE of Br-Br is
                  less endothermic than that of Cl-Cl, does it really explain why Br2
                  is less reactive than Cl2 if its bonds are easily broken?</p>
                  <p>Thank you for your time!</p>

                  U're welcome ;)
                  <br><br>
                  Q1. For such questions, Cambridge provides a bit of leeway, in that out of say, 4 acceptable key marking points for a 3 mark question, you can score the full 3 marks if you wrote any 3 of the 4 marking points correctly. So it's still possible to score full marks without mention of "binds permanently / irreversibly". No worries.
                  <br><br>
                  Q2. When in doubt, it's always safer to write it in. But in this particular case, unless Cambridge specifically asked for "conditions" or "temperature", otherwise just for "reagents", Cambridge will accept either "HCN" or "HCN and CN-". So no worries, but for P3, do yourself a favor and just play it safe when in doubt :)
                  <br><br>
                  Q3. Because the question specifically mentioned, "The rate of reaction increases, explain why", hence to get full marks for this question, you need to specify "Due to the large no. of different possible propagation reactions, free-radical concentrations will continue to increase, hence increasing rate of reaction, until the rate of termination reactions catch up" OWTTE (Or Words To That Effect). But you should still get the marks for the rest of the question.
                  <br><br>
                  Q4. To obtain full marks, other than quoting Data Booklet bond enthalpies (or energies, for A level Chem purposes they're interchangeable), you need to mention that the decrease in magnitude of exothermic H-X bond formation enthalpy outweighs the decrease in magnitude of endothermic X-X bond dissociation enthalpy, going from Cl to Br. So yes, best answer is, as you say, take into consideration both the bond dissociation and bond formation enthalpies, leading to the conclusion that the overall enthalpy change of reaction to generate H-Cl is more exothermic (hence more thermodynamically favorable) compared to H-Br.

              I've no comments on the individual scores for individual papers. I'm only interested in looking at the overall grade thresholds after considering all 3 Papers as a whole. Today's P2 is neither particularly easy nor tough. So it wouldn't affect the bell-curve that much (which will probably remain somewhere close to the middle between 70% and 75%). So the difficulties of P3 and P1 will determine whether the overall A grade threshold for this year will be closer to the low end of 70%, or closer to the high end of 75%. Unless the remaining papers are terribly easy or terribly tough, for *most* years the A grade thresholds do not go below 70% or above 75%.

              You've followed my past year threads (plural) on the after-paper discussions for H2 Chemistry, even when you were in Sec 4 / IP Yr 4, and JC 1? Or you dug up these old threads to read them? Either way, good to know you really love Chemistry ;)
