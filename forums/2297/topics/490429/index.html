              After each paper, you may post your discussions about specific questions from each paper, here in this thread.
                  <br><br>
                   Be sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep the night before each paper (it's actually better to sleep more than mug more the night before), and of course a healthy, nutritious, light and safe meal (nothing too spicy, fatty, raw or dangerous enough to cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea) about an hour before each paper so you've sufficient glucose in your brain.
                  <br><br>
                   Alternatively, if you're too rushed to have a meal, at least have some energy snacks (eg. Kit Kat, Kinder Bueno, Snickers, Mars, etc) and a can of isotonic drink (eg. Aquarius, Hundred Plus, H2O, Pokka Sports Water, Pocari Sweat, etc).
                  <br><br>
                   And if you've a headache or at risk of getting one during the paper, swallow a pill / tablet / caplet of Panadol, the locally available brand of Paracetamol, ie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol">N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanamide</a> just before the paper, *provided* you've already safely taken Paracetamol many times in your life, and so you're 100% sure you're not allergic to Paracetamol, which will be deathly fatal for those allergic to it.
                  <br><br>
                   Enjoy your papers! ;Ãž

              <p>Hi, just finished the paper. Quite worred as I didn't do well for the planning question. Basically left half blank. Anyway, can you help me with the following questions:</p>
              <p>Q1. Is the mechanism for HCl Free Radical Substitution? Also, is it because there is an increasing rate of reaction because the H• radical will react with Cl2 to reform Cl• radical which can further react with H2? I forgot to mention chain reaction. Will lose marks?</p>
              <p>Q2. Is it because Br atom radius is larger that's why there is less degree of overlap between Br and H to form HBr. As such, the reaction is less exothermic and hence the formation of HBr is less reactive?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

                  The exact grade boundaries differ every year, as a different bell-curve is produced every year, based on varying difficulty of papers, and varying performance of cohort.  Nonetheless, to play it safe, you should consider the A grade boundary to be 75%, rather than 70%. It's usually somewhere in between, depending on the bell-curve.

                                    Q2. Yes. It's about the different strengths of the H-X bond (in turn due to the different atomic radii), and accordingly the exothermicity and thermodynamic favorability of the reactions. You need to quote Data Booklet bond energy values as indicated in the question, to get full marks.

              Q1. Petrol is a mixture of alkanes, cycloalkanes, and alkenes, with between 4 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule. Hence it doesn't have a fixed combustion enthalpy value.
              <br><br>
              Q2. Due to the large no. of different possible propagation reactions, free-radical concentrations will continue to increase, hence increasing rate of reaction, until the rate of termination reactions catch up.
              <br><br>
              Q3. To *provide* the activation energy, not lower it.
              <br><br>
              Q4. Yes, zero marks.
              <br><br>
              Q5. Depends on exactly what you wrote. It's impossible to determine exactly how many marks you can get from Planning, and you shouldn't bother so much with it. Just do your best with the remaining Papers, and if you do well enough for them (since the overall score is an aggregate of all papers), you can still get your A grade.

              <p>This paper was quite manageable. Apart from the planning question, I think the other structured questions are doable but require some thinking.</p>
              <p>The planning question involves the determination of Kc of an esterification reaction. It requires us to briefly explain how we are suppose to obtain the equilibrium amount of each compound for the calculation of Kc. I forget to do the necessary scaling and I cocked up quite badly there.</p>

              No, you get some marks as long as your structures are drawn correctly. Yes, answers in pencil are fine as long as they're clear.

              Unfortunately that doesn't work with "dilute aqueous solutions" as in this question. You'll require gaseous HBr and concentrated H2SO4 (which is a serious safety hazard and thus shouldn't be used for distinguishing tests). But you may still get 1 out of 2 marks, provided you correctly described the smell of SO2(g) evolved as a "strong, choking odor".
              <br><br>I won't reveal the correct answer just yet, as I'll like to see what the rest of you wrote. Rest of you, go ahead and share your answers to this question (which is one of the tougher questions for today's P2), and see what you came up with.
