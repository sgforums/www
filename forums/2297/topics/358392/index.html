              <p>so..i had this question (will try to describe as clearly as possible, cant find diagram)</p>
              <p>2 beakers, A and B, contains a bar of zinc and iron each along with indicators phenolphthalein(detects alkaline solution) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (detects presence of Fe2+: will turn blue, otherwise colorless). the metals are linked by a wire and a voltage is observed. a salt bridge connects the 2 beakers together, with the salt bridge being partially submerged in both beakers' indicators.</p>
              <p>the question was "would any color change be observed at the iron electrode?EYA"</p>
              <p>so, i reasoned out this way</p>
              <p>zinc is more reactive than iron.</p>
              <p>zinc will reduce iron, so iron will gain electrons.</p>
              <p>Fe + 2e- -&gt; Fe2- (wtf?)</p>
              <p>the answer is that color change will be detected (meaning there is Fe2+ present), but im quite lost as to how Fe2+ is actually obtained......</p>

              <p>Zn at one electrode and Fe at the other electrode. Zn will lose electrons to the circuit to form Zn2+ ions. Zn is more reactive, so it will react with the salt (let say FeCl2) (This question had a problem , the salt is not given, if the cation in the salt is more reactive than Zn, nothing will occur) If it is FeCl2, Zn will displace Fe out of the salt to form ZnCl2, and Fe will be "kicked out", and since the salt is aqueous, H+ and OH- will be present also, therefore, the kicked out Fe will react with the OH- ions to form Fe(OH)2, O.S of Fe in Fe(OH)2 is +2, so Fe2+ will be present, and the H+ ions will gain electrons at the Fe electrodes to form hydrogen gas</p>
              <p>Equation at the Zn electrode</p>
              <p>Zn (s) ---&gt; Zn 2+ + 2 e</p>
              <p>At the electrolyte</p>
              <p>FeCl2 + Zn 2+ --&gt; ZnCl2 + Fe2+</p>
              <p>Fe2+ + OH- --&gt;Fe(OH)2 + H+</p>
              <p>At the iron electrode</p>
              <p>H+ + e- --&gt; H2</p>
              <p>I hope this is correct</p>
              <p>I had assume the salt to be FeCl2 . I think this question can only be done if the salt is a Iron (II) salt. or lower in reactivity series.</p>
              <p>If it is other salt lower than iron</p>
              <p>this will happen</p>
              <p>all the same for zinc, instead of the kicked out iron reacting with the OH ions, the kick out cation from the salt compund will remain a solid while the iron electrode will dissolve and react with the chloride.</p>
              <p>I hope i am correct. Ultima or others can correct me...thxs</p>

              <p>The question is indeed flawed with no electrolyte given unless we assume its the indicator in water solution as electrolyte.</p>
              <p>WIthout enough info and we just base on redox, Zn being more reactive will be oxidised to Zn2+ and a reduction reaction will happen at the Fe electrode. If thats the case, no Fe2+ ions should be formed at all and no colour change should be observed at the iron electrode</p>

              <p>The question is obviously incomplete (thus the answer is open to possibilities) because the electrolytes in both compartments (connected by the salt bridge) are not specified.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If instead, we modify the question to :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2 beakers, A and B, contain a bar of zinc and iron each along with indicators phenolphthalein (detects alkaline solution) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (detects presence of Fe2+: will turn blue, otherwise colorless). The metals are linked by a wire and a voltage is observed. A salt bridge connects the 2 beakers together, with the salt bridge being partially submerged in both beakers' indicators. A colour change was observed at the cathodic electrolyte. Suggest and explain two possible scenarios (including identities of electrolytes) that would allow this.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One possible scenario, would have the cathodic electrolyte as an aqueous Fe3+ solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming unimolarities (ie. standard conditions), the standard reduction potential of the cathodic half equation Fe3+ + e- --&gt; Fe2+ is +0.77V; the standard oxidation potential of the anodic half equation Zn --&gt; Zn2+ + 2e- is +0.76V; hence a current would certainly flow and the standard cell potential would be +1.53V.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> + 4Fe<sup>2+</sup> --&gt; Fe<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub></p>
              <p>            Prussian Red --&gt; Prussian Blue</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In such a scenario, the colour change at the cathodic electrolyte would be due to Prussian Red reacting with Fe2+(aq) to generate Prussian Blue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another possible scenario would have the cathodic electrolyte as an aqueous acidic solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming unimolarities (ie. standard conditions), the standard reduction potential of the cathodic half equation 2H+ + 2e- --&gt; H2 is +0.00V; the standard oxidation potential of the anodic half equation Zn --&gt; Zn2+ + 2e- is +0.76V; hence a current would certainly flow and the standard cell potential would be +0.76V.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that H+ ions came from the solvent water, generating OH- ions as a consequence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In such a scenario, the colour change at the cathodic electrolyte would be due to phenolphthalein reacting with the OH- ions; specifically, di-deprotonation and structural change from a non-conjugated, tetrahedral center and absorbing UV frequencies (hence colourless) to a highly conjugated, trigonal planar center and absorbing blue-green frequencies (hence pink/fuchsia).</p>

              <p>Solid iron electrode is in reduced form, hence cannot be reduced further, as you yourself said. Hence, H+ ions from water is reduced at the cathode, generating OH- ions, which causes the phenolphthalein to change coloour.</p>
