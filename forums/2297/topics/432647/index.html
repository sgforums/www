              narrow base of a small island with over four million people, the government
              must be led by the ablest, most dedicated and toughest. The task will become

              Kuan Yew has made it clear in a recent book that the economy and defence are
              closely interlinked. Without robust economic growth, the Singapore’s Armed Forces
              (SAF) cannot keep up on its technology which, even after taking into account
              the SAF’s size force, gives us a competitive edge over our neighboring
              countries. Not that we, Singaporeans, are desperate to reckon ourselves as a
              leading military force in the region. However, we happen to be strong military
              force due to the influence of external factors in the past when the British
              left us (</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";' lang="EN-US">th</span></span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">e Vietnam war, insurgency in Malaysia, and the
              PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia) influential in Indonesia</span>) and
              presently (the Pedra Branca dispute and many more of which are only made known
              to a “fraternity” who makes decisions on whether Singapore should react with
              any sizable amount of force or not. Fortunately, the answer is often not to
              react and hence we, the general public remain oblivious of those threats). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">If you
              read up on Singapore’s history and some pro-propaganda books by Lee Kuan Yew
              and his counterparts, there is a high chance you will come to a conclusion that
              a strong a decision military force is essential, if not imperative, to deter
              any external threats, or in some cases, tyrannies. And once again, as pointed
              out by Lee Kuan Yew, to maintain an impregnable armed forces, we need a strong,
              convincing economy.</span></span></p>

              the best can lead and secure such a Singapore.” – Lee Kuan Yew</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">I take my
              hats off to Lee Kuan Yew, he can make all the absolute and controversial
              statements in life and yet get away with it. In guide books and marketing brochures
              absolute statements are frequently used. Why? Because if you want to sound
              convincing, you cannot say this method could be the best, because that makes
              you sound only 80% sure, and no one is going to invest their life savings on
              something you yourself are not sure about. You have to sound confident by
              saying, this method is the best. Likewise, by using absolute statements all the
              time, Lee Kuan Yew makes himself sound decisive and confident. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">I will not
              deny that only the best can lead and secure such a Singapore. If you read into
              context when he made that statement, Lee Kuan Yew was referring to a board of
              leaders, known as the government. Though in some cases, the government has been
              diluted and can be substituted by the PAP. These people lead our country and
              only the best will and can lead Singapore. Likewise, this logic can be
              promulgated everywhere in our society. It is logical to let the best lead, be
              it a group, a platoon, a company, a union or a government. It might sound
              elitist, but look at it from a panoramic view point; The best will provide the
              best for themselves and the not-so-best.<span>  </span>Or would you rather the not-so-best provide the not-so-best for everyone
              and in the end we find ourselves in a decline or maybe a very gradual progress
              (I won’t go the extra mile to define the best because it is not in my ability
              to do so). It is not elitism. It is, from my perspective, meritocracy and
              common sense.</span></span></p>

              do not believe so. If I were to reason from Lee Kuan Yew’s perspective that the
              two cornerstones of Singapore are the economy and her defensive force, there is
              no such thing as Chao Keng.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">If you
              want to be an engineer, you study engineering. And because you have a passion
              for it, you will, in most cases, put in the extra effort to excel in that
              field. If you have a passion for engineering, it is unlikely that you enroll
              for a Biology course or any other courses not relating to engineering. Because
              you do not have the passion for those other courses, and thus this lack of
              infatuation for the subject might hinder you from becoming the best in that
              field. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">As an NSF
              (not a regular in the Army), you could a sergeant, or a corporal (also known as
              a man) depending on how the Army qualifies you. A lot of Singaporean males fit
              the criteria to be an officer or to hold be an officer, commanding posts
              however many of them prefer not to display their capabilities but instead “slack”
              and take clerical jobs. More often or so, these people are described with the
              word Chao Keng. Simply because they feign an injury in order to escape the
              tough training undergone by commanders. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US">But like
              the analogy I have given above, you choose to do things that you are passionate
              about. If there is no fire burning in your heart, willing you to be a commander
              so that you can serve your country in the best of your abilities, then why be a
              commander? Only the best will and can lead the army, or for that matter, a
              small amount of men to missions. If you fit the criteria to be a commander but
              have no interest in it, I rather you take the back seat, because most probably
              you will not be the best or at least try to perform your best.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Holding
              a clerical job, or a lax job during your two years does not render you less
              potentially useful than an officer or sergeant. Remember, Singapore’s
              foundation is based on the SAF and the economy. If you cannot help the SAF
              much, then aid Singapore’s economy. Having a laid back job provides you with
              time, during and after office hours. For some, they take a part time accounting
              degree during their service. For others, they learn crucial skills, play the
              stock market, prepare for university and many more. Time is not wasted. Time
              during the two years can be dedicated by an individual to make him the best in
              a certain field to boost the economy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">The
              decision to take up a slack job during your conscript service to Singapore is
              not being a Chao Keng. (Yes Chao Keng can be a noun and an adjective). If you
              have no passion in the army, it could plainly be, being wise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">Wise
              that you can use the time to value add yourself to be competitive, to be one of
              the best in your field of interest in the near future, and hence play a part in
              stimulating the economy to greater heights. Which, in turn further contributes
              to the SAF to, also grow into greater heights. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-US">And
              wise that you do not hold a leadership post because you will not be the best or
              close to the best. And like what our once prime minister has stipulated, only
              the best will lead.</span></p>
