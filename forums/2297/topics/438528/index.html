              <p>Liquid CO2 is not cheap. It is expensive to keep it in the liquid state. The correct reason is that it is the most volatile and therefore most easily separated after the extraction is complete. An additional reason is that it is non-toxic, compared to benzene.</p>
              <p>Polar vs non-polar, isn't a binary 1 or 0. It is a spectrum. Caffeine is partially polar, partially non-polar, as is carbon dioxide. CO2 may be overall non-polar as it's dipoles cancel out, but the central C is permanently partial +ve and the O atoms are permanently partial -ve, and therefore can have dipole-dipole interactions with the polar groups of caffeine.</p>

              <p>COOH groups also react with PCl5, not just OH groups.</p>
              <p>Y is oxidized by K2Cr2O7, and therefore Y is either a primary or secondary alcohol, and Z is either a carboxylic acid or ketone.</p>
              <p>Z has a carboxylic acid COOH group, instead of an alcoholic OH group, since it is an oxidation product of Y.</p>
              <p>Y is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, exists as optical isomers.</p>
              <p>Z is 2-oxopropanoic acid.</p>

              Thanks for the Reply.
              
              What do you mean by "Polar vs non-polar, isn't a binary 1 or 0" ?

              <p><br>From now on, Arxoz, post your questions in this very thread, ok? Or if you prefer, you can always start a new thread on this forum, just label it as "[H2 Chemistry] - Organic Chem Qn" or whatever topic the question is on.</p>
              <p>Are alcohols polar or non-polar. The correct answer is, they are partially polar and partially non-polar. The alkyl group of alcohols are non-polar, while the hydroxy group of alcohols are polar.</p>
              <p>So it's not a binary black vs white or 1 (eg. polar) vs 0 (eg. non-polar), it is a relativity spectrum of "how polar is it? compared to..."</p>
              <p>For instance, ethanol is more polar compared to propanol, but ethanol is less polar compared to methanol.</p>
