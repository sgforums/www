              Hi, I'm not a uni student.
              Just asking, in NUS, for example MA1101R, does the 1 in front indicates it's a 1st year module? 
              
              How about NTU ?

              <p>Hi CaiHong,</p>
              <p>I hope I can reply to most of your queries. Yes the first number of the module code sort of indicates what students should be taking the module. For example, MA1101R is catered primarily to year 1 students as it is fundamental (if you didn't learn the contents of this module, you won't be able to understand modules of higher levels) and possibly easier (probably the reason why NUS restricts students to take at most 15 level 1000 modules). It should be the same for NTU.</p>
              <p>As for why some of the forumers mentioned that year 4 students can also take level 1000 modules, it is because NUS requires all students to take modules outside of their major (something like how Sci students in JC need to take an Arts subject, and vice versa). So for example, you may be a Life Sci student, but you need to take at least 2 Elective modules (defined to be modules outside of your home faculty, in this case modules outside of Faculty of Sci). So you may take level 1000 Psychology modules or Computing modules out of pure interest or belief that you may score well in them.</p>
              <p>Yes, doing a double degree gives you a very heavy workload. Whereas students in general do 5 modules per semester, a double degree student may do 6 modules per semester, and still graduate 1 year later since they need to fulfil requirements in 2 degrees. But of course, this is not for nothing. You get more knowledge, you increase your chances of being employed, your pay may be higher. It all depends whether you have the ability and interest in doing a double degree.</p>
              <p>If you don't want to do a double degree but yet, wish to attain enough knowledge in a field other than what you are majoring in, you can consider doing a minor. For example, it is common for Chemistry students to do a Minor in Life Sci, a Physics student doing a Minor in Math, or a Math student doing a Minor in Business or Econs. To achieve a minor, you just need to do 6 relevant modules. This could convince your future employers that you have some knowledge in that field, as compared to those who didn't do any Minor.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned about MA1101R, can I assume that you are interested in taking up Math or Computing? If you want, you can tell us a bit about your career aspirations and perhaps we can make some recommendations on what modules to take. I feel that university students are generally ill-informed about the choices they have and only learn about them when it is too late.</p>

              Thanks for the info! It was very well-detailed. Yes you have answered a lot of queries alr :) . 
              
              I mentioned MA1101R is because for a dumb reason, this is one of the H3 module given in the JC. So I'm wondering what year is this module going to be learnt in uni. So I research in the internet &amp; this lvl 1000 thingy came out. 
              
              Do you mind intro a background of yourself? Roughly will do. 
              
              I'm going to be a jc2 student next year. Currently I still dont have any career aspirations, neither does I have alr decided to take what course. I won't mind taking up Maths and Computer Science double degree in NUS, provided I can get it. The subject I am interested the most is Maths lol. 
              
              The thing is, is the prospect of this degree good? I heard that IT industry have quite a number of foreign ppl. And taking up the maths degree itself, doesn't give much scope.

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>It's not really a dumb reason. It's gd to find out more about what you are doing. If you are interested in Math and/or Computing, then MA1101R (Linear Algebra I) is a very appropriate module for you. If you pass this at H3 level, u don't need to take it in Uni, I believe. But it is a rather abstract subject and u need some time to be able to be comfortable with dealing with it. If u need help, u can always PM me or leave a msg in this forum =)</p>
              <p>I am a Math student in NUS thinking of going into teaching. The truth is it's very hard for Faculty of Science students to find any job other than teaching. Perhaps it's not so bad for Chem and Life Sci students, who can work for labs in the private sector. For Math students, there are limited options unless you have relevant knowledge in another subject like Finance, Econs, or Business. For Physics students, it's worse.</p>
              <p>If you can get into the Math and Computer Sci Double Degree programme, that would bode well for your prospects, provided you are able to pass (and do well) in the programme. But there's really no harm trying if you have the interest. If u realise u aren't coping well, u can always drop out of the programme and graduate in time (within 4 years for an honours degree) like the others.</p>
              <p>If u take up only the Math degree, it's dangerous for your career prospects as not many employers look for Math degrees. If u do take this up, do remember to take up modules (preferably minor) in Finance, Econs, or Business.</p>
              <p>I'm not very sure about the Computer Science course. Intuitively, I feel it's gd knowledge to pick up since the IT industry is so hot these days, but I'm not sure about the employment opportunities. In any case, things can change in a few years time.</p>
              <p>If u like Math, u may also consider an Engineering course. There is huge demand for Engineering graduates, but that's because the course is very rigorous. U need to deal with Math, Physics, and a whole lot of other stuff. It's even been voted as the hardest course on the Guiness Book of World Records, if I've not been tricked, lol..</p>

              <p>1. Engineering has many different types.</p>
              <p>2. There are courses in Sci like Quantitative Finance, if you like to be challenged. Here, you will find the best of the best, nothing less. Be prepared to fight with the best foreign  and local talents as well. QF combines computing, finance, math and biz.</p>
              <p>3. Getting only a math degree is not a dead-end. You need to use the holidays to find appropriate activities that would direct attention to where you want to go in the future. Be aggressive in searching out opportunities. One way is to network.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Thanks for following up on my comments. CaiHong, they have brought up a few good points and you can think about what they said or google up more information about what they mentioned. Getting a math degree is not a dead-end but it is also true that u can't rely just on your degree. Like SBS suggested, u need to work hard in gaining relevant knowledge because your Math curriculum alone doesn't prepare u enough for the finance or banking sector, for example.</p>
              <p>Let me explain why I sound so negative about taking up a Math degree. From what I see from my peers, many didn't know what they wanted to do in future, so they just decided to do a Math or Stats degree because they felt that Math was their best subject in JC. But upon graduation, they realised it was so hard to find jobs. Some regretted taking up the Math/Stats degree because it was too theoretical/technical and they couldn't apply those skills at work. I know it's true for most disciplines, but at least it's more practical to know Business Law than Rolle's Theorem, for example. To summarise, I hope that you will not pick Math because you don't know what other course to take. I hope that you will choose to read Math only because you really love the subject (not just calculations but proving of theorems as well) and that you think it can help you get a suitable job in future. Too many people belong to the earlier case, and they all regret taking this path.</p>
              <p>Indeed you can consider joining banks who are not specific about what subject you choose to read like what Lee said. But do take note that not all banks are like that and you  have to consider whether you are willing to take up the one to two year training programme.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to elaborate on the QF course SBS mentioned, it's indeed a very exciting course with great career prospects. The only bad thing is that there are limited vacancies for this course, and only the top Math students at the end of year 1 are selected for it. Unfortunately, you'll have to compete with the many bright Math students from China. It's very difficult to compare with them unless you are the top Math student in your JC, for example.</p>

              Another qn! When we will apply for the course? After A level ? Or after NS?? If after NS then have more time to consider which course to go :) .

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I believe it's after your A level results are released. If accepted by the course of your choice, the Uni will reserve a place for you until you have served your NS and ready to enter the Uni.</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm is it possible to apply only when like maybe during the 1st year of NS? Means not straight away after A levels? Like for ppl who retake A level during NS etc!</div>
