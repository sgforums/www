              <h1 class="clr">School of Science and Technology to open in 2010</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: There will be a new secondary school option for primary
              school leavers come 2010 a new School of Science and Technology will
              offer students a four—year curriculum, placing heavy emphasis on
              applied learning.</p>
              <p>The Education Ministry is working with the Ngee Ann Polytechnic and
              the Nanyang Technological University to plan and implement its
              curriculum.</p>
              <p>The move to provide more choice and diversity in the
              education landscape was announced by Education Minister Tharman
              Shanmugaratnam in Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>At the School of Science
              and Technology, students will take courses that incorporate strong
              elements of technology, media and design.</p>
              <p>Lower Secondary
              students will take broad—based subjects, while those at Secondary Three
              and Four will pay more attention to O—level subjects.</p>
              <p>They can
              choose from four applied subjects, such as Biotechnology and Design
              Studies, on top of core O—level subjects in the Humanities, Languages,
              Mathematics and Science.</p>
              <p>The school will also prepare students
              for post—secondary education in junior colleges or polytechnics before
              they go on to university.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman said: "They will be able to
              learn by experimenting, tinkering and by taking a project through all
              its stages from concept to design to building the models. But the
              exposure to real—world applications will not be aimed at getting
              students to specialise early in any skills. The real aim will be to
              nurture students with inventive minds, people who will keep looking for
              a different way of doing things."</p>
              <p>In line with the applied nature
              of learning, enrichment courses and attachment programmes will be
              arranged for students at leading companies such as Creative
              Technologies and IBM.</p>
              <p>Class size will be limited to about 20 to
              25 students, and up to 200 places will be available in the school’s
              first Secondary One intake in 2010.</p>
              <p>Students can also apply through the Direct Schools Admission Exercise in June 2009.</p>
              <p>Lecturers from Ngee Ann Polytechnic will be seconded to the new school, which will start recruiting teachers this year.</p>
              <p>Mr Chua Chor Huat, the current principal of Ngee Ann Secondary, has been appointed as the new school’s first principal.</p>
              <p>The
              School of Science and Technology is the latest specialised independent
              school here after the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, the
              Singapore Sports School and the School of the Arts. — CNA/so</p>
