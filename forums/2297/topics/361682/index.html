              <p>Q1. 50 out of 60 badminton students like to play both, hence 10 likes badminton only. </p>
              <p>50 out of 80 table tennis students like to play both, hence 30 like table tennis only. </p>
              <p>100-50-10-30=10 students =&gt; 10% likes to sit in the classroom and sleep</p>
              <p>Q2. altogether he has 30 vases. assume he has x broken ones, hence unbroken is 30-x</p>
              <p>(30-x)(40)-10x=1000 =&gt; x=4 =&gt; unbroken is 26</p>
              <p>Q3. is the interest rate simple or compound interest?</p>
              <p>Q4. let x be number of blouses bough, y be number of shirts bought, b be cost of blouse, s be cost of shirt</p>
              <p>from your question: xb+ys= $5190 (1)</p>
              <p>xb-ys=$2310(2)</p>
              <p>b-s=$13 (3)</p>
              <p>0.8x=y(4)</p>

              <p>(1)-(2): ys=$1440, sub in (3) and (4), 0.8xb-10.4x=1440, sub in (5), 10.4x=1560</p>
              <p>hence x=150, y=120, b=25, s=12</p>
              <p>total number bought is 270 (she must be opening a clothing store or something)</p>

              <p>Q3 should be simple interest, as this is a P6 problem.</p>
              <p>As for Q4, it would be easier to understand if answer in model diagram. Algabra &amp; substitution is not encourage in PSLE. Thanks.</p>
