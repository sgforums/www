              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>I just got my subject combinations and they gave me H2 physics, H2 Econs, H2 Maths and H1 chemistry.</p>
              <p>I understand that having a H1 science subject is "A tragedy of shakespeare proportions" because it is as difficult as H2 sciences yet limits you of your choices in university by so much.</p>
              <p>I have tried convincing the vice-principal that I am willing to, and have a strong determination to face the heavy workload. However, because my foundations (Combined science, no a maths) provide little support, she is afraid that I am unable to cope with the rigours of the subjects and denies me of picking up PCME.</p>
              <p>I have a dream course is mind, but requires double H2 sciences to enter. My sister suggested to me that I try to ask the vice-principal for a probation period of about 3 months, to test me on my capability of handling the workload, which comes to my question:</p>
              <p>Is it possible to do this? Should I talk to her again about this probation period or is it rather impossible for anyone to be allowed a probation period?</p>
              <p>Also, do you think it's a wiser choice to stay in an average JC, but having this subject combination, or head to a weaker below average JC where they might let me offer PCME?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks all.</p>

              <p>If you're sure of yourself and you KNOW this is your dream course, which by definition is worth fighting for, then FIGHT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do whatever it takes (tell your HOD/VP you will do WHATEVER it takes to study H2 Phys H2 Chem H2 Maths), if necessary including going to another JC (fast! clock's ticking!) that allows you the necessary subject combination of H2 Phys H2 Chem H2 Maths.</p>

              <p>I hope you understand where your VP is coming from.</p>
              <p>Not having Amaths and taking H2 Maths is already a big issue, not to mention taking two H2 Sciences with only combined science.</p>
              <p>In any case, as Ultima said, if you're 100% sure of what you want to do, and what you need to achieve it, fight for what you want. Go for it. But don't say people didn't warn you.</p>

              <p>I highly doubt she will allow you to change combination. </p>
              <p>The choice of JC does play a role in your education, due to the surrounding factor.  However, if you are really hardworking, then this shouldn't be an issue. In fact, most of the complaints about teachers not doing enough for students are from the "elite" JCs rather than your neighbourhood JCs.</p>
