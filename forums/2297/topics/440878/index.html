              Hi, i have a mole calculation question here:
              
              when i crystallize MgSO4+H2O to form MgSO4.7H2O, is the mole ratio 1:1?
              
              If so, then if i have 5mole of the crystal, when i use mass/Mr, will the Mr be 24+32+16Ã—4+7(1+1+16). Meaning i multiply the Mr of H2O by 7.
              .

              <p>C2O4 is the empirical formula</p>
              <p>you got quite abit mixed up with the molar mass and empirical formulae .molar mass is for the calculation of SI unit of chemical compound aka mole .recall wHat is it equivalent to ? mass of c-12 .... ?</p>

              <p>Although this post is already too late as a form of 'help' for the Chemistry Paper 2 by now, nevertheless, I would try to answer these questions as an 'O' level student myself.</p>
              <p>My answer to 3) , 4) , 5), 6) : All these are not really salts. If you recall the chapter on 'Salts' , a salt is formed  when a metal ion or an ammonium ion replaces the hydrogen ion of an acid. Therefore, salts would normally contain a metal ion such as a sodium ion and an anion which comes from acids , which would commonly be nitrates, chlorides or sulfates . </p>
              <p>7)  Since the ionic precipitation is one of the methods used to prepare a salt, these are the two conditions for it :  </p>
              <p>- The salt formed must be an insoluble salt</p>
              <p>-The reagents must both be aqueous solutions.</p>
              <p>Based on the solubility of salts , you would have to first deduce whether the salt is to be prepared would be soluble or insoluble .  ( i.e All chloride salts are soluble except for salts containing lead(II) and silver ions ) .In the method of ionic precipitation, you would come up of two solutions such that one would contain the cation of the insoluble salt which you are preparing, and the other containing the anion. For example, if you are to prepare calcium sulfate which is an insoluble salt, you would use calcium hydroxide and maybe sulfuric acid as the reagents. </p>
              <p>Hope these helps !</p>

              about stuff like P4O10. If I use the ‘cross method’ I would not get
              it.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Not needed in O levels to know P4O6 and P4O10, just use criss cross</strong></p>
              <p><span>3) Are bases like MgO salts and why if not? I
              think that they are salts because they contain a metal and a
              non-metal but I know that salts are supposed to be neutrally
              charged. So im not sure if this is a salt or not.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Nope, salt is form when acid react with a base, O levels all salts are neutral</strong></p>
              <p><span>4) Are alkalis like NaOH salts and why if not?
              think they are because they contain a positive metal and a
              polyatomic ion which is negative in charge. But then again, it is
              not neutrally charged so im not sure if this is a salt or
              not.</span></p>
              <p><strong>same as (3)</strong></p>
              <p><span>5) Are acids like HCl salts and why if not? H is
              positive while Cl is negative so it seems like it is a salt but it
              is not neutral so again the same from like 3) and 4) so are they
              considered salts ot not and why?</span></p>
              <p><strong>same as (3)</strong></p>
              <p><span>6) are carbonates salts and why if not? Pretty
              much the same reason as the others.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Can be</strong></p>
              <p><span>7) Precipitation method. Will this method work
              for any 2 solutions of salts? Like if I put any 2 salt solutions
              together (when I switch the places of the cat ions and anions a
              insoluble salt will from) will it always form a solid? Or only some
              will form the insoluble salt? And how to tell if they will form the
              insoluble salts if it comes out in a test?</span></p>
              <p><strong>Provided that they are more stable in each other, refer to stability table in electrolysis (displacement), Usually cations are K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, (C), Zn,Fe,Sn,Pb,(H),Cu, Hg,Ag,Au,Pt, anions are sulfate, nitrate, carbonate, hydroxide (more stable --&gt; least stable</strong></p>

              form salt and water like other alkalis do or only a

              Hi, i have a mole calculation question here:
              
              when i crystallize MgSO4+H2O to form MgSO4.7H2O, is the mole ratio 1:1?
              
              If so, then if i have 5mole of the crystal, when i use mass/Mr, will the Mr be 24+32+16x4+7(1+1+16). Meaning i multiply the Mr of H2O by 7.

              <p>In <a title="Crystallography" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography">crystallography</a>, <strong>water of crystallization</strong> or <strong>water of hydration</strong> or <strong>crystallization water</strong> is <a title="Water" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</a> that occurs in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Crystals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystals">crystals</a>.
               Water of crystallization is necessary for the maintenance of 
              crystalline properties, but capable of being removed by sufficient heat.

              Hi i have some new chem question that I hope to affirm thanks
              
              1) do all ionic compounds have a pH of 7. They are not yet dissolved in water. I think it should be 7 as it does not release H+ or OH- ions at that state. This include salts and oxides. 
              2) all basic oxides, and acidic oxides have a pH of 7 right? Same reasoning as in 1). N only if basic oxides get a pH of &gt;7 is when they are added to water to form a alkali right?( only reacts if its group 1 oxide and calcium oxide)

              <p><br>Since I specailize at teaching 'A' levels, I won't directly address StudentQns, but I'll comment from a higher 'A' level perspective, to guide those who would guide 'O' level students.</p>
              <p>1) pH (ie. -log10[H+] where [H+] refers to molarity of H+ in a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">solution</span></strong>) applies to solutions only. Therefore to say a solid has such and such a pH is utter nonsense.</p>
              <p>2) same reasoning as 1.</p>
              <p>When bases (eg. metal ionic oxide) is added to water, hydrolysis (ie. chemical reaction with water) occurs in which the base, in an attempt to stabilize it's negative charge, struggles to grab protons from water; ie. a lone pair on the O2- ion becomes a dative bond pair with a H+ from water. Water is thus deprotonated to generate it's conjugate base the OH- ion. A solution with a greater molarity of OH- over H+ is considered alkaline, and has pH &gt; 7 at rtp.</p>
              <p>When acidic species (eg. non-metal covalent oxide) is added to water, hydrolysis (ie. chemical reaction with water) occurs in which the water nucleophile attacks the electrophilic atom of the covalent oxide (since the heteroatom is less electronegative than oxygen), generating species which are considered acidic (since the conjugate base is stabilized by resonance and/or induction), and thus able to release H+ into water (to generate the hydroxonium ion H3O+). Such a solution with a greater molarity of H+ (or H3O+, these two species may be considered equivalent for acid-base calculations at 'A' levels) over OH- is considered acidic, and has pH &lt; 7 at rtp.</p>

              This is what my tuition teacher said: OH- ions are not the only determining factor which determine the alkalinity of solutions. O2- is considered as a very strong base ion too. 
              Na2O is alkaline in nature already. Its pH &gt;7. Its a basic oxide.
              
              However, I agree with u, ultimaonline that solids or gases do not have a pH at all since pH is only conceded with solutions and solids and gases are not a solution. And also O2- can't be an indicator since its pH which compare OH- and H+ right?
              
              Then Na2O can't have a pH of less than 7, but it doesn't have a pH at all right? 
              
              So I'm confused about what is wrong n right. Personally I think that ultimaonline is right. Thank you

              <p>The above concept (known as <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=levelling%20effect&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLeveling_effect_(chemistry)&amp;ei=PUMIT-CDCcnsrAery_n1Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEr25B9IZdHqk-TeYgo0O0zoZ3afQ">the leveling effect</a> : in aqueous solution, any base stronger than OH- (eg. O2- ion) will be forced to undergo hydrolysis to ultimately generate OH- as the strongest remaining basic species in aqueous solution) is indeed the reason why alkalinity is measured in terms of pOH- and pH+ (or simply, pOH and pH), and not as anything else (eg. pO2-).</p>

              <p>Addressed to StudentQns :</p>
              <p>Why is it that you have engaged a personal private tuition teacher for a good long time, and yet keep incessantly asking conceptually confusing qns here (that betray your acute-and-simultaneously-chronic debilitating perpetual confusion over matters of physics and chemistry).</p>
              <p>I'm not criticizing or chastising you here, I'm merely observing that it just doesn't make sense that you would continue hiring a costly personal private tuition teacher all this while, yet seem to have none of your own needs (pertaining to intellectual curiosity and academic support) met by your personal private tutor.</p>
              <p>There are many students who cannot afford (financially or otherwise) a personal, private tutition teacher for academic support. Ideally, this forum is for to help such students (who are without personal tuition teachers). Students who can afford tuition, should address your questions to your tutor (afterall, that's what you're paying him/her a lot of $$$ for, right?).</p>
              <p>It's inefficient and a waste of time (for all parties involved) to struggle to work through such deep-seated confusion (as your questions clearly reveal you have) through an online forum. If an online forum can effectively and efficiently address such needs, there wouldn't be a need for a personal private tutor, would there?</p>
              <p>So here the tragic irony appears to be : you're engaging desperately on both platforms (online forum, and a costly private personal tutor), but you're still awfully confused.</p>
