              <p>If you are going after A levels, then yes you have to complete NS first.</p>
              <p>If you are jumping there immediately after Os, then you can request for deferment, complete uni and then come back. This path is usually taken by those could afford it.</p>

              <p>go to brightspark scholarship portals. (go google brightsparks if you dunoe wad is it)</p>
              <p>most of the scholarship boards requires A levels. you can apply now for early cycle with ur prelims result, or wait till A levels result is release. usually the regular cycle deadline ends 2 weeks after the release of result.</p>
              <p>as for the requirements, the general guideline is that you must have around 3 H2 A grades. or at least a AAB. GP to be B and above. and usually they would expect A for PW and MTL.</p>
              <p>after meeting the academic requirement, you need to have a good portfolio. you need to display "leadership qualities and outstanding achievements" in school, which means being at least an exco member in your CCA, and you need to have some achievements. e.g. win something in a contest, competition while representing your school.</p>
              <p>if you meet the above 2 criteria for academic and non-academic achievements, you will be shortlisted for an interview with the respective organisation you applied a scholarship with. everything will then depend on your performance at the interview.</p>
