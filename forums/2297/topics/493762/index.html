                  For Q17, since the ppt dissolved in dilute NH3(aq), the ppt must have been AgCl, which re-precipitated out upon addition of acid, because position of equilibrium shifts right : NH3 ligands &lt;~&gt; NH3 (aq) &lt;~&gt; NH4+(aq)<p>To address your question directly, it's Cl- not Br-, because the ppt dissolved in *DILUTE* NH3(aq). If the question used concentrated aqueous ammonia, then both Cl- and Br- could be possible (ie. then the MCQ would be flawed and cannot be answered definitively, unless the color of the ppt was specified).</p>

                                Q8. Option C assumes that the basic hydrolysis of ester is a 0 order reaction, but it is in fact, a 2nd order reaction. Hence the correct answer is option A. Option B is characteristic of an auto-catalytic reaction, but neither product of the basic hydrolysis catalyzes the hydrolysis. Option D is just nonsense.

                                Q28. X is the transition state as the C-Br bond is being broken, ie. a C-Br partial bond, a partial +ve charge on the C atom, and a partial -ve charge on the Br atom.</p><p></p>

              As reaction progresses, [ester] decreases, hence rate of reaction decreases, hence you obtain the decreasing rate curve in option A.

              Excellent question. There are actually 5 levels to this at-1st-glance straightforward question.<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Methyl_isocyanate.svg/200px-Methyl_isocyanate.svg.png"><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_isocyanate">Methyl isocyanate</a></p><p>
              At the simplest level, the N atom has 3 electron regions or charge clouds : a single bond, a double bond, and a lone pair. Hence electron geometry is expected to be trigonal planar, ie. bond angle close to 120 degrees.</p><p>On a deeper level, the lone pair is expected to have slightly more repelling power, hence the bond angle may now be expected to decrease slightly below 120 degrees.</p><p>On an even deeper level, the double bond is expected to have slightly more repelling power, hence the bond angle may now be expected to increase slightly back to approximately 120 degrees.</p><p>On a way deeper level, O has the greatest electronegativity, hence the O atom withdraws strongly by induction (ie. through the sigma bond) as well as by resonance (ie. through the pi bond) from the C atom, which consequently itself becomes somewhat electron-withdrawing vis-Ã -vis the N atom, despite N's greater electronegativity vis-Ã -vis the C atom. The effect of which is to reduce the electron density of the N=C double bond, hence the bond angle may now be expected to decrease back to slightly less than 120 degrees.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>On a way, way, way deeper level, you should be able to figure out that there is a minor resonance contributor in which the lone pair on the N atom forms a 2nd pi bond with the C atom, and the pi bond between the C atom and the O atom becomes a lone pair on the O atom, ie. +ve formal charge on the N atom, -ve formal charge on the O atom. This is a minor resonance contributor, valid only because of the high electronegativity of O. As such, the lone pair resides in an orbital which is mostly sp2, but has a little unhybridized 'p' character, in order for the slight overlap of unhybridized p orbitals (of N and C) to occur and for slight delocalization of the lone pair to form a partial 2nd pi bond with the C atom, ie. the N=C bond has partial triple bond character in the resonance hybrid. As such, the bond angle may now be expected to increase to above 120 degrees, ie. the N atom is mostly sp2 hybridized, with a little sp hybridized character.</p><p>Indeed, experimental evidence has proven the C-N-C bond angle to be approximately 125 degrees, thus concurring with my 5 points of consideration above.</p><p>Of course, Cambridge is aware that A level students are not able to consider all these factors to elucidate as deeply as I just did, and hence if it were a non-MCQ question, Cambridge will be reasonable and accept reasonable answers on condition of reasonable rationales. For a MCQ question, Cambridge will (as they did in this MCQ) only provide clear-cut options such as A) 120 degrees B) 109.5 degrees C) 90 degrees D) 180 degrees, in which the required answer is obvious, because the A level student is expected to choose the option which gives the closest answer.</p>

              The counter cation is spectatory hence irrelevant, it's the CN- anion nucleophile which is participatory and reacts. Beyond A levels, there are other considerations why a particular counter cation may be preferred, even if it's only spectatory, but these are not relevant for A levels.</p><p>
              When Cambridge simply asks for "structural formula", they will accept any of the 3 types : displayed or full, skeletal, or condensed. It's only when Cambridge specifies 1 of the 3 types, then only that type of structural formula is accepted. Otherwise, any of the 3, including a hybrid of the 3, will be accepted. </p>

              The formation of significant intermolecular attractions (eg. van der  Waals forces or hydrogen bonds) between the gas molecules when the gas is compressed (ie. molecules brought closer together) is exothermic, resulting in an increase in temperature. Hence, option A is the answer.

              Can you post the link to the CIE mark scheme?

              Before compression : PV = nRT, nR = (16000)(2 vol) / (300)<p>
              
              After compression : PV = nRT, nR = (40000)(1 vol) / (373)</p><p>
              
              If gas behaves ideally, then nR before compression, divided by nR after compression, will be 1.00, which is not the case if you do the division. Hence, the gas is not behaving ideally.</p>

              <p>The examiners' report for this question states:</p>
              <p>29% of candidates chose the correct answer C. The mst commonly chosen answer was D chosen by 29% of candidates. If a fixed mass of gas is behaving ideally the sum PV/RT gives a constant value. for both the conditions given in the question</p>
              <p>PV/RT =6.418 (if volume of 1dm3 and 0.5 dm3 are assumed. therefore gas is behaving ideally.</p>
