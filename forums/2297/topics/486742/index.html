              <p style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 21.8844432830811px;">Hello, <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am also taking O level this year. Honestly speaking, I also find that O level English this year was quite unusually odd. I also have the same goal as yours - to pursue to JC next year. Because I was sec 4 NA last year, I also took O level English last year and I obtained a D7. Thus, I retake English this year as Sec 5. I was also quite depressed for the moment that almost affected other O level exams. In my humble opinion, these are the following that you should/should not do :</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 21.8844432830811px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1) Don't make assumption on grades. How do you know that your L1R5 is 15 pts? Just simply because you NEVER KNOW how English and others are going to be marked. This also comes in on how the nation-wide students perform (bell curve). Based on what I concern, quite majority of people saying O level English is not that easy. So YOU are not alone, we are on the same boat.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 21.8844432830811px;">2) What really matters is something that is currently still under-controlled. Don't because of languages that affect your performance on other subjects. Strive for other subjects to score them! At least you will have no regrets after O levels that you should have had done better.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 21.8844432830811px;">3) Be confident in yourself! Don't keep saying that you are "not in a good situation." You can make use of this opportunity to score others well to pull up your aggregrate points. You may expect something unexpected to happen - your English may be just up to par! You may be the top student! Just simply because you NEVER KNOW.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 21.8844432830811px;">4) Determination! Keep continuing to pursue our goals (since we have the common goal). The world is at your feet always! All the best for your upcoming Os.</p>

              <p>Hi I actually tried to post a super long post  justifying  my answers to your questions but somehow it didn't get through.</p>
              <p>so in an ultra short summary, As a jc student myself, I wouldn't advise you gg to jc esp if You're not that competent in your English language. After all if you do fail GP you can't get into university. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why not try SIM? It is a private  uni and ultimately leads you to a degree. If I had known I could get into SIM using my Olevel results, I would have instead of  choosing JC . </p>

              <p>Haha, I also stay around Bukit Panjang. Hopefully we can be classmates next year. Yes! Our school offered this privilege to take in advance like English, Maths and Chinese.

Nice sharing with you... :)</p>

              <p>Haha I was thinking about the same thing. I'm very easily influenced by the environment. That's why I didn't want to consider Ijc. Other than pjc I also though of Jjc before but in Pjc I have some friends there whereas in Jjc I dont know anybody Lol</p>

              <p>so in an ultra short summary, As a jc student myself, I wouldn't
              advise you gg to jc esp if You're not that competent in your
              English language. After all if you do fail GP you can't get into

              <p>Why not try SIM? It is a private  uni and ultimately leads
              you to a degree. If I had known I could get into SIM using my

              <p>You can still be a science stream student in Jc. I have a senior who entered Anderson JC with combined science as well. You should aim for the best jc you can go to depending on your O level results. And from what I heard, you must work harder than those who took double/triple science in O level when you are in JC. Just be self-directed and you'll be fine. And take care of your EL Looool don't be like me, everything no problem but EL big big problem dont know can pass anot LOL</p>

              <p>Hi YctLeong! Thanks for enlightening me on this.Should have put more effort in my studies instead of dilly-dallying this year and I would have gotten into a double science class at least to save all these trouble. I'm quite strong in my languages  and therefore I don't think I should be worried too much about my EL. it's just  the math and science and the JC subject combination that worried me.Anyway thanks a lot for the tip and good luck for your EL too.Cheers!</p>
