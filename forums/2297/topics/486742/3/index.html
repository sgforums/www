              <p>Hi,here to help you with your decision-making process!</p>
              <p>Hi,I just finished my A levels in Jurong Jc. That's right,jurong Jc. If you are applying to my school,I suggest best not to do so. Now I will share the pros and cons of my Jc experience and you shall evaluate about Jjc.I will discuss about Pjc after this,since it was my first choice 2 years back.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pros</span></p>
              <p>High intensity lecture pace for Chemistry,Maths.&gt;&gt; Especially Chemistry. This is good for those who does their revision(recap and read ahead on time.)</p>
              <p>Commited tutors,with the heart to stay back and help you with your studies</p>
              <p>Later day on Tuesdays </p>
              <p>PE prepares boys for National Service and they allow you to retest at maximum 5-6 times till you achieve silver/gold standard for NAPFA. </p>
              <p>Classes end at 5.30pm on latest for first year and 3.30pm for second year.</p>
              <p>Chemistry is decent at 15% distinction rate</p>
              <p>Good Economics programme for H2 and H1.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cons</span></p>
              <p>Very laidback culture in general,unless you befriend those who are academically-inclined in the 4H2's combination.</p>
              <p>You can't have more than 1 CCAs.</p>
              <p>Promotional criteria of 2H2 pass and 1H1 pass is quite relaxed</p>
              <p>The average Grades is probably BCC/B or if not lower.(based on senior's average,sorry no statistics to back-up)</p>
              <p>Gp standards are very low throughout A level results,an exception will be getting a good GP teacher,like mine that produces 50% A-B and no failure rate.Otherwise,it's usually 30% A-B and 50%A-C, although that figure is set to improve from 2013 to 2014.</p>
              <p>Biology has the lowest distinction rates 10-11 over 220 students.</p>
              <p>Further advice:Do come here,if you are strong in english and need some help for Sciences. </p>
              <p>If you want to excel,choose this combination: PCME here,other combinations tend not to yield high-performing students compared to this one.</p>

              <p>Pjc&gt;&gt; Pros definitely better for Gp.</p>
              <p>It's overall entry score is now lower or on par with Jurong Jc. </p>
              <p>It's continuously improving,used to be lower than Jjc but now better.</p>
              <p>More lively culture over there&gt;&gt;I went to the open house.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cons</p>
              <p>Classrooms don't have aircons,similar to those in Jurong Jc.</p>
              <p>Better school does not guarantee you will do well,it's still a low-tier Jc,but performs better than Jjc academically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consider the distance travelled to the college too! For me,travelling to Jurong Jc takes 50minutes each day.</p>

              <p>tips erm,from 17pointer raw,that got in Jurong Jc.</p>
              <p>You can try Jurong Jc or pioneer Jc as first. If you fail to enter,appeal for it. If you fail the appeal,I don't want to be harsh.Don't apply to Jc.</p>
              <p>Not intending to give your false hopes beyond this point.You are competiting again with the giants of IP programme-RI,HC,VJ,NJ,TJ. These guys,oh man,they get complain if they get 3 H2 A's!! Sorry for stereotyping,but each of these schools produce 50% or not more 3h2 A's. Mine school,Jurong Jc is only 55/800&gt; 7% yeah. </p>
              <p>Not saying that if you put in a lot of hardwork,you will still not do well there. You will excel,but your potential cannot be harnessed there.</p>
              <p>You have got so much latent potential there,coming from a good sec.school but not working hard for your O levels. I really hope this is wake-up call for you.I have buddies who are not from such a good sec.school but excelling in my Jc. It will be an added advantage from you,since you lack the hardwork part only.</p>
              <p>Sorry to deviate,YJ/IJ doesn't do well for A levels.Someone will probably come about soon and criticise my post as being too stereotypical. However,if you look at top students in YJ/IJ,they tend to have low COPs. I have no clue of this trend but it's rather alarming to learn that.</p>
              <p>I am not discouraging you,but you can go to the open house to find out. Ask the teachers what is the subject distinction rate for each course? If the teacher pauses for a moment at your response,I don't need to explain that. If the teacher is open about it,you will start to understand why I am saying all this.</p>
              <p>I don't want you to complain if you enter IJ/YJ,because you may constantly compare yourself to better notched Jcs and lose your morale to study.</p>
              <p>Like what I mentioned above JJC average is BCC/B. You can expect the other two to be lower by a little. I am not that sure of YJ,I heard that it was worse off. Back to the gist of the story,go there and enquire about these 2 schools first.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Personally, pjc is a good school imo, vibrant school environment and dedicated teachers. 12 score is definitely safe for u to secure a place in pj, considering last year cut off was 13/14. There are some with 16-2 that are rejected from pj. Pj is generally more strong in their arts with a very good cse department. Other than that, it is indeed a very enjoyable school to be in, a good mix of play and work.</p></div>

              If you've a Poly course you're interested in, go for it. If no Poly course interests you, then go for YJC or MI.

              Depends on whether you have any Poly course you're interested in. As for whether you'll do well in JC, ask yourself why you scored 20 points for L1R5 and not better : is it because you didn't study (eg. due to laziness, personal problems, etc) or you really studied very hard and did your personal best liao to get L1R5 of 20 points.

              For subjects like Chemistry, since it makes a big difference as to which Uni courses you can take (ie. almost all Uni Science courses require H2 Chemistry), it's advisable to take it at H2. H1 Chem is useless as a Uni prerequisite, it's just a filler for your Uni Admission Score.<br><br> For subjects like Econs, since it makes no difference as to which Uni courses you can take, it's advisable to take it at H1 (and free the H2 slot for subjects like Chem). You don't even need to take Econs at H1 level (let alone H2 level), to be able to study it at Uni level.
              <br><br>
               Of course, if you happen to (although I can't imagine why) much prefer Econs over Chem, then go ahead and take H2 Econs and H1 Chem (or better yet, take some other subject you prefer... Chem is one of those either-take-at-H2-or-might-as-well-don't-take-at-all subject).

              <p>Sorry for asking for help at such a late hour but I really need it and really hope informed and experienced people in the forums can help me out here..</p>
              <p>I did badly for 2014 Os,missing my expected target of 8 (by my school and leself),getting 10 for L1R5 , minus 3 cus CCA -1, HMT pass B3</p>
              <p>Here is a breakdown of my results</p>
              <p>Eng-B3 , looks bad but actually my written english isn't , at worst it is average person standard (wrt to my school , tanjong katong sec ) , flunk cus I was left with 30 min to write compo</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities - A2 (the bell curve is honestly very low my class avg during prelims was fail, me included and I barely studied,only the day before full force )</p>
              <p>Geography - A1</p>
              <p>E-math - A1</p>
              <p>Amath - A2 (dissapointing cus I never got below 84 in school before , common test and smaller test always full marks )</p>
              <p>Physics - A1</p>
              <p>Chem - A2 ( pajiao and read 5 questions wrongly , wasting 15 marks )</p>
              <p>HMT - B3 , i believe the bell curve is low cus i didnt get above C5 in school before, maybe its the lucky situational writing topic</p>
              <p>My comments about my results aren't to show off (after all my o lvl marks are fixed ) its rather to give you all an idea of my academic performance in school with respect to the individual topics .</p>
              <p>I generally like studying almost everything except for bio and am prejudiced against lit and would prefer not to take it. Like most people, I like reading history and watching history related things but dislike the notion of having to memorise the entire subject, on the other hand I like analysing statistics and political cartoons and offering my opinion on them.</p>
              <p>Here are some of the schools I am considering , the top being most desireable</p>
              <p>1. National JC Sciences 5 - kinda try hard , yolo -1 hr trip</p>
              <p>2. National JC Arts - 7 , not sure if this is what i should pursue ? What are some negatives to taking arts ? Because i like the school,but im more of the standard math and science person, except im ok with humanities</p>
              <p>3.Temasek JC Sciences / Meridian JC Sciences</p>
              <p>TJ Pros:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Temasek because it has been in top 5 for quite some time and is more prestigious-ish , also the 100% admission to local university is enticing</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I also like a study-centric atmostphere because i'm rather anti-social. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worries for TJ :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Enter the worst class in TJ due to cut-off point</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Tj is deproving,and is the furthest from my house with a travel time of 1hr 8min.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Tj focuses more on IP programme people because the teachers have already build rapport with those students</span></li>
              </ul>

              <p>Meridian pros : </p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>6th in SG , 95% into local uni is acceptable</li>
              <li>Will enter the better classes of meridian and receive better education-better teachers assigned to the 101 classes</li>
              <li>Very near my house , 20 plus mins bus to meridian doorstep</li>
              </ul>
              <div>Meridian cons:</div>
              <div>
              <ul>
              <li>Excessively stressful- too much rigour, excessive workloads, not sure if its a decent amount for a jc , please enlighten me here</li>
              <li>High l1r5 people might be too slack- affect competitive atmostphere? cut off point is 9</li>
              <li>Retain rate is extremely high , scared that I am vulnerable</li>
              <li>Exam paper - is it the right standards ? My senior says its very easy , but he still fails , so I'm at a lost here</li>
              <li>Too hyper and too much social interaction ? </li>
              </ul>
              <div>4. Anderson JC</div>
              <div>Pros:</div>
              <div>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Better academically than nanyang , for my points thats the only other choice I guess.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Academically ok-ish</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Decently near - 30/40 mins</span></li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>Cons:</div>
              <div>Read in forums math paper is overkill and demoralising - I like challenges but setting papers which are not reflective of A level standards are a sign that their methods of teaching may be ineffective</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>5. Nanyang JC</div>
              <div>Pros:</div>
              <div>late start , decent school in terms of facilities , results so so 90% admission into local univeristy , very near like Meridian -20mins by mrt</div>
              <div>Cons: </div>
              <div>Very lenient ,leading to students being way to lax and not being pushed enough to study extremely hard ( like MJ)</div>
              <div>Affiliated schools mean that more of higher l1r5 people can get into nanyang jc-again slack ? <br><br>The above comments are not intended to criticise or mock anyone, i dont think i did well so i most definitely dont deserve to do so . No offence to the individual jcs, Im just thinking i need to express all of my concerns clearly so that they can be properly addressed . Thank you</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Additional concerns :</div>
              <div>I am interested in architecture - so any specific subject combi i should take note of ?</div>
              <div>Is there a need to take geography ?</div>
              <div>Distance- Is it really that important ? Ofc im human and it is tiring and annoying having to go home late and wake up early , but i have done it for 4 years going to TK-and though i dont like it, it was the best school i could enter with my mediocre psle results</div>
              <div>Thank you for reading this extremely lengthy writing and I express my sincere gratitude to those who can help me address my concerns , all inputs are greatly appreciated ! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></div>
