              <p>Sorry for asking for help at such a late hour but I really need
                      it and really hope informed and experienced people in the forums
                      can help me out here..</p>
              <p>I did badly for 2014 Os,missing my expected target of 8 (by my
                      school and leself),getting 10 for L1R5 , minus 3 cus CCA -1, HMT
                      pass B3</p>
              <p>Here is a breakdown of my results</p>
              <p>Eng-B3 , looks bad but actually my written english isn't , at
                      worst it is average person standard (wrt to my school , tanjong
                      katong sec ) , flunk cus I was left with 30 min to write compo</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities - A2 (the bell curve is honestly very low my
                      class avg during prelims was fail, me included and I barely
                      studied,only the day before full force )</p>
              <p>Geography - A1</p>
              <p>E-math - A1</p>
              <p>Amath - A2 (dissapointing cus I never got below 84 in school
                      before , common test and smaller test always full marks )</p>
              <p>Physics - A1</p>
              <p>Chem - A2 ( pajiao and read 5 questions wrongly , wasting 15
                      marks )</p>
              <p>HMT - B3 , i believe the bell curve is low cus i didnt get above
                      C5 in school before, maybe its the lucky situational writing
                      topic</p>
              <p>My comments about my results aren't to show off (after all my o
                      lvl marks are fixed ) its rather to give you all an idea of my
                      academic performance in school with respect to the individual
                      topics .</p>
              <p>I generally like studying almost everything except for bio and
                      am prejudiced against lit and would prefer not to take it. Like
                      most people, I like reading history and watching history related
                      things but dislike the notion of having to memorise the entire
                      subject, on the other hand I like analysing statistics and
                      political cartoons and offering my opinion on them.</p>
              <p>Here are some of the schools I am considering , the top being
                      most desireable</p>
              <p>1. National JC Sciences 5 - kinda try hard , yolo -1 hr trip</p>
              <p>2. National JC Arts - 7 , not sure if this is what i should
                      pursue ? What are some negatives to taking arts ? Because i like
                      the school,but im more of the standard math and science person,
                      except im ok with humanities</p>

              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Temasek because it has been
                      in top 5 for quite some time and is more prestigious-ish , also the
                      100% admission to local university is enticing</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I also like a study-centric
                      atmostphere because i'm rather anti-social. </span></li>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Tj is deproving,and is the

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Tj focuses more on IP
                      programme people because the teachers have already build rapport
                      with those students</span></li>

              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>6th in SG , 95% into local uni is acceptable</li>
              <li>Will enter the better classes of meridian and receive better
                      education-better teachers assigned to the 101 classes</li>
              <li>Very near my house , 20 plus mins bus to meridian doorstep</li>

              <li>Excessively stressful- too much rigour, excessive workloads,
                      not sure if its a decent amount for a jc , please enlighten me
                      here</li>
              <li>High l1r5 people might be too slack- affect competitive
                      atmostphere? cut off point is 9</li>
              <li>Retain rate is extremely high , scared that I am
                      vulnerable</li>
              <li>Exam paper - is it the right standards ? My senior says its
                      very easy , but he still fails , so I'm at a lost here</li>
              <li>Too hyper and too much social interaction ? </li>
              </ul>
              <div>4. Anderson JC</div>
              <div>Pros:</div>
              <div>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Better academically than
                      nanyang , for my points thats the only other choice I
                      guess.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Academically
                      ok-ish</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Decently near - 30/40
                      mins</span></li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <div>Cons:</div>
              <div>Read in forums math paper is overkill and demoralising - I
                      like challenges but setting papers which are not reflective of A
                      level standards are a sign that their methods of teaching may be
                      ineffective</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>5. Nanyang JC</div>
              <div>Pros:</div>
              <div>late start , decent school in terms of facilities , results so
                      so 90% admission into local univeristy , very near like Meridian
                      -20mins by mrt</div>
              <div>Cons: </div>
              <div>Very lenient ,leading to students being way to lax and not
                      being pushed enough to study extremely hard ( like MJ)</div>
              <div>Affiliated schools mean that more of higher l1r5 people can
                      get into nanyang jc-again slack ? <br> <br> The above comments are not intended to criticise or mock anyone, i
                      dont think i did well so i most definitely dont deserve to do so .
                      No offence to the individual jcs, Im just thinking i need to
                      express all of my concerns clearly so that they can be properly
                      addressed . Thank you</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Additional concerns :</div>
              <div>I am interested in architecture - so any specific subject
                      combi i should take note of ?</div>
              <div>Is there a need to take geography ?</div>
              <div>Distance- Is it really that important ? Ofc im human and it is
                      tiring and annoying having to go home late and wake up early , but
                      i have done it for 4 years going to TK-and though i dont like it,
                      it was the best school i could enter with my mediocre psle
                      results</div>
              <div>Thank you for reading this extremely lengthy writing and I
                      express my sincere gratitude to those who can help me address my
                      concerns , all inputs are greatly appreciated ! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></div>

              <div>Pros:</div>
              <div>late start , decent school in terms of facilities , results so so 90% admission into local univeristy , very near like Meridian -20mins by mrt</div>
              <div>Cons: </div>
              <div>Very lenient ,leading to students being way to lax and not being pushed enough to study extremely hard ( like MJ)</div>
              <div>Affiliated schools mean that more of higher l1r5 people can get into nanyang jc-again slack ? <br><br>The above comments are not intended to criticise or mock anyone, i dont think i did well so i most definitely dont deserve to do so . No offence to the individual jcs, Im just thinking i need to express all of my concerns clearly so that they can be properly addressed . Thank you</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Additional concerns :</div>
              <div>I am interested in architecture - so any specific subject combi i should take note of ?</div>
              <div>Is there a need to take geography ?</div>
              <div>Distance- Is it really that important ? Ofc im human and it is tiring and annoying having to go home late and wake up early , but i have done it for 4 years going to TK-and though i dont like it, it was the best school i could enter with my mediocre psle results</div>
              <div>Thank you for reading this extremely lengthy writing and I express my sincere gratitude to those who can help me address my concerns , all inputs are greatly appreciated ! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></div>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Your points about those jc are pretty valid, you did your research well. im from mjc 4/5 years ago so take it with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Firstly I don't think you should worry about their % rate admission to uni. I wouldn't worry about difficult exam papers also, because it doesn't really affect anything unless you are applying for scholarships etc that makes use of your prelim results. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">So here's what I can say or add on about mjc with reference to your points: </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1.    It's true that the school hours are long. Even if it is not long, there will likely be make-up tutorials or additional remedial for you. So the worst, longest period will be 7/8am - 5.30pm! (last period is typically P.E. lesson,). Otherwise, it will be like until 2/3/4 pm on normal days. On the CCA day (should still be wednesday), lessons will be like from 9am to 12.30pm.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2.    Despite all the ungodly hours, I guess it's kind of true that you won't be pushed, depending on your tutors. Like, you can still choose to pon the extra lessons afterall what. But I doubt you will do that. And the principal of mjc, who I believe to be the pillar of the school, has just left too. She was always the one who push and scold students for slacking and not perservering. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">3.    The exam papers are kind of hard. If cambridge wants to suddenly dish out some difficult papers, that difficulty would be about it. The difficulty of mjc papers given to you tend to decrease over time as you move on. The physics and math department (math dept rocks) are more lenient. Chemistry dept (some handful of good tutors inside) is hard too, but then afterall, the a lvl papers since 2010 are equally crazy. With those level of difficulty, it's not surprising to fail many many times you know. I tried AJC's math paper before, the difficulty is ridiculous. It will probably take at least 6 hrs for me to finish (supposed to finish in 3 hrs each). But if the difficulty of the papers are not suitable for you, you can always outsource from other jcs mah.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">4.    I'm kind of anti-social but I love the hyper enviroment there, so I dunno about you...besides, you are not obliged to participate in the high-ness in those events, other than Orientation (it's fun!). </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">5.    Retainment rate - to me it's not high like most other ppl say. I only know a few (I estimate 10+ ish ppl) who got retained. They will always moderate your marks before recommending you for retainment. After you kena, you and your parents will need to see the tutor, and if worse, the principal. Then you will get a qualifying test as a chance. I'm not sure what happens if you fail the test, if I put it nicely, it would probably be that they will suggest you to retain. To put it badly, it could also be that they will psycho you to retain. To put it realistically, there are pros and cons of retaining to consider. Normally people like us will score around 40-50+ for a subject. The danger zone is that if you score like 0-30 for most of your content subjects. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">6.    And if you want the competitive atmosphere, the few s100+ class series (they are 4 H2s people btw) are probably the one. But I would find it quite sad. </p>

              <p>According to NUS:http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply/local/prerequisites/BYA-prerequisites.html</p>
              <p>Architecture:
                                      H1 pass in Chemistry or Mathematics or    Physics; OR pass in 'O' level Additional Mathematics. (so yea, you have already attained the prerequisite for architecture)</p>
              <p>The JCs will divide students according to their subject combinations, so there is not best class or worst class.</p>
              <p>lol, why are you even comparing the University admission statistics? Better JCs have higher admission rate because their students are smarter, comparing them is like you saying that people living in landed properties are generally richer than those in HDBs.</p>
              <p>Yes, distance matters. You will not have enough sleep time in JCs, especially when you are in J2. I would advise you to go for the JC nearer to your house so that you have more time to sleep or revise. Last minute study would not work in JC since you have mentioned you did that for your O level.</p>
              <p><br>JC is just a stepping stone to university,</p>

              <p>Guys,if you are going for Pj,take the abovementioned advice seriously. I am a senior from Jj in 2014 cohort,but I want to tell you that 17-19 pointers,can even excel in A levels!! I am a 17 pointer but yet to receive my results from my Jc,but I am actually targeting the AAB/B for A levels and A for Gp if possible.</p>
              <p>Short advice for you guys is:1.make as many mistakes as you can in school</p>
              <p>2.learn from them,ask teachers/best friends for help</p>
              <p>3.redo/ do a question that tests the similar concept</p>
              <p>4.keep repeating 1-3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you guys really desperate to score 4-5As as a 17 pointer,it's feasible!! One of the Pjcian from the 2010 cohort,managed a 5As for his A levels and was one of the few neighbourhood Jc students,that made it into pharmacy in NUS.Although,he is preparing to leave to Adelaide to study medicine after spending 1 year there.He is a friend of mine,just my two cents.</p>
              <p>Any of you wish to talk to him more,send me a pm~~</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You will have to know that JC is more academical while Poly life is really where you have to be independent and have lots more hands-on opportunities. Both tracks will definitely be tough and if you're still not sure what you want in life, maybe JC will be good for you, especially if you plan on going university as chances will be higher. Most people who go poly will already know what they want in life or will study a course to pursue their interest. Hope you'll get into the school you want for the postings this thursday!
