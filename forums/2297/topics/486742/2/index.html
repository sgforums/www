              <p>To be eligible to take 2 H2 Science subjects, most JCs would require 2 Pure Sciences or 1 Combined Science + 1 Pure Science. You should have Pure Biology in addition to Combined Science (Phy/Chem) to be eligible for 2 H2 Science subjects. Additional Maths is usually a prerequisite for H2 maths. You might be able to take some of the subjects at H1 Level but that won't be too useful for university</p>
              <p>With your current subject combination, you are more suitable for Art Stream</p>

              <p>Hi DragonMaster. So you're implying that with no A Math and a pure science subject, I am only eligible to take 1 H2 level science in most JCs.That's all? Usually a science stream course consists of 2 H2 science and H2 math right? May I know the JCs which still allow me to opt for a Science stream course despite my arts background? thanks</p>

              <p>You could check the websites of the respective JCs for more info. Without a pure science subject, they would only allow you to take 1 Science at H2 level and 1 Science at H1 level. A typical Science Combination would consist of 3H2 subjects (eg: Physics, Chemistry, Math) and 1H1 Subject (eg: Economics). This is known as PCME, which is one of the most common combinations. You would also have to take H1 Mother Tongue (if you didn't take Higher MTL at O Levels), H1 General Paper and H1 Project Work along with the 4 other subjects</p>
              <p><br>You could always try to appeal for 2 H2 Science subjects if you get A1 for Combined Science and if your L1R5 is good. But if that doesn't work, be prepared to consider other options</p>

              <p>Hi DragonMaster. Thanks for the info. So normally a combined science student has to appeal for 2 H2 science subject instead of just directly opting for it? And by "other options", you are referring to arts subjects at H2 level or a "hybrid" of both science and humanities right?thanks</p>

              <p>Yeah, you are disadvantaged by the lack of A Maths and lack of Pure Science. Art subjects (such as Hist/Geog) usually don't have specific requirements. As long as you meet the cut-off point you should be able to get into Art Stream. That's why I said you're more suitable for Art Stream. You could consider those options which you listed above or maybe Poly :)</p>

              <p>No problem. Study hard and get a good L1R5/L1R4 so it opens up more options for you. For Poly courses, you don't need A Math and Pure Science so as long as you do well, you still have a chance to get into a good poly course. There's still plenty of time for you to decide :)</p>

              <p class="p1">I have recently compiled my elective history notes, summarising and reorganising information from my textbook and notes my teacher gave to me. The information in the notes created is the latest syllabus, excluding chapter 7 as it has already been tested in 2014. It has also included answers for some questions in the O'level examinations and skills for SBQ. I have also given tips and strategies for examinations (not just history) in the notes itself. </p>
              <p class="p1">As the new syllabus focuses more on the explanation section in SBQ and SEQ. Hence,</p>
              <p class="p1">The notes are also specially crafted with linking/logic statements to answer questions in the examinations, which is really important and could drop any answer to a really low level (L1) if the explanation is not explicitly stated.</p>
              <p class="p1">I would be selling each set of notes (The World in Crisis and Bi-Polarity in the Cold War) for $25. If you would like to purchase please email me at histurytwoday@gmail.com. The price may be negotiable.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I'm also quite worried for my O level result this coming week. I didn't do very well during my prelim before my national examination. Most of the papers are very unusual as compared to the papers found in our Ten Years Series (TYS). Because of my poor grades during mid year and prelims. I didn't managed to apply for DSA to Catholic Junior College(CJC) even though I did pretty well during my secondary 3. I love the school environment and the cultural there. I really wish to get in. Even though I didn't do well for my school examination and even scored F9 for my Amaths, I tried my very best to attain at least 12 for my 1LR5. If I pass my higher mother tongue, the most I have to attain is 14. I do not come from afflicted school and I'm kind of worried. In addition, I hold leadership position as a student councillor and I'm in my school team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">On the other hand, what can do if my friend is from St Joseph institution (SJI) which is afflicted to CJC and my mother's friends who is from CJC decades back. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anyone that can give me some advice on how to get into CJC?</p>

              <p>Hi there! I am currently a secondary 2 student who just got my
              streaming results and to my disappointment, I did not get the class
              I was aiming for as I did not perform as well this year.My subject
              combination for next year is Combined Science(Phy/Chem),POA,E
              Math,SS with elective Geography and Pure History and I am aspiring
              to go to a JC after O's and I really want to be in a science
              stream.However, I heard that it is difficult for me take H2 science
              or something like that (Sorry I'm not very familiar with all the H1
              H2 stuff) and I may face difficulty in coping with math and science
              as I have no pure science background and I do not take A Math. I
              was just wondering as a combined science student can I be in a
              Science stream in JC if I do well enough for O levels and which JCs
              should I aim for? Am I at a disadvantage that I am a combined
              science student in JC? Any help would be appreciated.thanks</p>
