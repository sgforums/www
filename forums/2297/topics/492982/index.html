              <p>not really. the purpose of case study is for you to analyze the case, not to write an essay based on your own knowledge. </p>
              <p>I believe some marks are in fact allocated for writing to context (by quoting the case extracts)</p>
              <p>However, own personal information can be counted for evaluation marks. </p>
              <p>There were actually many possible reasons from the case why Japan was worst.</p>
              <p>1). Central bank dont want to do anything now</p>
              <p>2). Even if tightening labour policy increase income, if your workers are unemployed... no income to talk about in the first place</p>

              <p>sales tax is ad valorem on consumers right ?_? i drew this weird ad valorem demand curve shift and got terribly confused by my weird diagram. i did use elasticity to explain though, thank goodness. on hindsight realized that the ad valorem factor is very probably a minor point markers won't care about. ._.;; btw, will we be penalized if we defined it as "fixed tax on producers" (my friend) though?</p>

              <p>i think background knowledge is great for substantiation but i don't think it's acceptable as a point in your essay itself as fire explained.</p>

              <p>i think if your points were based on the ones in the essays, e.g. deflation =&gt; recession spiral is more damanging and used japan's current deflation leading to several economic struggles which eventually may result in recession to substantiate, then it's great! but if your points are based on background knowledge e.g. quicker ageing population resulting in shrinking labour force restricting economic growth it won't be as good, but definitely not wrong either no worries. like L2 max i think bc L3 requires reference to extract + real world context.</p>
              <p>yeah i've heard predictions about FTA/globalization, for micro at least 1 market failure/structure cfm. i think macro will probably test the 4 goals, maybe SoL?</p>

Cause high and persistent inflation rate will deter foreign investments makes it harder for then to predict their future costs and revenue, hence reducing productive capacity and compromising on potential growth.

              <p>Its not a matter about whether you drew a table or not, but rather how you explained yourself. </p>
              <p>I would say it is much easier to argue that Japan's inflation is more damaging and persistent. </p>
              <p>1). Brazil is experiencing demand pull and cost push inflation, together with signs of economic growth-when incomes of people rises, it helps to offset the effects of inflation eroding the value of money, whereas for Japan, it is encountering low inflation, which means people's incomes are stagnating, yet inflation is further eroding their monies</p>
              <p>2). If you read the news, Japan's central bank has already hit rock bottom in terms of reducing interest rates (liquidity trap), recently going into negative interest rate territory, that means Japanese banks pay people to borrow to consume, which results in a lack of liquidity for banks and they go bust. Brazil, meanwhile has much more leeway in terms of monetary policy. </p>
              <p>3). Brazil's problems can be easily tackled. For example, its inflation was mainly also caused by excessive government spending on transfer payments. When incomes of Brazilians increase, they automatically pay more taxes, government welfare payments automatically reduce, which therefore acts to dampen demand pull inflation, also with economic growth, cyclical unemployment will reduce, therefore government doesnt have to pump in as much monies to reduce unemployment (which is also a cause of inflation stated)</p>
              <p>4). As for Japan, the government also decided to implement a sales tax, which will negate any interest rate measure since it further deters people from spending, therefore in the long run likely to be persistent. </p>
              <p>5). Brazil's monetary policy has also not kicked in yet. </p>
              <p>6). I think for Japan, it was mentioned clearly in the extract that with the low inflation, there was a production drop. I believe the low inflation rate will not help to increase production because the low production was caused by the sales tax. Unless you remove the sales tax, then production will improve. </p>
              <p>7). The focus of the last question should also be on comparison. If your entire essay is on how damaging high inflation is or how damaging low inflation is, i am sure it is not acceptable. Both countries are facing issues with their inflationary problems, we should zero in and talk about which country is likely to be more affected by their inflation based on their action plans and type of inflation. </p>
              <p>CA question would require an opportunity cost explanation coupled with factor endowment, with major antithesises being India's protectionism, transport costs, increasing opportunity costs of production.</p>

              But you have to argue for both sides anyway... it is a discuss question
              Many of my friends actually argued brazil, mainly because their inflation have led to lower economic growth indirectly, less capital accumulation etc.. it has also led to highercyclical unemployment, which is made worse by the higher labour costs, raising cost of production and shifting lras. It is like stagflation, very difficult to implement a policy to resolve all at once
              
              Japan mild inflation is necessary to further encourage consumer spending...
              
              i mainly talked about the subsidies leading to lower cop etc, lower opportunity costs of production... and of course the limitations. I would think variety is an important reason, lack of economic diversification, think it is mentioned in the extract

              Regarding your 1st point, higher labour costs also leads to higher cost of production, and higher level of cyclical unemployment, made worse by the fall in investments and sustained economic growth, since high inflation leads to great uncertainty to producers
              leading to lower income instead?

              <p>But you have to argue for both sides anyway… it is a discuss
              question<br> Many of my friends actually argued brazil, mainly because their
              inflation have led to lower economic growth indirectly, less
              capital accumulation etc.. it has also led to highercyclical
              unemployment, which is made worse by the higher labour costs,
              raising cost of production and shifting lras. It is like
              stagflation, very difficult to implement a policy to resolve all at
              once</p>
              <p>Japan mild inflation is necessary to further encourage consumer
              spending…</p>
              <p>i mainly talked about the subsidies leading to lower cop etc,
              lower opportunity costs of production… and of course the
              limitations. I would think variety is an important reason, lack of
              economic diversification, think it is mentioned in the extract</p>

              <p>depends on how you argue. though i would take the safe side and follow how the extract phrases it. Anyway P2 is more important</p>

              Hey for the theory of ca i just realised i didnt really talk about factor endowments, but about india govt subsidy which allow them to produce agricultural products at relativrly lower cost of production, hence lower opp cost in producing.. will i be penalised?i wrote the limitations of ca in detail for anti thesis

              <p>lol i think factor endowment is probably the only thing they are looking for since Comparative advantages is always linked to factor endowment. </p>
              <p>Based on your argument, i can subsidise cars/trucks/anything, not necessarily need to subsidize the agricultural products. But for India. because of their factor endowment whether got subsidiy or no subsidy also cannot produce capital intensive things based on extract. </p>
              <p>all the best and choose question wisely</p>

              I was trying to refer to the extract, cause they emphasised on the subsidy on agricultural...
              but at least i wrote limitations+ conclusion pretty alright hopefully
