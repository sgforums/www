              <p>seriously..</p>
              <p>All these suggestions ultimately going to lead you to make a Lan shop <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Free some more leh...think of all the overheads like air conditioning, furnishings, rental,utilities, wireless peripherals (unless <a href="mailto:wireless@sg">wireless@sg</a> la)...u wanna provide snacks and drinks..how much u gonna charge them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Confirm they will bring their own plain water or smuggle some snacks...</p>
              <p>you could have a niche area and charge students for it..</p>
              <p>For eg,</p>
              <p>If a student wants to study alone, it will be free..<br>If they want to bring some friends for discussion, then u can charge a "private" area for them ah..charge them by the hour...of coz, have to be comfy ah..like beanbags..sofas..huge table...of course, your area should be quite big and partition it carefully...make use of all the free space..</p>
              <p>It's gonna be a huge invesment on your part and maybe it will take a year or so to break even..</p>

              <p>bro not trying to say ur plan is bad but im afraid if ur targetted audiences is sec sch lvl.</p>
              <p>im afraid it will fail. why?</p>
              <p>As a sec sch student point of view, i dont tink anyone would wanna study at such a place. when i saw ur points, immediately i think of group of friends going over there to slack and hang out.</p>
              <p>If they really do that, imagine some bad kids would bring cigarettes or beer to drink there, or smoke secretly in the toilet, u might land urself into trouble with the police.</p>
              <p>Therefore, if this place is targetted to the tertiary level, things would be different.</p>
              <p>just my point of view.</p>

              <p>I don't understand why there's a need for people here to throw stones at you, but anyway, here's my piece of opinion:</p>
              <p>I for one used to pay like $5-10 per month to access the study room in a CC near my house during the O' levels period. It was the only place where I could sit down and finish hours of TYS questions non-stop. But during that time, I wished there was a much specialized service that would cater to the needs of a student. Let me give you some suggestions for your idea:</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Create sound-proof partitions to cater to both single users and group users.<br></li>
              <li>If you have a section where students can purchase meals and snacks, keep it away from the study area.</li>
              <li>If you're catering to the younger group of students (below tertiary), do away with the wireless internet access.</li>
              <li>Hire tutors to stand by to answer questions from students. Charge a premium to students who use this service.</li>

              <p>I don't understand why there's a need for people here to throw stones at you, but anyway, here's my piece of opinion:</p>
              <p>I for one used to pay like $5-10 per month to access the study room in a CC near my house during the O' levels period. It was the only place where I could sit down and finish hours of TYS questions non-stop. But during that time, I wished there was a much specialized service that would cater to the needs of a student. Let me give you some suggestions for your idea:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Create sound-proof partitions to cater to both single users and group users.<br></li>
              <li>If you have a section where students can purchase meals and snacks, keep it away from the study area.</li>
              <li>If you're catering to the younger group of students (below tertiary), do away with the wireless internet access.</li>
              <li>Hire tutors to stand by to answer questions from students. Charge a premium to students who use this service.</li>
