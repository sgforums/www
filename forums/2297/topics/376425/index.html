              <p>Qns 1 Solution</p>
              <p>First, find the total cost of the comics ($816) and dictionaries ($680).</p>
              <p>Then find the cost of 1 unit of comics ($272) and dictionaries ($340).</p>
              <p>1 unit of D - 1 unit of C = $68</p>
              <p>Quantity in 1 unit = $68/$4 = 17</p>
              <p>Therefore, there are 51 comics and 34 dictionaries.</p>
              <p>C = D - $4</p>
              <p>51C = 51D - $204</p>
              <p>51D - $204 + 34D = $1496</p>
              <p>85D = $1496 +$204 = $1700</p>
              <p>D = 1700/85 = $20</p>
              <p>~Solved by a friend</p>
              <p>Qns 3 Solution</p>
              <p>A   I               </p>
              <p>B   III</p>
              <p>A   III   III   III</p>
              <p>B   I    I     I</p>
              <p>I -&gt; a unit of $25</p>
              <p>the 1st model is a set of 1 week while the 2nd model is a set of 3wks. since we know that Ben spent 1/3 as much in the second scenario, the no. of wks in the second scenario is thus 3 times as long.</p>
              <p>if we group a set of 3 wks together (as in the 2nd model drawn), there'll be the same no. of sets for both models drawn.</p>
              <p>In a single set (1wk for 1st model, 3 wks for 2nd model), there's a difference in the how much Ann spent, which is 8 units of $25 = $200.</p>
              <p>In the total number of sets, the difference in how much Ann spent is $1350 - $150 = $1200.</p>
              <p>Hence, to find the number of sets, $1200/$200 = 6 sets</p>
              <p>This implies that the first scenario takes 6 wks while the second scenario takes 6x3=18wks. from here it's easy to get to the answer using either the first or second scenario.</p>
              <p>a) $1500 b) $450 </p>
