              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Let x = arcsin (0.6).</p>
              <p>  We want to find the value of sin 2x, which is 2 sin x cos x.</p>
              <p>  Now sin x = 0.6, by definition. With this result, draw a right-angled triangle to find cos x, which is 0.8 or 4/5.</p>
              <p>  As for your second question, let x = arcsin (-4/5) and y = arctan (4/7).</p>
              <p>  We want to find the value of cos (x + y), which is cos x cos y - sin x sin y.</p>
              <p>  Again, draw right-angled triangles to find the necessary values of trigo ratios in the expression of cos (x + y).</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>It is in the syllabus. In fact, this is the 1st time principal values of trigo ratios is in O/N syllabus. However it is ok not to know it as I am not aware of any schools that teach it. Everyone wrong together loh. kekeke</p>
              <p>For the 1st question, draw a triangle in the 1st quadrant.</p>
              <p>For the 2nd one, the triangles are in the 4th quadrant (arcsin -ve) and in the 1st quadrant (for arctan +ve).</p>
              <p>Question on principal values had been asked in the 2008 GCE N level I believe.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Many H2 Maths students struggle with inverse trigo concepts too.</p>
              <p>  Just during my last lesson, two students from IP programme clarified with me on inverse trigo. They asked if 1/(tan x) was equal to arctan x. It is a common to see students get mixed up with the ideas of reciprocal and inverse.</p>
              <p>  When we say reciprocal of tan x, we mean 1/(tan x).</p>
              <p>  When we refer to arctan x,  we mean: </p>
              <p>  k = arctan x &lt;=&gt; tan k = x.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>1st there is no apologies required. This is just a discussion not a debate/argument.</p>
              <p>2nd, I still might be wrong about those questions being the actual N level AM questions as it did not come 1st hand to me. Perhaps someone here can verify if those are the 2008 N level questions.</p>
              <p>Perhaps wee_ws could monopolise the N(Academic) Additional Mathematics TYS market by publishing it... the NA AM TYS is not available on the market at all despite there being a sizable target audience.</p>

              <p>Yes, the ShingLee TYS got some jialat questions but only when there were no existing past year questions. The geometry proof unit was especially badly done. The EM one for this year was bad because they spread the 2008 questions into the topics instead of having it as a paper at the end.</p>
              <p>However, it is the best organised among the various TYS with year by year questions not omitted where they exist. For the E Maths one, the summary points is especially useful because I can't be bothered going thru 4 years' of textbooks. In fact, I asked my lone sec 1 student to buy a copy so that she does not have to hunt thru the textbook for a concept.</p>
              <p>Every year, I buy one copy of the SAP, Dyna and ShingLee TYS to compare. And almost every year, my choice have been the ShingLee Pass with Distinction as the main material with the Dyna Year by Year format TYS for the final revision which I prefer to be done in a paper format.</p>
              <p>If I were to live with only 1 TYS, I would buy the ShingLee one...</p>

              <p>I have TYS under my name before in the past.</p>
              <p>But the pay is very little as compared to teaching or tutoring.</p>
              <p>The market for "N" level Add Maths is too small and the minimum print for each</p>
              <p>TYS is about 1000 - 2000 copies. So, Dyna might not be interested.</p>
              <p>Hi Mikethm, Dyna provides the service of compiling of actual past year exam</p>
              <p>papers for less popular subjects at a low fee ie Dyna will compile the actual "N"</p>
              <p>level Add Maths questions into a booklet and sells it for a few dollars.</p>
              <p>Dyna had helped me to compile the "AO" level Maths questions into a booklet in</p>
              <p>the past for my "AO" Maths students.</p>

              <p>You can approach Dyna to ask for the compilation of the H2 physics examination questions year by year. </p>
              <p>You will need to go to its premises to request for the compilation.</p>
