              <p>I suggest you take less subjects and concentrate on them rather than be a jack of all trades.</p>
              <p>Singapore education system is mostly a system designed to dumb down people, so take more subjects to me is also worthless.</p>

              <p>Triple science is not easy but if u feel u can cope and have the interest, u can always give it a try and at most drop 1 before ur O's if u feel its not suitable for you.</p>
              <p>Each of the 3 sciences is quite different, physics with its concepts and alot of calculations, chemistry which requires alot of understanding and biology which generally requires very good memory since its mostly memorising and vomitting out the textbook more than the other 2.</p>
              <p>If u feel you can handle it, just take all 3 and try. Any questions feel free to post on the homework forum and people will offer their help with ur questions.</p>

              <p>I took double science since my sch didn't allow me to do triple science and it was fine for me. Maths and science were always my bettter subjects so i feel its fine to take triple science if u have the interest and ability.</p>
              <p>Without trying, u will not know whether u like it or not. There is still a chance to drop it later on if you really don't like it but there is no way you can take it later on in sec 4 etc and its very hard to take a science for A's that you never taken for O's</p>

              <p>The requirement for taking them is chemistry with another science be it bio or phy. What knowledge u need will be taught in uni for the biological side but without the chem background u cannot handle all the organic chemistry involved,</p>

              <p>Hi BillaMax. If you think you can cope with triple sciences, then I think you should go for it. To me, studying more subjects means that I have more coverage and in addition, I enjoy learning more things; they sort of add more 'colours' to my life. Haha. (I'm sane when I typed this out. xD) Honestly, if you can cope, go for triple sciences. ^^  I believe that the coursework taught in secondary school ensures that one has the basic principles and concepts of a particular subject, readying students for further advanced studies in JC or polytechnics.</p>
              <p>For Biology, just like what the other forumers had said, it is mostly memorising, though now, it seems that the system is shifting towards a mix of memory work and application. Compared to the old syllabus which concerns the years before 2008, the new syllabus is more of a 'thinking' rather than memorising and regurgitating, judging from other schools' preliminary examination papers from 2008 and 2009.</p>
              <p>For Physics, it is really understanding of basic concepts and application with some calculations to do. Somehow, I just don't get Physics and... my Physics is not too good. :( Hahas. (I hope this won't discourage you from taking it. &gt;&lt;)</p>
              <p>For Chemistry, again, understanding and memory work. Somewhat similar to biology. =)</p>
              <p>From my two years of experience taking triple sciences plus double humanities (Literature Elective + Social Studies + Pure Geography), taking triple sciences is not an easy job as one have to juggle with quite a handful of subjects. My Physics was the poorest, and I struggled very badly with it... so I didn't feel too good at that time but I didn't give up because I know Physics may widen my scope in the future, even if it doesn't do so, it can help in terms of  the way of thinking and analysing Physics questions... They can be applied to other subjects as well. ^^ My biology and chemistry are average, so I didn't really have to worry about them, though I could just save my agony and not take  Physics, my nightmare. &gt;w&lt;</p>
              <p>Last but not least, the level of difficulty of the subjects at upper secondary level and lower secondary level are somewhat 'worlds apart'. You learnt things at a deeper level. So, you have to think carefully. If I were you, I would take triple sciences and if I really cannot make it and at my wits' ends, then I will drop my weakest science like what dkcx had suggested. As I have not been through JC yet, I ain't too sure if the things learnt in secondary school will help in JC, though I'm sure that ingesting more knowledge surely won't harm one, as long as he can balance out everything and cope with the other subjects. ^^</p>
              <p>Remember, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask either here in the forum, or your peers and loving teachers in school. ^^ All the best to you! =D</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
              <p>Generally, chem I feel is a must take due to the practicality involved. Physics / biology would be more of a personal preference, but I would say that the best way to go would be to follow your interests, or pick the lesser evil. Sciences can be relied on to complete the number of subjects needed requirement if you don't want to take humanities.</p>
              <p>But most importantly, just follow your interests. Don't be like me, taking physics for 2 years and suffering through all the hair-pulling moments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
