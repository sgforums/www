            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey guys, as o levels is coming very very soon. I'm also very worried about my A math. I want to get A1/A2/B3 but i'm afraid it's not very practical when things are already this late. I got C6 during Mid-year when i did not revise or practice at all for it.. However i realized time is running out and i think my A math is still kinda weak especially in Integration, Differentiation and Trigonometry. I really want to improve my A math as soon as possible, but should i hire a tutor or i can actually do it myself with the help of school teachers? i'm willing to work very hard!</p></div>

So i'm left with 6 subjects. The most dangerous 2 subjects are A math and Combined Humanities, my amath is not really as good and you know combined humanities is just a subject full of surprises.. Actually i have to stay back in school until 4.30 because that is when my curriculum lesson ends, so i don't really have time for extra lessons. But then now we are just doing papers and asking help from teachers during lesson. Do i really need a tutor for A math? I'm hoping for A1/A2 for my most dangerous 2 subjects.</p>

              <p>From what is stated in your posts, it seems that you are aiming to go JC not Poly, am I right? Because even the most 'dangerous' subjects you are actually aiming A1/A2. So may I assume you are aiming a L1R5&lt;10 to quailify for a good JC?</p>
              <p>If that is the case, I suggest you go and find a tutor. Yes, it is highly possible to archieve a B3/B4 in O on your own since the O level paper should be a little bit easier than your school ones, but if you want to secure a A1/A2, you'd better find someone to help you.</p>
              <p>In fact, I used to teach A Maths tuition in the past, but now I am not that willing to take up any more secondary student since I am a JC Maths teacher now, unless the student does not give me too much troubles because of attitude.</p>
              <p>My ex-JC teacher(ex HoD of NJC and RVHS)  is running a tuition centre now, if you are interested you can reply here. I will give you some more details, but be prepared that he should be charging more than other undergraduate/graduate tutor</p>

              <p>I spent 3 months purely on econs between July and Prelims, doing little work on my remaining maths and physics subjects because I was confident, perhaps a little too confident, in those subjects <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>The steps I took:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1: Strengthening the basic building blocks of knowledge</span></strong><br>Basically, I read through 4 different textbooks (3 on top of the one the school recommended). The 3 extra textbooks was borrowed from school library. I went through the case studies and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how theories are applied to case studies</strong></span> in great detail.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 2: Analyse good essays</strong></span><br>I photostated all high scoring essays by my friends, with teachers comments included. Analyse where the ticks and "GOOD!" comes in. Those are paragraphs or sentences worth analysing and learning. Analyse how the points was put forward, supported and analysed.</p>
              <p>I also photostated economic essays from The Economist at times, and some other economic magazine (I forgot the name, but has now stopped publication). However, I didn't have the time or motivation to really read them in the end.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 3: Collect, understand and remember personal case studies of real life</strong></span><br>I did some amount of newspaper cuttings and recording of observations of real life economic events.</p>
              <p>i.e. At my time, Starhub was a new entrant to the market. I studied how this additional telco comes into the originally duopoly telco industry. I linked it to price wars, kinked demand curve. And being a infrastructure intensive business, I linked it to average fixed cost, average variable cost, marginal cost, etc. I did newspaper cuttings as well as try to understand what happened and why Starhub could come into this market and succeed. (As a matter of fact, this paid off, and I'm a happy shareholder of Starhub now).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 4: Do your practices</strong></span><br>The above 3 steps are sufficient for you to understand and probably apply. But the real test comes from you being able to write the essays. I wrote lots of essays and compared with the better essays by myself.</p>
              <p>On top of that, I was extremely thankful to my economics teacher at that time, who helped mark my extra essays at that time. It was actually homework dued long ago, but I had to postpone doing it because of Physics Olympiad competition, SYF, Chess Competition, as well as extra lessons and homework for my S papers. Without her, I probably wouldn't have succeeded in scoring my A.</p>
              <p>When Steps 1 to 3 are done, write more, and not read more. Reading makes you good at reading, writing makes you good at writing. Exams is about writing and not reading.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 3: Collect, understand and remember personal case studies of real life</strong></span><br>I did some amount of newspaper cuttings and recording of observations of real life economic events.</p>
              <p>i.e. At my time, Starhub was a new entrant to the market. I studied how this additional telco comes into the originally duopoly telco industry. I linked it to price wars, kinked demand curve. And being a infrastructure intensive business, I linked it to average fixed cost, average variable cost, marginal cost, etc. I did newspaper cuttings as well as try to understand what happened and why Starhub could come into this market and succeed. (As a matter of fact, this paid off, and I'm a happy shareholder of Starhub now).</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 4: Do your practices</strong></span><br>The above 3 steps are sufficient for you to understand and probably apply. But the real test comes from you being able to write the essays. I wrote lots of essays and compared with the better essays by myself.</p>
              <p>On top of that, I was extremely thankful to my economics teacher at that time, who helped mark my extra essays at that time. It was actually homework dued long ago, but I had to postpone doing it because of Physics Olympiad competition, SYF, Chess Competition, as well as extra lessons and homework for my S papers. Without her, I probably wouldn't have succeeded in scoring my A.</p>
              <p>When Steps 1 to 3 are done, write more, and not read more. Reading makes you good at reading, writing makes you good at writing. Exams is about writing and not reading.</p>

              <p>Dear Swiftwinds,</p>
              <p>AMaths is not tough, and just requires a thorough understanding of concepts, and loads of practice -- not just TYS, but also the textbook questions.  If you're using Panpac and need step-by-step solutions, just go over to http://ascklee.org/.  Solutions to the other AMath textbooks are being uploaded from time to time.  Do check it out.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
