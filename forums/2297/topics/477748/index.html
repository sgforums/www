              <p>Hey guys, I'm a student in an express stream, currently sec 4 this year. I'm bound to take my O levels this year, but there has been a burning question in my head. What do I do after O levels? Am I supposed to go to JC or Poly? What courses should I take? What stream should I persue? So far, I've pretty much screwed up my Sec 3 year. At the moment, this is my subject combination:</p>
              <p>- English</p>
              <p>- Chinese</p>
              <p>- Maths</p>
              <p>- A maths</p>
              <p>-Physics</p>
              <p>- Science (Chem/Bio)</p>
              <p>- Humans (SS/Geog)</p>
              <p>I actually plan on dropping A maths because it's a topic I simply cannot grasp. I've been failing throughout the year despite constant mugging and I really wanna get it out of the way so that I can focus on the other 6 subjects I'm taking. I plan on taking an Art stream so that I can persue Law at a University level. I heard that Law is more lobesided towards the subjects in the arts stream, plus A maths for O levels is not compulsary. Hopefully I can study overseas since overseas Unis provide more exposure and a holistic approach as compared to local Universities in Singapore. I did a bit of research myself and I found out that some (if not all) JCs offer Knowledge and Inquiry as a subject. I'm guessing it's something like debate of sort? I'm assuming this will help out a lot in helping me get into the Uni course I want. So far I'm assuming that the absolute must subjects to help me get into Law are KI, Econs, Hist/Geog and Lit, the rest can be otherwise. Any advice on what I should do? I live near the East side so JCs like CJC, MJC and TJC are being considered. Do you guys know any other JCs that offer the subjects at a H2 level without the need for A maths? Otherwise, are there any Poly courses I can consider too? Thanks a bunch :)</p>

              I would advice you to go to a jc.firstly not only it is only 2 years but you have a much higher chances of uni admission especially for pretigious courses such as medicine etc.
              in order to take knowledge and inquiry, you must have achieved at least an a2 for your o level english and you would need an interview by the jc.
              Instead of worrying about the subject combination, I would like to ask you which subjects are you strong in?the reason is because law requires almost all A in order to be shortlisted, so the subjects you study you must be confident of scoring in..
              If you do not want h2 maths, you can only enter the art stream, with the exception of yjc

              <p>It can be easy to score and also no for some.Having taken the O level route before in a triple science stream,I have witnessed five of my friends who have dropped A maths to focus on the rest.They flunk their A maths around sec 4.Eventually,they had little choice but to drop.</p>
              <p>However,if you were to drop A maths,it will be a slight problem in applying for jc science stream.A level foundation is key in Jc maths but not the determinant factor.If you can work slightly harder,I can assure you do well.</p>
              <p>Anyway,one of my friends,dropped A maths but took pure double science and pure humanities,is doing well in Jc arts stream.</p>
              <p>Of course,it will be a risk to take and you have to ensure that you do well for each subject.</p>
              <p>Overall,do not be turned down to drop A maths and consider this option if it is wearing you down.</p>

              <p>Advice: Work hard and go to local University. Local U is better than many Foreign U. (besides, the Local U fees are heavily subsidized for Singapore Citizens) <em>Unless, the Foreign U you want to go is better than our Local Us. </em></p>

              <p>I am from a science stream jc now.Though I am not pursuing arts in jc,I am aware of the arts stream in my school.</p>
              <p>It's certainly glad to know that you are considering your options overseas.I am aiming for overseas too but a different course.This is due to the hard-core competition in local uni and I prefer to diversify myself when studying abroad.More time for yourself to be creative and learn more.</p>
              <p>If you are really on about pursuing arts stream,go for it.A maths is subsidary.If you can excel in the last moment,stay on.Should the otherwise occur,abandon the ship.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Right now,you need to focus on English,chinese(focus on this until mid-year) Half a year is enough to revise/recap/practise the other subjects,but not enough to drill foundations.You have to build subjects foundation + chinese hardcore mode.</span></p>
              <p>Ki is not necessary to get into law.However,<span style="color: #00ff00;">it is an advantage when you go overseas to study.</span>You will be equipped with the analytical skills which you will cover in law school.</p>
              <p>If you get in to Jc, join debate club.You will be ready in terms of presentation skills for law.</p>
              <p>If you want to get in to poly,a course you may wish to consider is psychology.It may not be in line with law.However,you learn critical thinking skills that apply in law.</p>
              <p>Last but not least<span style="color: #ffcc00;">,do not be too focused on tertiary education life as of now.I was caught in that quadrangle of envying my seniors and I ended up sidetracking.</span>The main objective is to get rid of O levels and move on.</p>
              <p>To enhance your learning capacity,you may want to take up reliable tuition to hone your knowledge to be ahead in class or to score exceptional grades.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">All the best in your O level year and may you make the right decision~Jiayou!</span></p>

              If one puts in the effort, they can surely improve their maths unless they have problems understanding basic math concepts...I am encouraging Ts not to give up easily because with o levels amath paper is alot easier than school paper...with strong concepts he difinitely can score well in the o levels

              <p>Well as I said I screwed up my Sec 3 foundation really bad. It's not until EOY that I actually realised the full urgency of the matter. Right now I stay back in school every alternate day for about an hour just for revision. I'd bump that up to 2 hours every day if exams are nearing. I don't go for any forms of tuitions, although since it's my O level year I might consider. In sec 3, I basically didn't do any form of studying, I was the typical last-minute type of student. Anyway I've got my hours in check right now, I'm just wondering if I started a little too late :/</p>

              <p>1.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Come up with a studying routine,it keeps you on task.</span></p>
              <p>2.Try not to spend so much time finding a place to study&gt;have a fixed spot for revision.</p>
              <p>3.You can maximise your efficiency each day by clocking up to 3h(no more than 4) during school days. Of course,you should also have a rest day,perhaps Sunday?Saturday,you can have more time for revision.</p>
              <p>4.I believe that reading notes is recaping.Learning is truly practising a lot.With practise,you can slowly become less reliant on recaping.Not only are you firmer with your concepts and also it helps with memory work.</p>

              <p>6.Don't go all out,only do so 1 month before every major exam.</p>
