              <p>it is a lamentable fact that history has downgraded to such an extent of having different categories....it remains the coldest and most unpopular subject - this also apparently implies that many do not have interests in the past...the realistic side of moving forward, though not wrong....but we have become "ungratified" and forgetting how our ancestry built up the foundations of where we r today. Women would be interested if u r pursuing finance than long winded memory crap of dates without realizing that history is a powerful subject and tool of social perception.</p>
              <p>Whether H2 or pure o level, I am not suggesting anything except for your own interests and own capability which you should know yourself. For me, SEA history is as interesting and most important towards understanding of our region. That could be useful of knowing our regional problems which directly affect us.</p>

Of course, as mentioned, I'm really passionate about it too! However, people have been telling me that If I didn't take a pure subject at O-Levels, I should not take it at H2 level as I will suffer greatly. In fact, SEA history is completely new to me! So, what do you think I should do? </p></div>

              <p>not to worry so much as our elite system does not place history as a golden subject...i would suggest u take up self learning outside your exam syllabus....if u r fine now....stay at that pace...</p>
              <p>remember, do what u can achieve but not to overstretch as to affect other more "important" subjects...the objective of history is to know the past so that you better understand the present and managing the future....human life is but a vicious circle....</p>
              <p>glad to know your interest in history....it is the beginning of true human consciousness and the great understanding of human nature....</p>
              <p>but mark my words...do place greater emphasis on subjects valued more by our elite system..your future employers and sg gals are most likely $ analytical than your knowledge house of nostalgias</p>

              <p><br>Just because you felt that it was a heavier workload (which i DO concede, in fact) than many expected, and that it's a huge jump even from Pure History, don't be so quick to dissuade him.</p>
              <p>Let me give you the lowdown on H2 History.</p>
              <p>In H2 History, you effectively have to write 8 essays (2 papers, 3 hours long each, 4 essays per paper, equating to 45 mintues per essay).</p>
              <p>One essay should ideally be 8 paragraphs long (Intro + 6 Body Paragraphs + Conclusion) with each paragraph being half a page long or thereabout, so be prepared for a sore wrist/finger/hand after each H2 History paper/test.</p>
              <p>There are also 6 themes in total to study, 3 themes for International History and 3 themes for Southeast Asian History.</p>
              <p>-</p>
              <p>First and foremost, excelling in H2 History requires a good command of the English language. It's fundamentally a humanities/arts subject, afterall. Without it, I suggest you reconsider taking History, even at the H1 level.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you'll need good teachers (goes without saying). <span style="line-height: 1.231;">H</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">istory isn't just memorizing and learning mere facts and dates. If it were, then anyone could score for the subject without a teacher or tutor to guide him/her along. Your teachers need to teach you to learn how to learn, learn how to argue, and make the lesson interesting enough for you to remember and appreciate the great amount of content and arguments you'll come across in the subject.</span></p>
              <p>Thirdly, I would say you'll need the passion and the fervour for history. To SECURE (not score, secure) a distinction, you need to do reading outside of your lecture notes, which, depending on the college, may or may not be entirely useful to you.</p>
              <p>Also, writing a H2 History essay is arguably more taxing than even a H2 Literature essay at times, as you'll need to not only memorize pure facts, but chronological chain of events as well. You need to be able to analyze things well, not just memorize and throw it back on a piece of paper.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents.</p>
              <p>My final advice is, if your English is sufficiently proficient, and you think that you like the subject, the rest can handle itself.</p>
              <p>And to answer your very initial question, no, you will NOT be at a disadvantage. Pure and Elective History at O' Level provides nice background knowledge to tie in with H2 History's start of the Cold War period, but it's otherwise irrelevant and such knowledge will not be assessed on. No worries.</p>
              <p>Just FYI - my Combined Humanities (SS+History) in O' Levels scored B4, yet I scored in my Promotional Exams a "B" Grade for H2 History.</p>

              <p>Hi, I took elec hist in sec school and yet still take H2 hist in JC even though my grade is not fantastic. </p>
              <p>Basically, the difference from H2 hist and sec elec hist is that there is an additional component of SEA hist and Int hist is studied at greater scope and depth, ie your cold war is more complicated and got new conflicts to study. </p>
              <p>Exam format is different. H2 hist requires you to sit for 2 papers, Int and SEA separately. Each paper is 3hours long and you are required to write 1 source-base essay and 3 essays.</p>
              <p>Might sound tough at first but after awhile you will get used to it. But maybe its just because I'm a arts student. My classmates too did not really have trouble with hist (econs is more of a bitch). However, ace-ing hist is not difficult, national average is about 30% A which is quite high IMO. Utimately, its still your choice. and whatever <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/270859">Casopia-maplesea</a> said not really true. I doubt he took H2 hist before or maybe he took it ages ago.</span></p>
