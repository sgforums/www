              <p>So, the question goes like this:</p>
              <p>Which of the following elements burns in air to give a compound which, in water, gives a solution of pH 2?</p>
              <p>1) Aluminium</p>
              <p>2)Calcium</p>
              <p>3)Hydrogen</p>
              <p>4)Sulphur</p>
              <p>An oxide (burns in air), which gives H+ ions when dissociated in water (hydrogen?) Am I on the correct train of thought? Is an acid and base reaction reversible in the sense that the compound formed can be broken back into their original forms?</p>
              <p>Secondly, whats the difference between acid and base? And whats the main point behind memorising the stupid basic/acidic/neutral/amphoteric oxide thing?</p>
              <p>How are we supposed to differentiate hydrochloric acid from sulphuric acid? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Which of the following elements burns in air to give a compound which, in water, gives a solution of pH 2?</p>
              <p>1) Aluminium</p>
              <p>2)Calcium</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>pH 2 indicates an acidic solution, which is produced by dissolving non-metal oxides in water, which must hence be sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide (which forms sulfurous acid and sulfuric acid respectively).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; An oxide (burns in air), which gives H+ ions when dissociated in water (hydrogen?) Am I on the correct train of thought? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, for instance, SO3 + H2O --&gt; H2SO4 --&gt; 2H+ + SO4 2-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is an acid and base reaction reversible in the sense that the compound formed can be broken back into their original forms? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes of course, you'll explore more about this at 'A' levels. Here's a sneak preview :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Consider the proton transfer (ie. acid-base reaction) between ammonia and water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NH3 + H2O &lt;&lt;&lt;---&gt; NH4+ + OH-</p>
              <p>NH4+ + OH- &lt;---&gt;&gt;&gt; NH3 + H2O</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When ammonia (base) is protonated (ie. proton transferred from the acid, water, to ammonia), it forms ammonium cation (conjugate acid).</p>
              <p>When water (acid) is deprotonated (ie. proton transferred from the acid, water, to ammonia), it forms hydroxide anion (conjugate base).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The NH3 (base) has become NH4+ which is now a conjugate acid, because it now has a proton that it can give (which is the function of any acid, to give protons).</p>
              <p>The H2O (acid) has become OH- which is now a conjugate base, because it now has the capacity to accept (back) a proton (which is the function of any base, to accept protons). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, whats the difference between acid and base? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'O' level definition uses Arrhenius definition :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arrhenius</strong>: According to this definition developed by the <a title="Sweden" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Sweden"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Swedish</span></span></a> chemist <a title="Svante Arrhenius" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Svante Arrhenius</span></span></a>, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>), which are carried as <a title="Hydronium" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Hydronium"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">hydronium</span></span></a> ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) when dissolved in <a title="Water" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Water"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">water</span></span></a>, while bases are substances that increase the concentration of <a title="Hydroxide" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Hydroxide"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">hydroxide</span></span></a> ions (OH<sup>-</sup>). This definition limits acids and bases to substances that can dissolve in water. Around 1800, many <a title="France" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/France"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">French</span></span></a> chemists, including <a title="Antoine Lavoisier" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Antoine Lavoisier</span></span></a>, incorrectly believed that all acids contained <a title="Oxygen" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Oxygen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">oxygen</span></span></a>. Indeed the modern German word for oxygen is <em>Sauerstoff</em> (lit. sour substance), as is the Afrikaans word for oxygen <em>suurstof</em>, with the same meaning. <a title="England" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/England"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">English</span></span></a> chemists, including <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sir Humphry Davy" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Sir_Humphry_Davy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sir Humphry Davy</span></span></a>, at the same time believed all acids contained hydrogen. Arrhenius used this belief to develop this definition of acid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'A' level definition uses Bronsted-Lowry definition and Lewis definition :</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="Brønsted-Lowry" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Br%C3%B8nsted-Lowry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Brønsted-Lowry</span></span></a></strong>: According to this definition, an acid is a <a title="Proton" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Proton"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">proton</span></span></a> (<a title="Hydrogen" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Hydrogen"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">hydrogen</span></span></a> nucleus) donor and a base is a proton acceptor. The acid is said to be dissociated after the proton is donated. An acid and the corresponding base are referred to as <a title="Conjugate acid" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Conjugate_acid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">conjugate acid</span></span></a>-base pairs. Brønsted and Lowry independently formulated this definition, which includes water-insoluble substances not in the Arrhenius definition. Acids according to this definition are variously referred to as Brønsted acids, Brønsted-Lowry acids, proton acids, protic acids, or protonic acids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Lewis</strong>: According to this definition developed by <a title="Gilbert N. Lewis" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Gilbert_N._Lewis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gilbert N. Lewis</span></span></a>, an acid is an electron-pair acceptor and a base is an electron-pair donor. (These are frequently referred to as "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Lewis acid" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Lewis_acid"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lewis acids</span></span></a>" and "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Lewis base" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Lewis_base"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lewis bases</span></span></a>," and are <a title="Electrophile" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Electrophile"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">electrophiles</span></span></a> and <a title="Nucleophile" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Nucleophile"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">nucleophiles</span></span></a>, respectively, in <a title="Organic chemistry" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Organic_chemistry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">organic chemistry</span></span></a>; Lewis bases are also <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ligands" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Ligands"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">ligands</span></span></a> in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Coordination compound" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Coordination_compound"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">coordination chemistry</span></span></a>.) Lewis acids include substances with no transferable <a class="mw-redirect" title="Protons" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Protons"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">protons</span></span></a> (ie H<sup>+</sup> hydrogen ions), such as <a title="Iron(III) chloride" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Iron(III)_chloride"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">iron(III) chloride</span></span></a>, and hence the Lewis definition of an acid has wider application than the Brønsted-Lowry definition. In fact, the term <strong>Lewis acid</strong> is often used to exclude protic (Brønsted-Lowry) acids. The Lewis definition can also be explained with <a title="Molecular orbital" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Molecular_orbital"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">molecular orbital</span></span></a> theory. In general, an acid can receive an electron pair in its lowest unoccupied orbital (<a class="mw-redirect" title="LUMO" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/LUMO"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">LUMO</span></span></a>) from the highest occupied orbital (<a class="mw-redirect" title="HOMO" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/HOMO"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">HOMO</span></span></a>) of a base. That is, the HOMO from the base and the LUMO from the acid combine to a bonding molecular orbital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; And whats the main point behind memorising the stupid basic/acidic/neutral/amphoteric oxide thing? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So that you know which substances can react with which, and how they react, and what are the products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 'O' levels, you are only required to be familiar with 3 amphoteric oxides : aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, and lead(II) oxide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being metals, they react normally as basic oxides. But because they are amphoteric oxides, they can react as acidic oxides too. At 'O' levels, you need only know the name (and not the formula, that's 'A' levels) of the salts that are produced when these amphoteric oxides act as acidic oxides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg. aluminium oxide + sodium hydroxide --&gt; sodium aluminate.</p>
              <p>Eg. zinc oxide + sodium hydroxide --&gt; sodium zincate.</p>
              <p>Eg. lead(II) oxide + sodium hydroxide --&gt; sodium plumbate*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(*plumbing pipes in the toilets were traditionally made of lead metal)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; How are we supposed to differentiate hydrochloric acid from sulphuric acid? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HCl is a strong monoprotic (monobasic) acid, while H2SO4 is a strong diprotic (dibasic) acid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HCl contains Cl- ions, while H2SO4 contains SO4 2- ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, you can distinguish the two acids on the basis of the above points. The easiest way involves the latter point, ie. by verifying the presence of the SO4 2- sulfate ions, by use of aqueous barium nitrate, which produces a ppt (which is barium sulfate solid) when sulfate ions are present.</p>

              <p>The reason why you have this problem (regarding this concept), is (not your fault at all, the blame lies with, or is) due to the oversimplified nature of the 'O' levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you can understand better after reading this (if not, then no worries, you'll eventually understand when you explore Chemistry at 'A' levels).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carbon monoxide is a neutral oxide, which means it does not react with bases/alkalis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Btw, an alkali is a base in aqueous state. Not all bases can exist as alkalis. But all alkalis are themselves bases. Eg. Na2O(s) and NaOH(aq) are bases, but only NaOH(aq) is an alkali, Na2O(s) is not an alkali.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carbon dioxide is an acidic oxide, which means it will react with bases/alkalis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how does carbon dioxide function as an acidic oxide? (This is the 1st part which donkhead333 is confused over, so here goes...) Carbon dioxide is acidic because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, which has the capacity to donate protons (ie. H+ ions), which (the protons) are accepted by the base/alkali, eg. sodium hydroxide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CO2 + H2O --&gt; H2CO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H2CO3 + NaOH --&gt; H2O + NaHCO3</p>
              <p>or H2CO3 + 2NaOH --&gt; 2H2O + Na2CO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 'O' levels, you may also write it summarily (ie. you summarize the above equations) as :</p>
              <p>CO2 + NaOH --&gt; NaHCO3</p>
              <p>CO2 + 2NaOH --&gt; H2O + Na2CO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(This is the 2nd part which donkhead333 is confused over, so here goes...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since CO2 has the capacity (or potential) to form carbonic acid when dissolved in water, we consider CO2 an acidic oxide, even if we don't actually dissolve it in water. (In other words, you don't have to first dissolve CO2 in water before you call it an acidic oxide.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that CO2 (or SO2 or SO3) has the capacity to react with aqueous bases/alkalis, because CO2 (or SO2 or SO3) first dissolves to form carbonic acid (or sulfurous acid or sulfuric acid). However, many 'O' level students are not aware of this because they are taught to write the summary equation directly, without actually understanding the mechanism properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, at this point (if you're not confused and want to learn more), it may be relevant to point out that certain acidic oxides, may indeed react directly with certain bases, under certain conditions, without water present.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg. Silicon dioxide, SiO2, is an acidic oxide; but it is inert (ie. does not react, does not behave as an acid) with aqueous alkalis or solid bases. It will only react with molten bases (ie. under conditions of high temperature), such as molten sodium hydroxide, NaOH, or molten sodium oxide, Na2O.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SiO2 + Na2O (molten) --&gt; Na2SiO3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SiO2 + NaOH (molten) --&gt; Na2SiO3 + H2O</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes. Further info :</p>
              <p>Zinc hydroxide, is not an "alkali" (because as you say, it's not soluble), but it is more properly called an "amphoteric hydroxide" (so it's both a basic hydroxide, as well as an acidic hydroxide).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_hydroxide">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_hydroxide</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, only ''SPA'' hydroxides are totally soluble right? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's dangerous to over-generalize to say "ONLY" such and such are fully soluble. Yes, these 3 hydroxides are certainly fully soluble, but there are also others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about this at 'O' levels; you have your Qualitative Analysis data sheet to help you figure out which hydroxides are soluble and which are not.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason why in the AQUEOUS (which means "dissolved in water") state, ionic compounds (specifically those that are soluble in water, eg. nitrates... as to why some compounds are soluble while others are not, that's for you to enjoy at 'A' levels... don't unwrap all your gifts at once!) are able to apparently 'separate' from each other, and move freely in solution, is because :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of the cations and anions being 'stuck' to each other, they are now 'stuck' or 'bonded' to water molecules instead (though it is not always 'covalent bonds', depending on the ions involved, the interactions may simply be electrostatic attraction with water).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Garrick mentioned the ions are attracted to the "H+ ions and OH- ions of water", to be somewhat more precise, the cations are attracted (or "bonded"; to be precise, "ion-dipole interactions") with the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms of water molecules, while the anions are attracted (or "bonded"; to be precise, "ion-dipole interactions") with the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms of the water molecules.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As to why the hydrogen atoms of water are partially positively charged, and why the oxygen atoms of water are partially negatively charged (hence, as Garrick mentioned, water is a POLAR molecule), it is because (and <a href="/users/237724">donkhead333</a> mentioned this term) oxygen is more ELECTRONEGATIVE than hydrogen (a more electronegative atom will draw/shift/polarize the electrons in its bonds to become slightly closer to itself, and slightly away from the less electronegative atom it is bonded with. For instance, in the H-O-H water molecule, the electrons in the two bonds are closer to oxygen and further from hydrogen, hence resulting in partial charges on the atoms). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in effect, the ions (in aqueous state, ie. dissolved in water) are now "bonded" or "attracted" to water molecules, instead of being "stuck" to each other. This is the reason why soluble ionic compounds in the aqueous state can conduct electricity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, as to why ionic compounds in the molten state conducts electricity, it is because the high heat energy causes the ions to become so kinetically excited that they are able to overcome the electrostatic attraction (not completely, but just enough) so that they (all the ions, both cations and anions) are able to move relatively freely, just like a liquid (eg. in liquid water, water molecules slide over each other freely). Hence, with mobile ions, electricity can be conducted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note that in metal (eg. wires), electricity is the flow of electrons.</p>
              <p>In ionic solutions or molten state, electricity is the flow of ions.</p>
              <p>It's fine whether it's electrons or ions, because both are CHARGED PARTICLES. Which is what electricity is all about.</p>
