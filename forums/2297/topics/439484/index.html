              <p>It could be quite a daunting experience if your child always makes a fuss every time you mention the word "homework". Parents could waste the whole day reminding them to do their homework. Homework eventually becomes something hated by both children and parents. Just to sit down and start doing their homework becomes a stressful event.</p>
              <p>For similar children that don't like to do homework, a more 'fun' approach is necessary. Parents will have to get involved as much as possible as the child will never get on with his/her homework alone. Praise the child for his/her good behaviour, effort and good work. Encourage the child as much as possible, tell them that you believe in them and that they can do it and that you will help them. For younger children, you can make a prize chart. If your child gets to do the homework without fuss, they will get to stick a star under their name, and at the end of the week they will get a treat. Make reading time more fun. Sit somewhere comfortable, surrounded with cushions and soft toys or even in bed. Read in turns, act the story, make a play out of the story. Choose books that have different characters in them and are more fun to read.</p>
              <p>For older children, ask them whether they have homework and whether they need your help. Tell them that you would like to have a look at the homework once it is finished. Give them advice on where to find information that would help them with their homework, like the internet (and how to search for it), library etc. Provide them with general guidance and advice. Help them prioritize and show interest in what the do.</p>
              <p>Setting a routine for a child is quite important, as the will know exactly when it is time to do their homework. Some like to do it straight after school, some after having watched their favourite programmes, some after their dinner or after playing a game. Of course they should have a place allocated to them where they can do their homework in a peaceful atmosphere</p>
