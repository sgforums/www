              <p>i have a few question to ask all our brother and sister</p>
              <p>1)and write down your thoughts.?</p>
              <p>Here are some questions to guide you:</p>
              <p>2)"...that educating a person only in terms of a cognitive mind and not in terms of values and morals is to create new sources of threat and danger to society." Do you agree with this statement? What does it mean?</p>
              <p>3)Do you consider yourself an "educated person"? Some people think that one can learn from every experience, encounter, interaction. Do you agree?</p>
              <p>4)What are your views on Singapore's education system? What do you think are its merits and demerits? If you could introduce one subject into the secondary school curriculum, what subject would it be and why? ..</p>
              <p>can anyone anwer those question thanks<br>thanks cheers</p>

              		meaning was defined in terms of purpose and goals, but, as teleology 
              		fell into disrepute, meaning came to mean context as a whole (a belief

              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>For many years, 
              the experience of Americans in their academic institutions has not been helping,

              <p class="style120"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>That experience has tended to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">a kind

              years) a petty bourgeois outlook. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>On the higher levels of the system, this has 
              been supplemented by a steadily narrowing of training for a place in the 
              bureaucratic structures which now dominate American life, in business, in 
              government, in education itself, in religion, the law, medicine, and the 
              defense forces. This is reflected in earlier, and in more and more narrow, 
              specialization and in the increasing pedantic nature of so much of the work 
              done in all fields.</span></p>

              leaves us facing gigantic problems to whose understanding and solution the 
              existing educational structure has little to contribute (that is why they became 
              gigantic). </span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This can be seen most clearly by asking ourselves the simple

              these questions, there is no answer, for the simple reason that the great 
              problems of our day do not fall into any one academic discipline, and, indeed, 
              cannot be dealt with by committees made up of persons from different academic

              using analysis rather than synthesis in seeking answers to problems; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              assumption of single-factor causation rather than pluralistic, ecological 
              causation; and </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span class="style12"><span class="style27"><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70"><span class="style113">(e) basing decisions and actions on needs of the individual 
              rather than needs of the group.<br>  <br> In our society, if we want to know how something functions, we take it apart, 
              cut it up, isolate it from its context; we analyze its factors and assume that 
              only one is an independent variable. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="style120"><span class="style12"><span class="style27"><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70"><span class="style113">We then quantify the changes this 
              independent variable makes in all the other variables that are assumed to be 
              dependent on it. Then we make the independent variable one link in a chain of 
              such independent variables, each surrounded by its system of dependent 
              variables, the whole forming a chain going back to some original cause in the 
              past or extending forward in a similar chain to some ultimate goal in the 
              future.<br>  <br> From such reasoning, given to us from the Greeks through Aristotle, we got the 
              "final" causes ( or goals) and the "Unmoved Mover" (that which is the first 
              cause of all movement and does not itself move) of Aristotelian metaphysics, 
              and, today, we still use this way of thinking, even though we no longer believe 
              in Aristotle's metaphysics.<br>  <br> The now obsolescent mode of thought and cognition just described might be 
              contrasted with a newer method which is, incidentally, closer to the thinking 
              processes of southern and eastern Asia, which were never much influenced by 
              transcendental Hebrew monotheism or by Greek two-valued logic.<br>  <br> This newer (or older) way of looking at experience tries to find how anything 
              functions by seeing its relationships to a larger system and, ultimately, to the 
              whole cosmos. To do so, it uses an ecological and qualitative approach, seeking 
              to grasp the whole contextual situation of innumerable factors, all of which are 
              changing at once, not only by quantitative changes within a fixed identity (such 
              as Western logic can handle) but with constant shifts of identity and quality.<br>  <br> This more intuitive and less logical point of view is now sweeping the West as 
              is evidenced by the fact that our traditional Western categories and cognitive 
              assumptions were rejected not only by youthful hippies but also by those 
              hardheaded, analytical people on whom the survival of the West depends.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The stumbling block, of course, is that our whole institutional setup is based 
              on the old method of thought.</strong></span> For example, our educational system is based on 
              the methods of categorization, specialization, and quantification, which must be 
              replaced. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This old method of thought is seen on the lower levels, where 
              objective tests assume such things as two-valued logic (True, False), the 
              principle of contradiction (Yes, No),</strong></span> and the principle of retained identity, 
              just as, on the highest levels, the great increase in the use of computers 
              assumes the possibility of objective analysis and quantification of life 
              experiences.<br>  <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is difficult to reform our old methods of thinking no matter how bankrupt 
              they may be.</strong></span> Standing in the way of change are the pressures exerted by 
              institutionalized establishments, the profits of powerful groups producing 
              equipment based on old ways of thinking, and the need which the large 
              bureaucratized organizations have for persons with narrow technical training in 
              the older cognitive patterns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>( a) using analysis rather than synthesis in seeking answers to problems;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>(b) isolating problems and studying them in a vacuum instead of using an ecological approach;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>(c) using techniques based on quantification rather than on qualification study done in a contextual situation;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>(d) proceeding on the assumption of single-factor causation rather than pluralistic, ecological causation; and</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>(e) basing decisions and actions on needs of the individual rather than needs of the group.<br> <br>In our society, if we want to know how something functions, we take it apart, cut it up, isolate it from its context; we analyze its factors and assume that only one is an independent variable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We then quantify the changes this independent variable makes in all the other variables that are assumed to be dependent on it. Then we make the independent variable one link in a chain of such independent variables, each surrounded by its system of dependent variables, the whole forming a chain going back to some original cause in the past or extending forward in a similar chain to some ultimate goal in the future.<br> <br>From such reasoning, given to us from the Greeks through Aristotle, we got the "final" causes ( or goals) and the "Unmoved Mover" (that which is the first cause of all movement and does not itself move) of Aristotelian metaphysics, and, today, we still use this way of thinking, even though we no longer believe in Aristotle's metaphysics.<br> <br>The now obsolescent mode of thought and cognition just described might be contrasted with a newer method which is, incidentally, closer to the thinking processes of southern and eastern Asia, which were never much influenced by transcendental Hebrew monotheism or by Greek two-valued logic.<br> <br>This newer (or older) way of looking at experience tries to find how anything functions by seeing its relationships to a larger system and, ultimately, to the whole cosmos. To do so, it uses an ecological and qualitative approach, seeking to grasp the whole contextual situation of innumerable factors, all of which are changing at once, not only by quantitative changes within a fixed identity (such as Western logic can handle) but with constant shifts of identity and quality.<br> <br>This more intuitive and less logical point of view is now sweeping the West as is evidenced by the fact that our traditional Western categories and cognitive assumptions were rejected not only by youthful hippies but also by those hardheaded, analytical people on whom the survival of the West depends.<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The stumbling block, of course, is that our whole institutional setup is based on the old method of thought.</strong></span> For example, our educational system is based on the methods of categorization, specialization, and quantification, which must be replaced. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This old method of thought is seen on the lower levels, where objective tests assume such things as two-valued logic (True, False), the principle of contradiction (Yes, No),</strong></span> and the principle of retained identity, just as, on the highest levels, the great increase in the use of computers assumes the possibility of objective analysis and quantification of life experiences.<br> <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is difficult to reform our old methods of thinking no matter how bankrupt they may be.</strong></span> Standing in the way of change are the pressures exerted by institutionalized establishments, the profits of powerful groups producing equipment based on old ways of thinking, and the need which the large bureaucratized organizations have for persons with narrow technical training in the older cognitive patterns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
