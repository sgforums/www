              <p>I think many of us have been through some of the major
              examinations in Singapore, from PSLE, O Levels, A Levels, or even
              Poly Diplomas.<br> <br> Having been through these hurdles in our educational life cycle, I
              think we become more retrospective of the crazy nights and endless
              hours of studying which we had to endure to get our grades.<br> <br> Since SGForums has been a major 'meeting point' for many students
              in Singapore, I would like to suggest perhaps that some of the
              'elders' in the forum offer free tuition or consultation services
              to 'juniors' around here. This can take the form of a meet up at a
              local neighbourhood shopping mall, where 3-4 students can seek
              academic consultation with a senior who has recently completed
              these exams.<br> <br> I am sure that those who have gotten perfect scores or have done
              well for these major exams will be more than willing to offer such
              services for free to those who would definitely enjoy a helping
              hand.<br> <br> It is important that this service remains free to stay true to the
              'pay it forward' nature of the proposal. Perhaps this is a great
              opportunity to those who would be willing to commit a couple of
              hours of your weekend perhaps every fortnight to meet up with
              juniors to help them with logarithms, or organic chemistry or even
              Newtonian mechanics?<br> <br> To start the ball rolling, let's hope that this thread will bring
              together 2 groups of people. Those wanting to help for purely
              altruistic reasons. And those who would not mind an extra aid in
              their path to scoring well in exams.<br> <br> Further queries can be sent via email to: <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:thelawnsg@gmail.com">thelawnsg@gmail.com</a></p>

              <p>I use to give free tuitions in the past during the holidays. </p>
              <p>But many parents do not trust a tutor who give free tuition to be capable, even if he is the top of his cohort. They rather pay $30 an hour to my fellow undergraduate who is tutored by me. -_-</p>
              <p>Thus, I spend most of my times on Yahoo Answers now and answer questions there. Nevertheless, I still gave tuition to that 1 or two students who bother to look for me during my holidays.</p>
              <p>I have to say that fewer and fewer students are seeking help here on sgforums though. In the past, the forum mods as well as the other regulars including myself can easily find 2 full pages of questions or queries from students when they really need help. Hence, to find someone who needs free tuition help here is an unlikely thing. It is better to contact those community service centers (such as the one at Ang Mo Kio) who seeks volunteers. and also offer free tuition by these volunteers.</p>
              <p>(Not an excuse, but because such community centers have fixed volunteering hours, I can't help out as they cut into my semester periods)</p>
