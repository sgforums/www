              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Point 1: Consider other factors, other than personal choice.</p>
              <p>  Point 2: Include some statistics, like the extent of salary increase over the years. Which industry areas are in demand and are they in agreement with increase of salary?</p>
              <p>  Point 3: Do substantiate with examples. Compare entry requirements between poly and JC.</p>
              <p>  Point 4: 10% refers to local university admission? How about others who went overseas or did correspondence courses after graduation? Also, I do know that polys try to link up with universities overseas these days, so that graduands can gain admission.</p>
              <p>  In addition, do speak with some people and gather more information about your essay.</p>
              <p>  Thanks and good luck!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Here are some other stuffs to help you out:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the reason why Poly is becoming more popular is because JCs are becoming more and more study-based, as you can see from the change of having 3 "A" subject to 3 H2 subject and 1 H1 contrast subject.</p>
              <p>What is more, many of those who come out of Sec school realise that what they are studying stuffs which they do not need once they enter uni, hence they will prefer entering poly and take up a course which they are more interested in.</p>
              <p>There is also the factor that "A-level" cert holders will be no better than an "O-level" cert holder if they cannot make it into uni, whereas a Diploma will help out in getting you a job.</p>
              <p>For employers, they will prefer a Diploma holder with working attachment experience over an "A-level" cert holder with no experience at anytime. Diploma holders whom they employ tend to have a diploma related to whatever business line they are in, accountants are expected to have an accountancy Diploma, and so on.</p>
