              <p><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Graphite and Diamond are allotropes. Complete combustion of equal masses of graphite and diamond produces equal masses of carbon dioxide as the only product. Why is this so &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because it proves that both graphite and diamond are pure C, no other elements present.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Is graphite not a carbon compound? Why? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above (Q1) has already shown why it is an ALLOTROPE of C, not a compound of C.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of structural formula, all of the 4 possible options in that MCQ question are flawed. You cannot draw the Kekule structures as suggested by the condensed formulae given. That's at 'A' levels, where everything matters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 'O' levels, it's far more simple - only NH2-CO2-NH4 fits in terms of the ratio of N to H to C to O atoms, based on the reactants (2 mols of NH3 and 1 mol of CO2).</p>

              <p>Your school gave you a flawed answer to this MCQ question. The correct answer is the latter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even better version of this question, would say per gram (or per tonne). Then first calculate no. of moles per gram/tonne, then multiply by no. of N atoms per molecule (or formula unit, since it's an ionic compound).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6)I particularly dont know how to do these kinda qns.</p>
              <p>it was found that 0.001 mole of chloride of metal X requires 0.002 of silver nitrate for complete reaction. What is the formula of the chloride? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your question's figures are flawed. I've changed 0.0005 to 0.002.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>0.002 mol of Ag+ ions reacts with 0.002 mol of Cl- ions to give AgCl(s).</p>
              <p>Since this means that 0.001 mol of chloride of metal contains 0.002 mol of Cl- ions, hence 1 mol of chloride of metal contains 2 mol of Cl- ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Empirical formula is MCl2 (eg. MgCl2) </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Which particle is present in the least conc. in sulphuric acid.</p>
              <p>H2O(l) molecule or SO4(aq) &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, original MCQ question and available options are flawed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are the following species in present, listed from highest to lowest molarity (assuming it's dilute sulfuric acid).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H2O(l)</p>
              <p>H+(aq)</p>
              <p>HSO4-(aq)</p>
              <p>SO4 2-(aq)</p>
              <p>OH-(aq)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 8) how does lead(ii) carbonate+ nitric acid and sodium iodide give lead(ii) iodide. Since lead carbonate is insoluble, wld nitric acid react with it? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>nitric acid reacts with any carbonate, to give soluble nitrate salt. Here, you get lead(II) nitrate solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mixing aqueous sodium iodide with aqueous lead(II) nitrate, you obtain solid lead(II) iodide.</p>

              <p><br>Not quite. H2O auto-ionizes to form H+ ions and OH- ions, regardless of whether there are ionic compounds dissolved or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The (endothermic) auto-ionization constant for water at room temperature, is very low. The molarity of protons [H+] and hydroxide ions [OH-] in pure water is only 1.0 x 10^-7. Which is why pH of pure water at room temperature is 7.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>pH = p[H+] = -log(1.0 x 10^-7) = 7</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When ionic compounds are dissolved into water, the water molecules form ion-dipole electrostatic interactions with the cations and anions, creating hydration shells of water molecules arranged in geometric patterns around the cations and anions. Beautiful stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But water molecules do not ionize more when they are ionic compounds present. That's a false myth you picked up (from your school teacher?).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, that's due to non-degenerate d-d* orbital splitting into distinct energy levels due to electron repulsion between electron orbitals of the complexed transition metal cations and the electron orbitals of the electron donor ligand molecules, the different magnitudes depending on their VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory) geometry, which results in different frequency wavelengths of light being absorbed and reflected as calculated by E = hv (where h represents Planck's constant), which results in beautiful colours as perceived by the human eye (retina absorbs wavelengths, sends impulses along the optic neurons to the sight processing center of the brain, and you go "Wah Swee lah, blue blue colour one!!!").</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) whats the thing about aluminium developing an oxide layer easily? why doesnt it happen on other metals? I know al and iron(can rust). &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Yes, all reactive metals do. But aluminium is 'special', because it develops the oxide layer very rapidly, like sodium. But unlike sodium, the aluminium oxide layer is insoluble (hence 'protecting' the raw aluminium underneath from further corrosion or oxidation).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) What has less tendancy to form a positive ion? Magnesium or iron? If this has sth to do with properties of transition metals, then it shld be out of syllabus. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you learn that magnesium is more "reactive" than iron, it actually means magnesium has greater tendency to be oxidized to cation (compared with iron).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) In the polymerisation of ethene, there is no change in -desnity or mass or molecular formula? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I already posted on it here. Do a Find (control-F) for "ADDITION polymer".</p>

              <p>Conc. of HCL gradually reduces to zero.(my choice) &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Correct. Concentration of reactant HCl(aq) decreases as it is used up by the reaction, hence speed of reaction decreases.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5)For electrolysis, the concentration of aqueous solution doesnt affect very reaction metals like calcium-potassium right? &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Correct. These metals are too reactive, hence their cations are too stable, to ever be reduced in aqueous solution.</p>

              <p>Remember that all solutions, all compounds, everything in this Universe, MUST be electrically neutral. That's (in fact) why you know how to write formula.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Al3+ cation</p>
              <p>CO3 2- anion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know the formula must be Al2(CO3)3. Why? To ensure electrical neutrality. If there were no salt bridge, electrons would stop flowing in the external wire, in order to maintain electrical neutrality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, that's why lightning occurs (electrical discharge due to built up of ionic charges) during a rain storm. But that's physics and physical geography and whatever.</p>
