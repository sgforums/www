I took 3 h2 subject-Bio, Chem, Math and h1 Econ.Honestly speaking I feel like I cannot cope and thanks to my poor time management, I ended up cramming so hard for my exams where my brain was trying so hard to retain the information that it eventually collapse. I only passed my math and bio in promo 1 though but anyway I am pretty fed up with science as I find it too mainstream and competitive. If I am going to retain, I think I am going to poly to do engineering with business course in sp/nyp because I find that engineering and business graduates get high pay. My dream job is actually to become paediatrician /qualified nurse practitioner/radiologist/sociologist but its almost impossible to acheive them because these areas are heavily based on academics</span><br style="color: #606060; font-family: roboto, HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;"><br style="color: #606060; font-family: roboto, HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;"><span style="color: #606060; font-family: roboto, HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;">Please answer my questions:</span><br style="color: #606060; font-family: roboto, HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;"><span style="color: #606060; font-family: roboto, HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue Light', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #eaf6f9;">Is it tough to gain admission to local universities for business and engineering after 3 years of poly? How is engineer and business courses like in poly? Should I retain in jc or went to poly? Is business similar to economics? Is engineer somewhat like design and creating a product?</span></p></div>

              <p>I was at MI (Millennia Institute) last year. The environment there was not conducive for learning and many teachers there are not really accessible. Besides, my own study attitude was not good and my heart was not on the books. So I did quite badly and was retained, with only 2 H1 (GP and Chinese) and 1 H2 (Physics) passes<span style="line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p>Was supposed to be a year one retainee this year, but I applied for a poly diploma early this year via this year's JAE, and transferred over to poly early this year. I am now doing quite well at Poly. kinda regretted not going to poly last year immediately after Os, becuase there's that seperation from same-age peers from secondary school (already in year two) and I am actually one year later than most people. but I'm used to it now.</p>
              <p>Anyway, on your questions, </p>
              <p>1. Poly to local uni is based on GPA. It should not be difficult to obtain high (above 3.0) GPA, so long as your attitude is there and you put in effort to learn.</p>
              <p>2. Poly diploma, unlike A level, is more specific towards a particular field. There are some diploma courses where students study general content in year one and specialise only in year two. Nonetheless, if you want to go poly, you should think about what you want now and maybe pursue a diploma course that is more specific towards a particular field.</p>
              <p>3. In poly, Engineering is seperated into a few categories: Electrical &amp; Electronic, Machenical, etc.</p>
              <p>4. I am not sure how to describe the courses. Perhaps you would like to visit the course websites and read up on them yourself.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your opinion on ur pre-uni experience. I understand how you feel and I will definitely feel the same way. If I went to poly, people would just mistake me from NA stream since I am turning 18 next year. I would look at my results once again and decide whether I could really handle A level or not. </p>

              <p>I am from Jurong jc,currently on the route to A levels.</p>
              <p>Your dream job is in the healthcare profession,which is similar to mine,that is to help people even if the pay is low. </p>
              <p>You can enter into these professions via the poly route too,there are some fields related to medical-related courses</p>
              <p>Now,let me give you two sides of  the story of my ending story in Jc and what I have learnt so far.</p>
              <p>In my class,3 people retained.However,there was this student,who retained that is doing exceptionally well right now.He scored CSU,BS for his promotional exams.This,coming from a guy that stayed back to study for promotional exams for one whole month!</p>
              <p>Unfortunately,he failed to be promoted but continued in the same combination in Jc,PCML.He worked tirelessly during holidays,picked up tuition. In the recent exams,he scored AAB/BE. He has grown a lot,despite being a late bloomer.</p>
              <p>The Jc course is so rigorous,that my friends who decided to promote in the goodwill of teachers,struggle hard to make it till their prelims and still failed to thrive</p>
              <p>In addition,I can admit to you that this is the icing of the cake for chemistry H2! Physical is the easiest amongst Inorganic and Organic. </p>
              <p>Getting into business for poly can get you into local uni,say if you may want to aim for SMU,it is highly accessible if you put in effort in poly</p>
              <p>However,if you fail,you need to decide to go overseas,don't stop at diploma</p>
              <p>Also,it is strange but true that jc students who leave for poly,do well compared to their peers,given the pressure of time,they will make up for it in their poly years.</p>
              <p>Business is totally different from economics,Business focuses on how corporates work and emphasises more on corporate management and usually can be applied in the finance sector.Economics is more broad,you learnt about how different sectors,healthcare to transport can affect your lifestyle choices and the market.Most likely,you may end up as a teacher or probably in several corporate firms.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind, that Jc is highly competitive but based on your targets,I think you will need to hit BBBB for your A levels.All the best in making your decisions</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
