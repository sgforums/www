              <p>I am not sure for other JCs, but for my JC - or rather, my class - we have a very interesting way of writing the school graduation cert.</p>
              <p>My form teacher will have us write for each other instead of our ownselves, and then she will help us to check through and make adjustments to it.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, one of the other classes actually have the top GP student in that class to write for the whole class after he volunteered to do so.</p>
              <p>A proper school graduation
                  cert will be like a self-appraisal, just that most probably you will want to cut down on all the negative points about yourself.</p>
              <p>The important things to note are your :</p>
              <p>1) Achievements</p>
              <p>2) Contributions</p>
              <p>3) Strengths</p>
              <p>4) Personality</p>

              <p>teachers only write about your qualities</p>
              <p>so the cert is used to sell yourself to the employer, and i guess it depends on how well you write it too</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Miscellaneous things could include activities you that carry out outside of school, e.g. a committed volunteer tutor at the Cheng San Community Club's tuition programme for needy students, an anchor player for the Kovan Community Club's basketball team, a contributing alumni member of Serangoon Secondary School's Symphonic Band, et cetera.</p>
              <p>  Please rack your brains and think of something positive to say about yourself, even though it is difficult. Certainly, you know yourself best and there must be something good about you :)</p>
              <p>  It is a good experience to write SGC because you will have to do so for your resume in future.</p>
              <p>  In the past as a teacher, I used to encourage my students to write their own testimonials and then I would polish them up with personal remarks based on my observations. This method is efficient and creates a win-win situation because the testimonial is complete in terms of information.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
