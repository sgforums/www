              <p>Chose mjc as it is very near to my house. Secondary choice would

              <p>Hey guys, my raw L1R5 is 8, and I'm planning to go to a JC, Arts stream, since I have no interest in the sciences.</p>
              <p>Currently deciding between NYJC and AJC. I've been to Open Houses of both schools, and I feel that they are quite comparable. But one key thing that I'm considering is my school's affiliation to NYJC. So means that I can enter NYJC with a net score of 4, while I can only have 2 bonus points if I choose AJC, making my net score 6.</p>
              <p>So can you guys pls provide some advice abt the environment of both schools and the teachers etc. Which JC will provide a better and more conducive environment in terms of the culture there, how good the teachers are? Thanks in advance! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Btw, I live in Woodlands, so the travelling time is not a major issue here, since travelling time to both JCs are relatively close.</p>

              <p><br>If you're 'forced' to consider MI, it already means your options are limited, and you don't have much of a choice anyway.</p>
              <p>You probably can't find a suitable Poly course.</p>
              <p>You probably can't get into any other other JC (Science).</p>
              <p>So if MI's your last resort, it probably means it's your best choice available.</p>
              <p> Alternatives (choose a random poly course, take A levels as private candidate, study a private diploma, etc) are likely to be worse off than MI.</p>
              <p>On the bright side, MI allows you to take H2 Sciences with just a B grade for combined science (as compared to a A grade required by all other JCs). H2 Sciences are required if you intend to study Science in the Uni.</p>

              <p><br>Fair enough.</p>
              <p>But when I said "forced", I didn't necessarily mean your L1R5 is not good enough for decent poly courses. Because even if your L1R5 is very good (eg. below 10), but you don't already have a poly course in mind, it means you're not suited for poly. Poly is only meant for people who have already made up their minds on what they wanna do for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p>If you're undecided on any poly course (ie. the exact career or profession you want, for the rest of your life), it means that you must go JC / MI / A Level route, regardless of how good or lousy your L1R5 is.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, my raw L1R5 is 8, and I'm planning to go to a JC, Arts
                  stream, since I have no interest in the sciences.</p>
              <p>Currently deciding between NYJC and AJC. I've been to Open
                  Houses of both schools, and I feel that they are quite comparable.
                  But one key thing that I'm considering is my school's affiliation
                  to NYJC. So means that I can enter NYJC with a net score of 4,
                  while I can only have 2 bonus points if I choose AJC, making my net
                  score 6.</p>
              <p>So can you guys pls provide some advice abt the environment of
                  both schools and the teachers etc. Which JC will provide a better
                  and more conducive environment in terms of the culture there, how
                  good the teachers are? Thanks in advance! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Btw, I live in Woodlands, so the travelling time is not a major
                  issue here, since travelling time to both JCs are relatively
                  close.</p>

              <p>was abt to say TJC or VJC for arts but then i dont think u wanna travel bcos they are at the bery other end of the island</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so it's AJC loh<br>even though not top 5 but is constantly in the tops for non-IP JCs</p>

              <p>if u haben had an idea of a specialised path, the MI would be good for u to prep urself well for the As<br>less stressful compared to other JCs, which means the pace n culture will be slightly more relaxed (which some might misunderstand as unmotivated)</p>

              <p>i'm actually debating between TP's apparel design and merchandising course and MI. Haven't gather enough info on MI since its quite an unconventional route. I feel that prospects after that is more important. I want to go to a local university definately, so i'm having quite a hard time choosing between that two route.</p>
