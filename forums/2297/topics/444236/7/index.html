              <p>Hey I got raw 11 and after bonus points is 7. My results are:</p>
              <p>English: B3</p>
              <p>Emath: A1</p>
              <p>Amath: A2</p>
              <p>All 3 sciences: B3 D:</p>
              <p>HCL: B3</p>
              <p>Chinese: A1</p>
              <p>Combined Humans: A1</p>
              <p>I'm planning to go MJ but their retention rate, from what I've heard, is almost 50%!!! Is that true? I don't want to be retained! So I'm considering NYJC as well...I live in Tampines btw so MJ would be nearer for me.</p>
              <p>How are the teachers and environment like in MJC/NYJC? And in terms of A level results? Which JC is better?</p>
              <p>Also, I've no chance of getting into TJC right? D:</p>

              <div class="quote_from">To pass JC 1 in meridian, you need 60%. For other JCs, its 50%. MJC is mugger school. That's why their COP had dropped so much since 2003, when they open. NYJC is a not that far. Just take mrt from tampines to paya lebar and then circle line to lorong chuan and walk there. I think nanyang is better for results but cannot confirm as MOe abolished the ranking system.</div>

              <p><br>If you're interested in CJC, it's worth a shot.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, SRJC wouldn't be too shabby an option for you (since you live nearby anyway)</p>

              <p>I need help. Urgently. Tommorow will be the last day to hand-in my JAE and stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>L1R5: 11 (with CCA minus 2 = nett 9)</p>
              <p>EL: B3</p>
              <p>CL: B3</p>
              <p>Combined humanities: B3</p>
              <p>Pure Chem: A1</p>
              <p>Pure Bio: A1</p>
              <p>E Math: A1</p>
              <p>A Math: A2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm currently deciding between Jurong JC and Anderson JC.I plan to apply for Science stream, BCME. H2 Bio, Chem, Math, H1 Econs.</p>
              <p>For JJC: Very high chance of getting in. COP 15.</p>
              <p>Seems like the school has a nice, friendly environment. With my score I might get into top few classes for BCME = better teachers. Should I appeal for Scholarship programme, which needs to be raw 10 pts and below, and take 4 H2 subjects? Or is it too heavy?</p>
              <p>And from what I've heard, their Chem and Bio teachers are very, very good. I want to do scientific research in the future (either chem, bio or both), hopefully with A*Star, so I guess this is an added bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For AJC: Chance of getting in. Their Science COP is 8 pts.</p>
              <p>I can always appeal through choir, even though I don't have any awards to show for it lol. Can anyone please tell me about their experience in AJC? Teachers, students, environment... anything!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For PJC: Definitely can get in. COP 16. May consider this... opinions on this school please? It's closest to my house, but I really need to know about the school culture and experience there. Also I heard PJC as a whole is improving significantly over the years, so is it worth it?</p>

              <p>hi guys just wanna share some stuff with u.</p>
              <p>i just did my a lvl last yr (2011) and i just wanna share my experience.</p>
              <p>firstly, try to choose a JC ( if you're planning to) that is near to your house.</p>
              <p>trust me, it's beneficial, because of all the late nights u will be up studying for ur tests and rushing thru ur tutorials, you don't wanna be late for school. you'll be so freaking tired that u cant even stay awake during national anthem. i have friends who are frequent late-comers and got themselves into UNNECESSARY trouble. im sure you wouldn't want that when you are so stressed up trying to understand what kinematics is or memorising the endless stack of protein chemistry notes. ( you'll know what they are when u enter jc )</p>
              <p>secondly, its all about your attitude. i had a friend who didn't take a maths, was from combined sci stream and he was very motivated and focused. initially we all looked down on him as he was an appeal student (thru cca)  but we were all wrong. my jc had this bridging course for those who didn't take a maths/pure sciences during secondary sch and he attended all lectures punctually without fail. true enough, he outshone all of us and we didn't know where to hide our faces. in my opinion, just get into a jc that u like, be motivated and determined to do well. most importantly DONT GIVE UP HALFWAY.</p>
              <p>and mjc's retain rate is not that exagerrating anymore. if i remember correctly, to be promoted to j2, u gotta pass gp, pass 1 h2 subject and something else i can't rmb. to me i think it's reasonable and achievable if u stay focussed. they are not so unreasonable as now they try to push u up to j2 so don't worry. just do your best. the school will do their part, and u have to do your part also.</p>
              <p>these are just the tip of the ice-berg from my experience during my jc life. wish u guys all the best in ur pre-u/tertiary education.</p>
