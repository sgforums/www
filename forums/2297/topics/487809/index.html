              <p>You have to study hard to bridge the gap. And the gap is quite large. Nowadays, for O level chemistry exam papers, Cambridge is using some A level questions in O level syllabus.</p>

              <p>I don't mind studying hard to bridge the gap but if I take Chemistry as a combined science will they require us to use le chatelier's rule to solve problems?</p>
              <p>And also I would prefer to have more time for revision, I don't feel 'confident' doing N levels within 6 months and I feel if I work hard enough for O levels within 9 months I can get a decent grade. </p>
              <p>What are the pros and cons if I were to take:</p>
              <p>Phy/chem(Pure<span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Bio</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">)<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Chem/Bio  (Pure </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Physics</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">)<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Phy/Bio (Pure Chemistry)<br></span></p>

              <p>Le Chatelier's principle is only in A level syllabus, so do not worry.</p>

              <p>For combined sciences (chemistry) even if the syllabus change in around 2017/2018, will they insert something from the pure chem syllabus like asking us to calculate the bonds formed by the substance in KJ or electrolysis?</p>
              <p>And also if I were to pass chemistry as combined science and E Maths and I want to take both of them as H2 subject as private A level candidate, Will I be able to fit in well(without A Maths)? I am aiming to a B4 or better, for atleast 3 subjects I'm taking.</p>

              <p>Hi there thank you for answering my question and I greatly appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Also why do I have to take Bio as a pure subject in O levels before I can attempt it as a H2 subject? I notice if I take pure bio as a private candidate (still considering) it's practical is slightly higher than pure physics chem though is bio as a pure subject very 'demanding'?</p>

              <p>For H2 Biology, the subject pre-requisite is O level biology. This ensures that candidates in JC have the necessary foundation to take A level biology.</p>
              <p>Biology is of a different nature from physics and chemistry.</p>
              <p>The answers for questions in biology are usually more descriptive, which means you need to be good in your English too. There are fewer calculations in biology. There are large chunks of materials to understand, key words and phrases to remember. So biology is demanding from a different way as physics and chemistry.</p>
              <p>Please consider taking A Math rather than Biology, as A Math is needed for many courses in JC and poly.</p>
              <p>I am not clear about which path you intend to take, so I am only providing generic advice.</p>
              <p>Usually Normal Academic students prefer to go poly/ITE rather than JC/MI. Sec 5 is a big jump from Sec 4 NA.</p>
              <p>All the best. You have talents that need to be discovered and nurtured. It is just that the education system in Singapore is imperfect.</p>

              <p>Hi there, I would prefer the science route, but I don't feel confident in taking it at a diploma level  and would like to see my options if I score B4 or better in O levels, For now I would want to concentrate on my sec 3NA maths first, (I have WPLN numeracy Level 5, which says I'm of O level standard, but would prefer to start at Sec 3NA first.)</p>
              <p>I am leaving science out for now but so as to focus better on Mathematics, If I were to take science I would take back my old combination (physics chemistry) which I feel I can do better.</p>
