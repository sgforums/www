              <p>I would actually advice you to retake ur O's since a fail in maths and science will not get you anywhere much unless you intend to do a career related more to language or art.</p>

              <p>The absolute minimum for SIM Diploma courses is 5 GCE "O"-Level Credits, though quite a number of them requires an "A"-Level Certificate or a Diploma. This should answer your query indirectly.</p>

              <p>Hi TS</p>
              <p>I think the best option for you is to retake Os. I just thought I share with you my story. Hopefully it'll inspire you to press on!</p>
              <p>About 3 of years ago I failed my O levels. By fail I mean REALLY messed up badly. L1R4 was about 30 points, and L1R5 was well ABOVE 40. Yes it's not a typo. I was averaging E8s and F9s everywhere lol.</p>
              <p>For some strange reason I decided to retake my Os, give it one another go because English was the only subject I had passed. Knowing that a pass in Eng would not take me anywhere, I retook Os not as a private candidate, but back in my secondary school instead.</p>
              <p>As you would well imagine, it was really tough for me, granted I had to learn to adapt to a new environment where I knew no one, at the same time deal with the prospect that I had failed Os. Everyone would look at you in that funny way you know what I mean? But yea, wasn't really too bothered about the fussing. I need to be taught a lesson anyway (I was a pretty arrogant chap back then). Thankfully I had really great classmates and they took great pity on me and decided to help me out whenever they could. Mind you, I wasn't a nice person at all. They really took great pity on me lol.</p>
              <p>Come O level PRELIMS during my SECOND stint, my results did not show any improvement. 38 points L1R5. The future looked bleak.</p>
              <p>I did not panic whatsoever, I continued going for classes and participated actively.</p>
              <p>Eventually, I managed to achieve 18 points for L1R5 and 12 for L1R4.</p>
              <p>The trick?</p>
              <p>The Ten year Series.</p>
              <p>I bought every single one for every single subject (except chinese). For my weaker subjects, I would do 2 rounds. Meaning, do every single question, and once I'm done, DO IT AGAIN. For Eng I wrote an essay per week. It was the only subject that I went for additional consultations with my teacher. Aside from english, other subjects were more or less self taught.</p>
              <p>Granted my foundation is the pits, ( L1R5 38 for prelims buddy), it was tough work.</p>
              <p>But now that I'm in the midst of completing my A levels, knowing that I have a chance to study for a degree in a couple of years, I think all the pain that was WORTH it.</p>
              <p>On hindsight, it's been a wild ride. Despite what people say, the Os really isnt that tough. A levels was the big one. 2 years of full-on daily mugging.</p>
              <p>But hey, I'm glad I made the choice to retain, afterwhich pursue an education in a JC. Going through A levels is hard work, but it disciplines, it motivates, and it has taught me about what suffering for a better future really means.</p>
              <p>Oh! Plus, the girls are really nice too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
