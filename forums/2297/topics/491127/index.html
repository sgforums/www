            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16.25px;">I'm 16 this year and currently taking Pure Chemistry, Pure Physics, AM, Geography/SS, English, MT, EM. I was wondering if I should drop Pure Sciences and change to Combined Phy/Chem. I'm currently still not sure whether I want to go to JC or Polytechnic cause I have to see my results first. However, if I do go Polytechnic, I'll probably pursue business-related courses which the COP is around 10 or for IB it would be around 6/7 and I doubt I would actually choose science-related courses but I'll keep my options open for now. If I'm not wrong Pioneer JC do not necessarily require Pure Sciences to get in however the combined science should be at least a B3 or distinction (if I want to take 2 H2 Science) and I'm not too sure about Jurong JC. So if I do drop my Pure Sciences, I would have to focus on all 6 subjects of mine and there might be a higher chance of scoring better grades and safer since it's considered easier than Pure Sciences but I'm not guaranteed that I would score like A1 and if I do score well, I'm able to choose whether to go JC or Poly. It's like if I get B4 for both Pure sciences, it wouldn't be good and I heard it's tough to score a distinction for Pure sciences. Oh and for my Secondary 3 EOY, I got 60 for Pure Physics and 68 for Pure Chemistry, Besides, I'm afraid that I might even lose my interest in Business-related courses in the future if I go to polytechnic. Do give me some advice like I'm literally in a dilemma. Thanks in advanced. (I have to decide soon cause my school will be registering for the 'O' Level subjects by the end of January and I have to get back to my teacher latest on Monday)</span></p></div>

              <p>My opinion is pure science is the best for JC since it gives you an edge with the new content especially if you want to take H2. But for pure science, i think bio is the easiest to score.. not sure about physics cos i didn't take it but chem is ok ok i manage to pass only (But i have been failing F9 since Sec 3 to prelim so i think this is quite alright). However, i see that most people who take combined science seem to do so well like most are As (which made me want to take combined but i stick to pure because for 3 reasons)</p>
              <p>1 - Pure science you have 2 sciences in O levels. So 2 papers for each science subject (excluding SPA) which is not bad while combined science you have to take 4 papers just to get one science o level subject (which is a waste if you ask me even though it's less content but still the more subjects you have esp for science if you want to go for science course then the better).</p>
              <p>2 - Pure science is helpful to keep up with JC syllabus (i heard that JC is not entirely the same as sec school syllabus but pure science definitely teaches you more so you're more educated before you enter JC)</p>
              <p>3 - I really like science so if you have a strong passion for the subject, it's good to take pure so you will enjoy learning :P </p>
              <p>P.s. For pure sciences you just need to pass them (although you should aim higher) to take H2 science so isn't this great? Haha while combined science is stricter yup</p>
              <p>And lastly, my sec school make us all take pure chem because they said it's important. But i think physics is equally impt especially if you want H2 math in some school (or at least YJC) as a backup if you fail A Math. </p>
              <p>End: I really really think pure science is more worth it then combined because you get 2 sciences and the content at least for chem is not that difficult plus you're doing well so i think it shouldn't be a problem cx</p>
              <p>Sorry quite long haha</p>

              <p>Hello, combined science is easier to score a distinction. However, if you drop to combined science, you may have problems entering many JCs if you want to do science stream.</p>
              <p>If you are intent on going business course in poly, then it is ok. However, poly is also stressful with a different kind of stress from JC.</p>
              <p>Best regards.</p>
              <p>If you are really unsure of going poly or JC, then keep to pure sciences and optimise your L1R5.</p>

              <p>Scoring at least a B3 isn't hard for the O Level</p>
              <p>None of my students have scored below that for past many years. </p>
              <p>Also, I do have a J1 H2 Physics student who took combined science. To ensure that she catches up with the rest of the class, I gave her some O Level notes as well, to read up and practice.</p>
              <p>Taking combined science may not necessarily put you at a disadvantage at H2 Physics because from what I see, many students don't fully understand O Level Physics even though they may score well for it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good article, Eagle.<p>Similarly for Chemistry, as long as your aptitude is good enough to score A for combined science (eg. Chem + Phys), then you needn't worry that you'll be at a disadvantage for H2 Chemistry compared to pure Chem students (since A levels is 10x tougher than both combined and pure science, so there's negligible difference in starting point).</p><p>But of course, if you can't even do well for combined science (eg. can't get A grade), then it may not be advisable for you to take H2 Science in JC.</p><p>Of course, it's possible that in combined science, 1 science subject may sabo your other science subject. But then again at O level combined science, both sciences are so easy that, if you're cut out to take H2 Science at JC level, getting an A grade for combined science shouldn't be a problem for you.</p></div>
