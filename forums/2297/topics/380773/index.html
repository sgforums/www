              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Why don't you draw them out on paper to enable visualisation?</p>
              <p>  The topic of vectors in H2 Maths can be quickly summarised into these 8 points:</p>
              <p>  1. Collinearity of 3 points and Ratio Theorem.</p>
              <p>  2. Definition of the scalar product, <br>      i.e. <strong>a</strong> . <strong>b</strong> = |<strong>a</strong>| |<strong>b</strong>| cos \theta. <br><br>  This definition is useful for finding length of projection of one vector onto another, angle between 2 vectors, angle between 2 lines, angle between 2 planes and angle between line and plane.</p>
              <p>  3. Definition of the magnitude of the vector product,<br>      i.e. |<strong>a</strong> x <strong>b</strong>| = |<strong>a</strong>| |<strong>b</strong>| sin \theta. <br><br>  This definition is useful for finding shortest distance between point and line as well as areas of figures. </p>
              <p>  4. The normal <strong>c</strong> is parallel to <strong>a</strong> x <strong>b</strong> means that <strong>c</strong> is perpendicular to each of <strong>a</strong> and of <strong>b</strong>. This idea is extremely helpful for finding equation of a plane containing a line and is parallel to some vector. It is also useful to understand the line of intersection between two planes.</p>
              <p>  5. The relationship between two lines may be intersecting, parallel or skew.</p>
              <p>  6. The relationship between three planes may be intersecting at a point, intersecting at a line, parallel or non-intersecting.</p>
              <p>  7. The relationship between a line and a plane may be intersecting, parallel or containment (i.e. line is on the plane).</p>
              <p>  8. Equation of a line may be expressed in vector, parametric or cartesian forms. Equation of a plane may be expressed in vector, scalar product or cartesian forms.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>  To Snoopyies:</p>
              <p>  1. Draw a right-angled triangle.</p>
              <p>  2. Let the hypothenuse be represented by vector <strong>a</strong>.</p>
              <p>  3. Let the adjacent side by represented by vector <strong>b</strong>.</p>
              <p>  4. Let the angle between vectors be \theta.</p>
              <p>  5. Length of projection of <strong>a</strong> onto <strong>b</strong> is given by<br><br>      |<strong>a</strong>| cos \theta, <br><br>     the horizontal component. <br>     This simplifies to |<strong>a</strong> . <strong>b</strong>|<strong> </strong>/ |<strong>b</strong>|, by definition of scalar product.<br>     Note that |<strong>a</strong> . <strong>b</strong>| refers to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">absolute</span> value of the scalar product, since it may be a negative value and length cannot be negative.</p>
              <p>  6. Shortest distance of point A from the line (going in the direction of <strong>b</strong>) is given by<br><br>      |<strong>a</strong>| sin \theta, <br><br>      the vertical component.<br>      This simplifies to |<strong>a</strong> x <strong>b</strong>| / |<strong>b</strong>|, by definition of magnitude of vector product.<br>      Note that |<strong>a</strong> x <strong>b</strong>| refers to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnitude</span> of the vector <strong>a</strong> x <strong>b</strong>.</p>
