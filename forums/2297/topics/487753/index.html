              <p>1. All school candidates will receive the PIN</p>
              <p>2. I got a place in NUS and will be matriculating this year (if all goes well), the letter will come first, which allows you to apply using the pre-filled form (which minimize the need to fill in personal info like name, NRIC as well as results, which does not need to be verified (no supporting info needed)). The PIN is also handy as you don't need to think of a new PIN when you apply. This PIN will be the one you apply for financial assistance and like a password to the NUS admission portal.</p>
              <p>3. NUS should know on the day. NTU I'm not sure the proceedure, as my offer is under early admission. </p>

              Your chances are not good, but go ahead and try. Also apply for NTU Science, for which your chances are slightly better.

              <p>My UAS is 65. Possibly the worst score to have. </p>
              <p>My current thoughts are as follows and I have several questions.</p>
              <p>1. Go overseas university - do a foundation or diploma pathway course. </p>
              <p>- Expensive. I am the only child and my parents are ardent savers, but I feel extreme guilt in asking them to pay for my education.</p>
              <p>*Do local banks offer loans for overseas university fees? </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">+ End product of a degree is still achievable </span></p>
              <p>2. Go NYP Healthcare course,</p>
              <p>+ Healthcare, a field I don't mind. However, I am not sure if I'm the kind of 'caring' person a physiotherapist should be. </p>
              <p>+ One year degree conversion course available</p>
              <p>- Not exactly my passion. I am not sure if I can see myself doing this for the rest of my life.</p>
              <p>3. Go poly to do 3 year diploma</p>
              <p>+ What I had originally wanted to do right after 'O' levels. </p>
              <p>- I think I missed the application dateline (Missed JAE?)</p>
              <p>* Is there an alternate intake for A level grads? </p>
              <p>4. Try for NTU Art, Design and Media </p>
              <p>+ Design is definitely something I am into. My CCA in secondary school was very relevant to what they do. </p>
              <p>- I do not have a portfolio. But I do have strong leadership + CCA records. </p>
              <p>Private universities are not within my options. I just don't believe in them. They cost too much but they aren't as recoginized as a degree from a local university. I don't think it's worth the investment. Neither is repeating A levels. It was my mistake in allowing my parents to control my decisions back then. </p>
              <p>Any advice from people who've been in a similar place? </p>

              <br><br>Apply for NUS Chem Eng 1st choice (lower chance), and NTU Chem Eng 2nd choice (higher chance). 3rd choice onwards consider very carefully. Choose a Uni course (eg. a related course such as Chemistry) that you've interest in and passion for, because unlike O and A levels where you can just force your way through, Uni studies require personal interest and passion to secure that degree.

                  These days there are more options available to enterprising individuals without formal paper qualifications, as long as you have access to funding (preferably family finances, or alternatively crowd-funding) and have creative ideas for business startups.<br><br>If on the other hand, you think you would feel more secure with a recognized paper qualification from a local Uni : NUS/NTU/SMU etc, then you may have to seriously consider retaking your A levels as a private candidate (btw, it may take more effort to study from scratch, with or without tuition, but you can consider changing to a new H2/H1 subject that you've interest in, but couldn't take it in JC).<br><br>Private Uni degrees are more expensive and less recognized, so caveat emptor.

                          Citizenship slightly affects your chances, in that there is a quota for Singaporeans vs Foreigners for each Uni course, and/or for each Uni. The Unis won't divulge the quotas, however. And the exact quotas may differ from Uni to Uni, and from course to course.<br><br> Yes, you've a chance (albeit a small one) for NUS Pharmacy (unlike say, Law, which has strict GP requirements).

              <p>Hi! Does anyone know if our citizenship status will affect our
              chances of getting into a course? And also, I got As for my 4H2s
              (BCME) and E for my gp, A for pw. Do I still stand a chance for NUS
              pharmacy?? &gt;&lt; Thanks!! </p>

              <p>Hi, based on IGP (AAA/A and assumed GP and PW = C) you stand a chance but based on past few years trend it seems that GP and PW is tilted to a B&amp;C kind of cut off. </p>
              <p>For citizenship, for foreigners there's a quota that NUS can take in, 10% = 21 spaces, hence, competition may be keener</p>
              <p>But still put it as 1st choice and have good alternatives too!</p>
