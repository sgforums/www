              <p>Didn't do very well for A levels but fairly alright~</p>
              <p>Physics C</p>

              <p>UAS 73.75</p>
              <p>Initially I was targeting Undergraduate medicine in Australia,in which the common grades are ABB/B.However,I failed to achieve it and am now considering postgraduate medicine route or perhaps biomed Phd(yes,Bio was my passion but I chose to take physics instead,quite stupid~)</p>
              <p>Should I retake A levels or International UK A levels? I have heard that international UK A levels are easier and also looked through several sample questions to find them rather manageable. However,I need to do this during NS,if not I will rather go for the 7 year postgrad medic route or biomed.</p>
              <p>Another cause of concern is my application to biomed overseas/local. I am applying to NTU biological sciences and NUS FS(life sciences) </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NTU</span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>More relaxed entry requisite,missed by 1.25(1 H1 away)</p>
              <p>Mother went for open house and told me my grades are eligible</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>Compulsory 4 years honours programme,I prefer flexibility. e.g. I did well in biomed in 3rd year,I can choose to apply to graduate med. However, NTU is inflexible to allow 3 years programme</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NUS</span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>Flexiblity(3+1year programme),option to choose whether to do honours.</p>
              <p>I know what I want in my mind(don't want to spend first year on covering general sciences)</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>Higher entry requirement,that I am a little far off(2.5-3.75 URP away)</p>
              <p>Higher competition required to excel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overseas biomedicine&gt;Considering of going abroad to Australia to do my 3 years degree. Heard that it's easier to cope with academics there and the living environment will challenge me to be stronger~</p>
              <p>I am eligible for 5-6 good biomedical sciences programme.</p>
              <p>My target is at least 2nd upper honours equivalent GPA as that will allow me the opportunity to do a Phd/progress to graduate medicine.(credit average)</p>

              the point of a double degree? and can anyone try for it?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi , if you are considering coming to nus,  you can still apply for double degree/ double major after your 1st year if you want. Double degree only helps if you want the degree to enhance your whole studying experience or you want to learn more or if they complement. For example , someone studying engineering with double degree in business is helpful because next ime he/ she can start up their own company , and the business aspect would come in handy. However , takin a double major or some extra courses( unrestricted electives outside of your major is also sufficient to have some biz knowledge). </p>
              <p>If you have two degrees that dont really complement each other, you can choose either one to venture. So, it also helps to broaden the choices that you have if you are still unsure of which to do.</p>
              <p>While double degree helps to broaden your choices , it may be good to specialise in an area or choose things that will complement well. ( if you cantreally multi-task). But if you really have passion in both areas , then by all means go ahead. Usually , if you just want to have more knowledge in one area , but dont want to pursue it as a career , taking a minor or major is more than sufficient. Minor in nus is an extra 6 modules. (which can be done in your 4 years)  2nd major is an extra 12 modules. ( usually might need to extend to 4.5 years if you dont overload) and 2nd degree is about twice of tha t modules. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hello, anyone applying to nus mechanical engineering recieved the offer yet? me not yet. applied for nus mechanical engineering, SUTD EPD, and ntu chem and biomed engineering(first choice). 80 rank points, PCM h1 Econs subject combi. So far offered sutd admission + 1 yr scholarship. i heard some ppl already got offers from nus and ntu. is there a reason for the different offer times? isit bad if i get my offer late? also im in a huge dillema between SUTD and NUS , if i get offered a place there. SUTD seems to have a really fun and hands on curriculum, where i heard nus is mostly lectures and not much of creating stuff for engineering courses (is this really true? ). Is NUS mechanical engineering fun? really need advice here :(</p></div>

              <p>Hi people, I am in a dilemma in which course should i choose in for my degree study and i would wish they some of you can give me some guidance and advices. Firstly i did not fare well for my A-levels (BCC/U) thus local univeristy isn't accepting me.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of studying psychology. I know that many do not quite support this decision of mine but it have always been my interest. I understand that if i do not get a master degreee i cannot really do anything with it. I thinking of SIMglobal's University at Buffalo, psychology and James Cook University psychology. Which is a better choice ? also i am quite interested in MDIS's Biomedical degree course. However my friends told me that MDIS isn't really a good school choice though.</p>
