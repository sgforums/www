              <p>Update :</p>
              <p>On EDMW forum (in which Kevin Wee had only just created a forum account to participate in the discussion thread dedicated to his video), <strong>Shutter89</strong> posted a summary of the 1st hour of Kevin Wee's video :</p>
              <blockquote>He thinks the education system now is not good for the youngsters because it focuses on grades. And because the education system is focused on grades, students are super stressed on academic since young and as a result, some of them fall behind (because of stress, depression which is what he went through, expectation to excel in academics) and hence, got bad grades and couldn't get into universities because universities entry mainly focuses on grades. As a result, they wasted their 18 years of youth because they couldn't get into universities. He was one of these students. He excelled in studies and sports, got into VS and RJC. But at RJC, I believe because of PSTD, he couldn't focus on studies, suffered severe depression from PSTD, blanked out during math exam and subsequently got a U for his math. Because of this U, he couldn't got into local University. So basically, 18 years of studying has gone into the drain. <br><br>So he was very angry towards the current education system. He began to tear up his lecture notes, burn them up, tear up his some of his past certificates which he think are useless to him. He also criticized the education system in terms of the content it teaches the student. He thinks some contents taught in JC are useless or senseless to him. He also feels that not much emotional support is provided with regards to depression management among students nowadays..everyone thinks everyone is capable of handling stress and like to simplify/generalise the idea of depression. <br><br>He feels the youngsters should go for dreams that they like right from the start. For example, if you want to be a cook, straightaway go study in a cooking school, don't go JC just for the sake of university and getting that degree. If you like art, go study it straight from the start so you won't waste time studying for a degree. </blockquote>
