              From my experience in both attending classes at Tuition Centre and being taught by people (tutors) coming to my house to teach me, I would say that both has its pros and cons. Regardless of tuition centre or private tuition, what matters is the qualifications/certifications/achievements that the tutors have.  As in, the tutor's own exam grades, the tuition center's certification in quality (if any) (for example), track record (how students generally progress when they attend their tuition), etcetera.
              
              Generally, going to tuition centre would enable the student to learn faster as there are many students in the class to identify many different doubts at the same time for the teachers to teach and clarify. On the other hand, having tutors to come to house and teach would enable the tutor to give a lot more attention and focus on the student during the tuition, since it's just one student to one teacher.
              
              It is usually quite hard to teach the Chinese Language to Primary school student, especially if Chinese language is not used at home. 
              
              While the tutors teach him the Chinese language, it would be easier for him to learn the Chinese language if you learn the language along with him and encourage communication in Chinese language at home. 
              
              Anyway, as to whether to go for tuition centre or private tuition, it depends on how much money you want to spend on this AND the qualifications of the tutors or tuition centre.

              <p>In language the best thing for your child is to make him interested and love the language, you might want to get him interested in stories, so that he likes to read chinese storybooks. If don't read Chinese storybooks, very hard to improve. </p>
              <p>Sometimes language Group tuition is better as your son has the chance to interact with other people in chinese, if not never get to use chinese, will not learn well <span style="line-height: 1.231;">just my opinion</span></p>

              I dont have children myself but I can tell you from my own experience growing up. I am fluent (both written and verbal) in Tamil, Indonesian and Vietnamese, and I didnt need classes for them. I grew up part of my life in Indonesia and Vietnam and learnt the language from general day-to-day life of meeting and speaking to people (from my drivers, maids, friends, etc.) and Tamil from my Mum. It helped to read loads of comics and watch TV series in the various languages.
              
              Being young, I would think as long as you engage him more in Chinese and have him reading books in Chinese, he will be able to pick up the language.
