              <p>just a question, is it better to be a full time tutor or MOE teacher doing part time tutoring?</p>
              <p>as a full time tutor it is defenitely less stressing than a MOE teacher, no need see face of principal, no need to worry about CCA teacher and other stuff to rise up the ladder. but the income is less stable, and not as much?</p>
              <p>MOE teaching income is more and job prospect more stable, qualificaiton also more recognised</p>

              <p>I've heard of Masters holders becoming full-time tutors and earning something like $7k to $10k per month.</p>

              <p>just a word of caution, it is not easy to become a MOE teacher. I should know since I am one myself ;)</p>
              <p>Besides teaching, you have to juggle with a lot of things in your hand...and handling a classroom of 40 kids can be quite challenging as well. But if you truly love being around kids and young adults, then this job can be a fulfilling one :)</p>

              <p>long ago, there were less tutors, so easier to charge more</p>
              <p>nowadays, especially with economic recession, it's extremely tough to get students paying you that amount...</p>
              <p>it's not that hard to find good tutors with degree charging half that price (or for some, even less)</p>

              <p>Depends on whether you're comfortable and confident with your teaching methods.</p>
              <p>Have you had prior experience in the line of teaching?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being an MOE teacher has its perks, like stability, experience gaining and benefits that any other regular job offers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But again, being a private tutor, you can really concentrate on the particular student. When he/she fares better after your coaching, the sense of achievement is definitely greater.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Down to basics, if you do well as a tutor, you can earn a lot more.</p>
              <p>Also, there are many good teachers, but good tutors are not easy to come by. When you are established, your name will be on a lot of parents' minds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Most pple in other professions/industries have an unforgivable misconception on teaching and/or tutoring as 'easy money'. There is no such thing as a free or easy lunch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Teaching (ie. MOE teaching) is easily one of the toughest white-collar (ie. non blue-collar) jobs out there. Tutoring, in contrast, is a non-reliable, non-steady, highly volatile means of income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not (be a fool and) expect easy money from either profession, especially in today's chronically ailing economic context. (In the past, if you wanted easy money, go be a banker. But so much for that.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've mentioned on occasion in the past, how unfortunate it was to have brilliant young minds who could have contributed to science and technology, give in to temptation and the lure of easy money, to go over into banking and finance. Well, the world economic crisis went some way into dealing with that disease. But it seems now, accounting is the next new best profession to make lots and lots of money (overtaking banking in the wake of recent events).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to teaching and tutoring. My recommendation (which has been also been echoed by others in this thread), is to go for both if you can. If you can succeed in your application, go teach as an MOE education officer. Then, if circumstances (or your free will) has it such, you can always give tuition subsequently to supplement and/or replace your income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I voluntarily resigned from MOE teaching, truthfully for a good variety of reasons (many of which would have sufficed on their own individually, incidentally), but I always encourage pple who have the genuine interest and passion, to try to take up teaching as a profession if they can (MOE may still be recruiting, but don't forget that increasingly so (in part thanks to globalization), supply outweighs demand, and every year the supply or number of new applicants (and consequently no. of rejected applicants as well) progresses geometrically/exponentially while no. of teaching places available (ie. demand) progresses only arithmetrically).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for tutoring, don't be fooled/blinded by the grandiose stories of a few who make $20k every month; for every one of these rare cases, there are many more who struggle to make barely $2k per month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottomline, whether teaching, tutoring, or any other profession, there's no such thing as a free lunch, no such thing as easy money. Don't go into either with foolish delusions, or you're doing yourself a disservice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you're willing to work hard, work smart, and work cosmoethically (ie. for the greater good of all beings in the Universe; in 'Hero', Jet Li the assassin could have murdered the Qin emperor and taken his personal vengeance, but Tony Leung wrote two words in the desert sand that reminded him of the bigger picture and the greater good - Tian Xia), then with Love as your guiding light, may you Live Long and Prosper.</p>

              <p>Hi, <br><br>  I made this posting on Channel NewsAsia forum some time ago when someone asked about teaching. The description below is a personal reflection. </p>
                          <p>  As a teacher, one needs to be able to juggle many activities, on top of teaching, lesson preparation, test/exam setting, marking and consultations such as:<br><br>- being a form teacher (plus responsibilities that come with the role such as counselling, speaking with parents, liaising with other subject teachers regarding academic matters when students perform below expectations, etc); <br><br>- carrying out department-assigned duties (e.g. action-research projects and cluster sharing sessions, develop teaching/learning resources, encourage e-learning among colleagues and students and the like);<br><br>- being a contributing member of various school committees (e.g. IT, speech day, national education, Innovation and Enterprise, and the like); <br><br>- being a co-curricular activity (CCA) teacher-in-charge (i.e. oversee running of the club, plan budget and monitor/review its spending, being with students when activities are organised, plan for club's student leadership succession, recommend students for school/MOE/national awards, etc.);<br><br>- entering data (e.g. marks, disciplinary cases, testimonials, etc.) into the student database (MOE-based and sometimes school-based systems);</p>
                          <p>- attend up to 100 hours of training in school or those conducted by MOE/NIE and complete several reflections (and sometimes carry out sharing sessions) after attending courses;</p>
                          <p>- attend frequent contact time meetings with heads/school leaders to receive information about initiatives/policy matters for school-wide implementation;</p>
                          <p>- attend meetings conducted by the department, various committees, school cluster, MOE HQ, etc;</p>
                          <p>- become invigilators, presiding examiners, chief presiding examiners, moderators, markers for national exams;</p>
                          <p> ...and the list simply grows :P<br><br>  As a teacher, one will be ranked on factors other than teaching such as organisational awareness, contributions to the school, leadership, strategic thinking, value-added results, etc. At the start of the year, a teacher will need to write personal statements about key performance indicators so that review sessions may be done at mid-year and end-of-year with his/her immediate supervisor(s) to see if these were met or otherwise. My experience is that there will always be areas for improvements no matter how well things were executed. The appetite for excellence is not to be underestimated.<br><br>  I hope this will provide a good picture of what a teacher is expected to perform in the education service. <br><br>Cheers, <br>Wen Shih</p>
