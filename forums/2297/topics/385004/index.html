              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>O levels is finally over and the next part to worry about is here. I do not have A maths or Pure sciences so I've decided to enter a Polytechnic regardless of the score I'll get.</p>
              <p>Well, the problem is, the only course that attracts me is International Business which is a new course in SP. I heard from many seniors that a new course may not be well managed and lecturers may be on-changing or inexperience. Is it true that a new course may not be as organised as other courses?</p>
              <p>Also, what are the career paths that is available for me in future?</p>
              <p>Lastly, as I'm pretty confident of getting L1B4 &lt; 10, I'm really afraid that the cut off point of the course will be more than 20, making it a course that others probably have a different impression of. Eg, nursing (sorry to those people in Nursing, no offence.)</p>
              <p>Please help me in making this decision and once again, congratulations for the rest of the O and N level batch for completing 10 years of education =D</p>

              <p>Hi mandy,</p>
              <p>You may wish to consider taking this course in Ngee Ann Poly instead, if you are worried that the course will have a high cut-off point.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.np.edu.sg/openhouse/course_ibz.html">http://www.np.edu.sg/openhouse/course_ibz.html</a></p>
              <p>However, given that this is what many who are interested in Business will consider a very "useful" Diploma Programme, and the intake for it is the smallest out of all the Business courses, the cut-off point in Singapore Poly will also unlikely be high.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>A recent trend in most of the course offered is they generally have a cutoff of 15 and below since more and more good students choose the poly route and would give new diplomas a try.</p>
              <p>Regardless if your dip, unless you do not intend to further your studies in uni, you should not be so bothered about the cutoff or anything. Eg engineering typically has the highest cutoff of poly courses but its 1 of the more popular courses in uni while business is a course that maybe even 3.5 might not get you into any of the local unis even though the cutoff for business might be higher than some other courses which ends up having an easier uni chance.</p>

              <p>All local dips are accepted by local uni. The only difference is the amount of exemptions a person might get which is only 1-2 modules at max for a business student.</p>

              <p>Sorry for the late reply guys. But really, thanks so much.</p>
              <p>However, I've surfed the net and found other business course that seems interesting as well.</p>
              <p>Diploma in Business Studies (NP)</p>
              <p>Diploma in Banking and Financial Services (NP)</p>
              <p>Diploma in Accountancy</p>
              <p>Diploma in International Business</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which course has a better future? As in, which course is more sought after even if I don't manage to qualify for a university by the end of the 3 years? Can anyone tell me in detail about the aforementioned courses?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance =D</p>
