              <p>Hi everyone, I need some help here pls. :D</p>
              <p>I am about to embark on a poly education and I have a few questions in mind.</p>
              <p>By fees per academic year which are in excess of $2k, does it mean that the total fees for 3 years are in excess of $6k or are the $2k fees for a semester?</p>
              <p>If Im not using my parents' CPF to pay for the poly tuition fees, is it possible to pay the full tuition fees through a bank loan and some other loan to cover the other 25%? As far as I know, the bank loan only covers 75% of the total tuition fees, hence if my parents are not willing to cough out the remaining 25%, is there a loan that can cover it? I do have some CPF funds which could cover about 1 sem worth of fees- possible to use these CPF funds with the bank loan to pay for the full amount of fees?</p>
              <p>Lastly, if I were to make it to a local uni after 3 years, does it mean that Im not entitled to any government grants to the uni education and I'll be on my own? Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>The $2250 fee for polytechnic is for one year. </p>
              <p>Indeed, the bank loan is up to 75% of the subsidised fee. You can try to get bursary from charitable organisations eg temples and associations or give tuition to cover the remaining 25% of the fee.</p>
              <p>In the past, students are entitled to only one tertiary education tuition grant. But, the restriction is no longer applied now for Singapore citizens.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>

              <p><br>Hi Hueyme,</p>
              <p>Poly does not require you to pay all the 3 years fee immediatley upon your admission / enrolment. </p>
              <p>You will pay your poly 3 year fee on an instalment basis.</p>
              <p>Hence, you need not pay the cash portion of $1687.50 immediately upon your enrolment even if you have the cash reserve to pay for it.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>You can use your parents' CPF to cover the polytechnic tuition fee.</p>
              <p>You do not need a laptop if you are short of funds and you have a desktop computer at home. There are very few courses in poly that specify that you must have a laptop.</p>
              <p>You can give tuition and / or work part time while studying in poly.</p>
