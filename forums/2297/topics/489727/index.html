              <p>SkillsFuture is a national movement to provide Singaporeans with the 
                              opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life, 
                              regardless of their starting points. Through this movement, the skills, 
                              passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's 
                              next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive 
                              society.<br> <br> No matter where you are in life – schooling years, early career, 
                              mid-career or silver years – you will find a variety of resources to 
                              help you attain mastery of skills. Skills mastery is more than having 
                              the right paper qualifications and being good at what you do currently; 
                              it is a mindset of continually striving towards greater excellence 
                              through knowledge, application and experience. With the help of the 
                              SkillsFuture Council, education and training providers, employers, 
                              unions – you can own a better future with skills mastery and lifelong 
                              learning. Your skills. Your asset. Your future.</p>
              <p>Everyone is part of Singapore's SkillsFuture journey. The choices you 
                  make or guide others to make in education, jobs or careers should 
                  lead to opportunities to maximise one's potential and develop a mastery 
                  of skills. To meet challenges and achieve success, chart your own paths 
                  through lifelong learning and skills mastery. Every Singaporean, every 
                  job, at every stage of life, counts.</p>

              <h3>Enhancing Continuing Education and Training (CET)</h3>
              <p>CET is increasingly important, given our rapidly changing economic and industry needs.</p>
              <p>Our polytechnics and ITE are quality 
                  providers for CET through the provision of subsidised part-time 
                  NITEC/Higher NITEC, part-time diploma and Advanced Diplomas/Specialist 
                  Diplomas programmes.</p>
              <p>To strengthen support for professionals, 
                  managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) to upgrade themselves, MOE 
                  will enhance subsidies for CET programmes, and expand the number of CET 
                  places in Part-time Diploma, Advanced Diploma and Specialist Diploma 
                  programmes at the polytechnics by 60%, from 6,400 to 10,100 places, by 
                  2015.</p>
              <p>In addition, we will work with the 
                  polytechnics and ITE to make their CET courses more compact and modular,
                   so as to provide greater flexibility for adult learners to customise 
                  their pace of learning. The high quality standards that our institutions
                   are known for will be maintained.</p>

              <h2>Taking Learning into our Careers</h2>
              <p>C.16.	The next stage concerns what happens after we 
              graduate from school and tertiary education. We will invest continually 
              in Singaporeans, throughout their careers.</p>
              <h3>SkillsFuture Credit</h3>
              <p>C.17.	We will create a<strong> SkillsFuture Credit </strong>for all Singaporeans. NTUC and several Members of Parliament have previously suggested a scheme of this nature.</p>
              <p>C.18.
              	Each Singaporean 25 years old and above will receive an initial credit 
              of $500 from 2016. We will make further top-ups to their SkillsFuture 
              Credit at regular intervals. These credits will not expire, but can only
               be used for education and training.</p>
              <p>C.19.	We have decided to spread out the top-ups over the course of a person’s life for two reasons.</p>
              <p class="indent">a.	<em>First</em>,
               there is no need for anyone to rush to use their credit. While some may
               use their initial $500 immediately for a short programme, others may 
              want to accumulate credits to engage in more substantial training later 
              in their career.</p>
              <p class="indent">b.	<em>Second</em>, we need time 
              to develop quality offerings in our SkillsFuture landscape that are 
              relevant to jobs and individuals’ future careers. We must go for quality
               training which will open up career possibilities for individuals, and 
              that employers find relevant.</p>
              <p>C.20.	The 
              SkillsFuture Credit can be used for a broad range of courses supported 
              by government agencies. These will include courses offered by our 
              Institutes of Higher Learning and accredited education and training 
              providers, as well as a range of courses that are funded by the WDA.</p>
              <p>C.21.
              	To complement this, every Singaporean will be given an online 
              Individual Learning Portfolio – a one-stop education, training, and 
              career guidance resource to help them plan their learning starting from 
              their time in secondary school.</p>
              <h3>SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme</h3>
              <p>C.22.	To cater to fresh graduates from our Polytechnics and ITE, we will launch a <strong>SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme</strong> in 2015. It will give them a head start in their careers.</p>
              <p>C.23.
              	The graduates will be matched with suitable employers. They will start 
              working and undergo structured on-the-job training and mentorship, while
               they study for an industry-recognised qualification.</p>
              <p>C.24.
              	Both trainees and employers who sign up for this programme will receive
               substantial support from the Government. This will be done in a phased 
              way, eventually covering up to one in three polytechnic and ITE 
              graduates.</p>
              <h3>Enhanced Subsidies for Mid-Career Singaporeans</h3>
              <p>C.25.	We will enhance subsidies for mid-career Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>C.26.	<em>First</em>, <strong>education and training subsidies for all Singaporeans aged 40 and above will be enhanced to a minimum of 90% </strong>of training costs for courses funded by MOE and WDA.</p>
              <p>C.27.
              	This additional support from the Government recognises the opportunity 
              costs that mid-career Singaporeans face when they go for education and 
              training.</p>
              <p>C.28.	These subsidies are significant:</p>
              <p class="indent">a.
              	For a part-time undergraduate course such as a Bachelor of Engineering,
               which is already subsidised, the total fees payable by a student will 
              be reduced by 60%, from about $17,000 to $6,800.</p>
              <p>C.29.	<em>Second</em>, Singaporeans will now be able to enjoy <strong>multiple subsidies from MOE for modular courses</strong> – at all levels, and regardless of age. This flexibility of modular, 
              continuous learning will help individuals, who will often have to 
              balance family and career together with their learning. Many individuals
               may prefer to go for several bites of short courses, rather than to go 
              for a long course.</p>
              <p>C.30.	We will implement these enhanced subsidies later in the year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Targeted Support for Career Progression</h2>
              <p>C.31.	Beyond the SkillsFuture Credit and these 
              broad-based subsidies, we will provide special support for Singaporeans 
              seeking to develop deep skills in particular fields.</p>
              <p>C.32.	<em>First</em>, we will introduce<strong> SkillsFuture Study Awards</strong>.
               They will support individuals who wish to develop the specialist skills
               required for our future growth clusters. For example, they may include 
              software developers, satellite engineers or master craftsmen. The awards
               can also support those who already have deep specialist skills and wish
               to develop other competencies such as business and cross-cultural 
              skills. At this stage, we are not setting a cap on the number of awards,
               but it should eventually be about 2,000 study awards per year. We will 
              introduce the SkillsFuture Study Awards in phases, starting this year.</p>
              <p>C.33.	<em>Second</em>, we will introduce <strong>SkillsFuture Fellowships</strong>,
               to develop Singaporeans to achieve mastery in their respective fields. 
              We will award about 100 fellowships a year, which can be used for a 
              range of education and training options, in both craft-based and 
              knowledge-based areas. It will be funded from the SkillsFuture Jubilee 
              Fund, which will be financed by voluntary contributions from employers, 
              unions, the public and the Government. This broad-based  involvement 
              signifies everyone being a stakeholder. The SkillsFuture Fellowships 
              will be introduced from 2016.</p>
              <p>C.34.	The 
              SkillsFuture Study Awards and Fellowships will be mainly used to develop
               deep skills and mastery in the growth clusters of the future. But we 
              will be open to those who want to develop themselves in fields that they
               are really passionate about, that may not be in these growth clusters. 
              Take individuals like <strong>Edwin Neo</strong>, for example. He was 
              trained in interior design, but developed a passion for making high 
              quality European-style shoes. He went to train under a master shoemaker 
              in Budapest and came back to found his own company. He is doing well, 
              selling both ready-to-wear shoes and upmarket bespoke creations.</p>
              <p>C.35.	<em>Finally</em>, we will work with companies to grow Singaporean corporate leaders under the <strong>SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative</strong>.
               This initiative will provide support for companies who commit to 
              developing a pipeline of Singaporeans to take on corporate leadership 
              roles and responsibilities in the future. This too is important.</p>
