              <p>1. The diagram shows a transverse wave on a rope. The wave is travelling from left to right. At this instant shown, the points P and Q on the rope have zero displacement and maximum displacement respectively.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/physics1-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>What is the direction of motion of points P and Q at this instant? (eg. Downwards, upwards, stationary)</p>
              <p>For  P, I think it's upwards while Q is stationary.</p>
              <p>2. Two solenoids, X and Y , are connected in series as shown and are suspended near each other. When X and Y are connected to an a.c. supply, they will</p>
              <p>A repel each other</p>
              <p>B Attract each other</p>
              <p>COscillate towards and away from each other</p>
              <p>D Oscillate upwards and downwards.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics2-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>3. A 12 V lamp is connected to a 12 V supply with very long leads as shown</p>
              <p> <img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics3-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Why does lamp glow dimly?</p>
              <p>A. Current through lamp is less than current from supply</p>
              <p>B P.D across each lead will be half the supply voltage</p>
              <p>C Lamp connected wrong way round</p>
              <p>D Electrical energy coverted to internal energy in long leads.</p>
              <p>Eliminated C since it's totally impossible. I also ruled out D as internal energy changes when there is a change in either kinetic OR potential energy. Now left with A and B. B sounds right but I'm not sure... if yes, can someone explain why P.D across each lead will be half the supply voltage? If no, then please explain to me why it is the other answer, etc.</p>
              <p>4.To an observer at X, in which direction does coil move?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics4.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>A From L to K</p>
              <p>B Out of paper</p>
              <p>C Turns clockwise about axis KL</p>
              <p>D Turns anti-clockwise about axis KL</p>
              <p>I understand that force is downwards so I thought answer could be A or D. I think if you visualise it 3D, it will turn anti-clockwise about axis KL (moving down). Not sure if it's correct.</p>
              <p>5. If you have 2 conducting plates</p>
              <p>S_________N_______________ +V</p>
              <p>                    </p>

              <p>R_________M_______________0</p>
              <p>placed parallel at a fixed distance apart, what is the magnituude of the electric form experienced by a point charge as it moves along MN? </p>
              <p>It's the same yeah? Since it's a uniform parallel conducting plate.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes, it is the same. This is because E-field inside the parallel plates is a constant.<br>But there's work done hor</p>

              <p>1. The diagram shows a transverse wave on a rope. The wave is
              travelling from left to right. At this instant shown, the points P
              and Q on the rope have zero displacement and maximum displacement
              respectively.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/physics1-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>What is the direction of motion of points P and Q at this
              instant? (eg. Downwards, upwards, stationary)</p>
              <p>For  P, I think it's upwards while Q is stationary.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For wave questions, think about which direction will the wave move, and as the wave move, the particles need to move up and down to complete the "motion", therefore, P should move up and Q should move down</span></p>
              <p>2. Two solenoids, X and Y , are connected in series as shown and
              are suspended near each other. When X and Y are connected to an
              a.c. supply, they will</p>
              <p>A repel each other</p>
              <p>B Attract each other</p>
              <p>COscillate towards and away from each other</p>
              <p>D Oscillate upwards and downwards.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics2-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assuming your directions of circuit is correct. Y and X will have the same induced north pole pointing right, so they will tend to attract each other, but according to , i think , Lenz laws, they will tend to repel the motion of attraction. Answer: A</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. A 12 V lamp is connected to a 12 V supply with very long
              leads as shown</p>
              <p> <img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics3-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Why does lamp glow dimly?</p>
              <p>A. Current through lamp is less than current from supply</p>
              <p>B P.D across each lead will be half the supply voltage</p>
              <p>C Lamp connected wrong way round (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clearly not possible, yes)</span></p>
              <p>D Electrical energy coverted to internal energy in long
              leads. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(conductor, should not be)</span></p>
              <p>Eliminated C since it's totally impossible. I also ruled out D
              as internal energy changes when there is a change in either kinetic
              OR potential energy. Now left with A and B. B sounds right but I'm
              not sure... if yes, can someone explain why P.D across each lead
              will be half the supply voltage? If no, then please explain to me
              why it is the other answer, etc.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The long leads will increase resistance using resistance formulae, therefore, using V=IR, increase R, V constant, therefore I decrease. So answer is </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #339966;">A</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, volatage is the amount of work across a certain section of wire or any item with resistance by 1 C of charge, so although the resistance wire (Lead), will cause some work to be done, but it is not across the bulb, so V stays constant.</span></span></p>
              <p>4.To an observer at X, in which direction does coil move?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk248/maymaytan/Physics4.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>A From L to K</p>
              <p>B Out of paper (<span style="font-weight: bold;">OUT OF CONTEXT, is see bu X not you)</span></p>
              <p>C Turns clockwise about axis KL</p>
              <p>D Turns anti-clockwise about axis KL</p>
              <p>I understand that force is downwards so I thought answer could
              be A or D. I think if you visualise it 3D, it will turn
              anti-clockwise about axis KL (moving down). Not sure if it's
              correct.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">current not given, question is ambiguous, however, if i use DC current from K to L, it will move right, which is neither the options, and AC curent cannot do.... Is this DC or AC system?</span></p>
