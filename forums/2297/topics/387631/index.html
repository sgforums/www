              <p>Hello everyone!,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the previous thread i've recently made in 'ITE to MASTERS possible?'. i'm actually elated to see wonderful feedbacks and some polorize views by you people. well , i'm currently studying in ITE CW-AM campus under 'Precision Engineering'. tomorrow is the debut of my first learning journey for the above course. the sentiment of having that as my 3rd choice was good enough because i've the sheer of determination to further my education in polytechnics with at least 3.8 GPA credits earned in my 2nd year - in 2011. by the way , 3.8 GPA is my target and i'll rest assure that i don't miss out that target for if the bullets need more backup. Also , i think that ITE is good for students who can't cope with academia studies. In my opinion it's 'ok' after doing the aftermath - the feedbacks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question is? When will ITE ever be known as a well-rounded Education to Pathway of education success? Please answer it honestly. I'd really appreciate that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the second though , i'd wish to apologize to viewers that found my previous thread a little insulting. Sorry.</p>

              <p>simple, the education system doesn't think he's good enough.</p>
              <p>there are other routes, but what if along the way, he learns that he wants something else?</p>
              <p>i have friends who go one big circle in university because they realise they are not learning what they wanted in the first place.</p>
              <p>i have a friend who was from normal tech, went to ITE, then swapped to Shatec, worked as a waiter, study accountancy part time and now that he's 29, he gets a nice paying cushy job as an accountant.  the ITE and Shatec route is totally different from what he is now.  would that be a waste of time? no.</p>
              <p>eventually he is happy with what he decided to go for.  the only thing was that the education system thought that he wasn't good enough to fly that fast.</p>

              <p>Private diplomas and degrees in engineering are rarely recognised by employers.</p>
              <p>Employers still prefer engineering qualifications from ITE, poly and NUS and NTU.</p>
              <p>Private schools can only teach the theory part while the practical part of engineering is not covered or cover superficially.</p>
              <p>As compared to ITE, poly, NUS and NTU, they have invested millions of dollars on the latest engineering facilities to help the students to get the first hand, practical engineering skills.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not all ITE student are lousy in their academic. Its probably a wrong step at that critical point that causes their "fall". I, for one, was a ITE student. After studying for 2 years in ITE and serving 2 years in NS, I managed to go to NTU after getting my diploma. (I studied 4 years of part time. Half study and half working.) I studied  full time in NTU.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also its not a waste studying ITE then diploma and finally NTU. At each point of time, you experience different stages in life. As a manager now, I fully comprehend what it is like to be a technician (cause I was a technician before).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore don't give up.. Treat every step as a challenge. Learn as much as possible in each instance in life. Stretch your potential (you don't know your own potential until you hit the limits).</p>
              <p>lastly a word of advice ....A person who give up is worse than a person who fall....</p>
              <p> </p>
