              <p>really? not too sure, since i was from before H1,2,3 came out, but my school allowed combined chem/phy from sec school to pure chem &amp; phy in jc. also allowed bio without pure bio background... maybe ts should check with the jc he plans to go to and see what they allow?</p>

              I am a med student so let me give my inputs. It is impossible to take all 3 pure sciences in JC now unless you take Knowledge Inquiry. Such a subject combination is terribly hard to secure and much less score in.

              <br>
              <br>
              
              Anyway Chem and Bio combination is not only preferred, its is the only way to get in. There have been students taking Phy and Chem getting into Medicine but I can affirm you that their chances are extremely slim.

              <p><br>That's bad news for Sg students interested in Medicine, seeing how problematic (ie. screwed up) the H2 Biology syllabus is.</p>
              <p><br>Generally, Physics and Chemistry at 'A' levels is still a far wiser option (than Biology and Chemistry), in terms of availability/number of University level courses open to you. Afterall, you (all students) may change your mind about studying Medicine one day, and you'd want to have as wide as possible, your options of available University level courses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/262220">Shinsyuen</a>, where there's a will, there's a way. You could always study Medicine in an overseas University (eg. explore scholarship options if finances are a problem).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Still, given your career dreams, it's definitely better for you to take triple pure sciences now at secondary school level. You probably want to transfer out of your current school if they refuse to let you take pure sciences. Try getting your parents to appeal to the principal first.</p>

              Yes I know she/he is in Secondary School. However I think he has been offered combined science for academic qualifications and I doubt the school would be willing to change it. Even if they did, if you cannot handle PSLE Science then I think TS will have problems with pure sciences much less JC H2 level and Medical Text.
              <br>
              <br>
              Regarding "they like that say but they prefer all 3", I am not too sure if the selection board looks into your secondary school subject combination but for my case I did take all 3 Sciences with A maths and E Maths. I think whats more important is your Junior College Subject Combination. Which explains why my above advice was more focused in relations to JC academics because that is what truly matters and that is what TS can realistically affect now. As to whether he will take combine science in Secondary 1 or not, thats entirely up to the school. Whatever we say here won't matter
              <br>
              <br>
              As to all the above post before me, I think its consensus that "if you want to get into medicine then you should be performing much better than this". We don't wish to be crude but it is true. TS is still young and still has 6 long years to change his course and my best advice is to wake up and work hard. 
              <br>
              <br>
              It is not that medical school is elitist and it only takes in students from top Junior Colleges and fine academic backgrounds. The selection process is extremely rigorous and mentally draining because this is what is expected of the profession. They are looking for people who have the mental capacity to withstand five long years of intense studying amongst many other qualities and hence academic record will be your first hurdle. Don't be fooled by thinking that you can get in as long as you have perfect or excellent A level results. Truth is everyone who applies will have a perfect or excellent A level results and each year only a small percentage gets through. The minute you apply, you are pitting yourself against the best in this country.
              <br>
              <br>
              Do think through it carefully because as said once you decide on this course your field of study becomes very specific. The life of a Doctor is not as glamorous, decorated or high living as you think.

              Yes yes. Dont give TS false hopes. There are people graduating with 4 H2 As from everywhere. Normally schools produce about 2-3 per year, Top Junior Colleges churn out 4 H2 As by the classes. The names of people who only attained 4 H2 As in my year was long enough to fill up 2-3 pieces of paper. This are the people who only attained 4 H2 A's. This people are considered the average. What the school announces are only those who attained 6 or more distinctions and such.
              <br>
              <br>
              Hence TS if you wish to get into medicine, Aim to get quality education in JC. Yes of course if you go to YJ and MI you still stand a chance to obtain 4 As and apply to compete for a seat in medical school, I will honestly and frankly tell you getting a quality education will make studying much easier. At least your chances of getting excellenct A level results are higher, once you achieved that you are on your own for the admission process. No one can help you then.

              <p>Have you participated in any Science fairs, events or competitions? You can use those to try to make an appeal to enter a Pure Science class.</p>
