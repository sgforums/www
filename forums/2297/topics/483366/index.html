              <p>Hi Christina,</p>
              <p>I have never experienced parenthood so I can only draw experience from my own parents and how they brought me up.</p>
              <p>My father had always been supportive of what I aspired to be ... but he also taught me to be realistic about my abilities and weaknesses. In a sense he gave me free will to choose my own path.</p>
              <p>I suppose the relevance to your own predicament is the realism bit. In life we aspire to succeed however most times we spend our life dealing with defeat.</p>
              <p>As such it is a good opportunity to help her deal with defeat and also to move on (the realistic bit).</p>
              <p> </p>

              What Genie99b said. Good advice, certainly.
              <br><br>
              Notwithstanding, at the same time, if your daughter is sure she would like to give the Medical School route another shot, she can try a route less conventional : for one year, do not go to either JC (arts) or Poly (non-biomedical), but instead self-study and retake O levels as a private candidate, *and* self-study A levels at the same time (since due to age constraints, she won't be allowed to take A levels as a private candidate till she's older).
              <br><br>
              If all goes well, her O level results should improve sufficiently to re-apply into a JC which allows her to take Science. And meanwhile, her self-study of A levels would have prepared her well for her JC studies.
              <br><br>
              Worst case scenario, she can always (whether at the time she's in a JC, a Poly, or neither) take A levels as a private candidate. If she manages to achieve all As as a private candidate, she can still apply into Medical school (both local and recognized overseas Unis).
              <br><br>
              The above is for your daughter's and your own consideration. It's just one possible route. I mention it, not because it's necessarily any better or any worse, but only because it doesn't even occur to (or register in the minds of) most students and parents, that this (albeit unconventional) pathway could actually work.

              <p>Two biotechnology students successfully entered NUS medicine in 2007 - <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100412-209774.html">http://news.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100412-209774.html</a>. If your daughter is the cream of the crop in her biotechnology course, she might stand a chance. But the A level route would be more feasible if your daughter manages to score straight A's in her subjects</p>
