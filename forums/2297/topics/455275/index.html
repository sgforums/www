However, there are claims that if one does not take Add maths, it will be difficult to move up from poly to uni. Can anyone verify this for me?</p></div>

              <p>It depends on the university course.<br><br>I wasn't allowed to take Add maths in sec school. <br>I was taught Engineering maths in poly, and the syllabus resembles Add maths taught in sec school, except some parts are a bit harder, while some parts are not as hard.<br><br>When i was in poly, i took a supplementary course on higher engineering maths (it's a few topic from university maths) and found that some parts of it requires some knowledge from additional maths, but not totally.<br> In my opinion the maths still rely very much on the basics, it's requires you to derive some equations, and prove here and there, thus it requires good manipulation in the sec school e maths part(factorisation, expansion) , as well as some advance knowledge in A maths, which will help to speed things up and understand concepts better.<br><br>Now for your question, i will suggest that your sister should decide if taking add maths will really hinder her chances of scoring well and get into poly. <br><br>If she will fail o levels or do very badly just because she has to concentrate on add maths, then it's better to drop it, dun fail the whole o level just because of one subject.<br><br>If she can cope with it, then it's a bonus to know A maths, it will help quite a bit. Like when you see this equation, you know what to do, cos u have done it before. It's something like once u see sin 30, u know the answer is 0.5, when you see a complicated mixed fraction, you know how to break them up, u know how to use l hopital rule, etc etc</p>
              <p>I heard JC maths will help a lot more in uni.</p>

              <p>Great, thanks. I don't think she will take anything resembling engineering, so I will take it that her chances are not affected by a lot.</p>
              <p>And JC maths do help in uni (if you take the right courses), cos apparently it's taught along the lines of yr 1 uni maths, but I'm am arts guy so I am not too sure how well will it help.</p>

              <p>I will suggest that she take Add mathematics just in case, some courses in poly likes to incorporate maths into their course.</p>
              <p>Even my friend from diploma in hospitality course also requires some maths, things like statistics, probability, etc etc.</p>
              <p>Learning more is always good.</p>
