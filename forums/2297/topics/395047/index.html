              <p>Hi guys.</p>
              <p>I have this question in my mind. Im taking Amaths now but my amaths results are always just 50+/100. My amaths is just struggling on the fail and pass line. Im scared that Poly needs a lot of amaths background, so i want to ask is Amaths needed or important for computer or business courses in Poly? But my Emaths is quite good, i usually get B3 and above for it. So do i need to worry about my Amaths much?</p>

              <p>A. Maths is not really that important if you are to work really hard in poly, but it is very clearly a huge plus to have with you.</p>

              <p>Depends on the courses for comp(uter?) and business. For my IT course, we do learn mathematics which some can be found in A-Maths. There only 1 Maths module for my course which last 1 semester (about half a year) so it's pretty simple.</p>
              <p>The topics found in A-Maths which I can still remember are matrix and sets. I think that's the only 2, others are decimal, hexadecimal and binary calculation/conversion which is not found in A-maths.</p>
              <p>For business, I'm not sure. Do business-related courses (other than accounting) even needs to study maths!?</p>
              <p>Tell you what, look at the course structure for the courses you want to get into and check for any maths module. Course structure basically tells you what you will learn for the whole 3 years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, like what others say, it's a big plus for poly if you know A-maths and more so if you are planning to get into engineering courses.</p>

              <p>Yes. Only minimal. 1 module. Business Statistics. <br><br>It really depends what you intend to pursue in the future.<br><br>For business related courses, A Maths seriously is rather redundant. <br><br>But anyway, by dropping, you must remember how many subjects you are actually taking. 6 drop to 5 I advise you not to drop at all.</p>

              <p>Some of my friend in computer engineering course learn a maths as well</p>
              <p>I am studying engineering in polytechnic, and there is a subject called engineering maths.</p>
              <p>That is the secondary school's A maths. Basically you will cover almost the whole a math textbook(i think) again in less than a year, so better listen in class.</p>
              <p>I have no basics in a maths back in sec school, my e maths was c6 at olevels</p>
              <p>I only listen in class, do some tutorial, and did most of the past year papers, and got back a B+ for this year's maths, so i think as long as you listen in class in polytechnic lectures you should be fine.</p>
              <p>I also heard from my classmates who took amaths in o level that the question in the poly exams is not as hard as those in the o levels</p>

              <p>PedoBear, now the Amath Olvl format different from what you say already, yours type i saw it in my TYS years ago, now dont have what partical mechanics already... anyway i compareÂ in TYS i see like last time's amath like harder then nowadays one ? &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>Haing Amath is good, and at some point I felt that Amath is easier than Emath, lol. I got C5 for prelim and a B3 for Olvl. I'm happy for that cos i dont really do well for exams in school, always is just pass kind.</p>
              <p>Anyway I dont understand why in poly engineering courses and some chemical sciences courses learn Amaths topics ? When you come out to work got use meh ? When work got use like trigo etc to solve problems meh ? engineering maybe got use but chemical sciences ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Im now wondering should i drop Amaths next year when im in sec 4? Becuz Amaths is kinda hard for me, and its stressing me off sometimes. And im aiming for IT courses in poly, which do not need much of amaths. Now with my Amaths on hand, im taking 7 subjects. Should i drop Amaths next year if i still do not do well for it? Becuz without Amaths, i can use the time to concentrate on my other subjects. And i feel that i might as well learn Amaths again in poly as IT courses juz need us to know some topics in Amaths but not all. But for O level Amaths, i need to know all the topics in Amaths!</p></div>
