              <p>Hey there,<br> I am currently in Secondary School and wish to take Law as a subject in the future.<br> I am wondering what subjects should I take now and if Additional Maths is
              vital or not as I am currently thinking about forgoing Additional Maths,
              I'm not very good at it. However,my English is rather good as with my
              other subjects such as Design and Technology, Geography and Et Cetera therefore I've decided to go Law.<br> Also, I also would like to know what subjects should I take in Junior College to suit me should I wish to take up Law.<br> Thanks In advance.</p>

              <p>I didn't go JC so i do not know what are the subjects they offer.</p>
              <p>However to enter law, u will need 4As so choose the subjects that u are confident in getting an A in since even 1 B will remove ur chances of getting into Law.</p>

              <p>A's.</p>
              <p>U need to do the full 3 H2 and 1 H1 for JC and get an A for all 4.</p>
              <p>For O's, u just need to do well enough to be able to do the subjects u want in JC, more As are obviously better but O's results are not taken into account for JC students going to uni. O's results are only used for poly students going to uni.</p>

              <p>Its essential for people who want to go into science and engineering related courses but if u are sure u don't want to go into that field that A maths is less required for u since A maths is required for A levels H2 maths.</p>

              <p>i received an offer from law.</p>
              <p>the way singapore universities work, it doesn't matter what subjects you take. my advice is: just take all the subjects that you're most confident of scoring a good score in. there'll always be a contrasting subject to pin you down so the others don't matter as much. the drawback is that should you screw up your A levels, you don't have many options, only FASS or real estate etc.</p>
              <p>then again, if you would screw up your most confident subjects, you're unlikely to do well in those "hard core" sciences. so just follow your heart. this is the first time you get to choose your subjects and society is not going to decide for you.</p>
              <p>good luck.</p>

              <p>Hi Deviouz,</p>
              <p>Most local private universities' degrees are much less recognised than those of local universities. If I am not wrong, you will need at least three "A"s and a "B" from your "A"-lvl examination to enter the law faculty in SMU. </p>
              <p>Do not worry too much about your subject combinations, take the subjects which you know that you will be able to score well in instead.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
