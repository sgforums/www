              <p>It is possible. However, have you considered using your dip to enter an overseas uni or a private uni instead? It is going to take at least another year for you to study for your private "A", if not longer. Thus, your dip will sort of go to waste, unless you use it to take up a part-time job for the time being.</p>
              <p>Results-wise you will not need need straight A's.</p>

              <p>do you realise what you are getting into? its not so simple say retake then can retake</p>

              <p>furthermore, even the core subjects are not easy. you need full time studies for 2 yrs to study everything again. do you have access to lecture notes, tutorials, and past year school papers to practice? 1 yr is definitely not enough for someone like you to prepare for A lvls from scratch.</p>
              <p>and since you already have a private diploma, why waste the time and effort to go through the A lvls? just go straight on to SIM or overseas uni, and save yourself 2 yrs in the process.</p>

              <p>Hi deathmaster.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for your advice.</p>
              <p>Of course I have done my research thoroughly. I am not underestimating A levels. I have read through the syllabuses from SEAB website. The H2 subjects that I am able to do are Mathematics, Economics and Management in Business. During my diploma course, I ace my mathematics and statistic modules and I am sure I am familiar with at least 50% to 60% of H2 Mathematics syllabus. Likewise for Economics and Management, but I would say, some topics in the syllabuses in Economics and Management are new to me.So I am not entirely doing A level from scratch, considering I have some knowledge.</p>
              <p>Resources such as past year papers and tutorials, are limited. I have friends who are tutors for JC students, so I may be able to get it from them. At least I have some resources to work on.</p>
              <p>My concern is,<br>Like what you have said, "Project Work" is a subject not available to me as a private candidate. Will I be at a disadvantage compared to the rest of the applicants? Will my application even be considered for admission?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Btw, thank you for letting me know UniSIM degrees are recognised by the government. I just check with MOE and they will put degree holders into GEO 1 scale. So, going into UniSIM is another choice for me if NUS/SMU don't accept my applications.</p>

              <p>Hi Forbiddensinner</p>
              <p>I am not 
              comparing the Universities in terms of rank only. But I am sure there 
              are reasons why NUS/NTU/SMU is a much highly sought after Universities. I
               agree with you, that individuals matters more. However, the standard of
               University do play a part, am I right? Otherwise, why do they rank them
               as the one of the top few university?</p>
              <p>Please correct me if I am wrong. My knowledge in education and universities is very limited.</p>
