What we understand from your definition of normal force is the reaction force from the ground, which of course reduces to zero when you are not touching the ground. It does not remain there. Because it is present for such a short time, you may also call it an impulse. Mathematically, an impulse is the multiplication of the force times the time of application of force.<br><br>Yes, the resultant force is what causes the person to accelerate, and it is due to the reaction force from the ground being greater than the weight of the person.<br><br>If you are asking about the magnitude of the resultant force during the whole course of the jumping motion, it cannot be answered properly.<br><br></div></blockquote>yep i know its impulse, the thing is what causes the normal force to increase. if u say internal forces dun matter, then the body cant juz push downwards since it has no other external forces acting on it what.<br><br>ok in the first place, all u guys mentioned was inertia, y the normal force is absent, n what is a normal force etc...what i wanna know is how the normal force changes from the point in time when he bends down up till the time when he is about to leave the ground. in that sense u guys din mention any part of it.<br><br>btw im asking abt how the magnitude of the normal force changes with time during the process of him bending down n abt to leave the ground. not resultatnd force.</div>

Only at the point of leaving would the force be greater than your weight, else you would have been lifted up off the ground before you even finish the jumping motion. =D</div>
