              <p>SBS n SMRT's answers are correct.</p>
              <p><br>1) Yes, that's right. The hydroxy / hydroxyl OH group is present in the form of the hydroxide OH- ion in NaOH(aq), which is basic (ie. can accept protons to form water) and hence the solution of NaOH(aq) is alkaline (ie. pH &gt; 7 at room temperature). The hydroxy / hydroxyl OH group in alcohol is covalently bonded to the alkyl 'R' group and has no (formal or ionic) charge, and is neutral, ie. pH = 7 at room temperature (it is not acidic because the conjugate base RO- alkoxide ion is not stabilized by being delocalized by resonance and is in fact destablized by the electron donating by induction alkyl 'R' group; it is not basic because oxygen is electronegative and holds the lone pair tightly and hence is not available to accept a proton, and the conjugate acid is unstable because electronegative oxygen does not like a positive formal charge).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion, for 'O' levels the two differences are : the OH group is sodium hydroxide is negatively charged and is basic; the OH group is alcohol has no charge and is neutral.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Yes, that's correct. Non-metal oxides are covalent oxides and hence are acidic oxides. Due to the greater electronegativity of oxygen compared to carbon, the carbon is partially positively charged and is hence electrophilic. It consequently invites nucleophilic attack by water molecules, forming carbonic(IV) acid upon hydrolysis :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CO2(g) + H2O(l) ---&gt; H2CO3(aq) ---&gt; H+(aq) + HCO3-(aq)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The protons (H+ ions) will cause the solution to be acidic and the pH to decrease below 7 (at room temperature), which can thusly be detected by the Universal Indicator solution.</p>
              <p> <br>In addition, when some species of yeast carry out fermentation (ie. breakdown of carbohydrates), they may also generate lactic acid, which can also be detected by the Universal Indicator solution.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) SBS n SMRT's answers are correct. The carbonate(IV) ions would be protonated by the carboxylic acid, forming the conjugate acid carbonic(IV) acid, which exists in equilibirum with, and hence can decompose into CO2(g) and H2O(l). Notice that carbon dioxide, being a gas, leaves the reaction mixture, pulling the position of equilibrium over to the right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2RCOOH(aq) ---&gt; 2H+(aq) + 2RCOO-(aq)</p>
              <p>2H+(aq) + CO3 2-(aq) ---&gt; H2CO3(aq) ---&gt; CO2(g) + H2O(l)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice how this reaction (ie. the 2nd equation) is the exact same reaction as in our discussion on Q2, but in the opposite direction.</p>

              <p>#1 - Esterification reaction, because an ester is generated as the main organic product.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 - Condensation reaction (NOT a dehydration reaction) because water is eliminated to join two smaller molecules (the alcohol and carboxylic acid) together into a larger molecule (the ester)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#3 - Nucleophilic acyl substitution (NOT just 'nucleophilic substitution', because those two words alone imply nucleophilic aliphatic substitution, whose mechanism is SN1 or SN2), because nucleophilic substitution is occurring on an acyl group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#4 - Addition-Elimination reaction, the mechanism by which nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs. The nucleophile is added first (in this case the nucleophile is the alcohol, the nucleophilic atom being the partially negatively charged O atom) as it attacks the electrophile (in this case the electrophile is the carboxylic acid or acyl halide, the electrophilic atom being the partially positively charged C atom of the carboxylic / acyl group), shifting the pi bond upwards to generate a singly bonded O atom with a negative formal charge, which then reforms the carbonyl and the leaving group (in this case, protonated OH group, or OH2+) is eliminated (in this case, as water).</p>

              <p>As an example, just a few years ago, transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein) used to be taught only at 'A' levels. It is now part of the 'O' level syllabus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, in the same way that I hope my posts might get 'O' level students interested in taking up 'A' level Chemistry (and to want to self-learn more outside the syllabus for the joy of Chemistry), I hope that my posts, which include some University level Chemistry, might also get JC students (or chemistry based polytechnic course students) to want to self-learn more outside the syllabus for the joy of Chemistry, or to take up some Chemistry related science courses in the future when they/you go on to University.</p>

              <p>You're totally welcome again. Remember to find what's enjoyable about your studies, allow yourself to enjoy it at a deeper level (ie. for the sake of understanding your relationship to the Universe, and not just for the sake of passing exams), and your academic life will be meaningful and fulfilling.</p>

              <p>On another forum, I replied the post of a parent who is concerned for his child, who is in Normal Academic. He was asking for advice on how to help his child improve his/her Science. I posted the following :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm about to make a suggestion that may not work for every Normal Academic student, but does work well for some Normal Academic students. There are many reasons why a student may be streamed into Normal Academic, and it does not necessarily mean that student is not capable in his/her own way, even academically. (I'm an ex-MOE teacher, and I've seen some NA students who were even more academically capable than some Express students.)<br><br>My suggestion is this - instead of letting your child do Normal Academic papers, let him/her do Express papers, first Combined Science papers, and if he/she expresses the interest to go futher, let him/her have a go at Pure Science papers.<br><br>You can obtain the Ten Year Series (Topical would be preferable over Yearly) for 'O' levels Combined Science, and for Pure Science 'O' levels, at any Popular Bookstore.<br><br>Every student, whether Normal Technical, Normal Academic, Express or Special, is academically inclined to different extents in different subjects. If your child has a talent for Chemistry, then even if he/she struggles with Normal Academic physics (for example), he/she may be able to perform well for Express level Chemistry. This may or may not be true, depending on the individual student.<br><br>Personally, as a ex-MOE teacher now full time tuition teacher, my teaching strategy for exam preparation has always been to expose the student to at least one level higher.<br><br>I let my Normal Academic students prepare themselves using Express level Combined Science Chemistry exam papers, and let my Express level Combined Science students tackle Pure Chemistry 'O' level exam papers, and let my Pure Chemistry students try out 'A' level Chemistry exam questions, and expose my JC 'A' level students to University level Chemistry questions.<br><br>This works very well for those with talent, inclination or potential in Chemistry, regardless of which stream (eg. Normal Academic) they may find themselves currently in, for whatever reasons.<br><br>All the best for your child.</p>

              <p><br>Sweee! MOE Teacher! :)</p>
              <p><br>Biology teacher eh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tips ah... for Biology (and for Chem, and for any subject actually), go NUS Co Op and look for good specialist textbooks (not general textbooks like Campbell), and buy good ones that have their solution manuals available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A couple of years ago, I recall once (at NUS Co Op) seeing an excellent Questions-&amp;-Solutions Biology compaion book full of intriguing fascinating molecular biology &amp; genetics challenging problems/riddles/questions, many of them similar to the Olympiad style questions, that seriously tempted me (to buy it), but since I had already decided (profession-wise) to focus on teaching (tutoring) Chemistry (rather than Biology, which I used to do many years back), so eventually I gave it a miss. But *you*, would certainly want to get it. It would definitely be useful for your Olympiad preparation!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just checked Amazon.com, this is probably book I saw. It's titled "<span id="btAsinTitle">Molecular Biology of the Cell - The Problems Book</span>". Check out the contents and reviews :</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Problems-Book/dp/0815335776/">http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Problems-Book/dp/0815335776/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking at the contents (you can click into the book and see sample questions), I have to say I'm again tempted. Lots of intriguing, fascinating problem questions. And the book comes with a CD that includes detailed solutions (to half of all the problems, I believe).</p>

              <p>1. Not a reliable or accurate way to measure rate of reaction. HCl is in excess. If it is present in large excess, its molarity will hardly change throughout the reaction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Unlike other metal parts of the car which are painted to prevent rusting (by preventing direct contact between water and the iron), the exhaust pipe is usually unpainted. The second reason is that it is usually warmer than other metallic parts of the car, because it acts as a channel for hot waste gases. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of corrosion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Bubbles of gas generated around the zinc solid. This is because protons from the acid are being reduced to hydrogen gas, while the zinc atoms are oxidized to Zn2+ ions. The other observation, is that the size of the zinc metal becomes smaller over time, as it dissolves into the acid. This is because zinc metal is a solid, but reacts with the acid to form soluble Zn2+ ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. The reaction will involve vigorous efferverscence, and hence some acidic splatter will result. The cotton wool helps to prevent the acid splatter from reaching the U-tube, allowing only carbon dioxide gas generated to pass into the gas syringe.</p>

              <p>1) an experiment is carried out involving magnesium ribbon and excess dilute hcl. vol of h2 is measured to find rate of rxn. Qn: can the change in the concentration of hcl be used to measure the rate of this reaction too? explain why.</p>
              <p>2)give too reasons why the exhaust pipe of a car rusts more rapidly than the other metal parts of the car</p>
              <p>3)zinc reacts wif an excess of dilute h2so4. describe two changes that you would observe during the rxn</p>
              <p>4) a conical flask containing mgco3 and hcl is allowed to react, den the flask is connected to a u tube containing cotton wool b4 the hydrogen gas is allowed to be collected in a gas syringe. explain the purpose of using the cotton wool in the setup.</p>

              <p><br>If HCl is easily decomposed by heat, then it would be decomposed during its formation (since its formation is strongly exothermic), which means it would not even get the chance to exist, which is a logical paradox, since we do know HCl exists, and you can easily find a bottle of its solution in your chem lab.</p>

              <p>olvl tys qn topic frm energy changes:</p>
              <p>1) which of these equations are exothermic and endothermic rxns? (i have absolutely no idea how to tell when im not given any bond energies to calculate and some dun even have state symbols...zzz)</p>
              <p>a)ch4(g) =&gt;c(g) + 4h (g)</p>
              <p>b)cuso4(s) + 5h2o(l) =&gt; cuso4.5h2o(s)</p>
              <p>c)h2 =&gt; 2h</p>
              <p>d)2h + o =&gt; h2o</p>
              <p>e)co2 =&gt; c + 2o</p>
              <p>f)hcl =&gt; h + cl</p>
              <p>g)cl2 =&gt; 2cl</p>
              <p>2) which of these does not give out heat to surroundings?</p>
              <p>a) caco3(s)=&gt; cao(s) + co2(g)</p>
              <p>b)mixing btw sulphuric acid and water</p>
              <p>the answer is a becoz i understand that thermal decomposition is endothermic but why is b) wrong? is b) an exothermic rxn?</p>
