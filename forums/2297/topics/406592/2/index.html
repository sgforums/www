              <p>a) thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide is endothermic. Furthermore, RHS has more energy (gaseous CO2).</p>
              <p>b) mixing concentrated acids and water are always exothermic. The saying "Do as you oughta, mix acid with water", is to help students remember not to drop water into concentrated acids, as the strongly exothermic reaction would cause the concentrated acids to start fuming and splashing dangerously, posing a safety hazard.</p>

              <p>g)cl2 =&gt; 2cl</p>
              <p>2) which of these does not give out heat to surroundings?</p>
              <p>a) caco3(s)=&gt; cao(s) + co2(g)</p>
              <p>b)mixing btw sulphuric acid and water</p>
              <p>the answer is a becoz i understand that thermal decomposition is endothermic but why is b) wrong? is b) an exothermic rxn?</p>

              <p>1A) Any of the amphoteric oxides that you're familiar with, as they react with acids and alkalis to form soluble ions and complex ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1B) P4O10 phosphorus pentoxide aka phosphorus(V) oxide, which undergoes hydrolysis to generate phosphoric acid.</p>

              <p>1C) MgO magnesium oxide, dissolves sparingly in water to generate magnesium hydroxide precipitate (ie. white suspension), which is alkaline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Iron isn't reactive enough to react rapidly with dilute sulfuric acid, unlike for eg. sodium metal. If concentrated sulfuric acid is used, iron reacts rapidly enough. But since dilute sulfuric acid is used, warming is required to speed up the rate of reaction (by increasing the % of reactant particles with energy equals or exceeding activation energy required for the reaction).</p>

              <p><br>Acids are proton (H+) donors. Usually it is the proton (H+) that reacts with metals, carbonates, bases and alkalis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With metals :</p>
              <p>Redox reaction. The proton is reduced the hydrogen gas 2H+ + 2e- --&gt; H2 gas, whilst the metal is oxidized (eg. Mg to Mg2+).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With carbonates :</p>
              <p>Protonation of carbonate to carbonic(IV) acid which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water. 2H+ + CO3 2- --&gt; H2CO3 --&gt; CO2 + H2O</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With bases :</p>
              <p>Protonation of base. Eg. NH3 + H+ --&gt; NH4+.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With alkalis :</p>
              <p>Protonation of hydroxide ion. H+ + OH- --&gt; H2O.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the usual reactions of acid are due to the protons (H+ ions).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, in mixing sulfuric acid and barium chloride, it is the SO4 2- ions, not the protons H+ ions, that combine with the Ba2+ ions to form BaSO4(s) precipitate. It could just as conveniently have been sodium sulfate Na2SO4 instead of sulfuric acid H2SO4. The point is not about the Na+ ions or the H+ ions, the point is the SO4 2- ions which can combine with the Ba2+ ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
