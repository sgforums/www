              <p>Hi Zen,</p>
              <p>Please do not give up so easily, as being in ITE does not mean the end of your future. There are a handful of students who have managed to enter local universities from ITE, though if you really wish to take up a degree in Law, you will have to repeat your "N"-lvl.</p>
              <p>If you can get a Nitec with merit, entering any of the local polytechnics, including Nanyang Polytechnic, would not be a problem. The most important thing for you now is to give up gaming, and focus on your studies from here on. If you choose to continue to play online games, it is unlikely that your results will improve.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I understand your dream to be a lawyer. However, there are a few life hurdles down the line which you have to clear by knowing yourself. Are you more academically-inclined? If you are, then you should opt to retake your 'N' level and proceed down the academic path to JC level where you have to compete with the cohort for a place in law faculty.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, walk the less mentally-strenuous path to ITE and see how everything goes from there. The majority of us would most probably end up in the private sector to earn a living.</p>

              <p>What everyone else on this thread said, has valid points.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being a lawyer isn't as fun as hollywood makes it out to be. Same with being a doctor. (But at least doctors do more good than laywers).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ITE graduates can find employment more readily than Uni grads, although (actually because) their pay is lower. Poly grads are in between in this regard for the same reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you know you can do better if given a second chance to retake the N/O levels path, then by all means give yourself a second chance (and manage your time better with more discipline).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your school lets you retake 'N' levels, go for it. If they do not, you can consider taking private 'N' levels yourself, or even private 'O' levels directly (though you'll definitely need private tuition for 'O' levels).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottomline, don't despair and don't give up. Instead now you should focus on planing your future carefully and wisely. Whichever path you decide.</p>

              <p>ok... Simple case. Ask yourself whether you are lazy, stupid, simply no time, or no interest ....</p>
              <p>- my cousin is lazy, so he really wake up and repeat his sec 4 NA,  for so well later in poly and ok. it is fine.</p>
              <p>- Friend A is really "not very intelligent type" so give up and now he is hawker.</p>
              <p>- Friend B is working part-time so he really have no time to study and is doing fine, even if he does not continue his education</p>
              <p>-Friend C has no interest, so he give up and decide to learn cooking at Sunrice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point is really find the niches that you are good and go for it.</p>

              <p>Seriously , i don't really care to 'poor command of english'. well , it's because i was in a hurry typing while awaiting replys. Thus , think before you throw those language of yours to me. i'm a student that's not ready for any 'hands-on' because if i ever ended up in 'ITE' - it's the end for my dreams. I don't wish to regret one more time if i was given a 'second ribbon' to fulfill my dreams and be a well oriented person to the community later on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise , i've no comments to what you have said. I'm not from a 'express stream' but i'm from the 'N(A) stream. i'm from serangoon secondary school and most of my classmates uses singlish as their communication tool. I want to be a lawyer , it's never too late to realise your dream.</p>

              <p>My take on this: This is purely my opinion.</p>
              <p>Aim at least "O" levels before you enter the school of hard knocks, it gives you flexibility in moving into different academia (higher nitec, diploma private or public, JC, etc) or working industries (insurance line need at least O level pass, etc.) at least at the local level.</p>
              <p>Then again, you might have some other commitments.</p>
              <p>I have seen people who fall early in life and still manage to rise up. Look away from those people who spout negative remarks about your academic failures, this may be hard, but when you think again, only you can define your failures, especially so young, more chance for failures early on = more chances of success./</p>

              <p>Not to break your dream (some people will be against me for doing this) but sometime you will have to face the harsh
                                          reality of truth and I have to say the time is now. You mentioned "it's never too
                                          late to realise your dream" but likewise "it's never too late to realise it is a dream".</p>
              <p>You may ignore what
                                          I've said below since it will definitely be not pleasing to your eyes and you may not accept it
                                          but I think it's something you really should know and decide.</p>
              <p>Firstly - To become a lawyer, you need to be excellent
                                          proficiency in English since you will need to write contracts and
                                          stuffs. I think you should have no problem with this since you
                                          "boasted" about your command of Englishin your last post, right? So I think you gotten an "A", or at least a "B" in English for your N-level, yes?
                                          Personally, I think B is no good but well, if you have gotten at least
                                          a "B" then there should be no problem brushing up it up to "A".</p>
              <p>Secondly - Unless you can get into JC which I doubt you can with
                                          your current standard, there are almost no way you can do law degree in
                                          Singapore University. If you failed your N level, there no way your
                                          basic foundation of your current taken subjects (Math, Science, etc)
                                          can be good.</p>
              <p>N-level to O-level is no walk in the park. Been
                                          there, done that. The gap is pretty big. It is said getting an 'A' in
                                          N-level is equivalent to 'C' in O-level which I think is quite true.</p>
              <p>Granted, there is 1 classmate I know who got himself into one of
                                          the better JCs but that is after his continuous effort in getting top
                                          in the class everytime round and his effort paid off. Can you do that?
                                          Saying yes is easy but doing it is not.</p>
              <p>Thirdly - Don't say I never give you benefit of doubt, even if you do miraculously get into JC, whether is it by luck or seriously study your ass off everyday, you still have another hurdle to breakthrough which your GP paper (Very Important - You will need at least a B to be eligible). Even if you do well in getting an "A" for GP but screwed up all other subjects, you can forget about it.</p>
              <p>Lastly
                                          - Getting into poly will NOT get you to do law degree in Singapore. You
                                          won't stand a chance against the A-level holders. You will more likely stand a chance to do a
                                          degree (provided you get a GPA of 3.4 and above) which is related to
                                          what you are studying in poly.</p>
              <p>Looks grim to you? It should. Currently, there are a few options left, which I can think of, for you:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Find some ways, don't care how you do it (go tuitions whatever), pass your N-level, score well enough for your O-level and get into JC. From there on, you are on your own.</li>
              <li>Find some ways, don't care how you do it, pass your N-level.
                                          However, you did not score well enough to be eligible for JC. Get into
                                          Temasek Poly, apply for <span class="pgHeader">Diploma in Law &amp;
                                          Management. Get a good GPA (3.5 and above) for the diploma and try apply for law degree
                                          in NUS. If fails, no choice, apply for law degree in overseas
                                          university instead. Do note that not all overseas law degrees are
                                          recognise in Singapore, unless you want to remain overseas to become a
                                          lawyer then by all means, go for any of it. </span></li>
              <li>Find some ways, don't care how you do it, pass your N-level. However,
                                          you did not score well enough to be eligible for JC. Get into Temasek
                                          Poly, apply for <span class="pgHeader">Diploma
                                          in Law &amp; Management.
                                          Get an average GPA for the diploma and try apply for law degree in NUS.
                                          If
                                          fails, no choice, try apply for law degree in overseas university
                                          instead but also fail. Be happy you are able to get into law sector and
                                          become a lawyer's sidekick.</span></li>
              <li><span class="pgHeader">Give up and let your dream remain as a dream. Think of a new dream which you like to do next and is within your grasp.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Frankly speaking, you don't earn much being a lawyer in Singapore. However, it will be a different case if you are well-known. If you are think being a lawyer in Singapore earns big buck, forget it but if its your passion, then go on aim for it.</p>
              <p>Right now, you should repeat sec 4 and just focus on getting your foundations up and do well in N &amp; O level. It's not too late to decide what to do after that. ITE is definitely not the route you should go for your dream.</p>

              <p>Hi TS, I'm from (NA) Stream as well.. few years ago.. I'hv gt some friends who failed their N levels , one of them decided to repeat and the rest proceeded to ITE.</p>
              <p>Seriously, i don understand why one's can fail N level. It's 3 times easier den O level..</p>
              <p>The only reason why u fail is because of peer influence. I came from a better Class in NA. The other NA CLASS most of them went to ITE eventually in their O level.</p>
              <p>Please don get influence by your friends/classmates anymore if u choose to pursuit ur dreams. Otherwise, u will get nowhere.</p>
              <p>I always believe in studying in a better environment , such as -competitive classmates, strict teachers, rules &amp; regulations. These factors serves as a catalyst to buck up, work harder.</p>
              <p>I don't know how u will be when u're in sec 5. Are you confident to pass your O's?</p>
              <p>FYI, i play games everyday. Be it N level or O level. Or during that day. Do past year papers/TYS. They really help  alot.</p>
              <p>Goodluck.</p>

              <p>If I were you.. I go with Aerospace and go into Poly with it and I NT going for my N next year, I plan to also go Aerospace if I can if not I would go to Automotive since its something I want.</p>
              <p>But really its your choice, ITE is not the end like a couple years ago. Now some of those earning 4-5k a month or even more went to ITE.</p>
              <p>Because now you have a choice, you can spend another year which is more or less the same as going ITE by repeating your N and re-learning or you can move on using that time and learn new things in ITE.</p>

              <p>I'll just list you what I think are your options.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I am not too impressed with your level of English in the above post and its not because of the spelling.Before you do anything else, you need to know why you have to retake or go to ITE.If you say you will quit gaming and study hard, are you sure you can do it?You would be the only person who can answer the question.You can lie to the whole world but not to yourself.</p>
              <p>Assuming after you evaluate yourself,you want to go back to N levels,you need to buck up on your subjects because passing your subjects is not enough.Why?</p>
              <p>For Poly, you need five O level subjects. 5 x C6 = 30 points.</p>
              <p>All subjects passed,yes,but where can 30 points take you?</p>
              <p>Same story for N level.Just passing is not enough.Are you sure you can go below the mark to make the cut?If you think so,go ahead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say you want to get into Aerospace Avionics...ok....You enroll yourself in ITE....if you still don't study, you think you can get a 3.5GPA?</p>
              <p>ITE may not be difficult,but it may not be a walk in the park either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say you really get your 3.5GPA, you can apply to poly and carry on from there.</p>

              <p>I'll say that i have learned 1/3 of sec 5 (N)A stuff while the N level marking days.. Should i get a private tutor for my 'O' Level? and if i did well with flying colours..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'll drop out from ITE and straight away apply a course with NYP or JC? is it possible Guys?</p>

              <p>'O' Level Subject Fees are here :</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/SEAB/oLevel/2009GCEOSubjInfo.pdf">http://www.seab.gov.sg/SEAB/oLevel/2009GCEOSubjInfo.pdf</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding private tuition, the fees vary widely. It will definitely be expensive for you because you will have to engage multiple tutors for the different subjects you're taking at 'O' levels. And you may need more than just once a week tuition, since a large part of the syllabus will be new for you. Unlike the usual practice for students studying in school, tuition won't just be supplementary, it will be your main source of learning the 'O' level syllabus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be aware that ITE offers 'O' level tuition classes on campus at night, for interested ITE students taking 'O' levels while studying in ITE. It will be a lot cheaper than hiring private tutors, especially multiple tutors.</p>

              <p>Currently i think only NTU offers a aeronautical engineering degree but it only takes in the top students from JCs and polys so its quite a difficult course to get into. It would be easier to go overseas if you really want to study this field at degree level.</p>
              <p>Personally i charge 25/hr for O's levels.</p>
              <p>Private candidate you might need to check with the private schools, not sure whether it varies or is the price fix.</p>

              <p>I dont think night classes for O level is a good idea.U will have ur ITE classes to attend and if U want ur 3.5GPA...U need to know your work and that takes time and effort.Where to find the extra time and effort for another 5 subjects?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As mentioned by UltimaOnline,ITE has night classes for people preparing for O levels...but they are catered mainly as tuition.You can look at them if you want to take O levels straight as a private candidate,but not with your ITE commitments as they would be too heavy for you to do a good job.</p>
