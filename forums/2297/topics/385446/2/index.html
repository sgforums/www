              <p>Currently i think only NTU offers a aeronautical engineering
              degree but it only takes in the top students from JCs and polys so
              its quite a difficult course to get into. It would be easier to go
              overseas if you really want to study this field at degree
              level.</p>
              <p>Personally i charge 25/hr for O's levels.</p>
              <p>Private candidate you might need to check with the private
              schools, not sure whether it varies or is the price fix.</p>

              <p>only O level exam fees are fixed, as in determined by SEAB.</p>
              <p>Private sch charges vary...U have to go check out some of the schs to know the prices now...the variation can be quite big....</p>
              <p>for private schs...U pay peanuts...U get monkey...but no confirm one...U can pay a lot...and U just get a better-dressed monkey.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Anyone aged 16 years and above</li>
              <li>No formal academic qualifications are required to start the course,

              <p>but I think its whether TS likes the subject in the 1st place....can get in doesnt mean can graduate....likewise for his Aerospace Avionics...</p>

              <p>Hello TS,</p>
              <p>I was once in your situation, but O's. I was given no choice but to retake O's or carry on in ITE. What I did was both since I need to be in a school, if not, NS call up. I passed, resigned ITE, applied a dip. course in NYP. After NS, Im still studying, but another dip. course in Lasalle.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I will just take Aerospace Avionics. At least you will learn something new in life. &amp; btw, don't say 'you was forced'. Just accept it.  </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>I just hate how everyone's stereotyping ITE, Seriously, it isn't that bad at all, my goodness. i've gotten a GPA of 4.0 for TWO YEARS STRAIGHT. It's the only place where you can actually prove you're worth something ( given if you put in the effort ) and look where i am now, NUS. In ITE, you'll meet great people ( If you know where to look), awesome lecturers, and loads of memories.And heck there's even a Diploma course in ITE,</p>
              <p>( Example, Diploma In Machine Technology, which is recognised in NUS )</p>
              <p>Link here : http://www.ite.edu.sg/ft/ted_mt.htm</p>
              <p>but if you're not in the precision engineering course, think of it this way, you'll gain more experience ( Hands-On ) then those who went in straight from O levels.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, never judge a book or in this case a school by it's students.</p>

              <p>Very good indeed. From ITE to NUS. But how many are there like you leh ?</p>
              <p>What are the others in ITE who cannot make it ?</p>
              <p>It is good to console TS and gives him a dream or hope.</p>
              <p>BUT it is better to instil in him the importance of self-discipline and good results only come with great effort and hardwork.</p>

              <p>I also just got my result too. And I thought that I was gonna to fail so I actually also thinking of choosing aerospace technology in ITE . But for your case what I think is that you should go to ITE and if you really want to take your certificate, try as a private candidate.</p>
              <p>Actually ITE is not a bad idea after all, if you do well you can even get to a scholarship to polytechnics.</p>

              <p>Wah dun play play with ITE, many from there make it to poly these days. Some classes have as much as half of them getting in. Why? Mainly also because of Republic Poly. It is like an ITE extension.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Got a fren who repeated primary 6 till primary 8, went to N levels, then went ITE, then poly, then NTU and now is an engineer based in the US.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May i suggest that either you retake ur Ns, get to O levels and move on from there, or if not, do the nitec, go on to poly etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
