            <div class='col-md body'><p>most seconday schools haave band as CCA. as i know, symphonic and concert band doesn't have any difference, just the name itself. i am not too sure but in my school, it's called symphonic band,i am not too sure about military band, but mine it requires marching too, which i think also related to military. most importantly, if you have the passion for music, it doesn't really matter which type of band you're in... it also doesn't matter much about how good the school is, unless you are aiming for better express classes.</p></div>

              <p>To really sort out the confusion. Concert Band and Symphonic Band are the same thing as what Bern had said earlier. Symphonic is just another way of putting it nicer.</p>
              <p>The main difference between a Symphonic Band and a Military Band is that Symphonic Bands is more inclined to playing while Military Band is more inclined towards displaying their foot drills and playing with more emphasis on foot drills. That's why Military Bands are also called Display Bands.</p>
              <p>Both types of bands require foot drills. Why does Symphonic Band needs to learn foot drills? It is a requirement for the SYF Competition. You will need to march and play and understand basic commands so that you are qualified to join the SYF. However, the grade you get from SYF will not be dependent on the marching whatsoever. Note that this only applies to Symphonic Bands.</p>
              <p>For military bands, you will need to march and play for the SYF. This time the SYF grade you going to get is dependent on how well you can march and play obviously.</p>
              <p>On your question about taking up bass drum as an instrument. Please note that the bass drum is classified under the percussion section. You will need to join the percussion to play the bass drum. You will also have to play other instruments of the percussion like the timpani, xylophones, snare drum and some other instruments you will probably find out after joining percussion section. Yes, all bands be it military and symphonic have the percussion section and therefore have a bass drum.</p>
              <p>About location of schools nearing where you live, you can check out in the Secondary School Posting Exercise Book or whatever you call it. If you intend to join a symphonic band and check their previous SYF results so that it will suit you, you might wanna check out this website at: www.sgbandfusion.com<br>Note that it is only for symphonic band.</p>
              <p>Hope this will answer your queries.</p>
