              <p>H3 chem is similar to some of the content u will study in uni. There are diff types of H3 chem that the JC offers like i heard CJC offers pharmaceutical chemistry, some JCs will offer organic synthesis and reaction mechanisms etc</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether u can take H3 at yr 1. I had the impression it was only available after promos and you show that u can handle ur H2 chem well.</p>

              <p>Hi ViewtyKU990,</p>
              <p>For H3 Chemistry from NUS, you will be studying the same material as NUS 1st year undergraduates, whereas for H3 Chemistry from NTU, you will be studying slightly toned down materials for NTU 1st year undergraduates. There do is a H3 UCLES which is not linked to any of the university too btw.</p>
              <p>H2 Chemistry is only at JC - level, and you cannot take H3 Chemistry in your first year.  </p>
              <p>And yes, you are free to drop H3 Chemistry if you cannot cope with it.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Its not really the entire yr 1 content etc. As far as i know, the NTU 1 focus on organic chemistry. Not sure about the NUS 1 but its far from the entire yr 1 content, more like just 1-2 module content worth of stuff.</p>

              <p>Hi dkcx,</p>
              <p>Each H3 subject is indeed technically only a single module, regardless of where it is taken from. I am sorry for not stating it properly. </p>
              <p>I apologise to the TS too, for there are H3 research programmes that can be taken in the first year which happens to slip my mind. They are very different from the content-learning H3 subjects in the 2nd year though. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Don't really get what u mean but u need to do well in yr promos for H2 chem to be considered for H3 chem.</p>
              <p>The contents for H3 chem is quite different from H2 chem and not really related.</p>
              <p>Actually some people i know who does H3 feels that its not really that useful since its not considered for uni admission etc unless you really intend to study that course in university and hopes to get an exemption from the module.</p>

              <p>Hi ViewtyKU990,</p>
              <p>No, it is entirely different. The H3 subjects for the first year are technically-speaking project works, whereas the H3 subjects for the second year are more content-based.</p>
              <p>I believe this will help you to understand more.</p>

              <p>Yes, be that as it may, (this isn't direct at you dkcx, since you already know this; the following wisdom is for the benefit of students) just because a particular undergrad course in a particular institution in a particular country uses a particular book, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the best book on the subject, or even necessarily the most suitable one at that level (eg. Year 1); and students may like to check out a wider variety of resources available.</p>

              <p>What i was trying to say was that it might be the textbook that they will be using since some lecturers gives questions etc from the textbook they are using and not other textbooks so getting the textbook they use is essential.</p>

              <p>I know what you were trying to say, you're just being helpful to that student's query and direct to the point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm making a separate point. Throughout my life (both academic and otherwise), I always enjoy exploring alternative sources instead of merely following the common (eg. course instructor's materials, societal dogma, etc). It's just my personal style to enjoy self-directed learning, exploration and development.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to OC courses, particularly for H3 (whether NTU, NUS or taught-within-JC) courses, I highly doubt it's 'essential' to buy any textbook at all, whether McMurry or others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If any textbook were indeed essential for the NTU H3 course, the student would likely have the required title and author direct from the NTU lecturer, instead of asking on a general online forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Courses usually have course notes given (though the student will usually have to print it themselves or pay for it), and even if the course instructor 'recommends' a certain textbook, it is seldom 'essential'. And countless undergrads waste countless $$$ buying textbooks that hey were under the impression that it 'recommended' = 'compulsory'. But of course, how 'essential' any textbook is for any course, is entirely up to the instructor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you personally enjoy using a particular textbook that makes learning fun and productive for you, that even the course instructor didn't recommend, then it's $$$ well spent; definitely more worth it than wasting $$$ on textbooks recommended by the course instructor but you don't like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And finally, OC (moreso at H3 level than H2 level) really requires more understanding than memorizing. So all the more important it is for the student to obtain a textbook he/she personally finds enjoyable.</p>

              <p>I find Mcmurry quite easy to understand so it was good enough for me in yr 1.</p>
              <p>However, i won't deny that certain module's textbook is quite useless and some like physical chemistry textbooks are useful but SUPER boring...</p>
