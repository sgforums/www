              <p>Because if you had used an Fe electrode against the SHE, then the Fe electrode itself would be oxidized to Fe2+, and hence the voltmeter reading would be for the oxidation potential of Fe to Fe2+, not Fe2+ to Fe3+.</p>
              <p>Platinum is inert, which means it would not be oxidized, and instead Fe3+ would be reduced to Fe2+ (assuming you started out with equal molarities of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the electrolyte solution of the half-cell connected to the SHE), and this reduction potential can be obtained from the voltmeter reading.</p>

              <p>okay okay.....why did'nt i consider that!!</p>
              <p>Another query is regarding salt bridge.</p>
              <p>When we connect two half-cells via salt bridge let say Cu/Cu2+ and Zn/Zn2+ cells then electrons flows from Zn half cell to external circuit to Cu half cell. Therefore Zn2+ and 2e both transfer to Cu half cell where Cu2+ is reduced so the [Cu2+] deceases which is balanced by the Zn2+ cations. On the other hand both electrons and [Zn2+] decareases in the zn half-cell, at this moment salt bridge which contains aqueous soltuion of KCl releases K+ [I think 2 K+/ loss of 1 Zn2+]....This restores the cations in Zn half-cell.</p>
              <p>Finally at the end of the process when wires are disconnected we have two solutions left. In the Zn half-cell we have aqueous solution of K2SO4 since ZnSO4 was usedas electrolyte. In the Cu half-cell e have aqueous solution of ZnSO4 left.</p>
              <p>Is there any detail i am missing....</p>
              <p>is there any balancing of electrons needed since elctrons are being removed from Z half cell to cu half-cell??....please mention.</p>

              <p><br>Technically, hydrolysis refers to the chemical reaction with water (don't worry about the "lysis" part, as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span></strong> water or the other reactant will inevitably be broken up or "lysed" when the reaction occurs).</p>
              <p>However, because water is a weaker nucleophile, therefore to save time and money, we use a stronger nucleophile OH- in nucleophilic substitution reactions involving water, as the richer the electron-rich species, the stronger its nucleophilic strength, the lower the Ea required, the faster the rate of reaction.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the final intended product is the same. For instance :</p>
              <p>R-X reacts with water to generate R-OH2+, which loses a proton to X-, hence generating R-OH and H-X as the final products. Higher Ea, slower reaction.</p>
              <p>R-X reacts with Na+OH- to generate R-OH, with Na+ and X- as counter ions, generating R-OH and Na+X- as the final products. Lower Ea, faster reaction.</p>
              <p>On a related note, notice that physical &amp; inorganic chemists are lazier compared to organic chemists in some ways (eg. physical/inorganic chemists' quick dative bond arrowhead versus organic chemists' full curved-arrow mechanism), but are stricter in other ways (eg. physical/inorganic chemists say "<em>hydration refers to physical interaction with water, while hydrolysis refers to chemical reaction with water</em>"; but organic chemists say, "<em>since dehydration means removing water from alcohol to alkene, then let's just call adding water to alkene as hydration; no need to specify hydrolysis rather than hydration</em>"). </p>

              <p>Based on the position of Se in the periodic table, you'd expect SeO2 to be covalent rather than ionic. For covalent, there is simple molecular, versus giant covalent. Since SeO2 is a solid at rtp with a high melting point (such info would be inlcluded in a fair exam question), you can deduce it's giant covalent, to be precise, giant covalent polymeric (ie. from the auto-polymerization of individual SeO2 simple molecular monomers).</p>

              <p><br>For electronegativity values, you can look it up on the internet (though there are a few different systems giving different values).</p>
              <p>For A level purposes, you don't need to know the electronegativity values, you only need to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">memorize</span></strong> that as long as the cationic charge density is very high (eg. Be2+, Al3+, etc), the metal fluoride is ionic (since F is extremely electronegative, all metal fluorides are considered fully ionic), but all other metal halides (eg. Cl, Br, I) are considered covalent (on condition that the metal cation has high charge density).</p>
              <p>If the cationic charge density is fairly high, but not too high (eg. Ag+), then you've to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">memorize</span></strong> to write that it has "significant covalent character", but is still primarily ionic in character.</p>

              <p><br>Guys only like Girls, Guys don't like Guys.</p>
              <p>Electrons (negatively charged species) are guys. Due to inter-Guy (ie. inter-electron) repulsions, electron pairs want to spread out as far away from each other as possible.</p>
              <p>NH3 - For N to have a stable octet but no formal charge, N must have 1 lone pair and 3 bond pairs. Hence electron geometry = tetrahedral (since that's the best shape that has 4 electron charge clouds away from each other as far as possible, but still bonded to the central atom). Since one of the four electron charge clouds is a lone pair, ie. treat it as invisible, hence molecular geometry = trigonal planar.</p>
              <p>Do a tripod stand with 3 fingers of your left hand, and use one finger of your right hand do the 4th and top electron charge cloud, since lone pairs are invisible, make your right hand invisible by removing it (although bear in mind the lone pair still remains there, otherwise the electron geometry would change into trigonal planar instead of tetrahedral), and what you have left, is called the molecular geometry, which is trigonal pyramidal.</p>
              <p>In future, I recommend you start a new thread on the forum, with a suitable title eg. "[H2 Chem] - Qn on Chem Bonding", instead of posting in an old thread such as this one.</p>
              <p>Also, if you can afford it, go for tuition sooner rather than later. Most JC1 students make the mistake of thinking, "I'll try to handle it myself first, only if I fail the mid year exams, then I'll look for tuition", which by then, it's a bit too late for the Promos, bearing in mind you have other subjects to catch up on as well.</p>
              <p>Also, there are many intricacies and aspects to H2 Chem that I have to teach in person, which cannot be effectively done via an online forum. Regardless, feel free to continue posting your H2 Chem qns here. I'll reply whatever I can. </p>

              <p>We can't totally do away with using a bit of memory.</p>
              <p>But it helps if you can group them into five basic shapes ( Linear, Trigonal planar, Tetrahedral, Trigonal Bipyramidal , Octahedral).</p>
              <p>For example, if a molecule has 3 bond pairs and 1 lone pair</p>
              <p>1) its "basic shape" (sometimes refered to as electron group geometry) is 3+1 = 4, tetrahedral.</p>
              <p>2) You visualise it as a tetrahedral shape with 4 branches, then "erase" 1 of the branches to account for it being a lone pair.</p>
              <p>3) You have 3 branches left with that looks like a pryramid with a triangle base -     trigonal pryrimidal. </p>
              <p> Be careful of the branches to "erase" if you start off with trigonal bi-pyramidal.</p>
              <p>And yes, it might be better if you create your own thread of questions next time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
