              <p>Ok, so I bought my laptop during the school roadshow a few weeks ago in my poly and they gave me this few steps to follow which will help me to change my home page to the school website instantly when I go on internet. I did follow and it can.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">i have to admit I sucks in computer since I only used them for gaming purpose.

              <p>Which poly are you from? Usually the information is on your school's website and it will also mention whom to contact if you have queries. You just need to download the software needed for your course and configure the network settings to access your school's wireless network. You bought your laptop at the roadshow so they might have already pre-installed the software for you</p>

              <p>The extra configurations may be to let your laptop auto connect to the school's wireless system, adding a shortcut which can access certain locations on the school's server, configuration to connect to the school's wireless printer, installing softwares which the teacher can monitor your screen during a test which u can access the internet.</p>
              <p>All these programs will slow down your computer's performance. Remember to back up important school work data.</p>
              <p>I used to work in my school's IT support department, my job is to help others configure all these and "reformat" their system drive if their is too much problem. Quit working after a few months, pay too low <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Oh, so now I just mainly need to connect to the school wireless network and that's all left? I bought the Lenovo laptop. It supports window 8.1 btw. Is it possible to configure it myself? But I need to bring it to school as well right? But if i configure it myself then I think The teacher can't monitor my screen right? Is it a must that I should bring it to the school IT help desk to ask them to help me configure it?</p>
              <p>Im from tp btw! Thank you for all your replys! It did helps me to clear some doubt. Haha.</p>

              <p>As for the other stuff, your school's IT support dept might have to setup for you. Not all lecturers use the monitoring software, might be for certain polys only</p>
