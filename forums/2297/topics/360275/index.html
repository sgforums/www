              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  My simplistic view is to focus on good quality teaching that emphasises on understanding, clarity, simplicity and meaning of concepts and skills in the subject area.</p>
              <p>  Let's hear from you out there. Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  There are many reasons why students do not stay in focus. Two common reasons I have observed from students' feedback are lethargy and a lack of interest. The hours spent in school are way too long and lessons as well as activities take place continually throughout the day. The poor student has to juggle with his/her many roles, responsibilities, demands and expectations coming from all directions. A lack of interest may be attributed to a less-than-desirable delivery of content that made no meaning and sense to the struggling student.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>These two are almost always the reasons for our headache, but the former is something beyond our control, whereas the latter is the main problem which I will like to discuss about.</p>
              <p>I have seen many students who are not slow-learners, but due to their lack of passion for studying, they tend to do badly, as they were not paying attention when their tutors were teaching them. These are the one who really will give you a big headache. A tutor friend of mine has problems with such a student, and the two of us have discussed and tried out some methods, but to no avail.</p>
              <p>I have seen for myself quite a number of outstanding teachers and tutors, but usually they are either able to 'make fun' of their work and amuse/amaze the student, or they have that kind of 'aura' which make the students quietly and obediently listen to them. Unfortunately, one seems to need plentiful of experience before he could achieve either of these two.</p>
              <p>Indeed, lack of interest might be attributed to lousy teaching methods or an unwillingness to change the methods of teaching, but more than often I will like to blame that rotten PSP by the desk or the XBOX under the television. To me, they are often ( but not always ) the main reasons why my younger students keep losing focus. The older ones will tell me how they got into problems with their halfs, and often made me wonder if they are here to study or to talk about love.</p>
              <p>My friends will be more than happy to accept SG$50 per hour to listen to the students spill out their woes, but I prefer making better use of my time than to listen to all the complaints they have.</p>

              <p>We should cater differently to each and every students, because every student is different and might require different way of approach. I believe the learning needs of the students requires the education providers (teachers, tutors) to adapt to a more flexible and creative way of teaching. </p>
              <p>Resources that are available are also very important. Not only notes, guiding and facilitating, but I believe help that are readily available is crucial in learning.</p>
              <p>Our students needs to learn how to think critically, and this is very often, this is not the skill that main-stream secondary school would impart to its students.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  This seems to hold true for JCs too.</p>
              <p>  The drill-and-practice method is still very prevalent in our educational landscape.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Wee,</p>
              <p>I'm supportive of drill and practice with some modifications. The last part of the puzzle is understanding and flexibility.</p>
              <p>One has to understand how to use the concepts and equations fully, and be flexible in applying equations and concepts to questions. Drilling and practice should be done to focus the students in this manner. We will need to guide students along this path.</p>
              <p>Doing questions is like practicing martial arts. You drill and practice the moves, but when it comes to practical applications, one has to be flexible and adaptive to situations :D</p>
              <p>Sadly, most students drill and practice blindly. For the extremely hardworking, given simliar questions, they will still be able to do, but give it a small twist and they are stuck.</p>

              <p>Hi eagle,</p>
              <p>  I agree with you. Practice should be carried out with good understanding and deep appreciation of the applications of concepts.</p>
