              <p>I will be going to poly in this April. ok, I have flunged my o level and admitted to one of the poly that offers business course .  In the end, I decided to go to one of the poly business course.

              <p>I know that Singapore is a country that emphasize a lot on qualification. To me, getting a degree is basically nonething cos there are some uni courses that entry pt is only BCC/ C etc. My personal aim is to excel in Uni business . ( I dont want to go for other courses in uni except business.) May I know what is the percentage of NP/ SP  business students entering local uni. Actually, I wanted to enter SMU business/ SMU accountancy....Right now, I havent enter poly yet but i have heard of ppl spending 5-6 hrs on average per day to study poly business subj so as to qualify for SMU...so may I know how much time will i need to set aside to study for my poly business courses everyday to score a GPA of at least 3.85? ( Actually, I aimed to score 3.9)....Pls shed light on me....thanks</p>

                  Actually, prior to that, I wanted to go to some top JCs(e.g

                  to mid-tier JC ( AJC, NYJC, CJC) . In the end, I decided to go to
                  one of the poly business course. ( since I have strong interest in
                  doing business in future). I am someone who always tot abt beating
                  others and being the top. Personally, I hoped to defeat most ppl in
                  Local Uni Business Course/ Business ( Accountancy). So since sec 3,
                  I wanted to score well in o level and go to one of the top JCS and
                  excel there/ go to poly business course to pick up new business

                  Math exam , and also my sec school is a band 3/ 4 school). May I

              <p>1. Have some humility.</p>
              <p>2. If your goal and dream is to beat everybody at their game, you won't get far. And I personally dislike such people because of their motivation for learning.</p>
              <p>3. You won't be just competing with just locals at local unis. Wait till you meet the FTs who will trounce you at your game. If all you can think of, is step on them and climb, be ready for a bitter and unhappy fight. Refer back to point 1 and 2.</p>
              <p>4. I think SGreans who always complain about having their jobs taken away have no idea how competitive the world market is. You want to be plugged into the world market, don't expect mercy. For the record, having worked with FTs before, I would say a lot of them deserve to take the locals' jobs. Read: SGreans are too sheltered. </p>
              <p>You need pain to build character, not the good things in life.</p>
              <p>5. Make some FT friends and you'll understand better and learn more in tandem, that way gives you a far better chance at matching their abilities.</p>
              <p>6. If you think I am talking cock, as I am sure some forummers here will say, then all I can say is that, I said my piece already.</p>
              <p>7. A first class honours is not called thus for nothing. And then you said, a degree to you is useless. What talking you?</p>

              <p>I simply dont want to argue with u, my pt is nowadays at least 30-40% of young ppl have degree, what is more impt is to get into the course i like and excel in it....thus, i wanted to attain first class honour in my degree for Business and so i choose the poly route..that's all</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tink u shuld study whole day every day whenever u have time. Admission to business sch is highly competitive. To tell u the truth, SMU business sch require you to attend an interview. Btw, If you are in sp, u want to make sure you select maths for business if you don't have A maths as this module prepare those people with some calculus skill. I heard from my polytechnic lecturer, to be successfully admited to business sch, u need at gpa of 3.9 to guarantee admission. Don't forget other student from any discipline hope to be admitted to business sch too. Business is a general degree, any disciplines are allowed to be admitted.</div>
