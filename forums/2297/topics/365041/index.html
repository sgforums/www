              <p>I know seow means crazy. To call people crazy just because they made some mistakes is being very offensive and disrespectful.</p>
              <p>You have no idea how by calling children "fail" or "failure" will affect them, because you have never taught them yourself before. I teach mainly Pri School level children and I know well enough how these so called "simple words" can negatively affect them and their performance.</p>
              <p>The highlighted sentence above shows your arrogrance. The truth is anyone who teaches is an educator, am I wrong to say that?</p>
              <p>If I have a motive, I will be focusing my time here only instead of posting around the entire sgforums.</p>
              <p>The reason why I wanted to be a mod here instead of anywhere else is because I thought that I will be able to contribute more here than anywhere else. As a mod, I will be able to help clear up flame-bait posts like yours and lock up irrelevant threads posted here.</p>
              <p>I know you probably think that I wanted to be a mod because of the power to ban others or whatsoever, but the only two people who could actually ban others and move threads across forums are Jason and Fi fi.</p>
              <p>dkcx is obviously not a clone of mine if you have been reading up every single one of my post. In fact, we even have debates and arguments now and then in the past over educational matters and my own lifestyle.</p>
              <p>You ask for me to be humble and apologize, but what about yourself?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I just made a simple comment that Mikethm's answer is incorrect
                                          and my choice of words have not been appropriate.</strong></span> You posted this, yet I don't remember you even apologizing once to Mikethm for your unruly behaviour, hence it shows your arrogance once again. What you mean was that your words are inappropriate, but you are not wrong. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I apologize once again to the mods for causing so much unneeded trouble here, and I hope you will forgive me for arguing with this troll and stirring up this whirlpool of argument.</p>
              <p>I believe that this troll will not let matters rest so easily, and if there is a need, I will humbly ask Fi fi directly to kindly interevene and help out.</p>

              <p>whether i’m a clone or not is clear to people i know in the forums and i don’t care what u think. Why we speak similarly is because we don’t like your attitude and i’m not as polite as eagle to say the things nicely</p>

              <p>Yes, time will tell whether you are a clone of Forbiddensinner.</p>
              <p>Whether you as a forbiddensinner or as a clone, dkcx, you are still contributing to the homework forum and indeed you have helped answered many questions in the homework forum albeit some mistakes in your answers.</p>

              <p>Let me tell you this - If you are to continue with your flamebaits, you will be permanently barred from this forum soon enough.</p>
              <p>Your arrogance is really unbelievable and unbearable, sooner or later you will find yourself in a situation where you will have to swallow up your own pride. Mark my words, if you do not change your attitude, you will end up dealing with a lot of unneeded problems.</p>
