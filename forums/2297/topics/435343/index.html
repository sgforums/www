              Hi Users,
              
              As reiterated earlier on my previous post, it's evident that i'm not in favour of 'projects'. i am presently a sophomore ITE student in the final year before graduation upon receiving my final assessment. Hitherto, i felt that i'm either compelled to study the field in engineering or could it have been just peer pressure to the cause which leads to the drive eventually. Well, i've realised all too soon that i'm more apt to the JC Curriculum which deals with theory at large spectacle. I've tried to consider all faction when it comes to 'bogus pride' I'm not going to impress the society that i took a leap of faith to recoup over regrets based on the biased past. I've stopped watching TVs for almost 5 months now, and every now and then, i'm reading as i write in here. i'm not going to parade around and announce to the whole world about life philosophies and get them under to follow suit. It's all about me and the fate of my two parents who brought me up with their best of their capabilities. 
              
              Well, i've to be blatantly honest with you, I'm a male in my 18s of a middle class financial mean and before even getting to settle down just as how my parents did,  i'm feeling the crunch before the pinch. I'm no longer politically apathetic, i realised that the ruling party is in favour of foreign talents to override the true blue locals, if possible, through all sectors in the job market. Little did i know that their are trying to burn a hole in our pocket simply through the bullnoze of policies that true blue locals here are laying a siege on it and will eventually retaliate anytime soon just as how the 'arab spring' have occured throughout the entire middle east. 
              
              Well, let's not get offtopic, i'm always inclined to doing so when i'm a freelance writer in my own dimension. The idea is, i don't wish to do something which i don't like to do - simply put. as mentioned, i've done my estimate on the damages which i'm about to make, should i take this course. I don't wish to waste anymore of my prime years going through the polytechnic curriculum painstakingly to get a certificate which will entitle me to universities with a course which i'll continue to moan over.  
              
              I wanted to study law and eventually be called by the singapore bar to serve the nation as a working adult together with other professionals. My interest has invariably been about debates and politics is just my cup of tea - don't ask me to consider FAS (Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences) I've been playing around with this dream of mine ever since from day 1 upon matrivulation to ITE. As time goes by, i encountered language gap and opposed by many from a 'clique' of ITE Students rather as they failed to comprehend my speeches. I was the President of the student council and i ruled out an exceptional approach to policies (i turned the union into 'congress')  - well, that's just some my experiences while in ITE - it has been a fruitful one indeed. 
              
              Well, I'm thinking of sitting for at least '5 A Level Subjects' as a private candidate following the requirement before one can be accepted into NUS Faculty of Law, as for CCA, i've got some to garner their attention - would it be worthworthy? (I need views). I've been averting watching TV and have shunned my doors to social gatherings which is often seen the like of a chore to me (my opinion). I've been to Victoria junior college website and i remained confused between 'International Applicants' and 'Returning Singaporeans' - may i know what is it all about? They are offering A level course and i was contemplating to applying but there are lots of forms and hoards of its stringent procedures before one know the turnout of eligibility. I'm uncertain if i'm eligible? - do they accept ITE Students too? it states that students both parties in this matter - it simply beguiled me out. I've yet to ascertain to whose party is the multimodal text refering to? 
              
              The Subjects are as follows: 
              
              1. ENGLISH &amp; LINGUSITIC H2 
              2. GENERAL PAPER
              3. ECONOMICS 
              4. GEOGRAPHY 
              5. HISTORY 
              
              Does this 5 subjects stand a chance for me to produce a certificate entitled as 'GCE 'A' Level' leading up my eligibility to enrol into the course of my choice while awaiting matriculation from NUS? 
              
              I'm prepared to be a No lifer to self-actualize according to the maslow's theory - No doubt that generation today wants to self-actualize. the 21st century belongs to both gender irregardless of any other traits that is not dispensable and irrelevant. I've believed in emancipation for a short while and gain faith after going through the trials and tribulation of having to muscle in some effort before it gets to be paid off. 
              
              Please users!!, i need opinons from all crossroads at this juncture!!! Thank you very much for reading some of the idiosyncrasies above. appreciate your effort at all lengths. 
              
              I allow non-partisan viewership as well, feel free to answer at your accord. Thank you.

              <p>First of all, you need 3H2 (Arts)+ 1H1 (Science) + GP.</p>
              <p>Secondly, those JC candidates have this 'subject' called 'project work' for A level, and the grade of PW contributes a few points to the aggregate. If you do not have it because you are in ITE, then the maximum points you can achieve (assuming all As) will be lesser than those JC students.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, faculty of law is the 2nd/3rd most difficult faculty to go in NUS, and it may sometimes require a total points which is higher than the maximum points you can achieve without PW, therefore, it is very risky. But of course, if you score all As without PW, you can surely go to NUS/NTU/SMU and do other courses.</p>
              <p>However, all As are not that easy to acheive.</p>

              <p>I will suggest you find a recognised overseas uni, study there, and then come back to take the bar exam.</p>
              <p>The reason is that you being a formal ITE student will always put you at a disadvantage when NUS looks at the credentials of all the candidates who applied.</p>
              <p>Straight As is unlikely to be enough in your case. You will require teachers and tutors to sign for you, as well as evidence of huge community contirbutions (frequent helping out at centers for the disabled for example) or national contributions (winning international awards). On top of that, you will need to be able to convince your interviewers you are qualified to be a lawyer, though you have been to ITE.</p>
              <p>There is this really big stigma on ITE students, and thus you will hear of only a hand-full (literally) who enter NTU and NUS each year after taking a really long route, and usually in faculties which are not as competititve.</p>

              <p>The question you have to ask yourself is, do you want to be a lawyer or do you want to study law in NUS? if it is the former, then perhaps you might want to consider alternative routes to becoming a lawyer (still called to the Singapore Bar) as opposed to trying to "play catch up"..</p>
              <p>if your goal is self-actualization, then perhaps the notion that you're trying to bring across is that you want to give back to society.. there are many ways that you can do that.. being a lawyer is just one way..</p>

              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>I agreed with <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff7129;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/252943">Forbiddensinner</a>, stop looking at Singapore. In Singapore, Law and Medicine does not based purely on good results, but with interview, and who knows what are the factors involved.  </span></p>
              <p>Imagine, in the interview, if your dad is a lawyer, and you have met those interviewers before thru' family social gathering, and I don't, who stands better chance?  You already knew those interviewers, and have chatted with them about all kinds of topic, but I have only the experience of a neighbourhood school.  Do I stand a chance?</p>
              <p>I had a friend, who don't do well in her A, she did a 3 yrs degree in UK, came back for bar-exam, bingo, she is now practicing lawyer!. </p>
              <p>So, there are other routes you can explore.  Do your best in whatever you are doing now, if you are male, finished your NS.  After NS, if possible, do your degree somewhere.  Not all overseas degree are expensive.  You can PM me for more infor. </p>
              <p>All the best to you. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi there, why are you so certain that law is for you? Do you just like the glamore of being a law graduate or you really do have the interest for law?</p>
              <p>Many students are deceived by the glamore image of lawyers being portrayed on television shows. </p>
              <p>If you really do have the interest, then please read on...</p>
              <p>Studying law in Singapore is very challenging and difficult as there are only 2 universities which offers LL.B programmes, namely NUS and SMU.</p>
              <p>Only top students with straight As for GCE A Level and excellent CCA achievements are given a seat in NUS/SMU Law. When I say that, I've not taken into consideration the aptitude test and interview stage.</p>
              <p>If you are taking A Levels just for the sake of going into Law, you're taking a very massive risk. Even students with straight As may not get shortlisted to the interview.</p>
              <p>There are top students from HwaChong, RJC, TJC, VJC etc.</p>
              <p>This may sound harsh, but it's the hard truth like mentioned above, why would NUS/SMU law want to choose a ITE graduate when they have plenty of applicants with excellent results to choose from?  </p>
              <p>When saying this, I'm not talking about other uni courses, just law. </p>
              <p>Law is a very specialized discipline that's why its a profession. </p>
              <p>I'll strongly suggest you to abolish the idea of going into law in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You may consider other fields which you like and get into a local uni, whether JC or Poly.</p>
              <p>If you really want to study law, you may choose overseas options, though it may cost a lot.</p>
              <p>Yes, Singapore education system favours students with excellent results. That's why majority of average diploma and A Level holders often further their education in private institutions or overseas universities.</p>
              <p>Have a serious thought on this.</p>
