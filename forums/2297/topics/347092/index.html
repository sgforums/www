              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hi, I would like to collect ideas from everyone, especially students who are still in secondary school, so as to write an award winning blog entry on how secondary school system should improve.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There are a few things that you could share:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> enjoy your secondary school life?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you think the subjects you study have any benefits for your future career? (other than the core subjects like English, Maths, and Science)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Are there only 3 paths after O-Levels? (JC, Poly, ITE)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you didn’t do too well for your O-Levels, are you doomed to retake O-Levels and suffer the plight of secondary school or go to ITE?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you belief that if you didn’t do too well for your O-Levels, and can’t get into a JC or Poly of your choice, MDIS and Kaplan will be a better option, still allowing you to get a diploma in 1 year time, as compared to Poly which is 3 years, thus you will still be able to get a good job?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Would you rather retake O-Levels, go to ITE, or choose MDIS and Kaplan if you didn’t do too well for your O-Levels?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you think the discipline teachers in your school are being fair to you and your schoolmates? (For instance, the infamous Coral Secondary School)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The official school hours is for example, 7.30am to 2pm. Do you think the teachers are being fair by keeping you back to clean up the classroom or for detention or any other purposes after school daily, resulting in you going home at 5pm instead of the official 2pm.</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that school rules are a little too strict and I would say, lame?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that strict school rules don’t benefit students, but rather, more for the sake of the school’s reputation in public eyes?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that if a school sends teachers to patrol the vicinity so as to catch pupils red handed for loitering or shopping, that the particular school would be tagged as “crazy” or “nothing-to-do”?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree Saturday and Sunday are rest days to recharge and relax, rather than going back to school <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unwilling</span></strong>, thus not being able learn anything?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that the discipline teachers in schools are treating students more like animals rather than humans?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that unreasonable discipline teachers should be sacked?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that Ministry of Education is doing a good job, however, certain school’s try to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">climb over the ministry’s head</span></strong> by implementing their own “fantastic” rules? (For instance, the infamous Coral Secondary School)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that your success depends mostly on you and your hard work rather than the aggressive discipline teachers?</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do your parents support you or your teacher? (Good thing if it’s you.)</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Do you agree that secondary schools <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">MUST IMPROVE</span></span></strong> so as to free the slavery of students suffering under unreasonable discipline teachers and principals who deserve to be sacked?</span></li>
              </ul>

              <p>most importantly, they need to improve the lives of sec sch teachers before the students</p>
              <p>Teachers are usually overworked, stressed up, and given many more things to do other than teaching. There are teachers who have to mark papers or prepare lessons throughout the night.</p>
              <p>Once told to me by a sec sch teacher. When this teacher was busy with lots of sch activities, till late at night (~7 pm), and was finding it hard to keep up with the assignments, the HOD simply told this teacher that: "You still have the night to catch up with it"</p>
              <p>Think about this. Sch teachers face stress not only from students, but also from HODs and Principals. If sch teachers are not even well treated, how can we expect the optimum from them every single sch day to give our students the best?</p>

              <p>put yourself in their shoes: 4 to 6  hrs of sleep a day, start work before dawn at 7, finish work when night is nearly dark at 6 to 7 pm, go home still need to mark papers, etc, means OT with no extra pay and no one to see, till midnight...</p>
              <p>Sat need to go back to work cuz of sch CCAs</p>
              <p>cannot suka suka take leave, can only take during sch holidays when they are not needed in school at all, childcare leave included.</p>
              <p>And supposedly sch holidays hv to go back for meetings, sch CCAs, so in the end also hard to clear leave</p>
              <p>And extremely bad office politics... I have even heard of a special unit set up in IMH for teaching professionals... not sure how much truth is there in it though....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And... their counterparts who are not in teaching, working 8 to 5 jobs (lesser hours), can take leave anytime of the year</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fact is... there's a high turnover rate for teachers... Teaching is really not for any Tom Dick Harry... Quite a number of students who took out teaching scholarships for overseas uni are stuck with it for years... and when they finally finish their bonds, it's almost impossible for them to find any other job..... So they are stuck with teaching even longer...</p>
              <p>Teaching is really only for those who have the passion to change all students lives, so much so that they can endure all those stated above... Not many teachers are like that...</p>

              <p>  Only when I left the teaching service that I was able to teach mindfully and whole-heartedly, without distractions. Nevetheless, I admire teachers who are still contributing in the teaching service while coping with many demands.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  I'd like to contribute some brief views on the questions:</p>
              <p>  1. Curriculum hours were shorter in the past, so I was able to pursue personal interests and develop deeper friendships with classmates.</p>
              <p>  2. JC, poly and ITE are system-imposed options. Our mind can conceive infinite possibilities, provided that it is open.</p>
              <p>  3. School rules ought to serve meaningful purposes, but the word 'meaningful' may vary significantly from person to person.</p>
              <p>  4. Schools ought to consider the welfare of students (e.g. the need for them to rest, to catch up with work, etc.) when planning for activities that may fall on Saturdays. If a lesson is planned with the intention to finish the syllabus early, then I feel that it is not well-justified.</p>
              <p>  5. Personal discipline is necessary for one to succeed.</p>
              <p>  6. There is always room for schools to improve in areas like school direction and leadership, teachers' and students' welfare, conducive teaching/learning environment, etc.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Sec school life is quite alright for me. Studying, doing homework, making friends.</p>
              <p>Humanties doesn't really play an important in what I'm studying. (I'm in science course).</p>
              <p>Other than the 3 paths, there are also other paths like Private institution which offers diplomas and degree programs for O level students.  yea. deagree program for O level students, there are!</p>
              <p>If didn't do well O levels, students can retake O level as private students or in the same sec sch or go to ITE. But it's not the end. Morale is important when comes to this situation, and I advice students to seek all available possible (be it from friends, family, relatives, Homework forums) channels to get opinions. Afterall, we went through this stage and might have our 2cents-worth to offer.</p>
              <p>Depends on the student's interest. MDIS or Kaplan are good choices for alternatives to retaking O levels. There diplomas still hold value in market. Most important, it's whether are you able to apply the knowledge you've learnt and self motivation play a huge part too. There are many jobs around; One man's meat is another man's poision. Job A might be good for A but not for B.</p>
              <p>If I were given a chance again, I would chose to go MDIS if I failed my O levels. It's a time-saving route, but burns hole in the pocket.</p>
              <p>Discipline-wise. The DP is quite fair and inpartial. What made the system ugly are the students councillors who 'cover up' each other's mistake who they themselves broke the rules.</p>
              <p>I feel that Cleaning the classroom should be part of the official time. Keeping students after doesn't seems to help especially on detention. Most student waste their time waiting for release.</p>
              <p>Depends on specific rules. But most the rules are to enforce uniformity and reflects on the school's culture, motto, vision, characteristic.</p>

              <p>  4. Schools ought to consider the welfare of students

              planning for activities that may fall on Saturdays. If a lesson is

              <p>I disagree. As it stand now, being on time would be finishing the syllabus a few week before the prelims in Aug/Sept and the O levels are in October. There is merely 1 month for students to cram 2(4yrs) of 7/8 subjects. Cramming is not an effective study technique. Spacing out your revision is far better. In addition, after initial learning, there need to be a time period of "digestion". And the O level exams schedule is much tighter than before. It used to be you have 2 to 3 days between subjects. Now you probably get papers every day or every other day.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there need to be a 3 months period for students to discover their shortcomings before an examination which grade them on 4 years of work. A school which finish the syllabus just on time will deprive them of such an opportunity.</p>
              <p>The prelim exams will only be useful if the student have sufficient time to prepare well for it. The prelims is a useful tool to identify your shortcomings after throught revision so that you can plug the problems before the actual O levels. Finishing just on time would mean that most students can only have a cursory revision before their prelims. This deprive them of using the only geniune review of their performance before the real thing.</p>
              <p>I would argue that finishing the syllabus before June is ideal.</p>
              <p>Revision at home in June holidays. Clarification with school teachers in July. Gauge of performance in August (prelims). Troubleshooting in Sept. Ready for the O levels in October.</p>

              <p>7am - 6pm is like 'official' timings... It's more like 7am - 12 midnight (or later)... all work... And the way timetables are structured for teachers.... they can't even have a decent lunch, unlike their students....</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  I often feel that teachers in school make the content (especially maths) overly complex, convoluted and disconnected. Therefore, students cannot understand the subject. If a deliberate attempt is made to teach with scaffolding, students will be better able to pick up new content. When I was teaching JC 1 students with scaffolding, I was able to have them understand H2 maths topics rather quickly by activating their prior E/A maths knowledge.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  If there is skilful teaching in schools, then there will not be need for tuition.</p>
              <p>  I feel that tuition complements school teaching.</p>
              <p>  Happy yuan xiao jie!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>
