              <p>A wave of the water current is flowing at a speed of 8 km/h towards
              Point X from Point Y which was 877 km apart. At 8 am, Johnny rode off
              with his boat at a speed of 50 km/h towards Y from Point X for 30 mins
              and then stopped to have a rest for 45 mins before continuing his
              remaining journey at the same speed. At 9.15 am, Peter set off with his
              boat at a speed of 120 km/h from Point Y to Point X and both of them
              travelled for a distance and finally met at Point Z. How long did
              Johnny take to travel after passing Peter at Point Z? Express your

              <p>Are you sure the distance is 877km and not 879km? The 2km will have made a lot of difference, especially when this is a P6 question.</p>

              <p>The question may be wrong. 877km should be 879km. I got the answer when the distance between Point X and Point Y is 879km.</p>

Hence, when a boat travels from X to Y, an additional 8km/h will have to be added since current is helping to push the boat. However, when a boat travel from Y to X, 8km/h will have to be deducted from the speed as water current is going against the boat.</span></p>

              <p>I think the answer is correct, but the question has a lot of typing errors. And when I say a lot, I mean A LOT.</p>
              <p>1) The distance is pretty suspicious, if it is 877km, no matter how you work it out, the answer will be full of decimal places.</p>
              <p>2) The current should be from X to Y, if it is not....have fun plotting your graph.</p>
              <p>3) When Johnny stopped down, did he he use an achor or stop at an island? If not, wouldn't his boat drift due to current?</p>
              <p>4) Shouldn't the question be 'How long was the journey that Johhny travelled before reaching point Z' ? If it is put in its current way, it sound as if the question wants you to calculate the time for johnny to reach point Y from point Z.</p>

              travelled for a distance and finally met at Point Z. How long did

              <p>Accordingly to him/her, the answer is still 6 1/4 h and this qn has nothing to do with relative velocity.                                                                                                                              Any comments and Thks.</p>

              a rest for 45 mins before continuing his remaining journey at the

              <p>I still think the question is incorrect. It should be rephrased as how long it takes for Johnny to meet Peter at point Z from the time he starts off from point X.</p>
              <p>Assuming that the point I made above is correct, the workings will be as followed:</p>
              <p>Distance travelled by Johnny in half an hour</p>
              <p>= 1/2 X 50km - 1/2 X 8km</p>
              <p>= 21km</p>
              <p>While resting for 45mins, distance the boat drifted back</p>
              <p>= 3/4 X 8km</p>
              <p>= 6km</p>
              <p>As such, after 1h 15mins, actual distance travelled is only</p>
              <p>= 21km - 6km</p>
              <p>=15km</p>
              <p>Distance between Johnny now and Peter</p>
              <p>= 865km - 15km</p>
              <p>=850km</p>
              <p>Actual travelling speed of Johnny</p>
              <p>= 50km/h - 8km/h</p>
              <p>= 42km/h</p>
              <p>Actual travelling speed of Peter</p>
              <p>= 120km/h + 8km/h</p>
              <p>= 128km/h</p>
              <p>Time taken for the two guys to meet each other</p>
              <p>= 850km / ( 42km + 128km )</p>
              <p>= 850/170 hours</p>
              <p>= 5 hours</p>
              <p>Total time for the 2 guys to meet</p>
              <p>= 5 hours + 45 mins + 30 mins</p>
              <p>= <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>6 and 1/4</strong></span> hours.</p>
              <p>If the question is correct whereas the one I proposed is wrong, the final answer will be over 15 hours, not to mention with some decimal places.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It is relative velocity, when we add magnitudes of vectors in the same direction and subtract magnitudes of vectors in opposite directions.</p>
              <p>  Thanks!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Aiyah, it is so obvious that TS Chocolate Cake is not consistent in the replies.</p>
              <p>First, TS claims that the question is from a PSLE assessment book. If it is really from an assessment book, name of the book please.</p>
              <p>Then, TS changes to say that it is from another website</p>
              <p>Now, forumers pointed out the mistakes and TS says that the poster in another</p>
              <p>forum changes the question.</p>
              <p>More likely TS is the setter of the question lor.</p>
              <p>TS has probably posted the question in another website and no one answers the question in that website and so TS re-post the question in this forum lor.</p>
              <p>So, when homework.sgforums.com forumers pointed out the mistakes, TS changes the question in the other website and in this forum too.</p>
              <p>The question is DEFINITELY a relative velocity question, though not a difficult</p>
              <p>relative velocity question AND THE question is of many mistakes and</p>
              <p>inconsistencies.</p>
              <p>The moderator Mr Wee has already kindly pointed out that it is a relative velocity</p>
              <p>question but TS still tries to say that it is not a relative velocity question.</p>
              <p>I totally agree with Mr Wee that this question is atypical and it is inappropriate for</p>
              <p>any PSLE student to attempt it at all.</p>
