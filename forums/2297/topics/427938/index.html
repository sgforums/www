              <p>Hi! I have just completed a essay as per request by my English teacher but before I submit, I will like to canvass fellow forum-ers opinions. Is there any advise you will like to share? I am taking O level this year so I am quite concerned.</p>
              <p>Titled: Heroes</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Could you believe it? I used to be a gangster. Gangster
                  of Singapore’s most infamous mob. To aggravate it, at 16 I was the youngest of the
                  bunch of hooligans. Back before I joined the bunch, I was very much inclined
                  academically. My grades would had easily ignited jealousy among anyone.
                  However, that was not long lasting. Someone close to me departed, that gravely stricken
                  and devastated me. It was during this hard time when I was introduced to the
                  apparent endearing appeal of the Lao’s gang. Eventually, I returned to my
                  rightful path but at the price of my brothers’ lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">After my loved ones passed on, my brothers were the
                  only group whom I can confine my problems with. Then, I enjoyed my company with
                  them. We did lots of unlawful activities, notably fighting. We did not need to
                  have any good reasons to start a fight, Laos frequently engage in it, mostly
                  just for the thrill. The gang was such professional that we always maintain a
                  reserve of deadly destructive weapons. Baseball bats, Parangs of different sizes
                  just to name a few. For most of the fight we had, Laos always emerged victory.
                  That was probably the reason how the Laos’ gang had made such a reputation in
                  this city state. However, there was a time where the Laos lost. The violent
                  between the Laos and second to Laos’ gang, the Lims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I am not sure what caused the violent but if I not
                  mistaken, it was because my chief unintentionally entered the Lims’ territory
                  without any permission. Lims believing the Laos did not have any respect for
                  them initiated the violent brawl.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">That night was particularly eerie and quiet. I could
                  perhaps hear a pin drop. Ominous moonlight shores the streets we were in.<span>  </span>I had a very bad feeling about the fight –
                  something bad was going to happen, something really awful. The streets were
                  clear and we were the only group present. 89 of us, each possessing at least
                  one possibly lethal weapon. At a hour past midnight, the Lims could be heard
                  marching towards the streets we are in. In front of us, there were at least a hundred
                  of them viciously and confident looking men. We were ambushed. We had agreed on
                  maximum of 90 members in this battle, we were tricked!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">“Tonight is going to be tragic!”, I mumbled that
                  night.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">For that five terrifying minutes when the Lims marched
                  towards us, I was shaken with fear and had a lot of uncertainty if we would
                  even be able to walk out of this street alive. I gradually took few steps back
                  and hid in a small corner where I watched.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">The inevitably started, I had a first taste of what
                  being a gangster really had to offer. Parangs can be seen flying in the air,
                  ever ready to inflict agonizing pain into its targets. Screams were
                  reverberating along the two narrow long stretch of Lorong 98, 99 Geylang. That
                  violent brawl allowed me to truly witness the brutality of the Lims. With a
                  slash of the sharp Parang, the skull splits, fragments of it could be seen on
                  the ground; bright pink brain matter was clearly visible. The Lims even had
                  firepower. Where they squeezed and held down the trigger sprayed a horde of
                  bullets all over the place killing my brothers. The few seconds of fire felt
                  like an eternity as I watched painfully my brothers flinch, toss and turn and
                  their bodies torn to pieces. All casualties had blood oozing out, most lying
                  motionlessly on the cold hard concrete. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I could feel my heartbeat in my temple and a cold
                  sweat broke out on the surface of my brow. I knew, chances were, the Lims would
                  examine every corner of all streets and when I am found, I would be sentenced
                  to death. I was terrified. The Lims played dirty. There was no way the Laos
                  could successful win this battle as we were outnumbered. They successfully
                  inflicted huge damages to my brothers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Unexpectedly two of my brothers found me in the
                  corner. They were badly injured. Alvin barfed blood whereas Ken was catching
                  his breath. They seemed surprised to see me alive. Noting that it was only
                  seconds before the Lim’s gang would find us, Ken said breathlessly, “Max! Out
                  of all the gang members, you are the highest educated, you have the brightest
                  future among all of us. We will distract the Lims while you run for the exit
                  and seek help. Do not join the gang again!” Alvin silently agreed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Before I could speak, Ken screamed, “Run now!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I did not have the luxury of time to think, I escaped
                  the spot and ran for the main road as I told. At the corner of Lorong 98, I
                  turned back and saw Alvin being ripped into halve with a Parang, Ken tried to
                  stop but was punched hard and kneeled for mercy. Blood was seen pooling on the
                  concrete he was kneeling. His eyes, nose was swelling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I could not tolerate the scene I was witnessing. With
                  teary eyes, I dashed to the nearest police post, imagining what will happen to
                  Ken. Would the punch collapse his trachea and he suffocates to death, or, would
                  he be crashed in his windpipe and his spine separated from the brain stem? I
                  thought of how the Lims would clear the traces of evidence. Would they
                  pulverize all their teeth, burn off fingerprints, and disfigure their faces,
                  forcing a DNA test to establish their identity impossible? The thoughts were
                  scary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">To lighten my guilt, I kept saying to myself that I
                  had to leave my brothers, I had to be selfish and it had to be done in order to
                  save at least a life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">When I knew I was at a safe distance, I slowed and walked
                  heavily hearted to the police post.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I swung open the glass door and briefly told the
                  officers the trauma I had just experienced. They brought me to their cafeteria
                  for a coffee to calm me down. There, I cried for a good fifteen minutes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US"><span> </span>I ended my presence
                  in the police post with the police taking my statement and they sent me home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Back home I remind myself of what Ken last words “Max!
                  Out of all the gang members, you are the highest educated, you have the
                  brightest future among all of us. We will distract the Lims while you run for
                  the exit and seek help. Do not join the gang again!”. His last sentence kept
                  echoing my mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">That night, I reflected the spiteful actions I did in
                  the past and despite being devastated, I did a serious concrete planning of my
                  future. I vowed to never to join any gang again. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">It was only after Ken and Alvin sacrificed for me that
                  I reflected upon myself. If I had continued be part of the gang, I would only
                  be a pest in this society, creating trouble for the country. Their death for me
                  made me discovered my rightful path in my life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Because of their heroines act, I became a part time
                  volunteer at a prison school where most inmates was sent there because of
                  gangster related activity involvement. While I did fulfill Ken’s and Alvin’s
                  last wish, the guilt was never taken from me for my selfishness to live ended
                  their live. It is something I have to deal with every day.</span></p>

              <p>Dear BillaMax,</p>
              <p>I'm Chin Seng from Homework Forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> Great to see you here. Tell you something interesting, exactly one year ago, I marked an essay with the exact topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Storyline is good. Slightly deviated from the topic "Hero".</p>
              <p>I can see that you used some vocab in your essay. Grammar is not a huge issue, but still have room for improvement.</p>
              <p>Sentence structure is good, you can further improve this by reading newspaper. Note that some times it is very easy for use to write down what we want to say (spoken language), and you must remember that there is a difference between spoken and written language.</p>
              <p>I can see one or two complex sentences. A good effort to add in variation. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> Kinda didn't see any spelling mistake. Look like Word97 correcting system.</p>
              <p>If this is O level question.... then this essay is too long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remark: The fighting part was well written because I see the effort in making the story come alife. However, when I come to the Police station and the ending part, the story seems to be a little hurried.</p>
              <p>Keep each paragraph short and sweet. Remember the rule, "starting of the paragraph (first sentence) is a short insight of the remaining paragraph".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>23~26/ 30</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>use some words to impress the examiners. Example I learn a new word yesterday " force majeure". I googled it and understood the meaning, now I'm selling this word. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>
              <p>I notice that you didn't use " ; ". This is another punctuation that will show the examiner that you're good with your punctuation.</p>

              <p>Hi! Thanks! Yup there is much to improve on for my English. My English is quite terrible at a C grade.</p>
              <p>I googled for the meaning of force majeure, it is very interesting.</p>
              <p>Re-read the essay and corrected some phrasing and grammatical errors. The corrected version of this essay is below:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Could you believe it? I used to be a gangster. Gangster
                  of Singapore’s most infamous mob. To aggravate it, at 16 I was the youngest of the
                  bunch of hooligans. Back before I joined the bunch, I was very much inclined
                  academically. My grades would had easily ignited jealousy among anyone.
                  However, that was not long lasting. Someone close to me departed, that gravely stricken
                  and devastated me. It was during this hard time when I was introduced to the
                  apparent endearing appeal of the Laos’ gang. Eventually, I returned to my
                  rightful path but at the price of my brothers’ lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">After my loved ones passed on, my brothers were the
                  only group whom I can confine my problems with. Then, I enjoyed my company with
                  them. We did lots of unlawful activities, notably fighting. We did not need to
                  have any good reasons to start a fight, Laos frequently engage in it, mostly
                  just for the thrills. The gang was such professional that we always maintain a
                  reserve of deadly destructive weapons. Baseball bats, Parang knifes of different
                  lengths just to name a few. For most of the fight we had, Laos always emerged
                  victory. That was probably the reason how the Laos’ gang had made such a
                  reputation in the city state. However, there was a time where the Laos lost.
                  The violent between the Laos and second to Laos’ gang, the Lims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I am not sure what caused the violent but if I not
                  mistaken, it was because my chief unintentionally entered the Lims’ territory
                  without any permission. Lims believing the Laos did not have any respect for
                  them initiated the violent brawl.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">That night was particularly eerie and quiet. I could
                  perhaps hear a pin drop. Ominous moonlight shores the streets we were in.<span>  </span>I had a very bad feeling about the fight –
                  something bad was going to happen, something really awful. The streets were
                  clear and we were the only group present. 89 of us, each possessing at least
                  one possibly lethal weapon. At a hour past midnight, the Lims could be heard
                  marching towards the streets we are in. In front of us, there were at least two
                  hundreds of them viciously and confident looking men. We were ambushed. We had
                  agreed on maximum of 90 members in this battle, we were tricked!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">“Tonight is going to be tragic!”, I mumbled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">For that five terrifying minutes when the Lims marched
                  towards us, I was shaken with fear and had a lot of uncertainty if we would
                  even be able to walk out of this street alive. I gradually took a few steps
                  back and hid in a small corner where I watched.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">The inevitably started, I had a first taste of what
                  being a gangster really had to offer. Parangs can be seen flying in the air,
                  ever ready to inflict agonizing pain into its targets. Screams were
                  reverberating along the two narrow long stretch of Lorong 98, 99 Geylang. That
                  violent brawl allowed me to truly witness the brutality of the Lims. With a
                  slash of the sharp Parang, the skull splits, fragments of it could be seen on
                  the ground; bright pink brain matter was clearly visible. The Lims even had
                  firepower. Where they squeezed and held down the trigger sprayed a horde of
                  bullets all over the place killing my brothers. The few seconds of fire felt
                  like an eternity as I watched painfully my brothers flinch, toss and turn and
                  their bodies torn to pieces. All casualties had blood oozing out, most lying
                  motionlessly on the cold hard concrete. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I could feel my heartbeat in my temple and a cold
                  sweat broke out on the surface of my brow. I knew, chances were, the Lims would
                  examine every corner of all streets and when I am found, I would be sentenced
                  to death. I was terrified. The Lims played dirty. There was no way the Laos
                  could successful win this battle as we were outnumbered. They successfully
                  inflicted huge damages to my brothers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Unexpectedly two of my brothers found me in the
                  corner. They were badly injured. Alvin barfed blood whereas Ken was catching
                  his breath. They seemed surprised to see me alive. Noting that it was only seconds
                  before the Lims’ gang would find us, Ken said breathlessly, “Max! Out of all
                  the gang members, you are the highest educated, you have the brightest future
                  among all of us. We will distract the Lims while you run for the exit and seek
                  help. Do not join the gang again!” Alvin too weak to say anything nodded his head
                  silently agreed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Before I could speak, Ken screamed, “Run now!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I did not have the luxury of time to think, I escaped
                  the spot and ran for the main road as I told. At the corner of Lorong 98, I
                  turned back and saw Alvin being ripped into halve with a Parang, Ken tried to
                  stop but was punched hard and kneeled for mercy. Blood was seen pooling on the
                  concrete he was kneeling. His eyes, nose was swelling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I could not tolerate the scene I was witnessing. With
                  teary eyes, I dashed to the nearest police post, imagining what will happen to
                  Ken. Would the punch collapse his trachea and he suffocates to death, or, would
                  he be crashed in his windpipe and his spine separated from the brain stem? I
                  thought of how the Lims would clear the traces of evidence. Would they
                  pulverize all their teeth, burn off fingerprints, and disfigure their faces,
                  forcing a DNA test to establish their identity impossible? The thoughts were too
                  scary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">To lighten my guilt, I kept saying to myself that I
                  had to leave my brothers, I had to be selfish and it had to be done in order to
                  save at least a life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">When I knew I was at a safe distance, I slowed and
                  walked heavily hearted to the police post.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">I swung open the glass door and briefly described to
                  the officers the trauma I had just experienced. They brought me to their
                  cafeteria for a coffee in an effort to calm me down. There, I cried for a good
                  fifteen minutes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US"><span> </span>I ended my
                  presence in the police post with the police taking my statement after which
                  they sent me home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">Back home I reminded myself of what Ken’s last words
                  “Max! Out of all the gang members, you are the highest educated, you have the
                  brightest future among all of us. We will distract the Lims while you run for
                  the exit and seek help. Do not join the gang again!”. His last sentence kept
                  echoing in my head.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">That night, I reflected the spiteful actions I did in
                  the past and despite being devastated, I did a serious concrete planning of my
                  future. I vowed to never to join any gang again. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; ' lang="EN-US">It was only after Ken and Alvin sacrificed for me that
                  I reflected upon myself. If I had continued to be part of the gang, I would
                  only be a pest in this society, creating trouble for the country. Their death made
                  me discovered my rightful path in my life. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";     ' lang="EN-US">Because of their
                  heroines act, I became a part time volunteer to impart wisdom at a prison
                  school where most inmates was sent there for committing gangster related
                  activity involvement. While I did fulfill Ken’s and Alvin’s last wish, the
                  guilt was never taken from me for my selfishness to live ended their lives. It
                  is something I have to deal with every day.</span></p>

              <p>(What I think)</p>
              <p>There's some run on sentences and some sentences that are rather awkward. I spotted about sixty or more errors.</p>
              <p>The following is how I would write it. You can compare with the one you wrote. Overall, I'd say that you have a very good storyline and some of your descriptions are really fantastic. Just be careful of the tenses, general grammar and avoid run on sentences. I hope you find my suggestions helpful.</p>

              <p><span>Could you believe it? I used to be a
                                          gangster. Yet I was no mere average gangster, but a member of Singapore’s most infamous mob. To make matters worse, my age of sixteen makes me the youngest amongst these hooligans. Back before
                                          I joined them, I was very much inclined academically. My
                                          grades would have easily sparked jealousy in anyone. However,
                                          that did not last long. Someone close to me departed. This
                                          gravely devastated me. It was during this hard time
                  that I was introduced to the apparent endearing appeal of the Laos’
                                          gang. Eventually, I returned to my rightful path but at the price
                                          of my brothers’ lives.</span></p>
              <p><span>After my loved ones passed on, my
                                          brothers were the only group whom I can confide my problems with.
                                          Then, I enjoyed their company. We did lots of unlawful
                                          activities, notably fighting. We did not need to have any good
                                          reasons to start a fight. Laos frequently engaged in it, mostly just
                                          for the thrills. The gang was so professional that we always
                                          maintained a reserve of deadly destructive weapons. Baseball bats,
                                          Parang knifes of different lengths just to name a few. For most of
                                          the fight we had, Laos always emerged victorious. That was probably
                                          the reason why the Laos’ gang had made such a reputation in the
                                          city state. However, there was a time where the Laos lost. This was during the
                                          violent fight between the Laos and their closest rivlas, the Lims. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>I am not sure what caused the violence
                                          but if I'm not mistaken, it was because my chief unintentionally
                                          entered the Lims’ territory without any permission. The Lims believing
                                          that the Laos did not have any respect for them initiated the violent
                                          brawl.</span></p>
              <p><span>That night was particularly eerie and
                                          quiet. I could perhaps hear a pin drop. Ominous moonlight shored
                                          the streets we were in.<span> </span> I had a very
                                          bad feeling about the fight – something bad was going to happen,
                                          something really awful. The streets were clear and we were the only
                                          group present. 89 of us, each possessing at least one possibly
                                          lethal weapon. At an hour past midnight, the Lims could be heard
                                          marching towards the streets we are in. In front of us, there were
                                          at least two hundred of them. They were vicious and confident looking men.
                                          We were ambushed. We had agreed on a maximum of 90 members in this
                                          battle, but we were tricked!</span></p>
              <p><span>“Tonight is going to be tragic!”, I
                                          mumbled.</span></p>
              <p><span>For that five terrifying minutes when
                                          the Lims marched towards us, I was shaken with fear and was uncertain if we would even be able to walk out of this street
                                          alive. I gradually took a few steps back and hid in a small corner
                                          where I watched.</span></p>
              <p><span>The fight inevitably started, I had a first
                                          taste of what being a gangster really had to offer. Parangs could be
                                          seen flying in the air, ever ready to inflict agonizing pain onto their targets. Screams were reverberating along the two narrow long
                                          stretch of Lorong 98, 99 Geylang. That violent brawl allowed me to
                                          truly witness the brutality of the Lims. With a slash of the sharp
                                          Parang, the skull splits, fragments of it could be seen on the
                                          ground; bright pink brain matter was clearly visible. The Lims even
                                          had firepower. When they squeezed and held down the trigger, they
                                          sprayed a horde of bullets all over the place killing my brothers.
                                          The few seconds of fire felt like an eternity as I watched
                                          painfully my brothers flinch, toss and turn and their bodies torn
                                          to pieces. All casualties had blood oozing out. Most were lying
                                          motionless on the cold hard concrete.</span></p>
              <p><span>I could feel my heartbeat in my temple
                                          and a cold sweat broke out on the surface of my brow. I knew,
                                          chances were, the Lims would examine every corner of all streets
                                          and when I am found, I would be sentenced to death. I was
                                          terrified. The Lims played dirty. There was no way the Laos could
                                          successfully win this battle as we were outnumbered. They
                                          successfully inflicted huge damages to my brothers.</span></p>
              <p><span>Unexpectedly two of my brothers found me
                                          in the corner. They were badly injured. Alvin barfed blood whereas
                                          Ken was catching his breath. They seemed surprised to see me alive.
                                          Noting that it was only seconds before the Lims’ gang would find
                                          us, Ken said breathlessly, “Max! Out of all the gang members, you
                                          are the highest educated, you have the brightest future among all
                                          of us. We will distract the Lims while you run for the exit and
                                          seek help. Do not join the gang again!” Alvin too weak to say
                                          anything nodded his head silently agreed.</span></p>
              <p><span>Before I could speak, Ken screamed, “Run
                                          now!”</span></p>
              <p><span>I did not have the luxury of time to
                                          think, I escaped the spot and ran for the main road as I told. At
                                          the corner of Lorong 98, I turned back and saw Alvin being ripped
                                          into halve with a Parang, Ken tried to stop but was punched hard
                                          and kneeled for mercy. Blood was seen pooling on the concrete where he
                                          was kneeling. His eyes, nose was swelling.</span></p>
              <p><span>I could not tolerate the scene I was
                                          witnessing. With teary eyes, I dashed to the nearest police post,
                                          imagining what will happen to Ken. Would the punch collapse his
                                          trachea and cause him to suffocate to death, or, would he be crushed in his
                                          windpipe and his spine separated from the brain stem? I thought of
                                          how the Lims would clear the traces of evidence. Would they
                                          pulverize all their teeth, burn off fingerprints, and disfigure
                                          their faces, forcing a DNA test to establish their identity
                                          impossible? The thoughts were too scary.</span></p>
              <p><span>To lighten my guilt, I kept saying to
                                          myself that I had to leave my brothers, I had to be selfish and it
                                          had to be done in order to save at least a life.</span></p>
              <p><span>When I knew I was at a safe distance, I
                                          slowed and walked heavily hearted to the police post.</span></p>
              <p><span>I swung open the glass door and briefly
                                          described to the officers the trauma I had just experienced. They
                                          brought me to their cafeteria for a coffee in an effort to calm me
                                          down. There, I cried for a good fifteen minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span><span> </span>I ended my
                                          presence in the police post with the police taking my statement
                                          after which they sent me home.</span></p>
              <p><span>Back home I reminded myself of what
                                          Ken’s last words “Max! Out of all the gang members, you are the
                                          highest educated, you have the brightest future among all of us. We
                                          will distract the Lims while you run for the exit and seek help. Do
                                          not join the gang again!”. His last sentence kept echoing in my
                                          head.</span></p>
              <p><span>That night, I reflected on the spiteful
                                          actions I did in the past and despite being devastated, I did a
                                          serious concrete planning of my future. I vowed to never join
                                          any gang again.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was only after Ken and Alvin
                                          sacrificed their lives for me that I reflected upon myself. If I had continued
                                          to be part of the gang, I would only be a pest in this society,
                                          creating trouble for the country. Their death made me discovered my
                                          rightful path in my life.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Because of their heroic act, I became a part
                                          time volunteer to impart wisdom at a prison school where most
                                          inmates were sent for committing gangster related activities. While I did fulfill Ken’s and Alvin’s last wish, the
                                          guilt was never taken from me for my selfishness to live ended
                                          their lives. It is something I have to deal with everyday.</span></p>
