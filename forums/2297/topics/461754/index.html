              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>One dangerous thing to do is to make decisions with a short term point of view. Taking Literature may allow you to score better in your exams, but will it be useful to you for your university studies? You say that you "really want to do Medicine", and you must definitely be aware that a Biology background would be a bonus for you for your future studies in that area, even if it is not compulsory to take it in A Level for entry to an Australian Uni.</p>
              <p>What I am worried about is that you may get better A Level results due to your decision to take Literature in place of Biology, and you may get into the course and university of your choice, but would you struggle in university due to your lack of Biology background? Even if the subject of Biology is hard to score well in, it's better to struggle in JC and receive help from your teachers, than struggle in university (the lecturers will try to help you but ultimately they won't spoon feed you as much as teachers in JC do)</p>
              <p>Chemistry and Biology are essential subjects for you if you are really keen on pursuing a degree in Medicine (or Pharmacy or Life Science). I don't recommend that you drop them, but instead put in more hard work in the following year. It's good that you are not considering dropping Math because it is essential in almost anything we do in future. I'm not exactly sure but you may need to do some stats in your Medicine course, so don't drop Math (you probably can't anyway right?).</p>
              <p>To me, it feels that Econs is the most appropriate subject for you to drop if you are really keen on giving Literature a try. In terms of giving you general knowledge, Econs is a great subject (and I regret not taking it in the past). In terms of giving you preparation for a course in Medicine, Econs and Literature are probably equivalent. So I guess you should decide based on interest and potential to score well.</p>
              <p>How did you score for this year's exams (in every subject, out of curiosity)? If you did well in Econs, perhaps you shouldn't give it up and stick with your current subject combination. If not, then ok you can consider switching to Lit if you feel really confident about it.</p>
              <p>Ideally, you should take Bio at H2 and drop Econs or Lit to H1. That will give you the best preparation for your Medicine course. But that's assuming you can cope with this workload. Seek more advice from other people, for example your teachers or seniors, and I hope some of the other forumers offer some help as well.</p>
              <p>In any case, don't worry so much. You are still very young with many options ahead of you as long as you work hard. Cheer up and don't be too stressed =)</p>

              <p>Hey, thank you for the advice and great insight! It really helped a lot! :) </p>

              <p>As you can see, Maths is what killed me. I am willing to admit though that I have been lazy with Maths. It's one of my least favourite subjects :P But I can't drop it even if I wanted to. Econs as well to a certain extent. I needed to pass every single subject to promote. And yes! I agree that I need H2 Bio and I'm worried that my school won't let a retainee take up an extra H2 science subject.. I hope they will though. </p>

              <p>It's great to know your best subjects (besides GP) are Bio and Chem. From what I see, if you really wanna take Lit, you should drop Econs. But do consider carefully whether you really have the potential to score in Lit, or whether the Econs knowledge you learnt this year gives you a good advantage next year if you re-take it.</p>
              <p>H2 Math is very hard, do put in effort for it! It's no longer like in the O levels where standard questions come out and you should know how to do them as long as you've done similar questions before. In A levels, they really test your concept and the questions that come out can be very creative and original. As such, you should do your tutorials regularly and really try to understand the content (haha ok very naggy but this is really something to follow, at least to some extent)</p>
              <p>Maybe you should write to your school telling them of your ambition to study Medicine, and that taking Bio at H2 is beneficial to you. Try to convince them that the B you scored at H1 level indicates your interest and ability in the subject, and that you feel you can handle the H2 level content. Then maybe you can take Lit or Econs at H1?</p>
