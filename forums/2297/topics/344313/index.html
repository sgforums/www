              <p>TPJC vs SRJC is a close call especially when u factor in the travelling time.</p>
              <p>At a glance, percentage of TPJC students going to university (60+) %</p>
              <p>                          ''                    SRJC students going to university (40+) %</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TPJC focus on independent study - you have to revise on your own. On the other hand, SRJC spoonfeeds you and u get excess to excessive consultation.</p>
              <p>Environment wise, both JCs have students who want to study as well as playful/slacking students.</p>
              <p>Oh, one thing to note is a JC with 20 COP doesn't meant majority of the students have that mark. It simply represents that the highest pointer (Lousiest) student went in with 20 points.</p>

              <p>just noticed that srjc don't have H3.</p>
              <p>How about YJC v SRJC?</p>
              <p>YJC sci  = 4-20</p>
              <p>SRJC sci = 5-18</p>
              <p>and, i know what it doesnt mean the majority are that standard. But by letting students with 20 points in, it shows that the JC is despo for students.. ever heard of, "study well and choose ur jc, not let jc choose you"? or something along that line. Basically, no one can tell what standard their students are at.</p>

              <p>doesn't time play an important factor too? I heard there's a lot of PW and stuff(CCA, etc) going on. So i'll need all the time i can get. And i live around the bishan area, maybe streetdirectory.com's calculation doesn't factor in traffic.</p>

              <p>I think i will be able to handle the worse environment, but how about the teachers? Are the teachers in yjc/srjc as good as those in tpjc?</p>
              <p>And, a side question -- Can most 13 pointers handle H3? That'll decide whether yjc is better than srjc &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>doesn't time play an important factor too? I heard there's a lot of PW and stuff(CCA, etc) going on. So i'll need all the time i can get. And i live around the bishan area, maybe streetdirectory.com's calculation doesn't factor in traffic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think i will be able to handle the worse environment, but how about the teachers? Are the teachers in yjc/srjc as good as those in tpjc?</p>
              <p>And, a side question -- Can most 13 pointers handle H3? That'll decide whether yjc is better than srjc &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p>oh and i'll most likely be taking pcme</p>

              <p><br>Yes, the statement about L1R5 6 points was meant as a guideline, meaning, H3 is tough. It's meant to be tough. It's up to the individual JC's HOD of course, to decide if your performance in JC1 is up to your taking a H3 subject in JC2.</p>

              <p>About going up and down to NUS, I'm very clear about it. So if I'm interested in major in maths, how will it benefit me with the H3?</p>

              <p><br>H3 is not necessary, of course. But for eager students who believe they are more capable than, and want to push themselves beyond, the average student, H3 represents exposure to University level academia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So how will it benefit you? Take it as a preview and/or fast-forward track to doing University level mathematics, while still in JC. It does help your overall performance, in terms of your heightened mindset and deeper thinking, if you're exposed and already functioning at a higher level of academia. PROVIDED you're up to the challenge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you find you can't cope (eg. your H2 subjects are not doing well, because you don't have enough time), then you can drop the H3 subject at any time. So it's safe, in that sense, to attempt the H3 challenge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Incidentally, for Chemistry, I do teach some H3 curriculum to my H2 students, because I find some of these aspects to be fundamental and necessary for a complete understanding of Chemistry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's akin to what some students observe, "H1 Chem students have an incomplete understanding because they skip some important parts of the H2 syllabus". I say simiarly, for H2 to H3. But of course, I only teach my H2 students the parts (of H3 syllabus) which are helpful and relevant (eg. Resonance, SN1 vs SN2, mechanisms, etc), not the parts which will totally not be examinable even indirectly (eg. IR, UV, MS, NMR spectroscopy, etc).</p>
