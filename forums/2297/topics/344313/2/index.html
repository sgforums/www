              <p><br>If what YJC management claims is true (that they're actually a high standard JC with cut off points deliberately set very kindly), then the interview is ostensibly only to ensure weaker students (eg. L1R5 19 or 20 pts) do not try to bite off more than they can handle, eg. 4 H2 subjects. The interview will, to some extent, help to ascertain the student's confidence and competence level.</p>

              <p>Take H2 Econs. The extra things you learn are definitely much

              <p>I seriously like econs although I didn't do very well in J1.
              Persisted till J2 when I finally scored a B for prelims and an A

              <p>And, usually, are classes grouped by subject combinations? If
                                      so, then 4H2 + a possible H3 i would land up in the better class i

              <p>If you ask me, I would prefer a better but further JC. I don't mind the travelling time. The trip from my house to my JC took around 1 hour by train and bus.</p>
              <p>But at the end of the day, I felt it was worth it because of the company. There was a reasonable amound of students in the JC who are hardworking and willing to study instead of fooling around. With them, I can concentrate on my studies. The facilities are better. The staffs are better.</p>
              <p>And the long hours on the transport shouldn't matter because you can study on the train/bus as well. Results or convinience, your call.</p>
              <p>And...try to appeal to NYJC if possible. I went in with a L1R5 of 12 points without any problem back in 2006. And glad to say, I graduated with a reasonably good results...partly because of the school with it's prestige.</p>

              <p><br>So you're in TPJC but want to appeal for SRJC?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Distance wise, not much diff to you. (in fact, TPJC is slightly better).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comparing quality of JCs, should be not much diff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I've had students from both JCs, and (although things may have changed over the years), from what they tell me, the TPJC culture is healthier and more condusive for studying, than SRJC. Both in terms of student habit patterns, as well as teachers (who give more counterproductive stress in SRJC).</p>

              <p><br>Of course it's not the environment, it's yourself. A private candidate CAN certainly score more distinctions than a RJC student. It's all about yourself, obviously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point was, from what my SRJC students say, it appears that in the eargerness/desperation/pressure-from-principal/etc, to improve the grades of the students, they give excessive homework, excessively tough exam papers, excessive extra classes after school everyday, etc. This is stressful for the average student (of course, if you regard yourself as an above average student, you have no worries), and as such may be counterproductive for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the student culture, it was an ex-SRJC student himself, who on the SgClub School Life forum just several weeks ago, said that the student culture there is intellectually slack. Meaning most SRJC students would rather play than study. This, he said, does not provide as condusive a study environment, as the better JCs. He was explaining in a thread in which someone asked why SRJC % of students going to local Universities were only about 40% (varies from year to year, of course).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HOWEVER, and this would be good news for you (all SRJC students reading this), this particular ex-SRJC student, emphasized that it's all up to you, student culture and pressure from teachers aside, that the final 'A' level grades are entirely in your own hands, regardless of which JC you're in. He is living proof of this - our SRJC student hero scored all distinctions (4As) and went on to study in the University of his choice.</p>

              <p><br>15min vs 1hr... I think the choice is clear. Imagine reaching school late during the exam period. Habis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise, if transport is really no issue for you (eg. you have your own chauffer and you love to wake up ridiculously early everyday), then by most accounts, TPJC is a preferred choice.</p>
