              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>I'm currently a Sec 4 taking my O's this year.Well,my school's MYE has just been over,and as usual to my HUGE dissapointment,i did not do very well.Although there were some A's here and there,i was dissapointed in my results.Especially for AM.I have not been studying hard for it,and it was something i had seem coming long ago as i wanted to go study psychology in Ngee Ann Poly.However,recently i was convinced that the percentage of students who made to Uni through JC were HUGE compared to those in Poly.Therefore,i am now face in a huge dilemma.I changed my mind somewhere before exams,and sad to say,there wasn't enough time for me to pass my AM. </p>
              <p>Therefore,the Amaths teachers had a huge 'axing' of many students who failed the exam.I clearly was one of the unlucky bunch,and we had 2 options.</p>
              <p>1.Continue to take AM and risk doing badly for my prelims and other subjects,to merely just bring AM to a pass,if I get lucky.But i risk doing badly for other subjects that clearly i could push to an A1 or A2 grade during the June holidays.</p>
              <p>2.Drop the Amaths,and focus on the rest.This way,there is a much greater chance i can score better for the rest of my subjects,which will still give me a good L1R5 aggregate.</p>
              <p>But now,the problem is that i found out many JCs,example MJC require a pass for AM in order to take H2 maths.And if i am not wrong,H2 maths are for jobs like engineering and science related subjects which i am not a bit interested in.I looked at the Arts stream,and saw economics.Reading more about the subject,i became quite interested,but i am unsure if economics require Amaths for me to take the subject.</p>
              <p>So,bottomline is,any of you know whether economics in JCs such as Meridian and Tampines require Amaths for me to take the subject?</p>
              <p>And also,what can i do if i take economics?</p>
              <p>My subject combination is currently</p>
              <p>English(DUH),Emaths,Pure Physics,Pure Chemistry,Core History,Comb Humanities of Social Studies and Elective Geog,along with MT.Amaths is now my weakest link,and the one that i am the most unsure of whether to slug it out or let it go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot guys!</p>

              Hi - i do not believe that A Math is a pre requisite to JC but please do explore further as Im not sure what levels of Maths are required at Uni level - you dun wanna cross one hurdle to run straight into a brick wall.
              
              Just hearsay - I'm not saying that the Arts stream is bad but I hear from Arts students that they face a greater degree of discrimination when job hunting as opposed to a Science / Business grad. Would need input from someone from Arts here to get a clearer picture.
              
              Poly and JCs should not be compared simply because they are the next 2 open routes post Os - Poly prepares you for the workforce while one should look at JC as a precursor to university - should you fail at your As, the A cert isn't worth alot. There are of course options such as completing your degree abroad but I am assuming the more common, local route here.

              <p>What's so hard about A math anyways. What are the problems that you face? When you are at my level, you will wish that every Engineering Math question is as easy as the ten year syllabus. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>What i believe is the stigma that you have in you that A math is tough. I believe the text books are also quite wordy, so when ever you see a wall of text, you are just turned off by it (I know I was once in your shoes and i'm doing it now.. typing a large chunk of text)</p>
              <p>What you have to do is also not to just memorise the pages and examples.</p>
              <p>The examples are one. fairly straight forward</p>
              <p>and two, take a back seat and notice the way you study it.</p>
              <p>most probably after going thru it a few times, you will more likely be memorising the steps on how to do that question, rather than understanding in general how to do that particular type of question. Alas, during the tests, even if the same type of question comes out, but with a change of numbers you will be confused as to how to do it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have friends who regretted going to JC (can't cope, no interest, no life) and dropped out after promos -  (to enroll in polytechnic).  </p>
              <p>However, don't get me wrong. Getting a diploma is not easy at all, not easy at all.</p>

              <p>A Maths is the prerequisite to JC science stream, but not to Art or H2 Econs.</p>
              <p>So without A Maths, you can still go to JC Art stream.</p>
              <p>However, psychology should be a major under NUS science faculty if I am not wrong. You should check out the requirement to enter this course in case JC Art Stream students stand no chance.</p>
              <p>Or you can simply go for Ngnn Ann psychology, and try your best in the 3 years of study. If you could get a GPA of 3.6/4, you can still make yourself in U.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>my advice to you: look at university entry pre-requisites. look at the courses you want or might be interested in, and see if they need H2 Maths.<br><br>most likely they won't, so there's one reason A Maths won't be needed, because you don't need H2 Maths. <br><br>for H2 Econs, i'm not sure, but i don't think there's an A Maths pre-requisite. I never took it, but if i'm not wrong, when we were told the pre-requisites of our subjects H2 Econs didn't need A Maths. <br>what I suggest is for you to call a few JCs, maybe around 5. ask if A Maths is a pre-requisite for Econs. or even better, ask what subjects have a pre-requisite of A Maths.<br><br>make sure you get a wide spread of JCs, that is to say, ask some from top, middle and bottom tier.</p></div>

              <p>If you're more linguistically-inclined and plan to take Arts subjects in Junior College (H2 Economics does not require Amath), then it might make sense to drop Amath.</p>
              <p>But personally, if I were you and I'm aiming for the Arts stream, I'd just stick with Amath, drop to combined science instead. It's a LOT easier to score a distinction in Amath/Combined Science than two pure sciences.</p>
              <p>If you're aiming for polytechnic, try to stay with Amath anyway. It keeps your options open greatly and may aid you in whatever math-related modules you may have to take in the future.</p>
              <p>Also, be careful. Almost every single one of my friends taking psychology say its a hell lot more crappy and boring than they thought it'd be. And surprisingly, they say (not sure if it's true or not) it's also kinda mathematics-related.</p>
              <p>If you're aiming for the Science Stream in Junior College, study harder, as hard as you can. Drop nothing.</p>

              <p>Hello im from MJC. Here's a FAQ that i gotten in 2010:</p>
              <p>FAQ2: Can I offer H2 Maths if I did not offr ans pass O-level A-Mats?</p>
              <p>Yes, if you are posted to the Science stream. THere is no need for you to appeal to offer H2 Maths during course counselling, as Science students are expected to offer H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>However, if you did not offer and pass O-level A-Maths, you may find it challenging to keep pace with H2 Maths. You will need to learn the relevent A-Maths topics outside of formal curriculum time. The tipics are: Remainder &amp; Factor Theorem; Partial Fractions; Binomial Theorem; Idices, Surds and  Logarithms; Trigonometry; Quadractic Functions; Differentiation; and Integration.</p>
              <p>FAQ3: Must I offer H2 Maths?</p>
              <p>Yes, if you are posted to the Science stream If you are posted to the Arts stream, you may offer either H1 Maths or H2 Maths (provided you have passed O-level A-Maths).</p>
              <p>------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I totally agree that amath is useful in H2 subjects (strong foundation).I know of some people who taken emath only but can still score A in  H2 maths promos. if they had put in equal effort in amath, im sure they would have still scored A in amath. Maybe their sec schl didn't offer amath in the 1st place, though. If you mean that you have gotten C5 or B for MYE amath, really... i think u can do well for Amath and shldn't drop.</p>
              <p>Econs don't require amath too. In fact, H1 and H2 econs does not involve calculations. It's mainly about explaining trends, analyzing and evaluating policies to solve to economic problems. Personally, I think it's very boring and might have taken H1 geography instead. But again, I don't know what H1 geography is about. Usefulness wise, I heard H1 econs is already sufficient in university's Economics (mostly need calculus etc). Need people to confirm this.</p>
              <p>As for the poly course, you should double confirm what it is really about, make sure the syllabus and stuffs are really what you want and need. There's one friend of mine who had taken a wrong course just because he likes the sound of it (dunno what IT business, in the end it's all computer stuffs).  There's another my friend who sent me a link to see the syllabus of a pyschology course ( i forgot which poly), and i saw something about Elderly Care inside. I wonder if Elderly Care is really relevant to pyschology? o_o I wouldn't have chosen pyschology in this case.</p>

              seems from your views that the Poly-Uni admission rate hasn't

              <p>You mean after so many years,things remained the same?And what

              <p>Dear Drageionel,</p>
              <p>AMaths is pretty important.  A large (and important) topic that EMath lacks is calculus, and a strong foundation in calculus will definitely help when doing H2 or even H1 maths.  If you intend to do engineering in university, you'll meet calculus there again.</p>
              <p>Some material on AMaths are downloadable from <a href="http://ascklee.org/">http://ascklee.org/</a> (click on "My Stuff").  See if it helps.</p>
