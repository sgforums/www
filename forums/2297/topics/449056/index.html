However , i have no idea whether to go to a JC or poly. I also have no clue what subject combination i should take if i go to a JC. If i were to go poly, will it be extremely difficult to get into a university in sg? im currently in sec 4 studying triple science. any advice on the educational path i should take to be a vet or a child psychologist? </span></p></div>

              <p>If you go to a poly, you will have something to fall back on if you don't go uni.</p>
              <p>but sg uni only admits top 5%.</p>
              <p>if you really want to go poly, remember to plan to go to overseas uni.</p>
              <p>cos in the future, everyone will have uni degree.</p>
              <p>For JC, i think its a waste of time(personal option), like many people use it as a spring board to SG uni. Becos poly very hard to enter.</p>
              <p>my sis entered JC becos poly is expensive and she want go local uni.</p>
              <p>Again, its up to you</p>

              <p>From Ngee Ann Polytechnic site:</p>
              <p>http://www.np.edu.sg/hms/courses/cpee/Pages/default.aspx</p>
              <p>Get a BSc degree in just two years – CPEE graduates can take up a 
              customised BSc in Early Childhood Educational Studies and Leadership 
              programme from Wheelock College of Boston, right here at Ngee Ann. The 
              two-year programme includes a five-week immersion programme in Boston. 
              Singapore citizens enjoy subsidised tuition fees for this 
              programme. Various scholarships are also available.<strong><br></strong>You
               can receive up to one semester’s exemption for relevant degree 
              programmes at Nanyang Technological University and National University 
              of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I like my polytechnic experience, even though many people still have that "Poly is for poor L1R5" mentality, which isn't true as you can see from the peers who are in the same course as you. But the thing about Polytechnic is that unlike that 1 shot to determine your path, you have to consistently ensure you maintain your GPA to get a good shot in university admission.</p>
              <p>Polytechnic also have clubs and academic societies/competitions which you can participate, not only to furnish your credentials but also to add to your learning and experience.</p>
              <p>There's of course the whole balance between practical and theories, etc. But in the end, the decisions are based on yourself and your preferences. Going to open houses could help in making up your mind as well as discussion with both JC and Poly people.</p>

              <p>Hi, the previous answerers have some inaccuracies, but they are good answers.</p>
              <p>I think there is some vet science courses in some of the polys, but they are not training you to be a vet doctor, but a biological lab animal experimenter. There is no vet uni course in Singapore, I think. If you want to go overseas, it will  be very expensive, if it is in Australia. There may be an increased demand for vets in Singapore as young people are getting more affluent and more want to own pets. If you want to be a vet, you may go to JC and take bio and chem and some other subjects, or poly and take some bio related courses.</p>
              <p>To be a child psychologist, you may like to try the poly courses (psychology department). Then, you can go to a private uni in Singapore or NUS. Poly courses are very exciting and more practical. JC education is more theoretical and academic. Or, you can go to a JC and study either Science or Arts stream, then go to NUS or NTU. You need to check the poly, JC and uni websites.</p>
              <p>Can someone provide a clearer picture? I am not exactly updated on the courses in poly.</p>

              <p>to become a vet, the fastest way is to get your degree in Australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you need to understand that sg is small and certain courses pertaining to certain occupations are not available here.</p>
              <p>For example, marine biologist that cater to sharks..you will need a Phd  and these occupation is widely sought after in the asia pacific and S. Africa where sharks are prevalent. Try becoming a marine biologist in Singapore and you'll <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example...vet specialist in beef cattle practice (you want good quality beef and milk), sports medicine (you cater to stallions that participate in races that are worth millions of dollars) or even internal medicine (you might look at koi fish, persian cats and even the arowana where each could easily amount to a price of a small car)  are widely sought after but are they available in Singapore? Do you think there will ever be a course or market for them in the future?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
