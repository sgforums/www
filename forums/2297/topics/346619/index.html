              <p>A unwise, counterproductive, nonsensical ban that will cause more problems (eg. student rebelliousness) than prevent.<br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,191705,00.html">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,191705,00.html</a>?</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><br>HE LOOKS around carefully, his legs tensed and ready to run.</p>
              <p>The coast seems clear, and his friends nod their confirmation.</p>
              <p>He dashes into McDonald's, and emerges 10 minutes later, clutching takeaway bags in triumph.</p>
              <p>His friends cheer, and they move off swiftly, not looking back.</p>
              <p>The boy has just committed an offence.</p>
              <p>But it's not against the fast-food outlet - it's against his school.</p>
              <p>Coral Secondary School forbids any student in uniform from entering the nearby White Sands shopping mall in Pasir Ris, among other things.</p>
              <p>The rule, which was imposed several years ago, also forbids students in uniform from hanging out at the neighbouring housing estate.</p>
              <p>The boy told The New Paper: 'I'm not supposed to go to White Sands at all, unless I want to go to the library after school.</p>
              <p>'Even then, I can go only after I fill in a form and get it approved by the Discipline Mistress or Operations Manager.'</p>
              <p>And then he pointed to the school handbook, which has an extract from the school's rule book.</p>
              <p>It states that the school has banned its students in uniform from loitering anywhere after school.</p>
              <p>It expects the students to go home straight from school.</p>
              <p>Only library okay</p>
              <p>It wants them to 'stay away from White Sands Shopping Mall at all times except to visit the community library after school after seeking approval from HOD/Student Management, Operations Manager, Vice-Principal or Principal'.</p>
              <p>When asked to comment on the rule, principal Veronica Ng responded through Madam Kathleen Ch'ng, the head of the department of student management: 'Coral Secondary places much emphasis on inculcating in our students good habits like using time prudently.</p>
              <p>'As such, it is in their interest not to loiter in the malls after school.'</p>
              <p>But many students are not too pleased about this.</p>
              <p>Said one Sec 3 student: 'It's crazy. Some of us don't have lunch at home. We have to eat outside, but we're not allowed to eat at White Sands.</p>
              <p>'We're not even allowed to just go in there to buy food to take home with us.'</p>
              <p>A Sec 2 student said that even her teacher did not see the logic behind such a rule.</p>
              <p>Her classmate added: 'Other students get to hang out here after school. Why can't we?'</p>
              <p>The school is so serious about the rule that it assigns teachers to patrol the shopping mall and neighbouring areas after school.</p>
              <p>Offenders are sent for a two-hour detention.</p>
              <p>And sometimes even the innocent get caught.</p>
              <p>Said a Sec 2 student: 'One of my friends, who waits for her mother near the shopping mall after school every day, almost got a detention.</p>
              <p>'She was saved by a bunch of classmates who explained to the operations manager.'</p>
              <p>Some parents are also upset by this rule.</p>
              <p>Said the mother of a Sec 2 student: 'I was told that my daughter had to go home and change out of her uniform before she can buy lunch at White Sands.</p>
              <p>'So instead of buying lunch and going home, she has to go home to change, then go out to buy lunch and go home again.'</p>
              <p>Family lunch impossible</p>
              <p>A father was particularly riled that he couldn't even have lunch with his daughter in peace.</p>
              <p>'It's just stupid. The teachers don't seem to care that students may be with their parents. So I have to keep watching out for teachers, or my daughter may get caught.'</p>
              <p>But many students are resigned to the strict regulation.</p>
              <p>As another Sec 2 student put it: 'My mother tells me to just be careful and don't get caught.'</p>
              <p>One parent, whose son left the school three years ago, said: 'No choice lah, just tolerate for four years and be done with it.'</p>
              <p>Said a Sec 4 student: 'I don't really care any more. If I get caught again, I'll just go for detention again. It's no big deal.'</p>
              <p>Teachers are also posted to the housing estate near the school to prevent students from loitering there.</p>
              <p>A Sec 2 pupil said: 'After school hours, we can't go to the mini-mart in the HDB estate and it's just across the road.'</p>
              <p>It is understood that even students who simply walk through the estate can accosted by a patrolling teacher.</p>
              <p>This reporter saw a teacher stop a group of students there last Friday.</p>
              <p>According to a parent, the strict rules were imposed following complaints from residents in the area.</p>
              <p>Said the same parent: 'If noise is such a problem, then remove the playground. It's always noisier than the students.</p>
              <p>'In any case, teachers aren't supposed to be security guards. I don't think MOE pays them to guard void decks.'</p>
              <p>But not everyone opposes the strict rules.</p>
              <p>One Sec 2 student said: 'I agree with the school, that loitering can lead to trouble.'</p>
              <p>One parent admitted: 'Ultimately, parents and teachers are both concerned for the pupils. I may not like the ban, but it shows that the school's making an effort for its students.'</p>
