              <p>You will have a harder time grasping additional maths on top of the maths in JC. A maths at O levels is very very easy, because if you do your practice religiously, you'll realise the exam paper only consist of this this this, and this question. Easy peasy to score an A1 or A2. Getting an A1 or A2 is a very good advantage as it lowers your aggregate score for JC entry. Consider that.</p>
              <p>E maths is the one that requires you to think, A maths is just dead.</p>

              <p>Ok, i wanted to know what are the benefits of additonal maths because i think i have too many subject to take. i got mother tongue,english,a maths,e maths,principle of account , combine science and combine humanities.I am considering should i give up additonal maths and ask for refund for examination fees because i cannot handle 7 subject. i know that additonal is useful for engineer course but i do not wish to go to engineer. i know jc need additonal maths but i can't possibly get in jc anyway because i heard JC also can learn A maths. I am thinking should i am really not good with  e maths, so my A maths i find it hard because i do not have foundation for e maths. Actually i didn't study much about A maths too but i really is thinking should i just give up because too many subject and i do not have enough time. the refund date ends at 30 june for any subject. i need help urgently, i need to view some suggestions.</p>

              <p>7 subjects was like the minimum during my time, I was in express course. There were 2 classes in front of me taking 9 subjects.</p>
              <p>You must also take into account that if you do well for MT earlier in the year, you got 1 less at the end.</p>
              <p>For me, I did crap for my MT, and had to do it again. So I took 7 papers, and A maths was the easiest paper among all of them. Up to sec 3 my maths, E and A were just crap. Till I went for tution and found the secret to being good in it was to just practice sums over and over. For me, mastering maths now is just to recognise its pattern. And O level maths is just dead maths, you only get this this this or this.</p>

              <p>Why choose to take amaths and POA when you didnt study before? Do  you have tuition outside? I mean you cant possibly study all this yourself what, at least must have a teacher to teach you. Amaths is good, like ditzy said, I tell you, if you practise amaths everyday and do past years papers, you can see amaths quite okay one. During my secondary school years i felt that emaths more difficult than amaths.</p>
              <p>If you are a private candidate, did you take Olvl before? I mean like when you're in secondary school. Or you home schooling one?</p>
              <p>POA quite easy also.</p>
              <p>Or you can just pay the fees what, if you pay already but on that day you dont want go take exam also can right ?</p>
              <p>What course you decided to take after this examination ? Poly or JC ?</p>

                  There are people in this world who can get straight As for A levels at 12 yrs old. There are people who can score A for English(and other subjects) in their O levels by burning dictionary/thesaurus and then swallow it when all their life they only know how to speak chinese till they come to Singapore in their teens. But most of us do not fall into these categories.
                      
                  Every person has different learning capacities and perseverance. It is already June now and just a few months to O levels and you should be already clear on your directions and not still pondering on whether A Maths is important...
                      
                  We are not clear whether if you are having any private tutoring as you mentioned that you are taking O levels as private candidate. How long have you been studying for A Maths and POA as they are new to you.
                      
                  Its really critical for you to concerntrate on the minimum subjects for you to get to the course in poly or JC of your choice! You got to think practical now rather than usefulness of A Maths in the future unless you are thinking of going to Science class in JC.
                      
                  Due to the time constraint you are facing now, its important for you to concerntrate on subjects you are confident in rather than taking unnecessary risk. Unless you are receiving coaching for POA and A Maths now, plus you are confident in other subjects, you should not take this risk as the content of a O level subject is quite hard to stomach in 1 year if not less in your case?

                  says need a math, i use e math can already, statistic e maths more
                  relevant</p>
              <p>BUT CALCULUS YES!!!!!!, </p>
              <p>in fact, in H2 maths, almost all is A maths continued, only
                  statistics can be of emath stuff, so if no A math, you will get a
                  super hard time touching on differentiation, maclaurin expansion,
                  functions eg (For J1 lah)</p>
              <p>Hence, give up POA and go for A maths, is more important</p>

              <p>Advanced economics at university level requires some advanced mathematics for mathematical models in economics. And that includes calculus. No joke.</p>

              <p>I did not go beyond A Level Chemistry, but dollars to donuts say that advanced maths is still needed for that. Oh wait, I did take a couple of uni modules in this - you need some heavy-duty differential equations in some cases.</p>

              <p>can see u dun like maths at all....but u must know maths if u want to have a degree..even a business degree would stress on statistics....which is quite fun and simple...with those regressions and sophisticated graphs that would make u look "smart"....</p>
              <p>dun force yourself to go intensely into maths if u have distaste for it...in fact, math concepts are all interrelated ..u can't proceed with a missing link..</p>

              <p>Hi yami king, i think i remb u posted before. i m actually quite shocked that u hav yet found out wad u actually want.<br><br>i think the best way to ur qn to which to drop POA or Amaths is that u need to know where u wana go. poly or JC.<br><br>If poly --&gt; what course? Does the course need amaths or POA?<br>if JC --&gt; science or arts?<br><br>u said, "i got mother tongue,english,a maths,e maths,principle of account , combine science and combine humanities"</p>
              <p>My opinion is Amaths will give u more benefit compared to POA unless u intent to go for courses like accounting or banking.</p>
              <p>Good luck. =)</p>
