              <p>There are a few thousand pte schools in singapore. Most of them(at least 90%) are small unknown schools which singaporeans do not go to study. Singaporeans goes to the local polytechnics and universities to study, even if they go pte school it will be those reputable ones like SIM, MDIS etc.</p>
              <p>So these pte schools have to recruit foreign students in order for them to have business.</p>
              <p>The govt recently introduced edutrust scheme for all pte schools in singapore. For pte schools who wish to recruit foreign students they must get this edutrust or else they can only recruit local students.</p>
              <p>So far, only less than 100 pte schools got this edutrust. Many of the rest of pte schools failed to make it for edutrust.</p>
              <p>Do you think we will see many of these pte schools close down?</p>
              <p>I think there are alot of pte schools now who are serving their current batch of students and once they have graduated, the schools will close down liao..</p>

              <p>Many schools that did not get their edutrust status at the first round are getting their edutrust status in these few months. Only those schools who cannot get their edutrust status from CPE at the end of these few months will close down gradually.</p>
              <p>However, those schools who did not get the Edutrust status might not close down as these schools will focus instead of taking in local students, going into the tuition classes and/or going into the conduct of enrichment and motivation classes / camps /seminars.</p>

              <p>Pte school will reduced.</p>
              <p>But to have pte school is good as working adults who want to upgrade can sign up with them.</p>
              <p>Or those who are unable to get into night poly or sim, they can appy pte school to study too.</p>

              <p>At the latest count, there are 216 schools with ERF status awarded by CPE but</p>
              <p>many schools are only given one year validity period.</p>
              <p>Many of these ERF schools have not been granted the Edutrust status by CPE.</p>
              <p>Even those schools that are granted Edutrust status are only valid for one year.</p>

              <p><br>As the Physics.Com.Sg guy aka Richest-Tutor-In-Sg once said, the tuition industry is actually already self-regulatory in the sense that students abandon tutors who don't produce results, and flock to tutors who produce results. This criteria matters more to students than whether the tutor is "MOE-certified" or not. Hence, any further action on the part of MOE or CPE is unwarranted.</p>
              <p>Note however, that private schools (that award diplomas and degrees, and/or offer tie-ups with foreign universities) and tuition centers (that serve only to support students learning, without awarding diplomas or degrees) are two completely different categories. The former must compulsorily be closely regulated by the government (because it directly impacts on the reputation of Singapore's private education industry, of which the government has both a direct and indirect stake), while the latter does not interest the government at all and (MOE has already stated that it) is a private/personal matter of caveat emptor (ie. buyer beware).</p>
