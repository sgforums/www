              <p>Firstly i like the way you post your qn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) i think it is theory that the light is caused by resistance. I may be wrong. btw, tungsten material is used as filament because it is hard to melt even with high temp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)it takes  1/50 sec from one dot to another. So 21 dots means 20 spaces and thus 2/5 sec.</p>
              <p>speed = 0.2m/ (2/5)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3)no. For water it is special. The volume actually increases when it turns from liquid to solid, contrary to the particle theory. Pros: i am curious to know why.</p>

              <p>1. Resistance R = pl/A</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since lamp X has a shorter filament length, l is lower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lamp X also has a thicker filament, hence A is larger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, when l decreases, and A increases, R is smaller for X.</p>

              <p>david your concept is wrong, you don't count by the
              <strong>spaces</strong>, you <strong>start counting the first dot
              as 0</strong>.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>actually it's the same if you count the spaces in between and counting the first dot as zero</p>

                                      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you place 100cm³ of liquid

              <p>No. It will be larger.</p>
              <p>Simple proof: Think about density of ice. The number of molecules of the water that freezes should remain the same, hence the mass of the ice cube is the same as the mass of the water being frozen.</p>
              <p>Since ice has a lower density, hence it's volume must be higher.</p>

              <p>fact: water that is frozen into ice has bigger volume.</p>
              <p>proof: observe when you take ice cube from your ice tray next time.</p>
