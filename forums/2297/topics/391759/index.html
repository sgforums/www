              <p>Is the reason behind your average day ending very late because of your CCA? If so maybe can consider changing CCAs (to some other less time-consuming CCAs?). Otherwise you can transfer but i wouldn't recommend so, since you have got to make new friends, and also you may have to play catch-up in terms of lessons ...</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  First of all, you have described the symptoms of a problem. Look deeper and see if you can arrive at the root cause of the problem. As for the transfer, speak to your teacher or school admin staff member?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Although everyone is different, let me share my story in JC. Perhaps my J1 wasn't as filled up as you, but by the time I was J2, I'm pretty sure the immense stress I had was incomparable.</p>
              <p>In J1, I had 4 CCAs that time. In J2, I had to drop 1, and still have 3 CCAs. In addition to SYF, Maths Competition and Chess compeititon, I was in the national training team for Physics Olympiad. Not only that, during those days of S papers, I had extra lessons for both Physics S and Maths S. It wasn't uncommon for me to reach home past 9~10 pm everyday. Those were the days where my JC was a Buona Vista and I too stayed at Hougang. You can imagine the time I took back and forth school. I even had to tell my econs teacher I simply don't have the time to do her essay homework, and requested for an extension of a few months. Fortunately, she was understanding and allowed that.</p>
              <p>Coupled on to that, going from a "monk" school to a mixed school, I had girl problems as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>Looking back, I have to say that it was the best training of my life, that is, to handle the extreme stress with limited time. Stress management, time management skills were taxed to the max. And on hindsight, I have to say it serves me very well now.</p>
              <p>Sure, it is a big transition from secondary school to fast paced stressful JC life, but you have to learn to adapt, learn to manage it, learn to take it as it comes. That's what separates the wildly successful from the rest. I do know how stressful it is in JCs nowadays, but trust me, it wasn't any better in the past as well. So many people have been there, done it. You will be able to do it as well.</p>
              <p>It's only a short two years. Look and focus on the final goal: at the end of two years, you get a cert from TJC on top of your A level cert. And when you finally get your certs and As after all your hard work, isn't the success all the sweeter?</p>

              <p>Hi uber_troubled, </p>
              <p>I will strongly suggest that you take up another CCA instead, unless you really have a lot of passion for your current CCA. If you choose to remain in your current CCA, you will have to be ready to bear with the stress for at least the next one year.</p>
              <p>As a side note, in stark contrast to eagle's life in JC, I did not take up any CCA at all, and focus fully on studying. Unlike him, I prefer to put maximum effort into my studies, as I know that I am not someone who is very good at juggling studies with other things. </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Although everyone is different, let me share my story in JC.
              Perhaps my J1 wasn't as filled up as you, but by the time I was J2,
              I'm pretty sure the immense stress I had was incomparable.</p>
              <p>In J1, I had 4 CCAs that time. In J2, I had to drop 1, and still
              have 3 CCAs. In addition to SYF, Maths Competition and Chess
              compeititon, I was in the national training team for Physics
              Olympiad. Not only that, during those days of S papers, I had extra
              lessons for both Physics S and Maths S. It wasn't uncommon for me
              to reach home past 9~10 pm everyday. Those were the days where my
              JC was a Buona Vista and I too stayed at Hougang. You can imagine
              the time I took back and forth school. I even had to tell my econs
              teacher I simply don't have the time to do her essay homework, and
              requested for an extension of a few months. Fortunately, she was
              understanding and allowed that.</p>
              <p>Coupled on to that, going from a "monk" school to a mixed
              school, I had girl problems as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></p>
              <p>Looking back, I have to say that it was the best training of my
              life, that is, to handle the extreme stress with limited time.
              Stress management, time management skills were taxed to the max.
              And on hindsight, I have to say it serves me very well now.</p>
              <p>Sure, it is a big transition from secondary school to fast paced
              stressful JC life, but you have to learn to adapt, learn to manage
              it, learn to take it as it comes. That's what separates the wildly
              successful from the rest. I do know how stressful it is in JCs
              nowadays, but trust me, it wasn't any better in the past as well.
              So many people have been there, done it. You will be able to do it
              as well.</p>
              <p>It's only a short two years. Look and focus on the final goal:
              at the end of two years, you get a cert from TJC on top of your A
              level cert. And when you finally get your certs and As after all
              your hard work, isn't the success all the sweeter?</p>

              <p>I am sorry but I will prefer not to reveal about that.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it is unfair to compare myself to eagle and vice-versa, since the two of us were from different faculties. </p>

              <p>Just be sure that you do not allow your CCA to get in the way of your studies.</p>
              <p>If it does, and the status quo will remain such that your CCA takes up too much of your time and gets in the way of your studies, then you should just drop your CCA for a more relaxed one.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, studies &gt; CCA. Remember that.</p>

              in tjc, jc1, and is feeling very very stressed(already). Well the
              reason is that my average day ends at 9pm, and im like in hougang,
              which is like 1hr away from tjc. After that, i still have to go hme
              and do my homework, and wake up at 5am the next day. All this are
              starting to put the pressure on me, and its only the first few
              weeks of school! Not to mention that pw has yet to start. What i
              was thinking is maybe transer to sajc, or does anybody have tips on
              how to deal with this.</p>
