              MOE Teacher : As long as you have the passion to teach and enjoy reaching out to and helping students (from all strata of society), you should definitely give teaching a shot. It's a highly interactive career experience no other industry can match. Having said that, it doesn't mean you have to stay in teaching forever (this would be up to you, you can decide for yourself when the time comes, and you'll know when the time comes). I never regretted joining MOE, just as I never regretted leaving MOE after teaching for 6 years.
                  
              <br><br>To address your query specifically : whether it's stressful depends on whether you bother with politics (at multiple levels). Whether promotion prospects are good, also depends on the same previous point.

              <p>For being a life science researcher, you need to have at least a Masters of Science and preferably a PhD. There will be many setbacks in the experiments that one carries out so one has to be resilient.</p>
              <p>Landscape Designer: There is a course offered by CET (continuing education and training) and WDA on horticulture and landscape design. For landscape designer, one has to be artistic and it deals a little with integrating with the architecture and the gardens. This job is not measured by the degrees one has, but by the artistic and aesthetic talents that one has. To get a degree in this, one may have to go overseas.</p>
              <p>Horticulture: at Gardens by the Bay, I see some male supervisors overseeing the migrant workers tending to the plants. Or one may be a horticulturist and study till PhD in plant anatomy and physiology and be a consultant in NPB (National Parks Board).</p>
              <p>You need to check with more professionals, as I am not in these professions so I can only give you some vague ideas.</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p>Every job carries with it stresses and strains at some point or other.</p>
              <p>Promotion rates depend on many factors - public/private sector, openings availability, business needs, value you bring, etc.</p>
              <p>At the start of your career, it's hard to see how things will pan out in 10, 5 or even 2 years' time. As you start out in the working world, subscribe to the philosophy "work to learn". Once you've gained competency, then start getting more concerned about "work to earn". </p>
