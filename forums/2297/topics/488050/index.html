              <p>Hi, everyone of us must at least complete the two compulsory education 
              academic, Primary and Secondary School. I suppose that after Secondary 
              School, everyone of us have the optional choice to do what we want such 
              as some of us would have further study to study either ITE, Poly, JC, 
              Private School or anything depending on the Secondary School Academic 
              performance. I am one of the person who was in Normal Technical Stream 
              and I am only able to apply for ITE courses.<br> <br> Well, during my primary school years, in my days of the 90s, there was 
              this EM1, EM2 and EM3 stream classes. Unfortunately, I got into EM3 
              stream after my Primary 4 streaming examination. I have hard times with 
              my peers in my EM3 class such that most of the students were hooligans, 
              gangsterism, stereotypes, ignorant, childish and so on. I often got made
               fun of during my school days for being "different" from them. I want to
               study hard and these people kept on making fun of me. I did not have 
              any friends in my primary school because of my academic performances and
               the class I am in.<br> <br> The education subjects in our EM3 classes were very easy such as primary
               1 to 2's standard. We did not even learn algebra in our Mathematics 
              class. Our English spelling are too easy such as primary 1 to 3 standard
               with words like Family, Friends, Teachers, Schools etc. Other streams 
              like EM1 and EM2 had already learn basic Algebra after their Primary 
              School Leaving Examination (PSLE). We studied only four examination 
              subjects, English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue. When I was 
              taking my PSLE examinations, most of the questions were very different 
              from what we have done in our  classes and I did not score very well for
               my PSLE examination.<br> <br> In Secondary School, I eventually got into Normal Technical class. Most 
              of my classmates were worst than in my primary school, almost everyone 
              was a gangster, immature and so on. They don't like studying, often fool
               around in class and make fun and disturb those who wants to study. I am
               one of them who often got made fun of. The subjects that I am studying 
              were English, Mathematics, Science, Computer Application, Home Economics
               (Now it is call Food and Consumer), Design and Technology, Arts, Musics
               and Social Studies. I am quite good at Food and Consumer and even 
              better in Computer Application subjects. When I was in upper secondary 
              school, there is a new subject, Administrative Skills. Home Economics 
              subject was unavailable for upper secondary school in our times, year 
              2001 to 2002.<br> <br> I wasn't in a very good term with my peers and classmates in class as 
              most of my classmates were gangster and I do not have any topic to talk 
              to them. When I was in Secondary School and even Primary School, my 
              parents doesn't allow me to go out after school and also doesn't allow 
              me to spend money such as buying handphone, video games, watching movie 
              and concert with friends, buying popular branded stuff and so on. I have
               heard some of these gangster talking about stuff like video games that I
               enjoy watching people playing when I was a kid, but did not had any 
              chance to play it. Even though they were gangster, at least if my 
              parents allow me to buy console game to play, I can at least show off my
               video game skills to my classmates and if they like watching me to 
              play, they might recognized my existence and treated me as their video 
              game buddy.<br> <br> I am not sure if anyone have at least seen someone in your class, whose 
              parent are very overprotective their child such as doesn't allow them to
               go out with friends, doesn't allow them to buy branded popular stuff, 
              doesn't allow them to have any entertainment but to study? Do you think 
              you want to interact with such so-called "boring" person? Majorities of 
              the classmates doesn't want to interact with this kind, they kept on 
              saying "boring leh" in front of that person especially when doing 
              groupwork with him. <br> <br> Well, even when I am in Secondary School, I did not thought of working 
              part time job during school holidays because they don't teach this in 
              school like teaching students if during holidays, they can work part 
              time job and guide these students how to find job, where to find job and
               so on. I am not sure whether is this common sense or maybe the teacher 
              might afraid that students might not complete their homework given to 
              them during school holidays? I am sure that those who are sociable in 
              class, they have friends and they can introduce part time job to their 
              friends so that they can work together during school holidays. This 
              gives major disadvantages to those who are not social in class.<br> <br> There were several group works in some of our school subjects and many 
              people doesn't want to cooperate with me as they kept on making a face 
              and being quiet. The teachers can't help it. Without any choice, I did 
              everything alone and pass it up to my teacher, and I remembered that it 
              was a social studies project. Some of them just talk and discuss among 
              themselves and ignored me. So what is team work and group work, I don't 
              know and I find those are a burden to me since my classmates have 
              already show me the don't welcome me attitude. <br> <br> After I graduated from Secondary School, the only further education 
              study I could choose was ITE. I choose ITE Information Communication 
              because I am pretty good in computing as I scored the highest in my 
              subject and got interest in it after I have studied the subject during 
              my Secondary School Years. <br> <br> In my ITE years, same old things apply to my interaction with my 
              classmates, just like in Secondary School, but most of my classmates 
              weren't hooligans, gangster, stereotypes etc kinds. They were those like
               want to study but once they found out that Information Communication 
              Technology wasn't their liking, they started to fool around, creating 
              nuisances, playing around and so on.<br> <br> There were plenty of group works when I was studying at ITE and many 
              people avoided working with me because I don't communicate with them 
              which was the same like I was in Secondary School. I wanted to try 
              making friends with them but I lost my social skills and I do not know 
              where to start. My classmates thought I am a weirdo and avoid 
              interacting with me. <br> <br> There were some modules like Communication Skills, Personal 
              Effectiveness, Interperson skills, Group Effectiveness and so one which I
               am having difficulties in those modules. Classmates were playing 
              around, fooling around and skipping classes during these modules as they
               thought they know interperson skills, communication skills, group 
              effectiveness etc very well. My parent even saying me like "Study 
              computing is useless, everyone knows computer" and I eventually gave up 
              computing and "blindly" graduated from it. <br> <br> I went to NS after I graduated from ITE and served NS as Admin. My 
              performance was horrible. This was due to slow performance, unsure of 
              what job role I am doing such as I don't know the logic of which email 
              to send to who, not interacting with others, different from others etc. I
               often got confinements and my chief supervisor kept on glaring at me. I
               can't even take down a simple  telephone message and even long 
              telephone message. In my administration subject back in my secondary 
              school, everything is theory, no practical except for typing skills. 
              School did not teach student how to answer and take down long and 
              tedious telephone messages as there are no practical class for that. <br> <br> After my ORD, I went to buy some self motivational books to improve 
              myself such as Improving your attitude (where some staffs in my admin 
              complaint about my attitude), how to make friends, how to improve on 
              your memory and so on. After I have "waste" my time reading all these 
              books and apply them to a new school and try communicating with my 
              classmate, it is useless. My classmates still treated me like some 
              invisible guy and act dumb when I am having groupwork with them. <br> <br> I went to study other subjects starting from Secondary 3 Normal Academic
               as Private Candidate to look for other interest instead. I managed to 
              learn something new such as for Science, there are Physics and 
              Chemistry, especially chemistry and doing laboratory works which is 
              ironically, my first time, Additional Mathematics, Principle of Account,
               Pure Physics and Pure Chemistry. I did well for Principle of Account 
              but I failed my Pure Physics, Pure Chemistry, Additional Mathematics and
               Science for "O" Level. I don't find any interest in Principle of 
              Account even though I did well for it. <br> <br> Unfortunately, I decided not to continue to study due to my age and the 
              most important is I do not have any job experience. I did not know how 
              to start finding jobs and these wasn't even taught in schools, even in 
              those "compulsory" schools like Secondary School. I went to look for job
               coach, with the help of using forum and they guided me to look for job 
              in some job websites and newspaper, and even taught me how I should talk
               and speak during interview. These wasn't even taught in any of the 
              schools that I have attended, nothing at all.<br> <br> Eventually, I found a job as a packer through an recruit agency from 
              street job website. In the contract, there are many things I do not know
               such as leaves, phrases like one week pior notice and so on. The agent 
              did not even bother to explain properly to me. When I was doing halfway 
              through, people were pissed of me because I was doing very slow. When I 
              do fast, I did almost everything wrongly such as miscounting items, 
              tagging the price tag wrongly on most items and so on. When I do it 
              slowly, everything was done correctly. I can't like do fast and do 
              everything correctly at the same time. <br> <br> When I was studying in school, my teacher asked me to complete my 
              homework on time. I have plenty of time to finished it, even though 
              there are lots of them, I could do it and managed to finish it. There 
              were some mistakes in some of the questions I have done, so my teacher 
              just marked it, put a tick for correct answers and put a cross for wrong
               answers. My teachers explained to me my mistakes like for Mathematics, I
               solved some questions wrongly and he explained where I solved wrongly. 
              Next when the same kind of questions appeared again, I managed to solved
               it correctly. I don't find this sort of theory apply to job at all. Job
               is everything must be done correctly, even if you do it wrongly, you 
              have to learn from it immediately otherwise, you might get dismissed. 
              They are like not writing on a piece of paper how on to pack things, 
              which items should be packed in which way and so on. Those like when 
              they explain verbally, everything must go into my brain cells. In 
              school, I can take my time to learn from it slowly from my days. So, it 
              is way different.<br> <br> When I was at my work place, I saw those kids who are younger than me by
               twelve and is temporary taking this packer job as some of them are 
              waiting for their school to start and some of them are waiting for their
               NS, managed to do everything well. Most of them doesn't have any work 
              experience and this is their first job, they can do very well. Even 
              those hooligan, gangsters with tattoos on their arm and legs can do the 
              job properly, fast, quick and correctly done. I wonder where do they get
               this power from? From friends that motivate them or maybe they are fast
               learner? Speaking about Fast learner, believe it or not, I am a slow 
              learner where often I need to be repeatedly ask the same thing from my 
              colleagues until they got fed-up with me, and I need frequent 
              surveillance from my senior if I have done my job correctly as compare 
              to other people. This is just the same like when I was working as admin 
              in NS. <br> <br> When I was looking at some job websites and newspaper, most of the job 
              requirements need to interact with people, being a team player and need 
              to have strong communication skills and those aren't even taught in 
              those compulsory school. It gave disadvantages for those who graduated 
              from Secondary School who doesn't want to continue to further study 
              especially those who aren't social. <br> <br> Anyway, I am not criticizing about any education system, just I feel 
              that there are something important that must be taught and is not taught
               when I am attending schools. There are some of my classmates who quit 
              school during Secondary School and I am not sure if they are wised to 
              quit school or do I feel admired of them that they quit school? <br> <br> So does anyone has any thought or view about these? Care to share your view?</p>

              <p>It story's time! :</p>
              <p>Once there was a man who did not make it to university. So, his mother got him a wife. After the marriage, he worked as a teacher in a primary school. Due to the lack of experience, he was squashed by the students in less than a week.</p>
              <p>When he returned home, his wife dried his tears. She comforted him with these words. 'When one is too full, he could either pour it out what's in him or he just could not pour it out at all. You should not be too sad about it. Probably there is a more suitable job waiting for you out there.'</p>
              <p>Later on, he found another job and not for so long, he was fired due to his slowness. This time, the wife commented. 'There are always people who are skilful and non skilful. Some have experience from their years of work. As for you, you were in school all this while. So, how could you acquire these needed skills?'</p>
              <p>He went for a number of jobs but never stayed long in those jobs. Each time, he would return home with a dejected spirit. His wife would always comfort him and never for once, she was disappointed or resentful.</p>
              <p>He was in his thirties when he aquired a flair in languages. He became a counselor in a school for the deaf and mute. Later on, he opened a school for the disabled. A few years later, he set up chain stores in different cities and provinces selling apparatus &amp; equipment for the disabled. He became a multi-millionaire.</p>
              <p>One day he asked his wife. 'When I was looking bleak at my own future, what's the reason that you have so much faith in me?'</p>
              <p>His wife gave him a very simple reply. She said, 'When a piece of land is not suitable for planting wheat, we could try planting beans. If the beans are not growing well, we could try planting fruits or gourds. If the vegetation is not economical, we can instead scatter buckwheat seeds. These seeds will one day bloom into flowers. On this land itself, there will be one seed that will germinate and grow.'</p>
              <p>After having listened to the wife's explanation, he cried. His wife's faith, love, patience, and persistence in him is liken to the one seed in the land. This is the seed that persists and creates the miracle on this piece of land.</p>
              <p>"In this world, there's no one person who is useless. It is just that they have not positioned themselves firmly in right place"</p>

              were hooligans, gangsterism, stereotypes, ignorant, childish and so
              on"<br><br>"almost
              everyone in Normal Technical was a gangster, immature and so on. They don't like
              studying, often fool around in class"<br><br>"They
              were those like want to study but once they found out that
              Information Communication Technology wasn't their liking, they
              started to fool around, creating nuisances, playing around and so
              on."<br><br>MoE divides the students according to their academical results, in PSLE, O's.<br>There are always more ah-beng, ah-lian, smokers, skip-lesson, tattoo, piercing in lower academical performing classes than those better classes.<br>This has always been the case. There are cases whereby "miracles" happen. Student in EM3 climbs to EM1, Student in NT climbs to Express. But the rate is like 0.01%<br><br>However as a tutor, no matter what grade you are in, you are my beloved students. I will try my best to help you in your studies or other areas so u can have a better career in the future.<br>The key is to never give up on students.<br>If they can tell me "Yes! I want to be better at studies" and put in considerable effort, I will assure them that they will indeed do well. <br>For students who are playful and not interested in studies, i will have to advise them, encourage them, motivate them, change their mindset from "i can't do it" to "I will try my best to make a difference".<br>Mindset is very important. Else 100% input, 90% output, only 10% absorbed.</p>
