              <p>Hey bro, in 2013 'O' levels i scored</p>
              <p>English - B3</p>
              <p>Combined Humans - B3</p>
              <p>Chinese - A2</p>
              <p>Food and Nutrition - B3</p>
              <p>Combined Science - D7</p>
              <p>Maths - D7 (2013) C6 (2014)</p>
              <p>I cant even get into any engineering courses/business courses in 2013.. I retook my maths and got a C6. Polys are very realistic. Get a C6 for Maths or dont even think of getting into any engineering/science/business courses except design courses.. Because i wanted to enter business courses so badly, i retook my O levels maths and studied at home myself. </p>
              <p><strong>You can try RP</strong> thou.. <strong>I have a friend that scored both D7s for Maths And English and scored 24points for COP but he was offered business informatics in RP. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>You can choose to retake your maths and wait for a year before entering poly.. it would be a good choice but very risky route (That was the route i took last year so i know exactly how you feel) Dejected, stressed. However, after a year of struggles, i have finally gasped a sigh of relief. </strong>Right now i have already applied for TP and NYP business courses. I was previously from a design course in NYP and i have no interest in the course so i withdrawn from the course because i wasnt allowed to transfer/ appeal. </p>
              <p>If you get E8 for English and C6 for maths, you are eligible for engineering courses.</p>
              <p>Once you pass ur maths u can go to any courses in NYP,TP or RP provided ur cop is below 16.</p>
              <p>You can also try for ITE courses. ITE is really advanced now, you would have many choices also.</p>

              <p>Yes. You have to call them up to request for deferment for one year, but you must apply for a private school as a private candidate so that you can defer. They dont allow you to retake O levels yourself.. They would ask you to go to NS first then retake O levels if you are intending to be independent to study on your own. The maximum age of deferment is 21.</p>
              <p><strong>A private school would be very expensive and if im not wrong it would cost $3000 for 3 core subjects (English, Maths and Science). For additional subjects it would be an additional $150 each?(Provided if you have taken the 3 core subjects) (As checked on PencilTutor's Website) This is the option if you have only failed lesser than 2 subjects. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>It would cost you up to $9000 - $10000 if you failed more than 2 subjects and intending to retake the whole O levels for year 2015.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi bro, i dont think so. The only thing you can do is to request for financial assistance from the private schools that offer O levels for private candidates and pay in installments. This way you can work part-time while studying. Im sorry bro but i cant be much of help. The other option is to try ITE and study hard for the next 2 years and apply for a polytechnic through higher Nitec. </p>
              <p>Taking private 'O's are very costly and therefore schools would push their students to pass their O levels at 1 take. Dont worry because this is not the end. </p>

              <p>When you collect your result slip, you will be given a piece of paper called 2015 Joint Admission Exercise(JAE).  You have the PIN number given in the paper to do your selection online.</p>
              <p>That paper also gives you all the courses in all the Polys that you are eligible for.  The more alphabets and numbers you see on that paper (subject codes), the better.</p>
              <p>If there is nothing, it means you are not eligible for any course in Poly.</p>
              <p>Do note that it is only eligibility.  Whether you eventually get into the course of your choice depends on the cop. And cop is dependent on course vacancy, number of applicants and their grades.</p>

              <p>The cop for local Unis vary depending on many factors.  The local Unis (NUS, NTU and SMU) have the latest cops listed on their websites.</p>
              <p>Generally, you need to score a GPA of 3.75 and above (for SMU) and 3.85 and above (for NTU and NUS) in order to even stand a chance.  That means you have to be a straight As student in Poly for all the 3 years.</p>
              <p>Do note that in Poly, the business courses are very competitive i.e. those who can study type will enrol in these courses. Some have a raw score of 5 pts (ELR2B2).  The cop for NP International Business course last year was 6.</p>
              <p>So you need to score high marks to get an A in the Poly exams as the bell curve gravitates towards the higher marks.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, I recently got back my O level results and things
              didn't quite turned out the way I expected. Got raw of 14pts and
              net of 10pts after deduction for CCA and HCL. I had initially hoped
              to get into ACJC Sci stream but the COP is 6pts and so it seems
              terribly out of my reach. I thought about appealing in through CCA
              but I'm not sure which are the few CCAs which the school is looking
              out for. I have some drama/public speaking experiences but I've
              never competed in any competitions nor was part of an official
              drama club. I'd like to know if I stand a chance at getting in
              through a CCA appeal (certain sport or performing arts) as I really
              love the school life balance in AC. I'm willing to put in the
              effort to get better results too. </p>
              <p>Ive also shortlisted certain JCs that I'm interested and might
              be eligible for and Id like to know your opinions on them. SAJC,

              <p>Hello AC does indeed accept ppl who did not meet the COP (as long as you scored below 20) via CCA appeal. This is how the schools grab top-CCA-performers to their schools and up their CCA excellences. The truth in JC is that most top athletes/performers do not do well in JC academically becos they get in via DSA or appeal (mostly), while most top academic-performers have a CCA which does not require much talent/skills or that they are not the top athletes there. And my friend, this is how the schools (not just AC) tell the public that they excel in both academic and Sports and performing arts and is a centre of excellences. Yes there are indeed some who are of national athlete standard and does incredibly well in academics, but these are a very small minority, and they are the ones who will get all the awards and scholarship and stuff. </p>
              <p>Anyway I think I went off topic lol.</p>
              <p>Ok the school will only accept CCA-appeal only if you are from that CCA in secondary school, and of cos of above average standards. AC accept appeals from various CCAs such as waterpolo/swimming/hockey and some performing arts. They have limited slots in accepting appeals (i tink less than 50 successful appeals per year). So you have to be very good in that area of expertise to have a chance to get in via CCA appeal.</p>
              <p>In CCAs where they are in shortage of ppl and are desperately trying to recruit good athletes/performers into the CCA so that they would be able to achieve that A Div gold medal, ah thats where you will find success. If you have seniors in that CCAs and are trying to appeal via that CCA, your chances will be much higher if you get the senior to recommend you to the CCA teacher-in-charge. </p>
              <p>If you are trying to appeal via CCA, DO NOT attempt to appeal via a CCA you have no prior experience in. Else its a 0% chance. For drama and stuff, AC has ACSian Theatre as a CCA (smth like drama club, but include some dancing, acting and stuff). They also offer Drama Elective Programme. Its sort of like a package you know. If you are in the DEP, I tink u are automatically inside the drama CCA. </p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can pull strings and get into the school. For example, if you know the board of directors (or your parents know), or you donate handsomely to the school. I personally know of a few friends whose parents pull the strings and they appealed into HC successfully after they failed JAE LOL.</p>
              <p>Ok anyway good luck to you!</p>

              <p>You could try the GE programme - <a href="https://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/pts.se.gep">https://www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/pts.se.gep</a></p>
              <p>It's the cheapest since it's only $72 per subject. However, I don't think there's deferment for NS since it's mainly a part-time course (night classes on weekdays and day classes on weekends) for working adults so you might have to study elsewhere during daytime to get your deferment. </p>
              <p>Classes for the following subjects are available via the GE programme:</p>
              <p>English, Math, Additional Math, Science (Phy/Chem), Science (Bio/Chem), Science (Phy/Bio), Chinese, Malay, Tamil, Principles of Accounts, Literature, Geography, History, Combined Humanities (History/Social Studies) and Art.</p>
              <p>(They pretty much have most subjects except Pure Science)</p>
              <p>The classes are held in ITE College Central and some secondary schools.</p>

              <p>Hi guys I'd just finished my A lvl and I would like to give you some insights and tips for JC life. You may find it useful. Theres no A1 A2 B3 B4 in JC, but just A, B, C , D, E , S and U.</p>
              <p>I am from a JC whose COP is below 8.</p>
              <p>Now when you enter JC, you will meet all sorts of ppl. This is the time where u will truly see the outside world for the first time. There are ppl of bad influences, of good influences, the selfish one, the selfless one, the enthu one, the smart one and stuff. So accept the differences, and choose your company wisely.</p>
              <p>If you want to score well for the tests and ultimately A lvl, CONSISTENCY is the key. Gone are the days when you can get that A1 in chemistry even though u only studied 3 months prior to O lvl. Unlike the Ordinary Lvl, you are now facing Advance lvl. Do not think that your life will be easier just becos you are taking less subject (i.e no SS, no elec geog, no chinese etc). Becos the H2 subjects u are taking are going to be of very chim stuff, more deeper than your O lvl.</p>
              <p>In O lvl, lots of stuff u are learning are actually "fake", and that is why when u try to google your O lvl electron configuration of Chlorine, it pops up strange stuff. But in A lvl, you are learning SIMPLIFIED version of the REAL stuff. That is why when u google ur A lvl questions and concepts, answers will pop out.</p>
              <p>The H2 subjects like Physics Chem Bio and Math are of great depth. Most require understanding rather than memorising, because most questions are application qns anyway. Try to understand what you are learning first, before u memorise them. For subjects like Physics Chem Bio math, they are ADDITION to what you have already learnt in O lvl. In other words, they teach you more methods of differentiation and integration; they throw more Organic Compounds formula for you rather than the 4 you learnt in O lvl; they throw more complex qns of F=ma. Most are additions to what you have already learnt in O lvl, while some are totally new stuff u'll learn. </p>
              <p>In JC, I recommend you to prioritise whatever you do. Time is very short. Despite only taking 4 subjects (lets exclude GP and PW and CL), YOU HARDLY CAN TOTALLY understand all 4 subjects that are taught at any point in time. That is to say, you'll find yourself lagging behind in some subjects. So prioritise what is imporant. If need be, forget about burning midnight oil just to complete ur hw. Sleep is more important. Make sure u get at least 6 hrs of sleep everyday, and concentrate in class to know whats going on. I rather you not do the homework, but understand what the teacher is saying when they go through in class. For your information, I have not done a single Econs HW in my entire J1, simply becos Econs is just writing essay, and I write the essay in my mind instead, and I understand them fully when the teacher teaches in class. I ended up with 99percentile at the end of J1, and by not doing econs HW, i have time for other hw like math.</p>
              <p>Most ppl will tell u they have less than 6hrs of sleep everyday. But by prioritising, it is possible to get 7hrs of sleep everyday. Something is wrong with u if u can get more than 8hrs of sleep, becos the hardtruth is those time should be spend studying LOL.</p>
              <p>Learn how to say NO occasionally when ur friend ask u to stay back after school to gossip. Learn how to say NO occasionally when your friends ask you to play soccer after school. Becos those time are precious to you in either keeping up with ur academics, or gaining rest, or engaging in your personal activities. And your CCA is gonna drain up lots of your time away, especially if u are in sports. (Theres a reason why most top sports athletes who DSA into top schools ended up undergoing 3 years programme).</p>
              <p>JC IS LIKE O LVL EVERYDAY, unlike in Sec 4 where O lvl pressure is only felt at the few months prior. Start your revision at J1 if u wanna lighten ur workload in J2s, else u'll break down in J2 (provided ur target is straight As for A lvl lah). </p>
              <p>Math is gonna be more chim. But good news is those JCs questions on Math are ABOVE A lvl H2 Math qn standard. AJC has a particular reputation for setting out-of-the-world impossible to solve Math QN. So just skip AJ qn when u are revising LOL anyway they will not come out in A lvl too. A lvl H2 Math qn is way way easier than those u did in school (maybe ang moh math lousier you know). And the distinction rate for H2 Math is about 50% nationally each year. But that being said, know how to solve your school math qns first before u attempt the easier A lvl TYS lah.</p>
              <p>For Physics, A lvl Physics qns are also way easier than the school's standard. A lvl Physics only test you some basic application of formulas and understanding, but the school will set qns that require much more mathematical treatment and further thinking. Physics is alot more mathematics than O lvl. You may need to differentiate too. So do not be too discourage if u cant understand the chim concepts. Physics, IMO, is the most chim subject out of PCME.</p>
              <p>For Chemistry, lots of ppl say its tough. I tink its tough too, but not so tough IMO. H2 Chemistry is all about understanding, becos most qns are application qns. Unfortunately, A lvl standard for Chem is not below that of the school's standard. Sometimes, A lvl pops out qns u nv see before. Thats why u need to understand to be able to solve them. Understand, then memorise. But u still need to memorise about 50 reactions. Quite a big workload for chemistry.</p>
              <p>For Econs, OMG it is a JOKE H2 subject lah. Honestly, the content in H2 Econs is SOOOOOOOOO much lesser than those in Physics Chem and Math. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY PPL HATE ECONS. Becos Econs require the least amount of time (IMO). As Econs is not a subject in O lvl, all of you new Econs students are on a fair playing ground. No one has a headstart. Econs are all about writing essays and case study. If you always do well in SocialStudies, chances are you will do very well in Econs. Becos it is all about BULLSHITTING and SMOKING your way through your Econs essay. Alot of ppl failed Econs, becos they do not know what the teachers want to see. They do not know how to WRITE ONLY. They have the concepts, but dont know how to phrase them in an A standard way. So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU to read model essays and see their way of writing. The teacher will almost gurantee not give u model essays, for fear that everyone thinks thats the right way and copy the style. But for Econs, theres no particular right and wrong. Its like debate. All can be argued both sides, provided ur concepts are correct.</p>
              <p>For H1 Math Physics Chem Bio, they are 50% content-wise lesser than their H2 counterparts. For H1 Econs, it is only 30% less content than H2 Econs. </p>
              <p>Also, H2 BIO is ridiculously tough and lots of memorisation. I did not take BIO, but I heard from my friends that Bio requires lots of memorisation. U might tink it as 20 times more difficult than ur O lvl Bio.</p>
              <p>Anyway, final advice for you is to be independent in your studies. Dont just rely on your teachers. Lots of teachers are actually useless as they cant teach zzz. Google is your friend. Whenever you are in doubt, GOOGLE THEM, becos A lvl teaches u REAL STUFF, but just simplified version of those in Uni. Go youtube and youtube about the Math topics to understand the concepts behind them. Youtube the Chem and Physics concepts and you'll understand them. KhanAcademy and DrPhysicsA are especially good in Math and Physics, and you might even understand the concepts via youtube video better than those lectures u attend in school. The best part? They take only 10mins to let u understand, and ur stupid lecturer takes 2 weeks to explain the concepts ZZZZ. 90% of whatever I understood are mostly from self-research online and watching some videos. Becos some teachers are really useless in teaching. If u are fortunate and got a good teacher, good for you. Treat ur teacher as a personal tuition teacher and clarify your doubts with them, and they're FREE.</p>
              <p>When u enter JC, you are ready to give up 2 years of freedom. Your life is just studying, trainings for CCAs, go home cry over stress, wake up with panda eyes, repeat. If you prioritise, you'll skip the crying and panda eyes part.</p>
              <p>Choose ur friends wisely. Work hard and play hard. Thats the way to survive these 2 hell yrs. Literally hell zzzz. But overall its an enriching 2 yrs. Dont miss out those opportunities like OCIP, OGL, CIP CAMP, CCA CAMP, OVERSEAS TRIP and all exciting stuff. But they cannot be exciting if you cant cope with your studies, and ended up with Bs and Cs and Ds for A lvl. So consistency is the key in JC academic rigour. Your O lvl cert is useless once you enter JC, throw that away. A lvl is the cert that will gurantee u a spot in Uni. Flunk it and your dream of entering law school or medicine school or whatever is gone.</p>

              <p>Hey guys. I have a few questions regarding my current situation.</p>
              <p>My O level results is 1A1, 7B3s. Mathematics A1, English; CHumans; Chinese; Amaths; Chem; Bio; Physics B3. CCA A1, hence L1R5 nett is 16-2=14</p>
              <p>My results are good but not good, bad but not bad. More of unlucky</p>
              <p>I live in the East area of Singapore; and i have direct buses to Serangoon JC and Tampines JC. </p>
              <p>My current first choice in mind is Tampines JC, which requires a 13nett score. I've asked the school whether it would be possible if i use my prelim/mye results to appeal and they told me no. I'm from a UG CCA and they did say that it wouldnt be of much use to aid me in my appeal should i not make it into Tampines JC. The school did mention that appeal will come as a case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p>My other option is Serangoon JC, even though that it requires 11nett for science and 12nett for Arts. I assume that it would be harder for me to appeal into SRJC bcos i would be expecting 12pointers appealing into the science stream but the difference SRJC has is that it accepts Prelim/MYE results and CCA records for your appeal. I assume it would be a better option for me because there would be a higher chance of me entering this school compared to TPJC via appeal. I've also heard from my friends it is possible to enter SRJC via the Arts stream and then transfer to the science stream or take up a hybrid. Is that true?</p>
              <p>With that being said, My CCA attendance rate is at 100% and i have quite a number of certificates attained from my CCA itself. My MYE&amp;Prelim results is 15raw13nett and 14raw12nett respectively, and on both ocassions i attained 4As</p>
              <p>My other alternative option is Yishun JC, which would be an approximate 1hr trip from my house. I am going to time myself going to YJC tomorrow. I would like to ask a few questions here regarding YJC. How is the school culture and are the teachers inside dedicated to help the students?</p>
              <p>Another question i would like to ask is; would it be taxing on me if i have to spend about an hour travelling to school and then another hour heading back home from school? I would need personal experiences on this matter.</p>
              <p>I would like to state that i have no passion for any poly courses so i would not be going to any polytechnic. I went to their open houses and still has not found a course that is of my liking.</p>
              <p>Lastly, would you put SRJC or TPJC as your first choice if you were in my shoes?</p>
              <p>Cheers <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
