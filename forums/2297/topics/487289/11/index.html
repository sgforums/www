              If (and only if) you get straight As for your A levels in MI, you still stand a better chance of entering Medicine compared to if you get a perfect GPA in Biomedical engineering.

              The fact that your L1R5 qualifies you for JC, is already a MOE safeguard that you're qualified (ie. have sufficient academic inclination) for the JC route. How well you do after entering JC, is entirely up to you.

              <p>CJC cop is 10pts.  TPJC is 13 pts. Which JC you go to does
              not really matter. </p>
              <p>It all depends on what you intend to do in Uni in the end.</p>
              <p>If you intend to read Medicine or Law, then you need to work
              really hard in JC cos the cop is AAA/A (3H1/1H2).  You need to
              be realistic<br> and ask yourself if you can achieve this score at A levels.</p>
              <p>Looking at most of the other popular courses like Biz or
              Accountancy in the local Unis (NUS, NTU or SMU), the cop is AAA/B,
              AAA/C or AAB/B types.  If you think you can achieve such
              scores, then go the JC route.</p>
              <p>Why don't you want to go to Poly?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I do not want to go to poly because it is too far and I am not sure what i want to do yet. I went for the open house for poly and also felt that i am not the kind for it and my parents don't really want me to go to poly. The chances of going to a local uni is lower than JC too.I did think of studying medicine/ business before and i believe that if i work hard enough i can achieve this score at Alevels or maybe a slightly lower score and opt for other good uni courses.</p>
              <p>I know that with my o level results, i shouldn't be picky when choosing the schools. However, with an L1r5 of 17-2 , the schools that i can go are too far and distance is very important if i am studying for the a levels. However, i feel that i will not struggle if i can go into tpjc/srjc/cjc with my score as it was only my english that caused me to end up with a score of L1r5 17. My english grade was also unexpected and up to now i have yet to find out the reason on what went wrong D: I am not sure whether i should appeal using this as a reason and CCA etc... and should i ask if i could retake my english as a private candidate while studying in the JC?</p>

              <p>I do not know where you live, but there are polys in the East, North and West of Singapore. </p>
              <p>I would suggest you visit the NUS, NTU and SMU websites to look at the cop for the various courses and have a realistic feel of what kind of grades are needed to enrol in these courses. Afterall, the purpose of the JC route is to be able to study in Uni. If it's a course that you do not mind taking at Uni and the grades are realistically achievable, then go for the JC route  </p>
              <p>It is not true that for Biz and Accountancy courses in the Uni, you need to do Biz or accountancy in Poly. Any course will do as long as you meet the cop and have the H1 equivalent of Maths. Of course if you have an Accountancy Dip, you can skip the first year in Uni. </p>
              <p>I know of Poly grads who got 15 or 16 pts at O levels and managed to get into local Uni with a GPA of 3.5 or something and do the Applied Physics course. To get 3.5, you need to score As and some Bs in your subjects. I also know of A level graduates with 12 pts at O levels and did badly at A levels and couldn't get into any of the top 3 Unis and end up in UniSIM. </p>
              <p>There is a new uni, SIT that caters to mainly Poly grads. Their degrees are recognised in Spore. </p>
              <p>Poly education is modular and some ppl excel in bite sized exams and continual assessments rather than one single exam that determines everything.</p>
              <p>I am not encouraging you to go the Poly route. Ultimately, whichever route you take, you need to work hard to get what you want. No short cuts. </p>
              <p>Btw, I went through the JC route to Uni. But that was many many years ago when it was the norm and life was not that competitive.</p>
              <p>I hope that I have not caused more confusion.  If you feel the JC route is the best for you, by all means go for it and work hard.</p>
              <p>Good luck and all the best. </p>

              <p>Hi guys, I recently got back my O level results and things didn't quite turned out the way I expected. Got raw of 14pts and net of 10pts after deduction for CCA and HCL. I had initially hoped to get into ACJC Sci stream but the COP is 6pts and so it seems terribly out of my reach. I thought about appealing in through CCA but I'm not sure which are the few CCAs which the school is looking out for. I have some drama/public speaking experiences but I've never competed in any competitions nor was part of an official drama club. I'd like to know if I stand a chance at getting in through a CCA appeal (certain sport or performing arts) as I really love the school life balance in AC. I'm willing to put in the effort to get better results too. </p>
              <p>Ive also shortlisted certain JCs that I'm interested and might be eligible for and Id like to know your opinions on them. SAJC, CJC , NYJC and AJC. Really appreciate any help I can get, thanks.</p>

              <p>i usualy wont recommend squeezing urself in (just meet COP)<br>somemore COP is based on previous batch..... so usually they want better students each year so will try to accept lesser pts if possible</p>
              <p>and always keep in mind they take in the raw scores one first</p>
