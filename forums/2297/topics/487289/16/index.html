            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hello , ive been posted to IJC which iam actually very ok with , but i did not checked enough information about this jc because i was not expecting this jc to be the choice of mine instead of PJ . I checked the website and it stated that in order to take h2 phy u need at least a2 in combined sci which unfortuately i only have a b3 in. In PJ , i talked to the hod and she stated that with a b3 i am able to take h2 phy and h1 chem with h2 maths (I taken amaths). may i ask if anyone who visited ijc asked if i am able to take h2 phy with just a b3 in combined science? my ideal combination is h2 phy h1 chem h2 econs and h1 pw and gp and mt .

Besides your score is very close to the minimum score of a2 so you should stand a chance, go for it</p></div>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Hello, great people. I just want to start by asking: is it possible to appeal for the same JC/course that you are unsuccessful in getting into in JAE? I took YJC (SC) as my first choice but I was unsuccessful in getting into it. If there are vacancies, I would be glad and be eager to appeal for this course.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">By the way, my O level results are as follows:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">ELR2B2 = 12; L1R5 = 18 (which is a pity because of my poor performance in Chinese)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">English - C5</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Combined Humanities (SS, HE) - B3</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Elementary Mathematics - A2</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Combined Science (Phy, Chem) - A1</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Principles of Accounts - A1</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Chinese - C6</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">The reason why I would want to enrol into YJC is because of its flexibility in allowing students to take up H2 subjects (especially in Science stream, which other JCs do not offer this privilege) and I would like to pursue a University course of my liking when I am on my way to choose which course I really prefer (preferably in the Science-related field of course). But when I appeal, can I do it without my CCA? I screwed up in my CCA and got seven (meaning complete) depression (which is D7). I would like to start a new beginning in this institution and hopefully move on to a greater height after the two years.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Do you think that I should appeal or move on to my second choice which is Chemical Engineering in a polytechnic (it offers a good amount of knowledge in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Economics but I would like to also avail myself to General Paper)?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Thank you to those who will reply to my reply to this topic. :) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">P.S When will the appeal end? Last time I heard it is by Feb, 5th.</p>

              <p>It's basically a course that involves nature and designing. Using plants to design the environment~~</p>
              <p>Careers:</p>
              <p>landscape designer,<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Horticulturist,conservation officer,entrepreneur in plant-related businesses(florists,garden accessories),laboratory technologist in plant science research</span></p>
              <p>Can you apply via JPSAE? Try that first. If you fail,prepare to appeal to NYP or other polys with lower entry requirement,provided that they have a similar course~</p>

              <p>I got into a JC with less than 10 points, but now I think I chose the wrong stream... I took combined sciences in Sec and thought taking H2 Sciences is too much, so I ended up with H2 Econs, Geog, Math and a H1 Science. <br><br>I heard that Econs is pretty much useless in Uni ( and I actually contemplated a lot on whether or not to take it in the first place ).<br><br>Geog + Econs doesn't look like a good choice does it...? Seems like an extra load for me to memorize textbooks and essays. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>Parents say to "love my choice" but eh I don't know. After seeing a few of my friends taking H2 Sciences despite not getting A1 for Combined Science, I feel like I wasted that opportunity. </p>
              <p>Now the subjects I'm taking at H2 are mostly those that I got B3 in. POA sounds like Econs so I'm assuming it's the same.</p>
              <p>Anyway can someone clarify with me if this matters at all? I don't plan on getting into a Sci course in Uni, if planning to get into Uni at all lol.</p>
