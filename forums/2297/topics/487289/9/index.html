              <p>Hello, looking for some advice.</p>
              <p>I scored lacklustre results for O levels this year due to a medical condition in sec 4.</p>
              <p>My results as follows:</p>
              <p>L1R5:19-2</p>
              <p>English:B4</p>
              <p>E Math:A1</p>
              <p>A Math:B3</p>
              <p>Chemistry:B3</p>
              <p>Combined Humanities(SS History):B3</p>
              <p>Physics:C5</p>
              <p>CCA:A1</p>
              <p>Chinese:C6</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I plan to apply for 1st choice NJC, 2nd choice JJC, 3rd choice PJC, 4th choice Innova.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking of approaching the dean of NJC to explain my circumstances, and possibly appeal into their canoe team.(i have had some canoeing achievements). I also have a history of a leadership role in my UG CCA with EAGLES I also intend to use my IQ results(done professionally with me placed in the 95 percentile). Ideally, i want to be able to enter with the pre condition of a mid year quota. But, in fair view, the NJC would most likely not bother with a 17 pointer. So i would use this appeal to place me in their notice. Should the NJC appeal prove unsuccessful(as it probably will be.), i aim to use my mid year results in JC1(Likely in JJ/innova) to appeal into NJC again.</p>
              <p>Why the recurring desire to apply for NJC? well, it's close to my house and readily offers H3 ressearch subjects with A*star. I'm a self-declared intellectual with a strong desire to study Physics/Maths, and aiming to pick up Law in Uni. My parents believe i stand close to zero chance even if i score stellar results but i suppose i just have to wing it. </p>
              <p>Gladly appreciate if anyone could help me out with this predicament! I REALLY want to take an academically strenous syllabus in JC but yet due to my medical conditions last year, i lack the results to show the JC of my choice my capabilities. </p>
              <p>Perhaps there's an alternative to what i'm seeking? Is my plan in the least feasible? I'm willing to work extremely hard for my goal to study subjects at H3 level. Any help is much appreciated! Thanks for reading this lengthy post.</p>

              <p>Hi! um so these are my results.. very unexpected of course..</p>
              <p>Raw L1R5: 9</p>
              <p>Net L1R5: 7</p>
              <p>for MI, ITE, poly, I got 7 points for all of them on my result slip. A2 for CCA so 2 bonus points but I'm not sure whether its included already? Also I heard that for poly only can minus 1 point.</p>
              <p>English, Core Literature, Emath: A1</p>
              <p>Biology, Chemistry, Combined Humanities, Chinese: A2</p>
              <p>yeahh... I stay near Woodlands but I'm not sure which schools to go to though I'm leaning slightly towards poly? Idk why everyone wants to go JC though... it seems very stressful and hard :/ And all the schools in Woodlands like Innova JC and Republic Poly have like really high cut off points.</p>

              <p>Just my two cents worth, if you are feeling slightly unconfident in getting H2 Mathematics through TPJC Science, you might want to consider YJC. Its flexible subject combination as well as its various teaching resources can help broaden your academic opportunities in near future. But of course, travelling time is vital in choosing a JC and you might want to slowly consider your choices in getting your desired combination and going to JC in the shortest travelling time possible.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, to those who qualify and are seeking to enroll yourselves in a JC, you might want to step back and check the subject combinations of the various JCs in Singapore. There are ample combinations to be chosen such as the famous PCMe combination, and that you must check whether does your O Level grades qualify you in getting your desired combination.</p>
              <p>All the best!</p>

              Appeals have a small chance of success *only* if your L1R5 (or for MI, L1R4) score is zhun zhun exactly on the dot for that JC's cut off point, in your case, you need exactly 20 to have a chance of successfully appealing in. MOE won't allow MI to accept anyone whose points do not meet the strict cut-off criteria. You can still try, but MOE policy is MOE policy, so be mentally prepared.<br><br> Moving forward, you have to seriously start considering private candidacy (O levels and/or A levels), and/or Poly courses. Every year, some students attempt to juggle both simultaneously (O or A level private candidacy, while doing a Poly course), with varying degrees of success.

              H2 Physics require the most math, while H2 Biology requires the least math. H2 Chemistry is somewhere in between (as always, Chemistry is the Central Science in so many ways).

              If you wanna work as soon as possible (and maybe get a Uni business degree a few years after working), go for the Poly diploma. If you wanna get a (NUS/NTU/SMU) Uni degree in business as soon as possible, go for the shorter JC route.

              advice ;( I really want to get into a JC (Science stream) but my
              L1R5 is 17 (Net L1R5 - 15) . I feel like my results are fairly okay
              but my Combined Humanities (SS/Lit) is a C6. I live in the East so
              I hope to get into TPJC even though I think the chances are very
              low even after deducting CCA 2 points. How are my chances to get
              into any JC Science stream, and if I were to appeal into TPJC,
              would my chances be better since the science stream isn't heavily
