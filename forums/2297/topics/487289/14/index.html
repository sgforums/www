              <p>Hi, really appreciate all the help you've given me. Do you
              perhaps know which are the CCAs which are "desperately trying to
              recruit good athletes/performers" so that they would be able to
              achieve results. Would be helpful if you can list a few of these
              CCAs.</p>
              <p>I'm quite a sporty person and was previously from rugby ( though
              I have no interest of using it to appeal in ) and also have prior
              experiences as a main cast in my primary school drama production
              with 2k audience and master of ceremony at the school's anniversary
              event. I'm really motivated on trying out for drama auditions but
              based on what I heard, AC drama really stands out and thus I'm
              afraid that I might not get in. Appreciate any advice you can give
              me and thanks a bunch:)!</p>

              <p>Hi, as to which CCA they are desperately trying to recruit, I cannot give you an answer simply becos I do not have knowledge of all the CCAs.</p>
              <p>Anyway, your chance of successfully appealing into AC is much higher if u appeal via Rugby, provided you are quite skillful in it such that you are better than the other ppl who tried to appeal via Rugby too. But u are forced to join Rugby as ur CCA. For drama, primary sch experiences are not very convincing, so u might have prob appealing via it.</p>
              <p>That being said, the best u can do is to get a senior in the drama CCA and ask for arrangement to "audition/try out", and get the teacher's recommendation if they want u. Most ppl who successfully appealed in have the the teacher's recommendation (the teacher will fill in a form to the sch). Some ppl even started joining the sch for CCA trainings in December holiday, just so they could get a "secure" place in the sch via appeal should they failed to meet the COP. But then again, you have to be very skillful in the CCA such that the CCA wants you. Even then, there is limited slots as to how many ppl each CCA can accept ppl who appeal, so the CCA might want you, but cant accept u cos theres no slot. </p>
              <p>I know of a guy in a sports CCA who joined the AC for trainings in December (he's very skillful), and are almost guranteed the appeal slot regardless of whether meeting the COP or not, as the teacher-in-charge will do the recommendation to the sch and accept him (becos they want talent and win the A Div). But ultimately he scored more than 20 in his results and cant go JC LOL.</p>
              <p>Some sports CCA in AC are trying to lure ppl in some reputable secondary sch (like B Div champion) by asking those who are interested to appeal to go down to the trainings and see their skills. Then, the teacher will do the job for u if they want u, as long as ur O lvl score is below 20.</p>
              <p>Ok anyway, what Im trying to bring across is, to get the teacher's recommendation. Else if u just submit the appeal form after JAE results are released, chances are u will fail. Becos u did not meet the COP. Mostly they will only consider the appeal form after JAE if u meet the COP, and have good CCA record. But u did not meet COP, and ur drama portfolio is not good. Your highest chance is to get a drama senior number (preferably someone u know or of high position such as President or in EXCO) and ask to go down to the sch and joins their CCA trainings. Dont wait till JAE results are release. U can do so now. Then if they decide they want u, the teacher will fill in a recommendation form to the sch to accept u. But then again, u have to be very good in the CCA lah. Most ppl who successfully appealed into the sch via their CCAs of choice are very skillful in their CCAs, so the sch wants them so as to achieve good A Div results (and to prevent other schs from getting the talent LOL). As to how you are going to find the seniors number, u have to figure it out on ur own...</p>

              I posted about MI on another forum :<br><br>
              
              MI is certainly a wise choice (in contrast to blindly picking a Poly course you've no interest in) that students who are undecided on a future profession (ie. not suitable for Poly) but do not qualify for JC, can certainly be grateful for.
              <br><br>
              Nonetheless, one point to note about MI if you're going to be studying there : you're advised to have an individualistic, strong-willed, highly disciplined approach to your A levels, and not be unduly influenced by the relatively lepak, laid back or laissez-faire culture in MI (vis-Ã -vis the other JCs in Singapore).
              <br><br>
              Always remind yourself that you're competing (for limited Uni places) against the rest of the JC population in Singapore (from RJC to MI), and never become complacent with being a (relative) big fish in a (relative) small pond.

              <p>Hi wassup, I feel it is better to try other JCs, eg. SRJC, or TPJC as AJC COP is low. The competition to enter AJC is stiff, so it is not gonna be easy with your L1R5. Please check the JC's COP for last year.</p>

              <p>Hi all! I need advice. I'm not sure if I'm in the correct place to ask for one but lol. Kind of desperate</p>
              <p>So basically: Foreigner. Average income family (as in, not rich but not poor). Screwed up O Levels (26 pts...lmao) by failing Math (E8). My English got B3 and Comb Humans B4 (these are the only things that are honest to god presentable on my slip). Art, POA, Comb Sci were C's. I'm aware parts of the reason I didn't do well were Art coursework and my shitty time management. Barely touched POA, didn't self practice Maths as often as I should have, and my Chemistry is just downright shitty as hell. I'm only good at bullshitting my English and memorising/bullshitting Comb Humans. I also didn't have any tuition, which was kind of really suicidal but we just can't afford it lol :-/</p>
              <p>I have the choice to go back to my home country but I'm really wary in doing so, since I'll have to transition back to an American education system and straight up go to Uni. More so, I may only be admitted A.Y 2016, which will make me two years late from everyone. So, my parents are quite adamant right now on making me stay in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I didn't try JAE, because parents didn't want me to go to ITE (family pride), but tried JPSAE instead (NYP Business IT, I.T, and NP I.T). My application is probably medium strength lmao, so I don't really have hopes for this.</p>
              <p>Private diplomas, whatever they are, are hella expensive so thats also out of the options. </p>
              <p>So my last hope, right now, is retaking O Levels, but even so my parents are very very wary of it because a) private schools only take in citizen/spr, b) expensive fees (again...I paid about 600$ as a school candidate jfc), c) what makes you think I will pass if I do it again lmao??, d) hella burdensome for the sole breadwinner of my family</p>
              <p>Please help me! What do you think should be my next course of action? Go back home? Just delete myself from Earth? If you have any alternatives I haven't heard of, please tell me. :+(</p>
              <p>(Also no I didnt take psle so I'm really...clueless)</p>
              <p>(Thank you for even reading this lmao have a good day!! uwu)</p>

              <p>What makes you think your parents are wary about your future decisions? Can you tell me what are their views now? From what I read above,I can't tell what your parents are actually deciding. They seem to be over-drive mode since you didn't fare well.</p>
              <p>You seem to doubt your own abilities in performing well for the O levels,when you are talking about planning to retake as private candidate.</p>
              <p>You should have work harder. It's not too late. </p>
              <p>You reminded me of my psle. I scored 196/300. I had tuition,but I fared quite badly. I can't imagine my results slip,but all of that was a result of computer gaming! In 1 year,I kicked the habit of using computer gaming during school days from 5hrs to 1hr.</p>
              <p>My results started to improve gradually and I managed to get to Jc,because I had a wake-up call from my results slip.</p>
              <p>For my case,my parents are not overly tense. They believe that it is up to the individual to discover their own strengths and weaknesses. They also felt that they should give me similar independence,despite my failures in Psle. I guess it was their constant motivation that got me far. On the plus side,my friends in class were enthusiastic about studying.We stayed back to discuss questions after school. For our school,when it's time to get serious,we are really serious.</p>
              <p>So I fell down,I picked myself up. Are you going to do the same today? My teachers never had the expectation of me entering Jc at day 1 of secondary school.However,I proved them wrong and perservered to enter Jc.</p>

              <p>Idk for starters I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life up until I went to NYP's Open House, where I discovered that Business I.T might not be so bad, maybe ideal, since I'm interested in business and I.T (I make tumblr themes lol) so when I took O Levels last year, I was really kind of heck care.

I suppose my weird subject combination also was a contributing factor to my failure, as my dad has repeatedly berated me about it lmao.

              <p>I never took psle and therefore had no idea what to expect for O Levels. I was terrified of taking it. I guess I shut down? Honestly I probably only studied a month and a half before O's &gt;_____________&gt; yea...h</p>

              <p>So glad that you have a purpose in life now.A purpose in life just keeps you pushing.It is not too late for regrets. Don't let one regret crapped out your life. You are still young.</p>
              <p>Maybe, it's your application skills.You can study 1.5 months for it and still do farely well.</p>
              <p>Since you can't afford private tuition,I guess you should choose nursing perhaps??</p>
              <p>Given your parents' stubborn view,I doubt they will let you retake your O's.If they say no nursing course,you ask them to propose their best solution that will be better for you.</p>
              <p>Post your parents' comments and I will predict their reaction afterwards,as well as  help you make a better decision.</p>

              <p>Yes, you should retake Maths. Retaking only 1 subject will not be as stress as poly since you are in ITE. Moreover, you are only paying over $100+ to retake Maths rather than going to private school which is expensive.</p>
