              Go whichever is nearer, and/or has a more direct bus/MRT route from/to your home. The school culture, programs and environment, including teachers, principal and students, changes from year to year (due to teachers/principal leaving and new ones coming in), and furthermore your combination teachers will be different from some say, 3 years ago, and so someone else's experience and opinion of the pros and cons of any 2 JCs (eg. TPJC vs SRJC) won't necessarily be a valid, reliable or accurate indicator for your own.

                  Private Message <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/7461">Eage</a> for advice. He's the H2 Math + H2 Physics expert.<br><br>
                  However, be mentally prepared, as your results don't qualify you for taking H2 Maths and/or H2 Physics in even lenient YJC <a href="http://www.yishunjc.moe.edu.sg/student-admission/subject-information">http://www.yishunjc.moe.edu.sg/student-admission/subject-information</a>, let alone normal JCs which are much stricter in subject prerequisites than YJC.
                  <br><br>
                  If you could somehow pull off the impossible, and secure a pass (or better yet, score a distinction) for a full A Math exam paper in front of your (would be) JC teacher when you meet them next week (assuming in the first place they would even entertain your request to do so), and in doing so convince them you're ready to take H2 Math and H2 Physics, then your (would be) JC would allow you to do so. 
                  <br><br>As a last resort, you could take private A levels during your NS, doing the 'missing' (from your JC studies) A level subjects that is required to study Physics at Uni level, and scoring well for them, then (even if these subjects are not used for your Uni Admission Score), the University's admission committee may take this favourably under consideration.

              <p>Hi, I just received my O level results and I extremely need some advice ;( I really want to get into a JC (Science stream) but my L1R5 is 17 (Net L1R5 - 15) . I feel like my results are fairly okay but my Combined Humanities (SS/Lit) is a C6. I live in the East so I hope to get into TPJC even though I think the chances are very low even after deducting CCA 2 points. How are my chances to get into any JC Science stream, and if I were to appeal into TPJC, would my chances be better since the science stream isn't heavily dependent on Humanities?</p>
              <p>My results are:<br>English - B3</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Combined Humans - C6</span></p>
              <p>Maths - A1</p>

              <p>That's said, H1 maths isn't that easy either, it's the same difficulity in terms of question per say (at times, H1 maths questions can be harder than H2, same as other subjects like Chemistry also) but half the breadth which fortunately gives you more time to adapt to the syllabus.Â </p>
              <p>H2 maths is not a prerequistic for courses like law, business and etc, so ponder carefully your future before making any decisions</p>
              <p>However, if you are bent into doing H2 maths, I wish you all the best but spend these few weeks reading up on A maths (especially calculus and trigometry - ignore geometry).Â </p>

              difficulity in terms of question per say (at times, H1 maths
              questions can be harder than H2, same as other subjects like
              Chemistry also) but half the breadth which fortunately gives you
              more time to adapt to the syllabus.Â </p>
              <p>H2 maths is not a prerequistic for courses like law, business
              and etc, so ponder carefully your future before making any
              decisions</p>
              <p>However, if you are bent into doing H2 maths, I wish you all the
              best but spend these few weeks reading up on A maths (especially
              calculus and trigometry - ignore geometry).Â </p>

              <p>Hello everyone, I received my o level results and I'm pleased to
              say the least. My raw l1r5 is 9 and after deduction its 7. I have
              the choice to either go to meridian JC or Victoria JC( -4 for vjc
              due to affiliation). Tampines JC, however, is 5 minutes from my
              house and apparently distance is a very important factor in
              choosing a JC. Any advice on what school to choose? Thanks in

              <p>if you want a more fun culture (stereotyping alert!), choose VJC. Service 31 does reach VJ and it takes about 50 minutes to reach also, many of my classmates / school mates stay in tampines also). Otherwise, TPJC will be good but it is more on the task kind.</p>

              <p>You can try your luck in getting H2 Mathematics if you didn't manage to take Additional Mathematics in secondary school, but be warned that such acts are indeed risky if unprepared and that you will need to meet a specific promotional criteria if you intend to continue on. Coming from YJ who got the same grades as you and obtained H2 MA and H2 PH conditionally, you will need to obtain an "E" grade in the subjects that you have appealed in order to continue on this combination of yours. <em>The marking scheme in YJ H2 MA department has been tweaked slightly</em>, placing a whooping 70% in Block Tests (15%) and Promos (55%), meaning that you need to <strong>place a lot of effort</strong> in your examinations or lose your combination. I am not kidding on that part.</p>
              <p>Regardless, subject combinations in YJ are pretty lenient since they give plentiful opportunities to many students who appealed for their desired combinations (i've seen some before). You can test it out and see if it is your cup of tea since it is undeniable that the jump between E. Math and H2 Math is <strong>huge</strong>. Regardless, good luck getting into the course of your choice! :)</p>

              To Unknown Soldier and Bbujess (and all students applying into JCs), bear in mind that "appeals" give you a small chance to get in, *only* if your L1R5 score is *exactly* the same as the cut-off score for that JC. Eg. for a certain JC's cut-off score for science stream is 10, and you scored 10 for your L1R5, but didn't manage to get in, then you can appeal (even then, the chance is very low, because only if some student who got in, decides to transfer away from that JC, thus giving a vacancy, then you've a chance... even then you gotta fight hundreds of other appealing students with the same L1R5 score).
              <br><br>
              So to both of you, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst (actually, the worst case scenario isn't all that bad), ie. after putting these desired JCs as your 1st and 2nd choices, put realistic JCs (particularly YJC, or even consider MI, which are more lenient in terms of A level subject combinations based on O level subject prerequisites) as your next few choices, and be prepared to enter these JCs.
              <br><br>
              As a last last resort, there is always A level private candidacy. But it's too early to consider this last last resort for now (this would be more appropriate for students who for whatever reason, decide to drop out of JC, but don't wish to enter Poly). For now, seriously consider more realistic, lower-tier JCs. It's not that bad, as the A level papers at the end of the 2 short years are exactly the same, and your own determination matters far more than the school environment.

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>I took N'Level last year with Emaths as an O'Level subject. I got 10 points for 4 N'Level subjects which was eligible for PFP. So I went to DPP for a short while, being confident that I would definitely get at least a B3 for my Emaths. But when I took my Emaths results today, I got C5 (equivalent to 2 points) and that I got 12 points altogether (no longer eligible for PFP). After knowing this, I have lost my mood to study at DPP. Should I appeal back to Sec 5?</p>
