              <p>Why do so sia. Just retake ur O levels alone? Im sure Mindef
              would give u another year to retake ur o levels. Why would u study
              then dropout ?         </p>

              <p>oh. Then i guess you could enrol into ITE then dropout? However it's a very risky route. I would suggest you continue studying in ITE until your O level retake results come out and you can decide whether you want to dropout or not.</p>

              <p>I am sorry for commenting without reading up on DAE. I myself switched course after my first year in tertiary level, via applying through JAE for the second time. However, that was from A lvl track to Diploma track. I was not aware that the procedure for Diploma-to-Diploma switch is not the same as A lvl-to-Diploma switch.</p>
              <p>I understand the concern here. I think now the only way is to, really, know what you really want to pursue, and appeal for it. Write in to the course managers, or even higher, to the director of the school, or even higher, to the principal of the polytechnic. You may want to write using pen and paper. It is always more sincere to write letter using pen and paper, instead of email.</p>
              <p>At the worse case scenario, you may want to opt for the Private Education track. It is (slightly) more expensive than the Polytechnic Diploma track.</p>

              <p>By right you should have been called for an interview provided if the course you applied for has slots and you are shortlisted. You can ask around if Students applying for the course you applied has already been called for an interview? Or Maybe the course really no slot already?</p>
              <p>By using DAE, shortlisted candidates must go for interview unless your results is like damn good den need to take a short test only. They will only pick like 4 out of 10 candidates i think..</p>
              <p><strong>I myself got rejected by RP </strong>despite L1R4 of 16 points, B3 ENG, A2 CHI, C6 Maths, B3 Combined Humans and B3 Food &amp; Nutrition. Right now im waiting for TP and NYP's DAE outcome i alr went for their interviews.</p>
              <p>You can appeal to RP but u shud include some IT courses or Engineering Courses for a backup plan</p>
              <p>and also considering the intake of RP most of the courses should be flooded alr only left with IT and Engineering Courses which has slots</p>

              <p>Im also a DAE applicant. I just went for an interview at NYP recently.</p>
              <p>btw business management and financial informatics</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">think theres no more slots..</span></p>
              <p>anyway sucks to be using DAE man we dropouts are left at the last. By last i mean, enroling at the last minute, missing orientation and giving u a few days to do medical checkup and payment etc</p>
              <p>got some cases where dae applicants were only informed aft sch started to replace the no shows. </p>
              <p>have u applied for other polys too? </p>
