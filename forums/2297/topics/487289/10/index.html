              <p>Hi, I need help deciding which JC too, can someone help? Thanks :)</p>
              <p>I got Raw 10 points, so after minusing it would be 8 nett.</p>
              <p>English - A1</p>
              <p>Combined humans - B3</p>
              <p>EMath - A1</p>
              <p>AMath - A1</p>
              <p>Physics - B3</p>
              <p>Chem - A2</p>
              <p>Bio - B3</p>
              <p>MEP (music elective program which is like another humans) - B3</p>
              <p>Chinese - A2</p>
              <p>I live at Redhill so the nearest JC to me is ACJC but with my grades its difficult to get in since ACJC COP is 6. My question is do you think i should put ACJC as first choice and hope that I maybe I might get in since I take MEP or should I put AJC or CJC for a safer bet. </p>
              <p>I also can't decide between SAJC, AJC and CJC. CJC is nearest to my house but I heard from friends and seniors that its not a very good (academic wise) school compared to AJC which is further from my house.</p>
              <p>Then I'm also thinking of doing business at SP too? Because I'm not sure if it is wise to get into a average JC where I cannot excel and then flung my A levels and end up with nothing. :(</p>
              <p>If I can get into ACJC all my problems would be solved. Do you think my chances of appeal is high? Considering I can appeal with Band or MEP? But I dont know if they will accept me since I only got a B3 for MEP. HELP!</p>
              <p>Thank you :)</p>

              <p>I live in Bedok :) I'm kinda apprehensive towards going to IP
              scools like TJ. I'm leaning towards MJC, but my friends have been
              saying that I should try a better school for my first choice. Would
              really help! :)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I also lived in Bedok, graduated from VJC. Our school have the IP program also, but the focus of VJ IP is more on exposure / breadth (such as overseas exchanges as well as group projects coupled with industry exposure). Hence, IP students do not have any significant advantage over O level students in term of academic competency as our tutors do not teach the IP students excessive A level content matter. </p>
              <p>For TJ, the IP focus is slightly different, but I have classmates who have less than stellar O level results getting into TJ and obtained good A level results. What's good meant is normative and these are just some anedoctal evidences also.</p>
              <p>In general, both TJ and MJ are quite similar in school culture but MJ is slightly more inclined to academics. But since you stay in Bedok, TJ will be a good choice based on distance</p>

I know its mediocre but i am interested to sign up for MI as i know the normal JCs are totally not an option for me. I scored a B3 for english but i know it can be better as i have gotten distinctions for the past few exams, while my combined science is not that strong. I still do well for the other subjects though. Do you think i should go ahead with MI or just join a poly? Because i was aiming for aerospace engineering and i did not meet the cut off point. No other courses are of interest to me as well. Also, i heard that you need to take chinese in MI? Is that true? because my chinese is of the standard of a primary school student <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"><br>My ultimate goal is also to enter university... Heard that the chances of getting in there from MI is not that high but also higher than poly.. I dont really like studying too</p></div>

              <p>CJC cop is 10pts.  TPJC is 13 pts. Which JC you go to does not really matter. </p>
              <p>It all depends on what you intend to do in Uni in the end.</p>
              <p>If you intend to read Medicine or Law, then you need to work really hard in JC cos the cop is AAA/A (3H1/1H2).  You need to be realistic<br>and ask yourself if you can achieve this score at A levels.</p>
              <p>Looking at most of the other popular courses like Biz or Accountancy in the local Unis (NUS, NTU or SMU), the cop is AAA/B, AAA/C or AAB/B types.  If you think you can achieve such scores, then go the JC route.</p>
              <p>Why don't you want to go to Poly?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">Your scores are pretty good (4 nett I believed).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">I personally advice you to choose the top 7 JCs instead, since you are eligible for them. While much has been said about all schools are good schools, the fact is that the people in the schools are really different. The top few JCs will mould you better (trust me as I havefriends from all JCs), and you are given more opportunities as well.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">Of cos that being said, distance is really an important factor for A lvl syllabus. (Don underestimate the importance of travelling time). As long as it is within an hour of travelling time, you should be fine. If the travelling time from your house to the school exceeds 90mins, I highly advice you to think twice.. Google maps should help you find the travelling time.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;"> </p>

JAE is only for choosing the JCs (not sure abt poly stuff). Of cos try to know what subject combinations you want first before choosing the school, as not all schools offer you the combinations you want. </p>

              <p>I also lived in Bedok, graduated from VJC. Our school have the
                  IP program also, but the focus of VJ IP is more on exposure /
                  breadth (such as overseas exchanges as well as group projects
                  coupled with industry exposure). Hence, IP students do not have any
                  significant advantage over O level students in term of academic
                  competency as our tutors do not teach the IP students excessive A
                  level content matter. </p>
              <p>For TJ, the IP focus is slightly different, but I have
                  classmates who have less than stellar O level results getting into
                  TJ and obtained good A level results. What's good meant is
                  normative and these are just some anedoctal evidences also.</p>
              <p>In general, both TJ and MJ are quite similar in school culture
                  but MJ is slightly more inclined to academics. But since you stay
                  in Bedok, TJ will be a good choice based on distance</p>

              <p>Actually, what I'm more concerned about TJ, is that I'm aiming to join SC and getting a high position in CCA. So, I feel that it might be quite difficult with IP people around as they might have more connections (?), or so to speak.</p>

              <p>I live at Redhill so the nearest JC to me is ACJC but with my
              grades its difficult to get in since ACJC COP is 6. My question is
              do you think i should put ACJC as first choice and hope that I
              maybe I might get in since I take MEP or should I put AJC or CJC
              for a safer bet. </p>
              <p>I also can't decide between SAJC, AJC and CJC. CJC is nearest to
              my house but I heard from friends and seniors that its not a very
              good (academic wise) school compared to AJC which is further from
              my house.</p>
              <p>Then I'm also thinking of doing business at SP too? Because I'm
              not sure if it is wise to get into a average JC where I cannot
              excel and then flung my A levels and end up with nothing. :(</p>
              <p>If I can get into ACJC all my problems would be solved. Do you
              think my chances of appeal is high? Considering I can appeal with
              Band or MEP? But I dont know if they will accept me since I only
              got a B3 for MEP. HELP!</p>

              <p>Hello I just finished A lvl.</p>
              <p>You definitely have 0 chances of getting into ACJC via JAE as you do not meet the cut off point. The lowest percentile of ppl who managed to get into ACJC via JAE just meet the cut-off-point.</p>
              <p>That being said, appealing into the school works even if you did not meet the cut-off-point. However, the appeal will only work if you are appealing via CCAs (For MEP im not sure), so do not appeal via academic performances. I personally know of friends who scored 15 or 10+ L1R5 and managed to appeal into CCAs in ACJC such as Canoe/Water polo. If you decides to take Band in ACJC, then you can consider appealing via band, but you cannot quit it afterwards. In ACJC, Band is one of the hell CCAs, where they have alot alot (and I mean really alot) of practises, so you need to dedicate alot of time to it. It is also one of the niche CCAs there, and it has quite a good reputation through the years.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure is that I feel you should not waste your 1st choice on ACJC via JAE, because the truth is you really have 0 chances of getting in.</p>
              <p>SAJC has lots of pretty girls (at least for my batch all the pretty girls seem to be concentrated there lol). Alot of party-goers and church-goers, but that also depends on who you hang out with really. AJC wise the people are quite academic-inclined. From my friends who studied there, they said it sucks (no offense but just opinions yea).</p>
              <p>Rmb if there is only one slot left in the school via JAE and there are 2 singaporeans with the same raw and nett, they will take in the one who choose the school as the 1st choice rather than the one who placed it at 2nd choice. For those schools whose COP are below 10, you can be assured that the last slot available are still given to those who just met the COP, and alot of ppl who just met the COP did not get in too simply because the demands are higher than the slots available.</p>
              <p>For ACJC, they will only administer about 800 students via JAE, out of about 2k applications.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">Hello
                              I just finished A lvl.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">Your scores are pretty good (4 nett I believed).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">I personally advice you to choose the top 7 JCs instead, since you
                              are eligible for them. While much has been said about all schools
                              are good schools, the fact is that the people in the schools are
                              really different. The top few JCs will mould you better (trust me
                              as I havefriends from all JCs), and you are given more
                              opportunities as well.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">Of cos that being said, distance is really an important factor for
                              A lvl syllabus. (Don underestimate the importance of travelling
                              time). As long as it is within an hour of travelling time, you
                              should be fine. If the travelling time from your house to the
                              school exceeds 90mins, I highly advice you to think twice.. Google
                              maps should help you find the travelling time.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.3333330154419px; line-height: 12.4741325378418px;">And yes, subject combinations are chosen after you start school.
                              JAE is only for choosing the JCs (not sure abt poly stuff). Of cos
                              try to know what subject combinations you want first before
                              choosing the school, as not all schools offer you the combinations
                              you want. </p>

              <p>Hi. Thank you for your reply. </p>
              <p>The cut-off points for last year's intake was</p>
              <p>3 for Hwa Chong and Raffles Instituition;<br>5 for National JC and Victoria JC; <br>6 for Anglo-Chinese JC; <br>7 for Nanyang JC and Temasek JC; and<br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">8 for Anderson JC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Since I live in Woodlands, most of those top JCs are quite a distance away. And from what you heard, AJC sucked (I don't know in terms of what though). I'm not sure how reliable is the estimated travel time as well. </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/eservice/eguide/rail_info.php">http://www.transitlink.com.sg/eservice/eguide/rail_info.php</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on the MRT map alone, all the better/top schools are quite far :(</span></p>
              <p>I don't exactly trust that "All schools are goods schools" either, even though it is true that all the schools will end up leading you to A-levels (excluding Polytechnics and IB schools).</p>
