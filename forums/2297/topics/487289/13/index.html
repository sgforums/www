              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hey guys. I have a few questions regarding my current
              situation.</p>
              <p>My O level results is 1A1, 7B3s. Mathematics A1, English;
              CHumans; Chinese; Amaths; Chem; Bio; Physics B3. CCA A1, hence L1R5
              nett is 16-2=14</p>
              <p>My results are good but not good, bad but not bad. More of
              unlucky</p>
              <p>I live in the East area of Singapore; and i have direct buses to
              Serangoon JC and Tampines JC. </p>
              <p>My current first choice in mind is Tampines JC, which requires a
              13nett score. I've asked the school whether it would be possible if
              i use my prelim/mye results to appeal and they told me no. I'm from
              a UG CCA and they did say that it wouldnt be of much use to aid me
              in my appeal should i not make it into Tampines JC. The school did
              mention that appeal will come as a case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p>My other option is Serangoon JC, even though that it requires
              11nett for science and 12nett for Arts. I assume that it would be
              harder for me to appeal into SRJC bcos i would be expecting
              12pointers appealing into the science stream but the difference
              SRJC has is that it accepts Prelim/MYE results and CCA records for
              your appeal. I assume it would be a better option for me because
              there would be a higher chance of me entering this school compared
              to TPJC via appeal. I've also heard from my friends it is possible
              to enter SRJC via the Arts stream and then transfer to the science
              stream or take up a hybrid. Is that true?</p>
              <p>With that being said, My CCA attendance rate is at 100% and i
              have quite a number of certificates attained from my CCA itself. My
              MYE&amp;Prelim results is 15raw13nett and 14raw12nett respectively,
              and on both ocassions i attained 4As</p>
              <p>My other alternative option is Yishun JC, which would be an
              approximate 1hr trip from my house. I am going to time myself going
              to YJC tomorrow. I would like to ask a few questions here regarding
              YJC. How is the school culture and are the teachers inside
              dedicated to help the students?</p>
              <p>Another question i would like to ask is; would it be taxing on
              me if i have to spend about an hour travelling to school and then
              another hour heading back home from school? I would need personal
              experiences on this matter.</p>
              <p>I would like to state that i have no passion for any poly
              courses so i would not be going to any polytechnic. I went to their
              open houses and still has not found a course that is of my
              liking.</p>
              <p>Lastly, would you put SRJC or TPJC as your first choice if you
              were in my shoes?</p>
              <p>Cheers <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Personally I would find 1 hour travelling time slightly too much for JC curriculum. Consider the school hours of that JC, normally it would be 7 or 8am to 2 or 3pm if I'm not wrong. My JC was 7/8am to 4/5.30pm on most days, holy hell.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">And I would prefer SRJC to TPJC because of several complaints by my friends in TPJC (chem tutor teaching a lot of wrong stuff, bad principal, bad pw mates etc), but this was 4 or 5 years ago, and it's sometimes a matter of luck isn't it.</span></p>

              For subjects like Chemistry, since it makes a big difference as to which Uni courses you can take (ie. almost all Uni Science courses require H2 Chemistry), it's advisable to take it at H2. H1 Chem is useless as a Uni prerequisite, it's just a filler for your Uni Admission Score.<br><br> For subjects like Econs, since it makes no difference as to which Uni courses you can take, it's advisable to take it at H1 (and free the H2 slot for subjects like Chem). You don't even need to take Econs at H1 level (let alone H2 level), to be able to study it at Uni level.
                  <br><br>
                   Of course, if you happen to (although I can't imagine why) much prefer Econs over Chem, then go ahead and take H2 Econs and H1 Chem (or better yet, take some other subject you prefer... Chem is one of those either-take-at-H2-or-might-as-well-don't-take-at-all subject).

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Sorry for asking for help at such a late hour but I really need it and really hope informed and experienced people in the forums can help me out here..</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I did badly for 2014 Os,missing my expected target of 8 (by my school and leself),getting 10 for L1R5 , minus 3 cus CCA -1, HMT pass B3</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Here is a breakdown of my results</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Eng-B3 , looks bad but actually my written english isn't , at worst it is average person standard (wrt to my school , tanjong katong sec ) , flunk cus I was left with 30 min to write compo</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Combined Humanities - A2 (the bell curve is honestly very low my class avg during prelims was fail, me included and I barely studied,only the day before full force )</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Geography - A1</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">E-math - A1</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Amath - A2 (dissapointing cus I never got below 84 in school before , common test and smaller test always full marks )</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Physics - A1</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Chem - A2 ( pajiao and read 5 questions wrongly , wasting 15 marks )</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">HMT - B3 , i believe the bell curve is low cus i didnt get above C5 in school before, maybe its the lucky situational writing topic</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">My comments about my results aren't to show off (after all my o lvl marks are fixed ) its rather to give you all an idea of my academic performance in school with respect to the individual topics .</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I generally like studying almost everything except for bio and am prejudiced against lit and would prefer not to take it. Like most people, I like reading history and watching history related things but dislike the notion of having to memorise the entire subject, on the other hand I like analysing statistics and political cartoons and offering my opinion on them.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Here are some of the schools I am considering , the top being most desireable</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1. National JC Sciences 5 - kinda try hard , yolo -1 hr trip</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2. National JC Arts - 7 , not sure if this is what i should pursue ? What are some negatives to taking arts ? Because i like the school,but im more of the standard math and science person, except im ok with humanities</p>

              <p>Hello AC does indeed accept ppl who did not meet the COP (as
              long as you scored below 20) via CCA appeal. This is how the
              schools grab top-CCA-performers to their schools and up their CCA
              excellences. The truth in JC is that most top athletes/performers
              do not do well in JC academically becos they get in via DSA or
              appeal (mostly), while most top academic-performers have a CCA
              which does not require much talent/skills or that they are not the
              top athletes there. And my friend, this is how the schools (not
              just AC) tell the public that they excel in both academic and
              Sports and performing arts and is a centre of excellences. Yes
              there are indeed some who are of national athlete standard and does
              incredibly well in academics, but these are a very small minority,
              and they are the ones who will get all the awards and scholarship
              and stuff. </p>
              <p>Anyway I think I went off topic lol.</p>
              <p>Ok the school will only accept CCA-appeal only if you are from
              that CCA in secondary school, and of cos of above average
              standards. AC accept appeals from various CCAs such as
              waterpolo/swimming/hockey and some performing arts. They have
              limited slots in accepting appeals (i tink less than 50 successful
              appeals per year). So you have to be very good in that area of
              expertise to have a chance to get in via CCA appeal.</p>
              <p>In CCAs where they are in shortage of ppl and are desperately
              trying to recruit good athletes/performers into the CCA so that
              they would be able to achieve that A Div gold medal, ah thats where
              you will find success. If you have seniors in that CCAs and are
              trying to appeal via that CCA, your chances will be much higher if
              you get the senior to recommend you to the CCA
              teacher-in-charge. </p>
              <p>If you are trying to appeal via CCA, DO NOT attempt to appeal
              via a CCA you have no prior experience in. Else its a 0% chance.
              For drama and stuff, AC has ACSian Theatre as a CCA (smth like
              drama club, but include some dancing, acting and stuff). They also
              offer Drama Elective Programme. Its sort of like a package you
              know. If you are in the DEP, I tink u are automatically inside the
              drama CCA. </p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can pull strings and get into the school. For
              example, if you know the board of directors (or your parents know),
              or you donate handsomely to the school. I personally know of a few
              friends whose parents pull the strings and they appealed into HC
              successfully after they failed JAE LOL.</p>
              <p>Ok anyway good luck to you!</p>

              <p>I'm quite a sporty person and was previously from rugby ( though I have no interest of using it to appeal in ) and also have prior experiences as a main cast in my primary school drama production with 2k audience and master of ceremony at the school's anniversary event. I'm really motivated on trying out for drama auditions but based on what I heard, AC drama really stands out and thus I'm afraid that I might not get in. Appreciate any advice you can give me and thanks a bunch:)!</p>

              <p>Hi everyone! Currently panicking over JAE, but this year O levels I received 2A1s, 4A2s and 1 B4, and total R5 is 10 raw, with bonus points, R5 is 8.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im currently considering AJC, NYJC and SAJC, however I'm really wanting to go to ACJC but I missed the cut off by 1 (ACJC art s currently 7) </p>
              <p>Which JCs should I seriously consider? And should I put ACJC for my first choice to just try?</p>
