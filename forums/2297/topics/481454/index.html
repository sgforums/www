              <p>Hi, i am new here. My name is Wu and I am 21 this April, I am from Hong Kong. Been in Singapore since Sec 1. My parents are not with me, and I live with my guardian (Who is a malaysian, no relationship at all). I just graduated from ITE Nitec on Medical Manufacturing Technology and I’ve already applied for Higher Nitec for Information Technology.</p>
              <p>I’ve just finished apply for the student pass. I am an international student, so the fees for higher nitec is very expensive, it’s 9,190 per term. I need to study this course for 2 years which means i need to pay 9,190 x 4 = 36,760. I just found out there is a big difference between this year and 2012. In 2012, is 1,954 per term, but now ??? Is 9,190 per term ???!!! Once my parents knew that, they said they can’t afford that much, oh forgot to mention, my guardian fee is 1,200 per month. So School fees + Guardian fees are about 2,700+</p>
              <p>My father is not working anymore while my mother is a head nurse but she is getting old, she is 51. They can’t really afford that much money for me to continue ITE. I just wanna ask your advices, what should I do or where should I go ?</p>
              <p>Go back to Hong Kong ? But where can I study in ? I only have a N level and a Nitec cert. Don’t even know what kind of school are available... I heard from my friends about studying in Singapore MDIS, Kaplan all these, what school are these ? What are the requirements ? Can I go in with my 2.6+ GPA ? Will the fees expensive ?</p>
              <p>Sorry for asking so many questions, it’s kinda urgent but I hope all the bros and sis can help me out... I really need to decide my future in 2 weeks time. Thank You and have a nice day ! :)</p>

              <p>Many china chinese who studied here had left singapore.  Their parents cannot afford the high costs here.  Since you are already here make full use of what you have now.  </p>
              <p>If you are not already aware about the super high cost of living here, recently there is a study show Singapore is the most expensive city in the world.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do some search on courses in hong kong or other countries.  Singapore is very expensive to us living here what more for foreigners who are not rich living and studying here.   </p>
              <p>You and parents have to know the reality and facts is  that the current government of Singapore has purposely make singapore expensive to benefit themselves.  Even china chinese told me the same.</p>

              The Koreans are doing it...The Filipinos paid less to get a job in Singapore...Besides, HK is not very far from the Philippines...plus you must see your financial situation as you have mentioned above..so you choose and decide...and do your research...right.
