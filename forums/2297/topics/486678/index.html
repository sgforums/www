              <p>what makes you think you are gonna fail your english Os? I took the paper yesterday too...it was hard so i think the bell curve for passing will be lower. Anyway you should focus on your other subjects first then think about this haha. jia you!</p>
              <p>Retain means you have to take all the subjects. If you retain next year, they will take the better grade of the two (: One of my friend retain...so i know.</p>
              <p>you can opt for private candidate.</p>

              <p>Hi, if u failed English, if u get E8 i dont think u can get into poly leh... Worst come to worst u can get into NP's early childhood education or ITE. ITE isnt that bad anyway. try to pray for a D7? Then all the polys will take u in if provided you get at least Bs for ur other subjects. But dont worry, you can retake ur english next year provided ur grades &lt; 20 otherwise there's no reason to retake only english as a private candidate. But u only have 1 last chance. Cherish it and pass ur english. Cheers! Right now, dont care how u fared for ur english paper. Work hard for ur other subjects especially Maths and Combined Humans! Polys look at ur EL, Humans and ur Maths. I failed maths last year and i took maths this year as a private candidate so i know. Cheers! I just passed my paper 1 by 1 mark and im afraid that i cant pass my O maths agn! LOL. </p>
              <p>Source : 17 points for my 'O's including D7 for my maths last year.</p>

              <p>Firstly...TBH, even myself feels that I might fail(for last year paper). But eventually got away with a C6. So I advice you to just continue working hard for other subjects. Stop thinking about the English paper, it might affect your other subjects. </p>
              <p>I believe you also know that if you gotten D7, there are some courses which accepts students with D7, but they need to retake during their first year. </p>

              <p>I'm a private candidate for this year and I'm retaking English this year.</p>
              <p>Can I know what's you definition of 'flunked'? Which part you did not do well?</p>
              <p>I got 21 points for 5 subjects including English (E8) and I find it not worth to retake the whole subject combinations again.</p>
              <p>What I can only say is, this year, compared to last year, it is slightly harder. Definitely, the bell curve will drop. However, it does not mean that we rely on bell curve to pull us up. In the end, it is our performance that contributed the most to determine our grades.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all the best for Listening Comprehension.</p>

              <p>Combo12: oh hi , thanks eh its like everything I prepared were not tested. For paper 1 there wasnt any question on argumentative and expository . So I had to do Q3 ( biggest influence on your life ) . It was my first time doing such topic Loool I spent whole year preparing expository lol..... so I dont suppose I can do well for ir</p>
              <p>Paper 2 the questions are really weird lol never seen them before..... and so ya...... Both papers I screwed up.</p>

              <p>I see and understand how you feel.</p>
              <p>Yeah, this year, surprisingly, argumentative didnt come out. If you had closely analysis the past 10 years it come out, there is also a year where argumentative didnt came out as well. For the last 10 years, discursive essays always come out 1 or 2 or even 3!</p>
              <p>For Paper 2, I must say that I cannot blame the teachers for not teaching us. In the end, we know roughly what type of questions it will come out. For instance, like Passage A 1st questions, it ask us to identify 3 examples to show that the visiability of the mountain is not clear( They taught us before ). There is only 1 question from Passage A which can be directly lift( Not the entire sentence) from the passage(points) to the answers. The other one required us to answer in our own words.</p>
              <p>The visual text is terribly demanding compared to last year and I myself, find it hard to answer. If you could still remember the 3rd questions, we have to answer 3 parts based on the icon to in order to get 1 mark!</p>
              <p>Passage B is still managable. The first 3 out of 4 questions are contextual clues question and you can copy directly to your question booklet as the question did not ask us to answer in our own words. Therefore, we do not require to create extra troubles to substitute the words from the passage. Also, the summary is neither easy or diffcult. As long as you manage to write at least a draft with words being replaced or substitiuted, Im sure you can get at least 4/7 marks for language for attempting to change words with the same meaning to a certain degree.</p>
              <p>Do not worry and brag on that. It is time to focus on LC.</p>

              <p>Im in ITE studying Network Security Technology. However, the course doesn't interest me and Im planning to go to Poly once I had gotton my results on Next Year January.</p>
              <p>Well, I didnt make a wise decisions. I retake E-Maths, Combined Humanities (Both B3) and English (E8). My cut off point is currently 21.</p>
              <p>Dont follow my path though unless you are the one who likes that particular subject a lot.</p>
              <p>For me, many people may not understand me the reason behind Im taking Maths and Combined Humaities as I had gotton B3 for it. It is the interest I have on those subject. However, English should always be the priority for me this year. When I have spare time, I will always practice my Maths and Combined Humanities.</p>
              <p>However, I always have to stay up late at night( as late as 2am ) to study those 3 subjects. No choice, but sometimes, if i work hard for this year, I wont have to struggle for my future.</p>
              <p>To study English, I urge you to write a essay a week ( any format ). Also, sometimes looking at answer key without doing also may be a better way (for me) to analysis the questions as this is a good way on how to answer a question. </p>

              <p>I withdrawn from NYP this year to retake my maths as I'm not interested in the course im taking. I will enter Poly again next year but as a Year 1 student again. To retake, you must have self-discipline. I dont wanna spend so much $$ on private schools to retake maths because they require me to retake at least 3 main subjects which costs over $3000. So i decided to be independent and study at home. The course i want to go which is in business, requires me to pass my Maths. I scored 3 B3s and 1 A2 for my other subjects except for my Maths which is D7..</p>
              <p>Yes the Maths Paper 1 for me is quite hard as I only managed to get a borderline pass on that paper because this is the 1st time i have seen questions which i have never done in the TYS before! For paper 2 it's quite manageable but i only managed to get a B for that paper. I think the bell curve for this year's maths shud be lower than last year's. I hope i can pass. :)</p>

              requires me to pass my Maths. I scored 3 B3s and 1 A2 for my other
              subjects except for my Maths which is D7..</p>
              <p>Yes the Maths Paper 1 for me is quite hard as I only managed to
              get a borderline pass on that paper because this is the 1st time i
              have seen questions which i have never done in the TYS before! For
              paper 2 it's quite manageable but i only managed to get a B for
              that paper. I think the bell curve for this year's maths shud be
              lower than last year's. I hope i can pass. :)</p>

              <p>Hi, I need to clarify a few things. I wrote my O level this year and I am waiting for my results... I suddenly have a fear that I might fail english as I did quite badly...  The subjects that I take are HTL, A math, Emath, Chem, Phy, Elec Humans, Eng</p>
              <p>If I get A1 For all my other subjects and D7 for Eng, can I know what options do I have? </p>
              <p>If I pass Eng and get c6, I can get 6-4= 2 points( L1 -HTL) , and go for a good JC... But if my English drops to D7... I just want to know what can I do after that... So that I don't panic when I get the results...</p>
              <p>Even though I have not failed English before in my 4 years of secondary school life, I have a slight worry as the paper was hard... Thanks in advance.</p>
