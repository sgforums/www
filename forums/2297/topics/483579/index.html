              <p>Hey everyone, Im currently a NSF that just started serving NS, ORD-ing in Feb 2016. I completed my A levels in 2013 and applied for all 3 unis just like any other students. I have received 3 offers from the 3 different Unis ( SMU, NUS, NTU). Personally, im not a science kid, i did badly for sciences in fact :( My grades were Econs(A), Maths(B), Physics(C), Geography(A). Im still undecided as to which course i should accept.</p>
              <p>SMU - Business Management</p>
              <p>NUS - FASS ( I intending to go for Econs )</p>
              <p>NTU - Econs</p>
              <p><br>I was hoping for some advice on to how the courses would be like for each university and the propects they would offer along with any random or small bits of information about the University like maybe campus life, exchange programmers, etc. Any information would be greatly appreciated :) Thank You ! :)</p>

              <p>My impression of SMU students is that they are more outspoken, and SMU's culture is to groom students to be vocal, confident people. It would be good if you are the extroverted sort.</p>
              <p>As for NUS, NTU, I think they are more or less the same. Between them, it would boil down to campus and course structure (whether you want to pursue a direct-honours programme or not).</p>

              <p>@SBS2601D : I really enjoy economics in my JC days as i personally felt that it is a subject that is very much alive and easily relatable. It was also interesting and very much applicable for me.</p>
              <p>For what I would want to learn, i would feel that I would like to learn something that is not very much dead ( No offence ) eg. history, physics that i find it hard to study as it doesn't really link well with me. Yet however, at the same time, i would also have to be practical and of course also go with the course that offers a better prospect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@deathmaster : Thank you. Yes, im the extroverted kind which like to be involved in activities and enjoy group discussions. Sorry but my university knowledge is quite minimal, what would you be refering to when you are saying direct honours programme ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@chemguide7 : Thank you :) Yes I've heard tons of things about Econs at university level from SMU, NTU, NUS. They said stuff about heavy weightages in stats and calculus, a strong math foundation would be good. Whatever you learn at JC level is much much different compared to uni level. Econs grads have very little prospects mostly teachers specially since Econs is branded as an Social Science/Arts degree :(</p>

              <p>Is your interest in economics so superficial that you are less than interested in finding out about the fundamental basis behind the theorems that you so happily learn in JC?</p>
              <p>If so, Econs is not for you. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>As for Econs = teaching.....dunno where you get that idea from. </p>
              <p>In any case, prospects are for you to discover.</p>
              <p>They don't drop on your lap just because you have a cert.</p>
