              <p>You need to enquire whether is it possible for you to switch from Accountancy to eg. Econs in Faculty of Arts and Social Science in NUS. Arts faculty requires you to take a major together with minors (eg. history, literature, math) which you probably did not do much in poly.</p>
              <p>Econs and Business studies are more general than accountancy. You need to be the top (maybe) 5% in your poly cohort to enter NUS and NTU. NUS and NTU each have their own strengths. NUS Arts faculty is more established than NTU.</p>
              <p>Econs students still need to compete with Business studies students for eg. banking jobs. And some employers may prefer a Business degree grad over an Econs grad.</p>

              <p>FASS doesnt require one to take minors. And math is not offered by FASS.</p>
              <p>And why do people still associate Econs with finance?</p>
              <p>Financial Economics is really just one section of Economics.</p>
              <p>If it seems that many with Econs degree are going for finance, it really is a representation of the situation with other faculties also, including engineering and science!</p>

              <p>Even if you aren't, the above sentence still stands!</p>
              <p>Anyhow, FASS offers minor, but there isnt really any "program" of sorts except the special ones. Basically if you say you wanna do theatre studies as minor, nobody really gives a hoot there and you just get by your own way.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>TS comes from poly accountancy.</p>
              <p>TS may find it useful to know that Econs as taught in FASS can involve math of rather high difficulty levels which poly students have tended to struggle.</p>

              <p>Are you really very interested in the research prospect? Like all other majors, research in Econs is not easy at all and not rewarding unless you have some insatiable curiosity and are willing to use ALL methods available to you (math, statistics, psychology, field experiments, loads of dreaming and reading) to do your research.</p>
              <p>Take Econs because you are interested in it.</p>
              <p>Screw the "job prospects" mentality.</p>
              <p>If you find yourself able to excel in anything you do, you will find opportunities associated with it.</p>
              <p>Try and find out the syllabus first before you make your choice. Because many entered Econs only to find it way more difficult than they expected, especially poly students!</p>
              <p>FASS Econs quite probably holds more prestige than NTU in the job market if you are curious about that.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, NUS Econs &gt; SMU Econs as well, because the one in NUS is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hardcore</span> theoretical stuff. Of course that is my opinion and if you think SMU is for you, go for it!</p>
              <p>And I think that if you want biz fluff, one doesnt need to learn at SMU. Can always do internships and work part-time etc to learn the ways of the working world.</p>
