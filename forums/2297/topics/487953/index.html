              <p>Basically I have enrolled into ngee Ann poly.</p>
              <p>i don't really like the course and had been very skeptical about the course and its prospects.</p>
              <p>finally I had called to find out what it is and to my horror, it's isn't as perfect as it seems on the webpage.</p>
              <p>so right now, I am applying to other Polys via dae which I not sure whether they will let me in or not.</p>
              <p>so now how? High chance that they might reject me. I know it's kind of too late.</p>
              <p>i am very depressed about this.Â </p>
              <p>As backup plans , I have some ques:</p>
              <p>1) if let say my dae successful, what should I do next? Like withdraw and ...?</p>
              <p>2) I had also purchased a laptop from ngee Ann poly and had bought their warranty as well, if I withdraw suddenly, my warranty no more le?</p>
              <p>3) if say dae not successful, what gpa must I have to change my field of studies in uni?</p>

              <p>yes, you may have purchased your laptop from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, but it's the roadshow that you purchased it from, not Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Warranty should be from the company that makes the laptop. Even if you change institution along the way, it should still be valid, until it expires.</p>
              <p>Whereas for GPA, of course the higher the better. Minimum is around 3.2 for courses in our local government universities.</p>

              <p>Ya if ur dae successful, you should dropout from ur current course because you are only allowed to take 1 course at one time. You need to attend an interview for the DAE course to show that you have chosen the course not out of recklessness.</p>
              <p>But plz be reminded that the adminstrative office will only consider courses that are more than ur cop for eg. 17 points for ur 'O's, you shud apply for 18 pointers courses.</p>
              <p>DAE abit too late le leh for most of the polys I think u can wait till april 10 and appeal cause the DAE application period has alr ended. Try calling all the polys by their hotlines and not email as emailing would take too long for them to reply. Good luck!</p>
