              Hello there, I have a question.
              
              I'm currently studying in JC and I am tentatively in the Physics-Chemistry-Maths-Econs stream for my JC, with H2 for PCM and H1 for E.
              
              I wish to know how taking Economics would affect the chances of entering a good university. I am also considering appealing for a different stream, namely Physics-Chemistry-Maths-H1 Literature.
              
              I am rather enthusiastic at Literature and as such, I am wondering whether I should just "go for it" and if it would affect my chances of entering a good university.
              
              I am probably aiming for future courses in Chemistry, though, and I'm probably going to try my very best for UC Berkeley or similar-standard universities.
              
              Would dropping Economics be detrimental, given I already have more than a basic understanding of the key points of Economics, and have little to no interest in the market?

              <p>I would personally feel that economics at A level was a great tool in understanding much of what goes on around us.</p>
              <p>But I buy the argument that following your interest should take precedence.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless we might not know fully if our interest is really such at this point, and in such cases, I would just "follow the heart" and not look back.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Another point is that you may find out the distinction rate for lit. Lit is rather subjective and maybe harder to score.</p>
              <p>Econs is more marketable, but your interests are important too.</p>

              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your replies! They've really helped me with understanding what I would be getting myself into.</p>
              <p>However, I would also want to ask about some other questions.</p>
              <p>1) The scores obtained in the A-levels are also calculated in the University Admission Score (UAS). Do US/UK universities pay attention to this score? </p>
              <p>2) Do universities take CIP hours into account?</p>
              <p>3) Are certificates of participation from competitions involving the subject being majored, such as the Olympiads, accepted as valid documentation during application?</p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Pardon me, I am off the tangent. I am a chem major and IMHO, I would like to inform you that this degree is not the "best" "marketable" degree.</p>
              <p>Money wise, your earning power may not be that fantastic compared to that of banking and finance.</p>
              <p>This degree is rather limiting in the type of careers you can do.</p>
              <p>However, having an Ivy League degree sets you apart, and you may go into govt Admin dept and be a high flier there. But a finance degree is much more practical.</p>
              <p>About undergrad life, The lab chemicals are real switch off for me. I walked past a NUS chem lab, smelled some funny gas, and I got a sore throat for weeks. You need to be able to endure the "toxic" chemical effects. After 6 hr of lab non-stop, my shirt smells like the chemicals. My research lab nearly caught fire after my PhD mentor forgot to switch off the power supply to a distillation device. These are the adventures of chem students. But theoretical chem can be real interesting.</p>
              <p>But if you are real interested in chem, then go for it. Get a PhD and be a prof or start a research company and do R&amp;D. Sometimes, you can strike millions if you are the science entrepreneur. Prof also earns well but not as well as high flying finance professionals. If you are going to the US, then maybe you can consider staying there as the chem there is more advanced than Sg. The scientific culture is there. However, the Indians are getting the chem jobs as their pay are real low and the US chemists are not happy.</p>
