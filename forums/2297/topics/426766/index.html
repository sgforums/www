              <p>if you aren't interested in doing anything related to science or engineering when you are in uni, then it'll be a gd idea to switch. H2 Econs isn't really tt much more, in terms of content, than H1 Econs. there are some additional skills, but the difference isn't as great as the difference between H2 Maths and H1 Maths. H1 Maths is heck of a lot easier than H2 Maths.</p>
              <p>having said tt, not doing H2 Maths means you really can't do science or engineering courses in uni. </p>

              <p>is it still possible for you to upgrade your h1 econs to h2?</p>
              <p>if you are struggling with math, yes, i would suggest you to downgrade it. yes, its true that you will not meet the requirements for science and engineering courses if you do that, which is pretty much pointless for a science student.</p>
              <p>BUT, at the end of the day, its the grades you get which are more important.</p>
              <p>engineering and most science courses will involve alot of math, and i assume that you weak in math, therefore dislike math, hence is not interested to take up such courses in uni.</p>
              <p>so, why not just settle for your stronger subjects? if econs is your interest, why not go for it?</p>

              <p>hi guys!</p>
              <p>omg my last post seems to have gotten deleted off ): spent an hour getting it down. anw, i'm taking a levels as a private candidate this yr, i took it once back in 2008. I was previous from CJC. i did badly the first time because i gave up studying in july and totally went it for a levels unprepared so i guess i deserve the results which i've gotten. i went in 1hr 15mins late for my chem paper ): i wasnt focused then but 2 yrs working has catapulted me back to reality.</p>
              <p>H2 Chem E, Bio S, Math U, H1 Econs C, GP D.</p>
              <p>since jan, i've been taking lessons from a private sch offering the sg a level programme. so far i've made quite alot of improvement in math because the teacher's pretty good. the geog teacher's quite passionate abt teaching as well. but the gp and econs teachers leave much to be desired out of my hefty school fees! chem teacher is very knowledgable and knows many of the latest exam question trends but problem is, he doesnt give homework and so i havent had any work marked since the beginning of the year so i dont actually know how i fare in my written work for chemistry at the moment.</p>
              <p>current subj combi: H2 math, econs, chem, h1 geog</p>
              <p>dropped bio because it was my least fav subj back in jc and took on geog as a new subj. i've heard that last yr's chem paper was a killer! so i'm wondering, whether i even stand a chance in getting a B at least for chem? ): since i;ve got to compete with people from the top 5 colleges who may even have experience in H3 chem! the private sch offers management of business as well as a H2 subject as well so i'm wondering if i should drop my chem and take up mob instead. i really need to choose soon so that i can start studying hardcore for all my subj ):</p>
              <p>i dont plan on doing anything related to science but i'm interested in accountancy, business courses and FASS in the local unis. yet i have to add that the mob teacher in school isnt good and seems rather unprepared at times. he's not able to answer our queries well and even tells us to smoke through the answers most of the time. sigh!</p>
              <p>i need to know if there are any good tuition places i can go to for chem? like places whereby the stress level is higher and which give lots of homework eg 2 sets of prelim papers to be done per week because i only seem to perform well under stress  O: i live around the thomson area.</p>
              <p>would love to hear opinions from some forumers to aid me in making a decision quick! D:</p>

              <p>Since you're a full-time private candidate (assuming you're not working part-time or full-time now), you might as well take 4H2s. When calculating your Uni admission score, downgrade your lousiest H2 subject into a H1 weightage. And H2s are always used as prerequisites for Uni courses, not H1 subjects, so it makes sense to take your subjects at H2 levels.</p>
              <p>Between Econs and Chem though, it's far more important to take Chem at H2 level. Because most (or all) Econs-based Uni courses don't require H2 Econs as prerequisite, while all Chem-based Uni courses require H2 Chem as prerequisite. Even if you say you "don't plan on doing Science in the Uni", but you do want to keep your options open, don't you?<br><br>As for wanting the 'stress level to be high', you can always stress yourself, if you've self-discipline you won't need an external source to force you to do whatever you want to do. For instance, you can always choose to force yourself to do (and mark) 1 set of Prelim Papers per day (rotate across subjects), regardless of your tuition center or private school. </p>
