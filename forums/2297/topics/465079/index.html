However,I am more passionate in studying Bio(i got A1 for prelims.) I will like to know the content that I will be covering for Bio/Phy,so that I can decide between the two. I am also considering 'die die' score A for either Bio/Phy. </p>

              <p>From a tutor viewpoint, there are more people looking for H2 Physics tuition than H2 Bio tuition, so.... ;)</p>
              <p>From what I heard from my students, H2 Bio is mostly memorisation, pure mugging. For H2 Physics, I would say lots of visualizations are needed; and the most basic test will be how well do you really understand Newton's First and Second laws at O levels. I have had students who got their As at O levels, but don't really understand Newton's Laws.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, you mentioned you are passionate in studying Biology. Passion is one of the most important consideration. If you don't have the same or equally strong passion for Physics, in my opinion, it will be better to take H2 Bio, because you will give your utmost to do well in it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My personal story in JC was that I scored badly for Economics, but I really liked the subject. I put in extra efforts in it during the later half of J2, and it never tires me because I really love reading up about Economics. The first time I got a B was during prelims, and the first time I got my A was A levels. Throughout JC, I never scored higher than a C, but I scored at last. Passion pulled me through. I was considering an Engineering-Econs double degree after that, but NUS didn't offer it until my 3rd year. Until now, I'm thinking if I would take a PhD in Economics in SMU in the future (after my current Engineering PhD application goes through).</p>
              <p>I didn't think of Econs tuition at that time, or I didn't know of any, or probably it wasn't popular back then. My classmates helped me lots. But of course, I'm pretty sure the Econs tutor at my centre will do a much better job than my classmates in teaching <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>im taking h2 bio, its mostly memorising, with  alot of application, 
              structure of yr answer must be good. it is pretty hard to score unless u
               memorise all the points and regurgitate everything out. so standard compared to o lvl bio is very diff as o lvl just memorise and write the stuff. anw u say u 
              want to take medicine, bio is actly not a prerequisite for medicine 
              course though i think it is much much more useful to take bio than 
              physics.however, do rmb that biophysics is taught in medicine course too. if u rly want medicine, be prepared to work hard for it and take up leadership roles blah and blah  make your records sparkle so u can get accepted into the course. if not very hard leh...unless u go Nus-duke med sch which is a graduate sch meaning u must first get yr bachelors degree (need not be  bio-related/ science related ) first, then u can study medicine, this is a less competitve pathway then going to get a medicine degree straightway but it is longer and maybe by that time yr brain cells too dead to go med grad sch ardy.</p>

              <p>I share with you a revelation:I write so much for my o levels till my right hand(middle finger to last finger) are callused and look very rough right now.(not boasting) Work hard not enough,you need to work smart,haha<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">. I was consistent for my O levels. (started revision at start of sec 3 not at the mid or the end) I will strive to take up leadership positions and step out of my comfort zone(of course,easier said than done,but i am more of a doer than talker) If let's say I can't get in,then it is not end of the world for me,lol i am optimistic of my future.(maybe biomedical research scientist,biotech,maybe engineer(worse come worse))</p>
              <p>Haha,my brain cells will be powered up and energetic.(I can't say in future,but with my determination,YES!) If i hold onto this belief,I will be 100% confident(no probably,what if) and be likely to reach my goals.High-five, I love bio as compared to chem,phy but i did badly for O's. I need to be realistic for my future.</p>
              <p>Went to see my bio/phy sec sch teacher today.Bio teacher suggested i go for my passion bio course.Phy teacher referred me to a medical student who will speak to me about my subject choices.</p>
              <p>Overall,I will apply for overseas if i fail to get in local medicine course,or look into other options.As the saying goes,if you aim to get five apples from the tree,you will surely get two to three apples but if you don't aim for three,you may only get one.

              <p>Thanks,I was rejected by pjc but i got in jjc.No matter what school i go into,if it is a jc,I should be happy about it and move on with life there.Nothing to complain about,just have got to get used to it.I enjoy studying but this year,I am going to balance my studies and rest time. I feel that I can achieve better results that way</p>
