              <p>The theory is not hard from the notes. What I guess is that you have problems in the techniques of answering such questions.</p>
              <p>Basically, you take materials from the notes, and apply case studies, to support the points.</p>
              <p>Example: Explain price elasticity of demand. (Q5 part i)</p>
              <p>You can start off by defining what is price elasticity of demand. Then draw some graphs and illustrate the point. Raise a case study. Use the graph and concepts, together with the case study, and explain your points out on what happen. I.e. when P goes up, Q goes up more proprotionately.</p>
              <p>Basically, it's almost regurgitating from notes + using case studies and applying it.</p>
              <p>Ideally, for this part alone, you should be writing about 3/4 to 1 full side, with a big proportion of the space for your graph. Your graph should be large. Don't draw it too small.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can visit the stickies, under useful resources. There should be a link to some RJC model Economics essays to take a look and understand the how-to of answering essay questions.</p>

              <p>From the fact that you used the word "module", I guess it is safe enough to assume you are a poly or uni student.</p>
              <p>I strongly suggest you to save your parents' money and drop out and take another course. If you don't even know why you are studying, and have so many problems with basic stuffs, there should be no reason for you to be even in the course.</p>
              <p>I apologise here if I sound nasty, but as a teacher, I don't want students to foolishly take up courses just because "I was given this choice". You will regret it, as you will not work as hard as others due to a lack of passion for the course. You may deny it, but if you were to work hard, you wouldn't be asking us here about stuffs which you are meant to read up on your own.</p>

              <p>The trouble dear, is that these questions are definition-based questions, without any analysis needed.

              <p>At Homework Forum, we help students who are willing to learn and try out, students who are stuck in understanding concepts, not students who are waiting to be spoonfed on basic definition of terms and giving excuses why they cannot find the answers themselves.</p>

              <p>What is inflation ?</p>
              <p>All notes, textbooks and google it will give you three key words ie inordinate, sustained general increase in the price level.</p>
              <p>Next, the notes, textbooks, google it will explain their meanings ie inordinate ie excessive (not 0.1% increase), sustained ie over a period of time, general ie not due to only one or two but most.</p>
              <p>Hence, inflation is defined as the inordinate, sustained, general increase in the price level (The definition of inflation as too much money chasing too few goods will only be partially correct).</p>
              <p>In simple terms, inflation refers to the excessive increase in prices of most goods and services over a period of time usually over a year.</p>
              <p>Next, you just have to ask yourself why prices of most goods and services will increase. The reasons for these prices to increase will be the causes of inflation lah.</p>
              <p>So, it is not so difficult to answer the economic questions.</p>
              <p>You just have to ask yourself what you read, have you understood them, if not, which part you do not understand, are the words or terms that you do not understand, check up the meanings on an economic dictionary or google it, summarize what you have read as you read.</p>
              <p>Indeed, you can use the SQ3R method to study ie survey, question, read, recite and revise.</p>
