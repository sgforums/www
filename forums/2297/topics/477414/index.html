              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Congrats on the good Promo results!</p>
              <p>  Q1: Do some maths (school questions/Cambridge questions) everyday, depending on what you'd like to revise. Recent Cambridge exam trend suggests a mix of topics being assessed in a single question.</p>
              <p>  Q2: Believe that you can excel and take proactive actions to achieve that.</p>
              <p>  Q3: School assessment does not affect the A-level outcome, you do not need to be overly-stressed over them. Simply take these as rehearsals for the ultimate A-level exam.</p>
              <p>  Q4: Now that you are aware of complacency, always observe it and catch it by taking proactive actions to overcome it.</p>
              <p>  Merry Christmas!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Requilm,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Those are very decent Promos results indeed. Well done!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">More
                      than a decade ago, I was in your exact same shoes and dreaded the dawn of JC2.
                      However, it turned out to be my most enjoyable year in college. The camaraderie
                      shared / time spent with my classmates in mugging for the endless tests and
                      exams really helped us bond together. In fact, all my ten ‘brothers’ for my
                      wedding were my JC-mates!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Given
                      the fast pace of the upcoming academic year, I believe there are a few things
                      which you can note:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231; text-indent: -18pt;">Every test henceforth does not really ‘count’. Prospective
                      employers/scholarship boards are more interested in your prelim results / ‘A’
                      level results, and the other assessments take up a peripheral role. Hence use
                      these checkpoint tests to </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">make mistakes</span><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231; text-indent: -18pt;">! E.g. if you’re exploring
                      modifications to your writing style, or you plan to devote more time to
                      planning before writing your essays, do them right away and refine your
                      approach along the way. This way, you’ll be better prepared before the final
                      exams.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 1.231; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify;">Start making your own condensed notes. I’ve had
                      students who planned to study the same set of lecture notes (multiple
                      iterations) in preparing for the Mar test, mid-year test, pre-prelims, prelims,
                      then the ‘A’ levels. Such repeated reading does not really help. Instead, when
                      preparing for the mid-year, use the revision time to do up your own notes
                      (condensed version of lecture notes, with additives e.g. concept maps). Let’s
                      call this set of notes version 1. When reading for prelims, do a version 2
                      based on version 1 (an even more condensed version). Final revision for ‘A’
                      levels, you don’t really need to do notes anymore. This way, you streamline the
                      amount which you have to read through, and this may be more effective. Remember,
                      lecture notes are excellent for teaching purposes, but not necessarily for aiding
                      revision.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 1.231; text-indent: -18pt; text-align: justify;">Lastly, based on your commendable results, you
                      may already be serving as a mentor to some of your classmates. If not, now’s
                      the time to start sharing your knowledge! I learn better when I explain
                      concepts to others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231; text-indent: -18pt;">Of course, don’t neglect the wonderful interactions
                      you could be sharing with your friends (excellent networking opportunities
                      too)! Enjoy JC2, while it lasts </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings;

              <p>Just to add that for your upcoming tests, some results may be intended as a 'signal' to students - i.e. if teachers are especially rigorous and stringent in marking for one test, that could serve as a wake-up call to students falling into complacency.</p>
              <p>Hence, keep a resilient mindset and soldier on!</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/things-consider-sending-child-tuition-classes-102823408.html">Moreover, parents who are fixated on their children's academic performance instill a spirit of competition in their children. In today's Information Age, however, what's needed in order to excel is a spirit of curiosity, rather than a spirit of competition.</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/things-consider-sending-child-tuition-classes-102823408.html">There's an incredible amount of information available on the internet, which means that if you want to become knowledgeable in some field, you probably could. It just requires that you have enough genuine curiosity to compel you to look up the information online.</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;"><a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/things-consider-sending-child-tuition-classes-102823408.html">If students are caught up trying to compete with their peers and outperform them, it's difficult to cultivate a real love for learning and discovery—the things that form the basis of a meaningful education and of long-term success in the Information Age.</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">Furthermore, if students feel like they're being forced to improve academically, there's a limit to how successful they can become. To achieve success—I'll go one step further and use the word "greatness"—in any field, you need to make a conscious decision to be great.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">After all, no great pianist, athlete, engineer, doctor, mechanic, nurse or entrepreneur became that way without intentionally <em>choosing</em> the path of excellence.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">You can't force anyone to become great. It's possible to force someone to become mediocre or even good, but greatness requires commitment.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">If parents make their children go for tuition classes without also empowering them to take full responsibility for their own education, it's impossible for the children to become great students.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.453125px;">At the heart of it, greatness is much more a matter of will than it is of skill. Before we teach our students the skill of studying more effectively and of doing better on exams, we need to encourage them to make a deliberate choice about their education, their future and their life.</p>
