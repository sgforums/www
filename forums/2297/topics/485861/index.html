              <p>I'm sec 4 this year, studying in a neighbourhood school. NEVER studied at all from sec 1-3 but managed to meet the minimum grades to promote every time. Now that I'm sec 4, I know that getting a few C5s is not enough. I am taking 6 subjects. I aim to get:</p>
              <p>English:B3</p>
              <p>E-Math: A1/2</p>
              <p>Combined science(phy/chem):A1</p>
              <p>Computer studies:A2</p>
              <p>Chinese:B4(got nervous during oral)</p>
              <p>Humanities(history/social studies): B3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How hard would I have to study in order to get these results? I'm not a slow learner but not super smart either. Can anyone who has gone through O levels share their experiences with me and how hard they studied?</p>
              <p>Oh and any study tips for any of the subjects above would be welcomed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>Humanities - practice the formats, memorise the information. regurgitate.</p>
              <p>Physics and Chemistry - right now, memorise the concepts and practice.</p>
              <p>Emath -  this subject is very easy to score. to excel in it, you should practice on geometry - "Angles, triangles and polygons", "Mensuration", etc - finding angles, length, etc.</p>
              <p>English - paper 1: memorise situational writing formats and read the 'good' letters/speeches selected by your teachers. For the format, it's best to know every format - rather than find a 'pattern' and predict which format will come out - because the format last year may come out again this year. Whereas for the essay, choose the easiest question to do.  paper 2: well, I did the comprehension questions first. (sorry, I cannot remember how I did it.) (well, I took my O levels in 2012. The syllabus for English is different now. Not sure if this is still relevant.) </p>
              <p>Chinese - paper 1: read 'good' works (email and essay) selected by your teachers. do the easy question for essay. paper 2: (sorry, I cannot remember how I did it).</p>
              <p>To be honest, I was not a good student. During my O level days, I would simply mug and try to remember everything just before I go to the exam room, and "pour everything out" in the paper.</p>
              <p>Well, the ideal method is to practice. You should do all the TYS papers and other school's prelim papers. Form/join study groups. Consult your teachers.</p>
              <p>If you find it difficult to form/join study groups and/or consult your teachers, ask your Form Teacher(s) to help you form/join study groups and/or contact teachers to help you. I am sure he/she will help. Otherwise, ask your Level Head (Co-ordinator) to help you. </p>

              <p>'O' levels at my time (in the 1990s) was very straight forward. Just memorise during studying and "vomit" out during exams.</p>
              <p>Now I can't even answer primary sch questions! So can't tell you what advice. No joke! See below:</p>
              <p>Jarran, Ken and Leo saved $660 altogether. Jarran's savings is half of the total savings by Ken and Leo. 1/4 of Ken's savings is $20 more than 1/5 of Leo's savings. Find the ratio of Ken's savings to Leo's savings.</p>
              <p>If I were to go back to sch now and take the current exams papers, confirm I will fail until jialat jialat.. I can't imagine the next generation's education standards....will def be much higher (children then really would have no life)!!!</p>

              <p>tys would be a typical pratice for o lvls and a gauge to how well u may do in o lvls. the requirement marks for the following subjects, by the bell curve i estimate:</p>
              <p>English B3 : 65 should be safe</p>
              <p>C.Humanities B3: 65 to 70</p>

              <p>you wonder how much you should relax, how much you should study, and how much to get your goal results, but you sound reluctant to give in your best effort.</p>
              <p>i have friends who chiong shows and dota before their o lvls but can still get L1R5 raw score 8-10. surely one can say that they are smart but essentially they <strong>clearly understand</strong> the concepts and some practice of tys and schl papers does it all, aside from memorising stuffs for combined humanities.</p>
              <p>16 hrs is hardcore, so of course it is very good to be efficient but before that i would advise you not to  underestimate o lvls.</p>

              <p>The answer is Ken 6: Leo 5.</p>
              <p>K+L+1/2K+1/2L=1.5K+1.5L<br> 1.5K+1.5L=660<br> K+L=660 x 1/1.5=440<br> <br> 1/4K=1/5L+20<br> K-4/5L=80<br> So, 9/5L=440-80=360<br> L=200<br> K=440-200=240<br> <br> K:L= 6:5</p>

              <p>not really very hard actually...if you know what's happening in class and understand everything so far..all you needa do is practice...PRACTICE REALLY HARD.</p>
              <p>i had some kind of annoying condition for the 3 weeks before o levels and even during the exam period...studying was impossible for that one month...but somehow managed to scrape through.. i am guessing it's only because i was listening to the teacher's lessons attentively..not much of a punctual-with-homework person either....you gotta experience JC bro! That is the real thing!</p>
