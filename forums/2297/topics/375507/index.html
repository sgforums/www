              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Enjoy reading the following article about maths research that has been written by Anton Zettl. Thank you.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>
              <p>  I want to start by saying a few words about research in Mathematics generally. Describing research in mathematics to an audience not familiar with the language of the subject is a formidable task, one that may well be beyond my capabilities. Nevertheless I will make an attempt.</p>
              <p>  It is more difficult to explain, to a general audience, research in mathematics<br>than it is to explain research in many other fields, including the<br>Sciences. Not because mathematics is deeper than the sciences, but because<br>scientists have the advantage of being able to build on common human experiences<br>and to rely on intuitive meanings of commonly used terms. Thus<br>a Physicist can talk about an atom and all of us prescribe some meaning<br>to this term. She can then go on to tell us what it really is and describe its<br>fascinating properties. Similarly a geologist can talk about ancient volcanic<br>rocks in lake superior and a biologist can discuss the genetic and molecular<br>analysis of certain viruses.</p>
              <p>  A mathematician does not enjoy such a luxury. People outside the field<br>do not normally encounter the spectrum of a differential operator and even<br>if they did they probably wouldn't be aware of it.<br>Everything in mathematics, even the numbers 1,2,3, ... has been painstakingly<br>and rigorously defined in terms of basic set theory. So when a mathematician<br>discusses the differential equation</p>
              <p>y'' + q(t)y = 0 (1)</p>
              <p>every other mathematician knows precisely what he is talking about. There<br>is no ambiguity, no room for different "interpretations".</p>
              <p>  Research in mathematics consists of proving theorems. A theorem has<br>two parts: (i) a statement of a fact and (ii) its proof. The statement must<br>be clear and precise, the proof completely rigorous and based entirely on <br>logic. All terms used in the statement must be painstakingly and accurately<br>defined, the proof cannot leave any doubt about the validity of the<br>statement. Here mathematics differs from the sciences. Trying to prove a<br>theorem merely by confirming its validity in 27,650 special cases is totally<br>unacceptable in mathematics; no graduate student survives a basic course<br>with such an attempt. Some 5,000,000 special cases out of infinitely many<br>possibilities is an insignificant number.</p>
              <p>  Once a theorem has been proven it becomes part of the heritage of the<br>human race forever. The Pythagorean Theorem established by the Greeks<br>more than 2,000 years ago is as valid (and as useful) today as it was then;<br>the Chinese Remainder Theorem is more than 3,000 years old. A research<br>Mathematician simply adds to the collection of theorems. The number of<br>known theorems increases every day. The total accumulation of theorems<br>is so large that no human knows even one percent of them. Only God, and<br>possibly someone somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy, knows them all and<br>also those yet to be discovered.</p>
              <p>  How does one discover a theorem? Often part (i) expresses a pattern<br>observed in numerous examples. For part (ii) the challenge then is to prove<br>that, given the conditions of (i), this pattern always prevails. There are two<br>extremes: On the one hand you can take a known conjecture - a pattern<br>observed by someone else - and prove it. A prime example of this is Andrew<br>Wiles' proof of "Fermat's Last Theorem" (a misnomer - it should have<br>been called Fermat's Last Conjecture). A French lawyer named Fermat,<br>whose hobby was mathematics, claimed, in the margin of a book he was<br>reading at the time, to have proved a theorem. But only part (i) survived<br>him because he died before he was able to publish part (ii). This occured<br>more than 350 years ago. Fermat's part (i) became so famous that many<br>people devoted their life to finding part (ii) but only Wiles succeeded. If his<br>proof holds up - it is still being checked by experts - Wiles will join Euclid,<br>Archimedes, Newton, Leibnitz, Gauss, Fermat, Euler, etc. as one of the<br>immortals of Mathematics.</p>
              <p>  At the other extreme are people who find a new pattern for part (i)<br>and succeed in proving it. This way of discovering theorems can be utterly<br>worthless, if no one else is interested, or it can be a major breakthrough.<br>Often asking a good question is more important, and requires more insight,<br>than finding the answer.</p>
