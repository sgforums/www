              <div class="name">&gt;&gt;&gt; There are two senses in which Occam's razor can be seen at work in the history of science. One is <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/ontology"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">ontological</span></span></a> reduction by elimination and the other is by intertheoretic competition.</div>
              <div class="name">
              <p>In the former case the following are examples of reduction by elimination: The impetus of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/aristotle"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Aristotelian</span></span></a> <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/physics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Physics</span></span></a>, the angelic motors of medieval <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/celestial-mechanics"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">celestial mechanics</span></span></a>, the four humors of ancient and medieval medicine, <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/demonic-possession"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">demonic possession</span></span></a> as an explanation of mental illness, <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/phlogiston-theory"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">phlogiston theory</span></span></a> from premodern chemistry, and vital spirits of premodern <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/biology-3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">biology</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the latter case there are three examples from the history of science where the simpler of two competing theories each of which explains all the observed phenomena has been chosen over its ontologically bloated competitor: the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/nicolas-copernicus"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Copernican</span></span></a> <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/heliocentrism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">heliocentric</span></span></a> model of celestial mechanics over the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/ptolemy"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Ptolemaic</span></span></a> <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/geocentric"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">geocentric</span></span></a> model, the mechanical theory of heat over the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/caloric-theory"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Caloric theory</span></span></a>, and the Einsteinian theory of electromagnetism over the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/luminiferous-aether"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">luminiferous aether</span></span></a> theory. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an on-going) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "<em>While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research.</em>" &lt;&lt;&lt;</div>

              <div class="name">&gt;&gt;&gt; When discussing Occam's razor in contemporary <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/medicine-1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">medicine</span></span></a>, doctors and philosophers of medicine speak of diagnostic parsimony. Diagnostic parsimony advocates that when diagnosing a given injury, ailment, illness, or disease a doctor should strive to look for the fewest possible causes that will account for all the symptoms. While diagnostic parsimony might often be beneficial, credence should also be given to the counter-argument modernly known as <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/hickam-s-dictum"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Hickam's dictum</span></span></a>, which succinctly states that "patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please". It is often statistically more likely that a patient has several common diseases, rather than having a single rarer disease which explains their myriad symptoms.</div>
              <p class="name"> </p>
              <p class="name">Also, independently of statistical likelihood, some patients do in fact turn out to have multiple diseases, which by common sense nullifies the approach of insisting to explain any given collection of symptoms with one disease. These misgivings emerge from simple probability theory, which is already taken into account in many modern variations of the razor; and from the fact that the <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/loss-function"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">loss function</span></span></a> is much greater in medicine than in most of general science, namely loss of a person's health and potentially life, and thus it is better to test and pursue all reasonable theories even if there is some theory that appears the most likely.</p>
              <p class="name"> </p>
              <p class="name">Diagnostic parsimony and the counter-balance it finds in Hickam's dictum have very important implications in medical practice. Any set of symptoms could be indicative of a range of possible diseases and disease combinations; though at no point is a diagnosis rejected or accepted just on the basis of one disease appearing more likely than another, the continuous flow of hypothesis formulation, testing and modification benefits greatly from estimates regarding which diseases (or sets of diseases) are relatively more likely to be responsible for a set of symptoms, given the patient's environment, habits, medical history and so on. For example, if a hypothetical patient's immediately apparent symptoms include <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/fatigue-medical"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">fatigue</span></span></a> and <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/cirrhosis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">cirrhosis</span></span></a> and they test negative for <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/hepatitis-c"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Hepatitis C</span></span></a>, their doctor might formulate a working hypothesis that the cirrhosis was caused by their <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/alcoholism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">drinking problem</span></span></a>, and then seek symptoms and perform tests to formulate and rule out hypotheses as to what has been causing the fatigue; but if the doctor were to further discover that the patient's breath inexplicably smells of garlic and they are suffering from <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/pulmonary-edema"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">pulmonary edema</span></span></a>, they might decide to test for the relatively rare condition of <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/selenium"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">Selenium poisoning</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p class="name"> </p>
              <p class="name">Prior to effective anti-retroviral therapy for <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/hiv"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">HIV</span></span></a> it was frequently stated that the most obvious implication of Occam's razor, that of cutting down the number of postulated diseases to a minimum, does not apply to patients with <a class="ilnk" href="http://www.sgforums.com/topic/aids"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #003399;">AIDS</span></span></a> - as they frequently did have multiple infectious processes going on at the same time. While the probability of multiple diseases being higher certainly reduces the degree to which this kind of analysis is useful, it does not go all the way to invalidating it altogether - even in such a patient, it would make more sense to first test a theory postulating three diseases to be the cause of the symptoms than a theory postulating seven. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

              <p><br>Actually, I don't play the popular FPS (perhaps more due to a lack of hardware requirements rather than a lack of interest) such as CS. In fact, I don't play DOTA either (which is easily the most popular game in LAN shops now).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only FPS I played years ago was Unreal Tournament and Quake; only played WarCraft I and II, no WarCraft III or DOTA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never played WoW; only MMORPG ever played was (*gasp of utter shock from audience due to unforseeable, unpredictable, unfathomable twist in the plot revealed*) a game called Ultima Online (played it only for the PvP). (I've since sold off my account and moved on for good.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So other than King of Fighters 2002 (Omega Rugal, Choi Bungee, Iori Yagami) in the arcades, I no longer play any games at all (PC, XBox, PS, etc).</p>
              <p><br>But I did enjoy Diablo I and II, so when Diablo III is released next year in 2009, depending on financial situation then, I may or may not purchase a new higher end PC that would surely be required for Diablo III. We'll see how it goes then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Razer Krait mouse is really damn shiok to use sial. Serious.</p>
