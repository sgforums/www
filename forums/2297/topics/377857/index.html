When 19 coins are taken away from Box B, Box A and Box B will have the same amount of coins. The total values of coins in Box A more than Box B will become $1.30+$0.20X19=$5.10</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since each coin in Box A is worth $0.30 more than each coin in Box B, amount of coins in Box A=$5.10/$0.30=17 coins</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Hence, amount of money in Box A=17coinsX$0.50=$8.50</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. Draw out a model. You will see that 2 big units + a small unit = 890L, whereas a small unit = 170L. 1 big unit=360L after calculations, and amount of water put in = 1 big unit - 1 small unit=360L-170L=190L</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3. Amount of rice at first=15/15. Amount of rice after 3 days=4/5=12/15. Hence, after 7 more days, amount of rice=12/15-7/15=5/15=1/3. Thus,1/3 of the rice is 24kg, and the total amount of rice at first = 24kgX3=72kg.</p>

Since x=20+1/2x, x=40cm. Thus, the head=10cm, the body=40cm, the tail=30cm, and the entire dog=80cm.</p>

              <p>No it is alright, please don't apologise.</p>
              <p>For this question, we will have to work backwards.</p>
              <p>By selling 2/3 of the new remainder, she will have 1/3 of the new remainder left, and since all the cakes are sold out, 1/3 of the new remainder = 1/3 of a cake. Hence, the new remainder = 1 cake. This also means that 1/3 of the remaining cakes = (1+1/3) cakes. That means the total remaining cakes = 3X(1+1/3) = 4 cakes. </p>
              <p>Continuing on, this means that 1/3 of the original cakes = (4+1/3) cakes. Hence number of cakes at first, which will also be the number of cakes she sold, =3X(4+1/3)=13 cakes.</p>
