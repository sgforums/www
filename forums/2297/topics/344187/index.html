              <p>I just wanted to clarify something ppl. </p>
              <p>If a student actually appeals successfully into a jc, having failed to secure a place through the JAE process, what are the expectations the JC will have of the student? Would she or he be placed under 'academic probation' or is required to commit certain amount of time to the individual's CCA, which the applicant had used as her or his means of appeal into the institution? </p>
              <p>For me, I was admitted directly, so I do not know what successful appellants actually went through and I'm concerned if the above requirements persist, that students would actually find constricted by these demands especially when the academic work load starts pilling up. I'm sure those of you who went through Promos and Prelims know what I am talking about. Furthermore, successful appellants might not fit into the CCA they are required to commit to, and given their status, would be enable to leave their respective CCAs. Hence making life a living hell. I don't know, are my concerns unfounded? </p>

              <p>appeals are normally successful only when you have a strong track record in some CCA in which the JC needs people... the student will most likely be expected to perform well in that CCA for the school...</p>
              <p>other than that... very hard to appeal through...</p>
              <p>with respect to studies, be it going through appeal or direct intake, ALL students are expected to work hard, so no difference...</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  It's always best to ask the academic counsellors at the institutions of your interest. Much info that you need will be gleaned from them :) Go forth boldly and ask about your question, before the deadline for registration is up. Thanks!</p>
              <p>P.S. When I was teaching at AJC, students who appealed successfully are closely monitored in case they need additional help from teachers to catch up.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yeah, the sad thing is that he is just one point short of meeting the COP, so in terms of academic rigor as expected by the institution, he should not have a problem attaining that. But my concern is with the CCA per say, should he not attain the expectations the coaches have for him, then that inability to fulfill the institution's expectations would creep into his academics, which is dumb given that the prime reason he is there is to excel in his academics. </p></div>
