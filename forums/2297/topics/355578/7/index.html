              <p>There's isn't much difference (other than distance and location) in the first 1 or 2 semesters. You still have to do engineering maths and physics.</p>
              <p>Engineers are in uni to train and hone their analytical and creative skills.</p>

              <p>Teaching in MOE is a very noble profession because of the stress and work involved vs the amount of remuneration. It just doesn't tally. You still have my respect for choosing this path...</p>

              <p>Who do we have to thank for? Some Minister of education who believed that physical punishment is wrong.</p>
