              <p>Hi TS, dont give up hope. Cuz I had only A, C, C, in A levels and got into NUS common engineering. Ofcourse, you need alot of backup in your CCA to prove your other talents. Then I got A1 for CCA, holding numerous big posts as in general secretary of AVA club, badminton monitor, class chairman, prefects council, Staff Sergeant and Asst Head Libririan, etc. And in JC, was member in Band that got SYF silver, NYAA member etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And guess what, I graduated with 2nd Class Hons in Mechanical Engineering (NUS), way better than many of my peers who were from more reputed JCs and had more As.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All you need is to be given an opportunity/chance to show yourself. Remember to beseech the interviewer to give you a chance so that you can proof to them. :)</p>

              Yup, my sentiments exactly. Oh...by the way, even if you got 1 D! you will have a conditional 1 year "probation" in NTU engineering...my friend had that. The reason is NUS/NTU do not want only all the best people to get in, they want a good mix of people, with a range of grades.
              
              Having said that, those taking As, please do not get anything worse than a B,C,D. This is an almost no chance combination. What is left is to study overseas already, or go again as a private candidate. :(

              If you are in Mech Engineering (NUS), for me last time, be prepared to have 8 modules/subjects for every semester for the next 2 years. Year 3, besides IA, the other semester will see you taking 6 modules, than last year, on electives and CFM, other humanes, about 5 modules each. 
              
              You can see yourself somewhat getting back to O levels like that, but way way much easier to get better grades. Like e.g. if you always get D,F, etc in JC, then will most probably get B,Cs in the modules.

              i read this from another forum. 
              
              that a first class honours is easier to obtain in ntu. but if you get a first class in ntu, you may not even get second lower in nus. in terms of engineering that is. so is it wiser to go ntu, and stand a higher chance of getting first class or go nus, and get maybe second or third class honours. after all, employers would know that a first class degree fron ntu is not as good as a first class degree from nus.

              <p>I won't bet on that. Theres still a limit to how many people can get first class honours since everything is by GPA and its not like everyone can get it if not there won't be ppl with 2nd class like me and even people who kanna kick out of uni liao.</p>
              <p>I would definitely not agree that a NTU 1st class is not as good as a NUS 1st class. Likely whoever post that is a NUS student who just wants to 'advertise' his school.</p>

              hello. i just got an offer from ntu. they offered me engineering. 
              
              actually i was already quite decided on taking engineering since after results. but theres another prospect thats bothering me. ive heard people say that engineering is a sunset industry in singapore now. plus with foreign talent coming in and willing to accept lower salary, demand for local engineers will fall. 
              
              then theres another side that goes with the "engineers can do anything" theory. that demand for engineers,like accountants will always be there. so its kinda like a iron rice bowl. but then again, the manufacturing sector in singapore is indeed shrinking.
              
              ive also heard people say that to do well as an engineer, you have to go overseas. engineers dont do well in singapore. is that true??

              <p>Hey! U can join me at NTU! Haha! :) And to answer your question, engineering isn't a sunset industry. But of course it depends on your specialisation. But overall, engineering in Singapore is very much alive like what sbst275 said. The manufacturing sector in Singapore won't die off so fast. It is true that we would have to compete with the foreign talent so you have to consider it a motivation and challenge to do way better than them or else you will die off.</p>
              <p>That said, about the "engineers can do everything" theory, let me quote an example: My sis was a computer engineer by profession but she hated the job so much and quited after 2 years. After that, she took a masters in business and now she is working in a well-acclaimed investment analyst firm. What I'm trying to say is that even if you feel engineering is not your ultimate choice, sure you may have your regrets in the future. BUT you can always branch out to do anything you want next time. Business, the arts, service/private sector or maybe even a yoga instructor, etc; the world is your oyster!</p>
              <p>As for the last part, I ain't too sure. But think about it this way, if one already can't do his/her best in Singapore against the foreign talent, then what makes you think one can do better if they head over to a country breeming with a whole more "foreign talent"?</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>One more thing! Don't accept NTU's offer yet. Wait and see what NUS comes up with. For all you may know, you might get accepted into NUS common engineering! =D</p>
