              <p>Thanks for helping David, Garrick. Really busy now, a day before the 'O' level exam paper, with lots of students at my place the entire day today. I'm still rushing off for dinner now. Be back later tonight, but still with my students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I take it that Garrick has answered all David's qns, except Q4 which Garrick asked for my input.</p>
              <p>Mass of test tube = 21.28g</p>
              <p>Mass of test tube + lead oxide = 27.26</p>
              <p>Mass of test tube + lead = 26.46</p>
              <p>What is the emprical formula of this oxide of lead?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sample mass of lead oxide = 5.98g</p>
              <p>Sample mass of lead = 5.18g</p>
              <p>Sample mass of oxide ions = 0.8g</p>
              <p>No. of moles of oxide ions = sample mass / molar mass = 0.8 / 16 = 0.05</p>
              <p>No. of moles of lead = sample mass / molar mass = 5.18 / 207 = 0.025</p>
              <p>Formula of lead oxide = PbO2(s)</p>
              <p>Stock name of compound = lead(IV) oxide</p>
              <p>Notice that this is not the regular lead(II) oxide, which is PbO(s).</p>

              <p>They would only ask about the physical properties and wanna you to link it to its structure, for NaCl.</p>

              <p>Actually it's based on that CALCIUM cations do produce a slightly white ppt with aqueous ammonia IF, IF, AND ONLY IF, the calcium cations are in high concentrations, which is why I asked in my first post.</p>
              <p>And of course, when you react ammonium ions(in aq ammonia) with ammonium ions(ammonium sulphate) you still get ammonium ions, no brainer, thus no reaction.</p>

              <p>Yes, they ARE physical properties. You are asking why I said it is a chemical property right? No, I didn't. When boiling or melting a substance, they merely undergo a change in PHYSICAL state, not a chemical change. Like what I said previously,</p>
              <blockquote>Chemical properties can only be observed with a chemical

              <p>NaOH + HCl --&gt; NaCl + H2O</p>
              <p>The reactants undergo a chemical change to form a completely new product. THAT IS A CHEMICAL CHANGE.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, your points are correct.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to point out though, the fullerenes are allotropes of carbon (not fluorine). Hence you have to write them as (there are other fullerenes, but the most common one is) C60 (and not F60).</p>

              <p>Correct, calcium sulfate (solid) is insoluble, and will not "form" a new ppt, but will simply remain as a solid, when placed in aqueous barium chloride solution.</p>

              <p>Here is a qn for you (I'll reveal the answer at 11pm, if no one gets it by then. Simple qn lah, you all 'O' level students better know how to answer correctly hor.).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Explain (not just state) how the brightness of a bulb will change over time, when connected to a setup (ie. got battery included, the bulb is glowing brightly at the beginning of the reaction), in which the electrolyte is aqueous barium hydroxide, and you (continuously but slowly) add aqueous copper(II) sulfate, until there is no futher change in the brightness (or lack thereof) of the bulb. After which, you continuously add aqueous ammonia until there is no futher change in the brightness (or lack thereof) of the bulb. Rest assured the battery is functioning fine (this is not a trick riddle in which the battery is dead). Also, for the purpose of this question, disregard any electrode reactions (ignore redox reactions at the cathode and anode, if any).</p>

              <p>First, Insoluble barium sulphate is formed in the reaction between barium and sulphate ions in the electrolyte. This decreases the number of mobile ions available to carry electrical charges, thus decreases the brightness of the bulb.</p>

              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The light bulb will become dimmer over time, as Ba2+(aq) and OH-(aq) ions are removed as BaSO4(s) and Cu(OH)2(s) respectively. There are therefore increasingly less mobile ions left in solution to conduct electricity. The light bulb will be turned off totally when, at a particular point in time, there are only covalently bonded water molecules left. As additional CuSO4(aq) is added, the light bulb will become brighter again. When aqueous ammonia  is added, a blue ppt of Cu(OH)2(s) is formed, thereby removing Cu2+(aq) ions, so the bulb becomes dimmer again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the bulb does not go off (as it did previously), because there are still mobile NH4+(aq) and SO4 2-(aq) ions left in solution. As excess aqueous ammonia is added, the Cu(OH)2(s) becomes a soluble complex ion [Cu(NH3)4]2+(aq) giving the solution a deep/dark blue colour, which (the tetraaminecopper(II) ion) is a mobile ion and conducts electricity, and so the bulb becomes even brighter.</p>
