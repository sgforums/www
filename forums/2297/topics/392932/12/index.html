              <p>Since the final product is branched, a simple nucleophilic substitution will not suffice.</p>
              <p>Elimination of HX following by addition of HX, is useful for converting terminal alkyl halides to internal alkyl halides.</p>
              <p>Notice that the product has one more C atom than the reactant (which means we need a C nucleophile, such as the cyanide nucleophile, or a Grignard reagent, or a Wittig reagent).</p>
              <p>Hence, substitute away the halogen (good leaving group) with CN by heating under reflux with NaCN(alc).</p>
              <p>Carry out acidic hydrolysis of CN to convert it into (an amide intermediate which is further hydrolyzed to) COOH.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>I request to review a question i set for AS. It relates to the difference in bonding of CO2 and SiO2 and their relation to bond energy, bond polarity. <br><br>In part (a) I have given the relavane melting point of CO2 and SiO2 and asked students to draw the structures of CO2 and SiO2. <br><br>Then in part (b) using these diagram I asked from the perspective of bond energy and bond polarity the difference in the bonding of these two oxides using the data from the data booklet. I made two headings bond energy and bond polarity. This is what I expect students to state and the relevant problems I am facing with this question.<br><br>"Si=O bonds are not stable" is given in the question. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BOND ENERGY</span>: C-O, Si-O, C=O values quoted from the data booklet.<br><br>C=O bond is stronger than C-O in CO2 therefore a simple molcular structure is favoured over a giant covalent. while in SiO2, Si-O bonds are stronger because as given Si=O does not exist therefore a giant -covalent structure is likely to occur than a simple molecular structure. [<span style="color: #ff0000;">Now should I give the information regarding Si=O or is there any other way of rephrasing the question?]</span>  <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BOND POLARITY:</span> Si-O bonds are more polar in SiO2 than C=O in CO2 since the difference in the electronegativities is larger in case of Si than C because Si has is less electronegative than C. Hence a three-dimensional network of Si-O bonds in SiO2 is favoured. [ <span style="color: #ff0000;">I also like to involve the Si=O bond here is it workable?</span>]<br><br>I would also like to involve the parameter of bond length here. Since multiple bonds are stable than single bonds but double bonds are shorter than single bond. Here is what i wish to stae w.r.t this case.</p>
              <p>shorter C=O bond is favoured in CO2  as compared to long C-O bonds if CO2 were to be giant covalent because both C and O are small atoms they can easily overlap to form stronger C=O bond. In SiO2 silicon has a lrager atomic radius than C and thus will form weaker Si=O bonds or a lot of  longer Si-O yet strong covalent bonds thus a giant covalent stritcure is more favoured over a simple molecular form.</p>
              <p>I am looking forward to your suggestions.</p>

              <div class="name"><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/279500">Kahynickel</a>, I agree with all your marking points.</div>
              <div class="name">As for how to get the student to write more about the hypothetical Si=O bond, the question could be structured to give hints to guide the student. For instance, along the lines of :</div>
              <p>a) By comparing the lengths and strengths of single bonds versus double bonds. state the correlation between the two parameters.</p>
              <p>b) By comparing the relative atomic radii of C vs Si, suggest the difference in bond lengths that the C and Si atoms would form with O atoms.</p>
              <p>c) Hence, deduce whether single bonds or double bonds, are favoured when C atoms, and Si atoms, bond with O atoms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I would prefer the student explain this in terms of atomic orbitals (for which the question can be similarly structured, as in the example above, to guide the student towards this explanation).</p>
              <p>Alternatively, if you leave your question as more open-ended essay style rather than structured, your mark scheme could accept a variety of points. For such essay style questions, the Cambridge mark scheme often has "accept any 5 of the following 7 points" that will suffice for the student to gain full marks for the question.</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>Carbon and silicon are both Group IV elements. Why then, under standard conditions, does carbon dioxide exist as a simple covalent molecule, while silicon dioxide exist as a giant covalent lattice?</em></p>
              <p>To form the pi bond between C and O atoms, involves the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more effective</span></strong> sideways or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">side-on overlap</span></strong> between the (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less diffused</span></strong>) unhybridized <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2p orbitals</span></strong> of both C and O atoms. To form the pi bond between Si and O atoms, involves the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less effective</span></strong> sideways or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">side-on overlap</span></strong> between the (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more diffused</span></strong>) unhybridized <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3p orbital</span></strong> of Si and the (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less diffused</span></strong>) unhybridized <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2p orbital</span></strong> of O.</p>
              <p>Consequently, the C=O <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pi bond</span></strong> is significantly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">stronger</span></strong> than the (hypothetical) Si=O <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pi bond</span></strong>, and hence it is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more energetically favourable</span></strong> for C atoms to form <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(relatively strong)</span></strong> double bonds with O, and in contrast for Si atoms to form (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a greater number of stronger)</span></strong> single bonds with O.</p>
              <p>Conclusion : it is energetically favoured that (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">under standard conditions</span></strong>), carbon dioxide has a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">simple covalent molecular</span></strong> structure, while silicon dioxide has a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">giant covalent lattice</span></strong> structure.</p>

              <p>As you will be aware of the situation CIE exams are appoaching I am preparing two final mock exams. This question was a part of my second mock. I would also request you look into the parts of two questions.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1</span> <span>Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, occurring combined in many minerals. </span></p>
              <p><span>Give the electronic configuration of Al<strong><sup>3+</sup></strong> ions in the space below.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>(a)(i) Al<strong><sup>3+</sup></strong>……………………………………………………………………………………………………</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>(ii) Using your answer from (a) sketch the shapes of the orbitals having <strong>lowest energy</strong>, <strong>highest energy</strong> and <strong>the next available orbital</strong> in Al<sup>3+</sup><strong>.</strong> Label in each case the name of the orbitals</span>. [Below i have provided the axes forthe answers] the answers are:</p>
              <p>         Is                         2p                                 3s</p>
              <p>lowest energy            highest energy          the next available orbital</p>
              <p>                                                                    [<span style="color: #ff0000;">is this right</span>]</p>
              <p>[How about the approach of this question? Will students get it!!......</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 2</strong></span>  [It is also a part of the same mock exam]</p>
              <p><span>Nitrogen, which makes up about 80% of the Earth’s atmosphere, is very unreactive.</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>(a)(i)</span> <span>Explain the lack of reactivity of nitrogen.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #888888;">It</span></span> <span><span style="color: #0000ff;">has strong N-N triple bonds which needs high energy to break. bond energy may be quoted.  </span></span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>
              <p><span>(ii) State one use of nitrogen which depends upon its lack of reactivity.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is used to provide inert atmosphere during synthesis of organic compounds. </span><br></span></p>
              <p><span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>(b)(i) On the other hand, Fluorine is most reactive member of group VII. Draw the dot and cross diagram for fluorine.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>                                                     All lone pairs and bond pair shown                                                          </span></p>
              <p><span>                                                                       <span style="color: #0000ff;">F.xF</span></span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>(ii) Fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen. This reaction is performed in dark i.e. in the absence of sunlight.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span><span>                                                  </span></span></p>
              <p><span><img src="/C:/DOCUME~1/ADMINI~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.gif" alt="" width="57" height="12"></span><span><span>                                                 </span> H<sub>2</sub>(g)<span> </span> +<span> </span> F<sub>2</sub>(g) <span>         </span>2HF(g)</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>The corresponding reaction of chlorine requires sunlight. By using your answer from (c)(i) and choosing suitable data from the Data Booklet to support your answer explain the difference in the reactivity of fluorine and chlorine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Data from data booklet:              </span></span><span><span style="color: #0000ff;">F-F 158 kJmol-1    Cl-Cl   244 kj mol-1 </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Flourine has samller atomic/ covalent radius than Chlorine but lone pairs in F-F causes repulsion since they are very near to each other (second shell) as comapred Cl-Cl in which lone pairs repulsion are insignificant thus F-F has lower bond energy than C-Cl and reacts violently with hydrogen. </span>  </p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Another well-written question.</p>
              <p>Yes that's correct, 3s is the next available orbital. Yes, the phrasing of the question is fine, students should have no problems understand what's required.</p>
              <p>(Regarding relative energy levels of orbitals, it is the 4s versus 3d orbitals that students have difficulty with. Despite being slightly further away from the nucleus, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4s orbitals have slightly lower energy compared to the 3d orbitals</span></strong>. The reasons for this are beyond an 'A' level discussion).</p>
              <p>Only suggestion to add to the very last part of your question :</p>
              <p>You might further split your last question "<em>By using your answer from (c)(i) and choosing suitable data from the Data Booklet to support your answer explain the difference in the reactivity of fluorine and chlorine</em>" into two sub-parts, eg. along the lines of :</p>
              <p>a) Using information in the Data Booklet, compare the atomic radii of fluorine and chlorine, and compare the molecular bond dissociation enthalpies of F2 and Cl2. Identify the apparent contradiction and suggest an explanation for it.</p>
              <p>b) Using information in the Data Booklet, calculate the enthalpies of the reactions between (i) hydrogen and fluorine, and (ii) hydrogen and chlorine. Hence explain the difference in the reactivity of fluorine and chlorine, with hydrogen gas.</p>

              <p>Indeed, that will make for a more challenging, interesting question.</p>
              <p>Not to mention that P4O10, even though an acidic oxide, because it is the anhydride of phosphoric(V) acid, will therefore still 'dissolve' in aqueous acidic solutions (eg. HCl(aq) ), in the sense of hydrolysis of the P4O10 to generate phosphoric(V) acid. Which means this 'dissolving' would be a hydrolysis* reaction, not a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, and the resulting solution would have two different acids.</p>
              <p>(Technically, hydrolysis may be considered a Lewis acid-base reaction, with P4O10 as the Lewis acid and water as the Lewis base).</p>

              <p><em>Would a reaction occur if NaOH(aq) was added to SiO2 at room temperature? If yes, write an equation for the reaction. If no, explain why.</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer :</span></p>
              <p>SiO2 is chemically inert to both aqueous acids and aqueous alkalis, hence no reaction occurs with NaOH(aq) at room temperature.</p>
              <p>Being a giant covalent acidic oxide, it will react only with fused (ie. molten) NaOH(l) at high temperatures, to generate the sodium silicate salt Na2SiO3 and water.</p>
              <p>Due to SiO2 having a giant covalent lattice structure, this particular acid-base reaction has a very high activation energy, in order to break the multitude of strong covalent bonds in the giant covalent lattice, required for the reaction to proceed.  </p>

              <p> <br>Mass solubility refers to the sample mass of the ionic species (ie. Mg(OH)2, not just Mg2+) that can dissolve in one dm3 of solution. Mass solubility is not Ksp (which is the solubility product). To convert mass solubility to solubility product, you need to first obtain the molar solubility.</p>
              <p>Eg. If the mass solubility of Mg(OH)2 is 9mg/dm3, the molar solubility (ie. mass solubility / molar mass) is hence 1.544 x 10^-4 mol/dm3, and therefore the solubility product is (1.544 x 10^-4) ( 2 (1.544 x 10^-4) )^2 = 1.472 x 10^-11 (mol/dm3)^3</p>

              <p><strong><em>Which statement is correct about this reaction when the temperature is increased?</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>A) Both forward and backward rates increase.<br>B) The backward rate only increases.<br>C) The forward rate only increases.<br>D) There is no effect on the backward or forward rate.</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer</span> :   A</strong></p>
              <p>When the temperature is increased, the percentage of reactant molecules with energy equal or exceeding the activation energies for both the backward and forward reactions, are increased (along with temperature). Hence, both the forward and backward reaction rates increase.</p>
              <p>However, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the percentage increase in rate is greater for the reaction in the direction with the larger activation energy</span></strong>. If the forward reaction is endothermic (ie. the forward reaction will accordingly have a larger activation energy, compared to the backward reaction's smaller activation energy), then increasing the temperature will increase both the forward and backward reaction rates, but will increase the forward reaction rate by a larger magnitude compared to the backward reaction rate. This results in the position of equilibrium shifting towards the right (ie. towards the products), even as the rate of both the forward and backward reactions simultaneously increase.</p>
              <p>In an endothermic forward reaction, heat may be regarded as a reactant (rather than product). Increasing the temperature is thus akin to increasing the concentration of the reactants, which will therefore cause the position of equilibrium to shift towards the right (ie. towards the products), as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle (ie. the system attempting to remove the added heat energy by using some of it to convert the reactants to the products). Mathematically, the Kc (ie. equilibrium constant) value will increase, while the Qc (ie. reaction quotient) value remains initially unchanged.</p>
              <p>Hence (while increasing the temperature of the system increases both the forward and backward rate constants), the rate of the forward reaction (ie. indicated by the new relatively much larger k-forward value) will now exceed the rate of the backward reaction (ie. indicated by the new relatively only slightly larger k-backward value) until equilibrium is eventually re-established for the system, ie. Qc = Kc.</p>
              <p>Once Qc = Kc and the system has re-established equilibrium, the rates of the forward and backward reactions will be exactly the same. This is despite the k-forward rate constant still having a larger value compared to the k-backward rate constant. To understand this, recall that the rate of reaction is given as the rate constant multiplied by the molarities of the reactants, each raised to the power of their orders. Thus at position of equilibrium, having smaller reactant molarities and a larger k-forward rate constant, will be mathematically equal to having larger product molarities and a smaller k-backward rate constant.</p>

              <p>To be precise, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sulfur dioxide</span></strong> is being reduced (and is hence the oxidizing agent) and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hydrogen sulfide</span></strong> is being oxidized (and is hence the reducing agent). Since elemental sulfur is not present as a reactant, it is less proper to say "<em>sulfur is a reducing agent</em>" or "<em>sulfur is an oxidizing agent</em>".</p>
              <p>This reaction may be regarded as the opposite of a proper disproportionation reaction, because of the two sulfur-containing reactant species, one is being oxidized and the other being reduced, both generating elemental sulfur as a product. Thus it would be more proper to say, "<em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sulfur in SO2</span></strong> is being reduced, while <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sulfur in H2S</span></strong> is being oxidized, both generating elemental sulfur as a product</em>". </p>

              <p>H2S functions as the Bronsted-Lowry acid and donates protons. The O atoms of SO2 function as the Bronsted-Lowry base and accepts protons.</p>

              <p><br>Density = mass / volume</p>
              <p>Since for a constant n, mass is also constant, hence regard density as constant/V</p>
              <p>Accordingly, density / pressure = constant/(PV)</p>
              <p>Since pressure and volume have an inversely proportional relationship (ie. when you increase pressure volume decreases; when you increase volume pressure decreases), hence PV = constant.</p>

              <p>I recently got Singapore A-level papers from Nov 2004 to Nov 2010 in exchange with the 2010 Prelims papers from a Singapore student. I still need Nov 2011 papers and June papers.</p>
              <p>The questions are excellent.<span> </span> One of the things that I have noticed is that papers-setters sometime extend a multiple choice question into a full-length question for theory paper. The first question of my first mock that I e-mailed you was an example of this mind-set.</p>
              <p>The question was:</p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span>When two liquids are mixed, <strong>heat may be evolved if intermolecular bonds formed are stronger</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span>than those broken,</span></strong> <span>even if there is no chemical reaction'</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Which pair of liquids, when mixed, will give out heat?</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span>A <span>   </span>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span>B <span>   </span>CHCI<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;"><span>C <span>   </span>CCl<sub>4</sub> and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO</span></p>
              <p><span>D <span>   </span>CCl<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH</span></p>
              <p>The answer was A.</p>
              <p>In <strong>D</strong> CCl4 has VDW forces while ethanol has H-bonding so they don’t mix therefore no heat is evolved. H-bonds are stronger than VDW forces in CCl4 consequently heat must be added to make them mix. You can say that in the context of this question intermolecular forces are not broken. [Is this right]<span> </span> <span> </span></p>
              <p>In <strong>C</strong> propanone has permanent –dipoles as compared to VDW forces in CCl4 again the same explanation as in D.</p>
              <p><strong>B</strong> is also same as that of <strong>C</strong>. <span>   </span></p>
              <p>In <strong>A</strong> the intermolecular forces are same in both cases. Propanone has, however, stronger permanent-dipoles forces than CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> because of the high electronegative O atom against the low-electronegative C-atom. The intermolecular bonds /forces formed here are strong permanent dipoles (I don’t think that VDW forces have a role to play here albeit CH2Cl2 has more electron than propanone.) so heat is given out.</p>
              <p>In addition for the rest of the pairs to be soluble heat will be added but only A is the one which gives out heat.</p>
              <p> I am waiting for your comment as I have to finalize the question in a long format.</p>

              <p><br>Btw and Fyi, the Singapore-Cambridge exams are only offered in November. We do not have June papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've little to add to your excellent explanations on this particular MCQ question, except on two minor points :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) For options B, C and D, although the two species listed are generally not miscible (due to reasons you've given), but due to favourable entropy, they will be a slight measure of mixing. Moreover, the question specified, "when the two species are mixed", which you may take it to mean "forcibly mixed" together, eg. by mechanical means. In which case, your structured or open-eneded question, may require the student to take this into consideration.</p>
              <p>For options B, C and D, when mixing does occur, no heat is evolved, because the newly formed inter-species (solute-solvent) interactions are permanent dipole - induced dipole van der Waals (Debye) forces, which are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weaker</span> than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces (option B &amp; C) or the hydrogen bonding (option D), that must be overcome as part of the mixing process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) For option A, as you've pointed out, since the new interactions are of the same type as the old interactions, ie. permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces, we cannot be sure, without carrying out the relevant experiments, that A will definitely give out heat. But because this is an MCQ question, we can eliminate B, C, D as the answer, and therefore A is the only remaining viable answer. But if you were to phrase your structured or open-ended question to guide the process, eg. "In the table above, which experiment would be the most likely to have an exothermic reading?" and "For the experiment you identified, suggest with explanation at the molecular level, why this experiment might have an exothermic reading."</p>
              <p>Then perhaps the molecular geometries and sterics might play a part. Dichloromethane is tetrahedral, while propanone is trigonal planar. Perhaps the student can score credit if he/she writes along the lines of, "<em>due to sterics consideration of the molecular geometries involved, the newly formed permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between dichloromethane and propanone, might be stronger than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between dichloromethane and dichloromethane, (but not necessarily stronger than the pre-existing permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (Keesom) forces between propanone and propanone)."</em></p>

              <p>A 0.10 mol dm–3 solution of NH2CH2CH2NH2 has a pH of 11.3. When 30 cm3 of 0.10 mol dm–3 HCl is added to 10 cm3 of a 0.10 mol dm–3 solution of NH2CH2CH2NH2, the final pH is 1.6.</p>
              <p>Using the following axes, sketch the pH changes that occur during this addition of<br>HCl(aq).</p>
              <p>ANS: Since it is a  diprotic base there will be two curves. But how to calculate the end-point? </p>

              <p><br>Data given only allows the student to calculate Kb1, but not Kb2. If Kb2 is not given, the pH for the 1st and 2nd equivalence points cannot be determined.</p>
              <p>The final pH of 1.6 is due primarily to the excess HCl, and not due to the acidity of N2H6 2+, since the former acid is much stronger than the latter.</p>
              <p>Since the question says "sketch" and since Kb2 is not given, the student will not be required to determine the exact pH of the 1st and 2nd equivalence points.</p>
              <p>If Kb2 was given, then we can calculate both Ka values (ie. of NH2CH2CH2NH3+ and +H3NCH2CH2NH3+, aka protonated ethylenediamine and diprotonated ethylenediamine).</p>
              <p>Only if we have both Kb (or therefore, both Ka) values, then we can calculate the pH of the 1st and 2nd equivalence points as follows :</p>
              <p>1st equivalence point : only 1 amphiprotic species present, use pH = 1/2 (pKa1 + pKa2)</p>
              <p>2nd equivalence point : only 1 acidic species present, use Ka of diprotonated ethylenediamine.</p>
