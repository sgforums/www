The strength of an acid is measured by how much % of it dissociates protons. In water, only a small % of the carboxylic acid molecules present will release / dissociate its protons. In ammonia, almost 100% of the carboxylic acid molecules present will release / dissociate its protons. Simply because ammonia is a stronger Bronsted-Lowry base than water. So the calculated acidic strength, ie. Ka or pKa, of any species is actually relative to its solvent.</p>

              <blockquote>Regarding the more accurate way of calculating pH at equivalence point, for example, the first equivalence point of HOOCCH2COOH, <br><br>I have 2 options: <br><br>1) -OOCCH2COOH + H2O --&gt; -OOCCH2COO- + H3O+<br>2) -OOCCH2COOH + H2O --&gt; HOOCCH2COOH + OH-<br><br>How then do I know which one is the correct one?</blockquote>
              <p><br>Here (and in point of fact, for most cases), this (ie. considering only either the Ka or the Kb alone, instead of considering both simultaneously vis-a-vis the amphiprotic formula) would be the <strong>less</strong> accurate way of determining pH.<br><br>As long as the Ka (proton dissociation) and Kb (base hydrolysis) of the amphiprotic species are comparably large (and in a majority of cases they will indeed be), then the amphiprotic formula will be more accurate : <strong>pH = 1/2 (pKa1 + pKa2)</strong><br><br>But in rare cases, such as in the conjugate acid of hydrazine, ie. N2H5+, where the Ka value of this (theoretically) amphiprotic species is much larger than the Kb value, or vice-versa, then you should (obviously) use whichever value is larger.<br><br>Consider the diprotic acid H2A.<br><br>If Ka of HA- (ie. Ka2 of H2A) is &gt;&gt;&gt; than Kb of HA- (ie. Kb2 of A2-), then regard HA- as only acidic and use the Ka of HA- (ie. Ka2 of H2A) to determine pH.<br><br>If Kb of HA- (ie. Kb2 of A2-) is &gt;&gt;&gt; than Ka of HA- (ie. Ka2 of H2A), then regard HA- as only basic and use the Kb of HA- (ie. Kb2 of A2-) to determine pH.<br><br>But as long as the Ka and Kb of that species (eg. HA-) are comparably large (ie. less than 1 million times magnitude difference from each other), then this species is indeed (for all practical considerations) truly an amphiprotic species, in which case the amphiprotic formula <strong>pH = 1/2 (pKa1 + pKa2)</strong> would obtain a more accurate pH answer, because it takes into consideration the fact that this amphiprotic species would actually undergo hydrolysis both ways : as a Bronsted-Lowry acid and also as a Bronsted-Lowry base, simultaneously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>KickMe remains terribly confused at this point, and no, at this point he still doesn't see it. At least not yet.</p>
              <blockquote>Now I see! We consider the value of the Ka and Kb to determine if it is effectively an acid or a base. And in the case of Ka/Kb&lt;10^7, and Kb/Ka&lt;10^7, we use pH=1/2(pKa1+pKa2)<br><br>However, what if it is the 2nd equivalence point of a diprotic acid that I am talking about? I will only have the value of one pKa to use. Then I will not be able to successfully determine the pH at the 2nd equivalence point using 1/2(pK1 + pK2)<br><br>For example, given HOOCCH2COOH, <br><br>pKa1=2.65<br>pKa2=5.70<br><br>For the first equivalence point, since Ka is more than one million times larger than Kb, we treat it as an acid, hence use -OOCCH2COOH --&gt; -OOCCH2COO- + H+<br><br>For the second equivalence point, Ka/Kb=1000 hence use 1/2(pK1 + pK2) But theres not pK2 in this case. <br><br>And when I attempt to use the approach of "treat it as acid or base", since Ka is larger than Kb, I treat it as an acid, which in this case is wrong as I am suppose to treat it as a base.<br style="clear: both;"></blockquote>
              <p>Once the 1st equivalence point is reached, you have HOOCCH2COO- (which is the only species present), which is clearly an amphiprotic species, hence pH = 1/2 (pKa1 + pKa2).<br><br>(The only time you only need to compare Ka of a species, with Kb of that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">same</span></strong> species (ie. not Ka of an acid with Kb of that acid's conjugate base), is if the amphiprotic formula does not appear to be mathematically viable, ie. if the species' acidic capacity far outweighs that of its basic capacity, or vice-versa.)<br><br>Once the 2nd equivalence point is reached, you have the dinegative -OOCCH2COO- (which is the only species present), which is clearly only basic (and not acidic at all, since there are no protons available to dissociate, obviously) and therefore you have no choice but to use the Kb (and not Ka, which applies only to acidic species that have protons available to dissociate) of -OOCCH2COO-, which could be labeled as Kb1, to calculate the [OH-], hence pOH, hence pH.<br><br>When we define the various Ka and Kb values such that Ka1 &gt; Ka2, and Kb1 &gt; Kb2, then :<br>Ka1 x Kb2 = Kw and Ka2 x Kb1 = Kw<br style="clear: both;">  </p>
              <p>For now, the KickMe saga finally comes to a conclusion :</p>
              <blockquote>I understood the second equivalence point. The only doubt I have now is why HOOCCH2COO- is "clearly an amphiprotic species". By calculating the Ka and Kb, I found the ratio of Ka/Kb=50 million, shouldn't then I treat it as effectively an acid?</blockquote>
              <p>pKa1 = 2.65 hence Ka1 = 2.2387 x 10^-3 hence Kb2 = 4.4669 x 10^-12<br>pKa2=5.70 hence Ka2 = 1.9953 x 10^-6 hence Kb1 = 5.0118 x 10^-9<br><br>For the amphiprotic species, Ka2 and Kb2 are relevant.<br>Since Ka2 is only 446,669 times larger compared to Kb2, hence this is indeed an amphiprotic species, and the amphiprotic formula for pH applies with validity.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p>Why do you get Kb2 from pKa1 and Kb1 from pKa2?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because as long as we consistently define Ka1 &gt; Ka2 &gt; Ka3 etc, and Kb1 &gt; Kb2 &gt; Kb3 etc, then :</p>
              <p>Let H2A represent a weak molecular diprotic acid (eg. the conjugate acid of A2-)<br>Ka1 is the 1st proton dissociation, H2A --&gt; H+ + HA-<br>Ka2 is the 2nd proton dissociation, HA- --&gt; H+ + A2-</p>
              <p>Hence,</p>
              <p>Let A2- represent a diprotic base (eg. the dinegative conjugate base of H2A).<br>Kb1 is the 1st base hydrolysis, A2- + H2O --&gt; OH- + HA-<br>Kb2 is the 2st base hydrolysis, HA- + H2O --&gt; OH- + H2A</p>
              <p>By observing the relevant species involved, notice that :</p>
              <p>Ka1 x Kb2 = Kw, since both Ka1 and Kb2 deal with the same conjugate acid-base pair of H2A / HA-.<br> <br>Ka2 x Kb1 = Kw, since both Ka2 and Kb1 deal with the same conjugate acid-base pair of HA- / A2-.</p>
              <p>The amphiprotic species here is obviously HA-.</p>
              <p>If HA- were to function as a Bronsted-Lowry acid,<br>then it is Ka2 that is relevant, since HA- --&gt; H+ + A2-</p>
              <p>If HA- were to function as a Bronsted-Lowry base,<br>then it is Kb2 that is relevant, since HA- + H2O --&gt; OH- + H2A</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>The above equations and formulae regarding the various proton dissociations or base hydrolyses, can always be used, regardless of the symbols used, eg. say if the acid was the conjugate acid (eg. H2B2+) of a weak molecular diprotic base (eg. B), and the amphiprotic species would then be HB+.</p>

              <div style="font-style: italic;">Do you think that alkyl and hydride shift is likely to be tested in H2 syllabus? There are far-reaching implications if they chose to do so. For instance we must consider the Friedel-craft acylation instead of alkylation due to instability of carbocation intermediate formed.<br><br>Anyway, am I allowed to use reagents I learned in H3 for synthesis questions in paper 3?

              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding the application of reagents or knowledge beyond that which is usually taught within the H2 syllabus, in answering H2 A Level exams, I still advise the same exam-smart strategies :<br><br>Whenever you see the possibility of equally appropriate alternative answers, go ahead and write them all. Of course, if the most appropriate answer (ie. what you suspect Cambridge is most likely looking for) can be found within the H2 syllabus (and this is most usually the case), then go ahead and write that H2 answer in first.<br><br>Thereafter, if you feel it appropriate (eg. if you feel a better answer would be one that you've learnt outside the H2 syllabus), then go ahead and add that in as well.<br><br>Despite what some JC teachers might warn you about, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">writing in alternative answers in the A Level exams is an exam smart thing to do</span></strong>, as long as you carefully qualify your answers, and as long as none of these answer contradict each other in any way (in which case the marker would think you're trying to cheat and of course you'll get zero marks for the question).<br><br>( Examples of this would be to write all 4 of the following non-contradictory answers, when asked to describe the type of reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid or acyl halide, to generate an ester :<br>esterification, condensation, nucleophilic acyl substitution, addition-elimination )<br><br>Since the H2 Chem papers are increasingly testing beyond the basic H2 syllabus, this issue is all the more relevant and pertinent. Bottonlime : When faced with such questions, go ahead and write in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span></strong> the H2 answer as well as the better H3 answer, with an appropriate statement so the Cambridger marker understands you, eg. "we could use this H2 method <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OR</span></strong> this H3 method to synthesize this product, but the H3 method has the following advantages...". Just be careful that your answers don't contradict each other in any way.<br><br>Usually, if the desired answer by Cambridge, involves concepts beyond that which is typically taught in H2 syllabus, they will give the necessary info on the concept as part of the question, ie. a data-based question. This will likely be the case for concepts such as carbocation rearrangements via alkyl and hydride shifts. <br><br>If so, all the more power to those of you who made the effort to study beyond the basic H2 syllabus. But it's still fair to those who didn't (ie. the typical within-syllabus H2 student doesn't lose out too severely to the H3 or Olympiad or BedokFunland JC student, because all the necessary data will likely be provided in the question, or the answer can be extrapolated from the basic syllabus with a bit of thinking, etc).<br><br>Yes, carbocation rearrangement can be asked by Cambridge in a H2 exam, in the form of "Carbocation rearrangements can occur as follows... Clemmenson reduction involves the following... The acylium ion is resonance stabilized as follows... Suggest why Friedal-Crafts alkylation to generate propylbenzene using propyl chloride has a low yield, and suggest how this difficulty can be overcome" or something similar.<br><br>My BedokFunland JC Challenge Qn titled "H2Chem_Clemmenson_Reduction" deals with this problem and gives the solution.</p>

              <blockquote>Very insightful, thank you Ultima! But I guess there is still the 'time' factor which could really prevent most able students from writing the most appropriate answers with extensive line of reasoning. This would, more often than not, limit the answers to the perceived accurate answer.</blockquote>
              <p> <br>No problem at all.<br><br>And yes you're right, time constraints will always be a factor of being exam-smart, as well. In this regard, my advice to students is to always skip any and all questions that you suspect will be time consuming (eg. difficult equilibria calculation qns, or Deductive Elucidation qns, etc), and/or questions on topics that (for whatever reason) you're ill-prepared to handle (eg. particularly so for the Planning Qn of Paper 2 ; for instance in last week's paper, unless you happened to have prepared very well for this Kinetics clock reaction Planning topic, it would have been exam-smart of you to have skipped it to focus on the other questions more productively first).<br style="clear: both;"></p>

The amide N atom and the enolic OH groups do not react with SOCl2.<br>1 mole of OH- is required for (base-promoted) hydrolysis of the terminal / primary amide, generating NH3.

For N, each p orbital is only singly filled and hence unpaired.<br><br>Q14. Weaker bonds are more readily broken than stronger bonds, and stronger bonds are more readily formed than weaker bonds.

              <p>Regarding the van der Waals attractions, interestingly ethane does indeed have a slightly higher boiling point, but ethene has a slightly higher melting point (because melting point has to do with symmetry / stackability as well).<br><br>As long as the state (eg. gaseous versus gaseous) is the same, for entropy we do not look at the strength of the intermolecular attractions, but rather we consider the total number of permutations and combinations possible.<br><br>The more atoms are present, the more ways to permutate and combine, in terms of atom rotations, bond rotations, bond stretchings, bond bendings, etc. Hence entropy is greater for the molecule with greater number of atoms.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p>NaCl is not hydrolyzed by water instaed water just hydrates it. AlCl3 is hydrolyzed by water producing acidic solution. CH3Cl in hydrolzsed by NaOH (aq) and by water to form alcohol... Hydrolysis is the reaction with water or NaOH(aq)?? Please calrify and define hydrolysis.</p>

              <p><br>Technically, hydrolysis refers to the chemical reaction with water (don't worry about the "lysis" part, as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">either</span></strong> water or the other reactant will inevitably be broken up or "lysed" when the reaction occurs).</p>
              <p>However, because water is a weaker nucleophile, therefore to save time and money, we use a stronger nucleophile OH- in nucleophilic substitution reactions involving water, as the richer the electron-rich species, the stronger its nucleophilic strength, the lower the Ea required, the faster the rate of reaction.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the final intended product is the same. For instance :</p>
              <p>R-X reacts with water to generate R-OH2+, which loses a proton to X-, hence generating R-OH and H-X as the final products. Higher Ea, slower reaction.</p>
              <p>R-X reacts with Na+OH- to generate R-OH, with Na+ and X- as counter ions, generating R-OH and Na+X- as the final products. Lower Ea, faster reaction.</p>
              <p>On a related note, notice that physical &amp; inorganic chemists are lazier compared to organic chemists in some ways (eg. physical/inorganic chemists' quick dative bond arrowhead versus organic chemists' full curved-arrow mechanism), but are stricter in other ways (eg. physical/inorganic chemists say "<em>hydration refers to physical interaction with water, while hydrolysis refers to chemical reaction with water</em>"; but organic chemists say, "<em>since dehydration means removing water from alcohol to alkene, then let's just call adding water to alkene as hydration; no need to specify hydrolysis rather than hydration</em>"). </p>

              <p>EmpireCity asked :</p>
              <p><em>AlCl3 reacts with AlH4 and (CH3)3N to give (CH3)3NAlH3.<br>Which statement about (CH3)3NAlH3 is correct?<br>A It contains hydrogen bonding<br>B It is dimeric<br>C The Al atom is electron deficient<br>D The bonds around Al atom are tetrahedrally arranged.</em></p>
              <p><em>Why is B untrue when the product has dative bonding?</em></p>
              <p> <br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mechanism :</span></strong><br> <br>Hydride ion (H-) transfers from AlH4- to AlCl3, generating AlH3 (a Lewis acid or 'electrophile'), which is then available for trimethylamine (CH3)3N (a Lewis base or 'nucleophile') to attack, forming the Lewis acid-base product of (CH3)3NAlH3 with AlCl3H- as a byproduct.</p>
              <p>This (arguably) isn't considered 'dimerization' because an H- ion is lost from the two 'monomers' when forming the 'dimer' product. (It's a bit of an ambiguous area because you can also argue that polymerization can be either addition polymerization or condensation polymerization). So it's still a rather lousy option to include in this weak question.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution :</span></strong></p>
              <p>Since 15 hours elapsed to reduce molarity from 1k to 1/8k,</p>

              <p>Since molarity of the second-order reactant is doubled, the rate of reaction increases by (change in molarity) ^ (order of reactant) = 2 ^ 2 = 4 times.</p>
              <p>Hence (new) half-life of the other reactant is the (old) half-life decreased by 4 times, ie. 5 / 4 = 1.25 hours.</p>

              <p>[Final] / [Initial]   =   (1/2) ^ n<br>1/8 = (1/2) ^ n<br>n = 3</p>
              <p>Since (new) half-live = 1.25 hours, hence time elapsed to decrease molarity of Br2 from 1k to 1/8k = 3 x 1.25 = 3.75 hours.</p>
