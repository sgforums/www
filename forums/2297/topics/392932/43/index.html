              Very unfortunate, poor Ayumi. However, her going deaf is partly her own fault, in 2 cumulative ways : when she had a ENT infection, she chose to be a workaholic and ignored it to continue working ; anyone with an occupational exposure to loud noises / music / sounds should be wearing earplugs (which do not shut out noise completely, just reduces it to safe levels, she would still have been able to perform as a singer with earplugs on). Even at the cinema, let alone at (even noisier) night/dance clubs or pubs (with live bands), and certainly at any (speaker blasting) live concert performance (possibly with the exception of softer classical piano or orchestra type performances at the Esplanade), are hazardously loud activities in which you should consider putting on earplugs. Here's (yet another) excellent BedokFunland JC public service tip : You can buy $2 earplugs at Daiso, and keep it on you at all times (eg. in your wallet or bag, just like you would a small mirror). You never know when you might need them whenever you go out.<p><img src="http://img.stomp.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_detail_fi_breakpoints_theme_bootstrap_screen-lg-min_1x/public/images/2017/05/ayu.jpg"></p><p>

                                This anomaly is one of those interesting tricks (I have an entire BedokFunland JC collection of such fascinating Chemistry anomalies) that I usually only share with and reveal the answer to my own BedokFunland JC students, and I won't spoonfeed these answers here. But you should be able to find the answer for yourself quite easily with Google.<p>Cambridge is unlikely to ask A level students this question, but if they do, they'll phrase it as, "<i>Suggest a reason for this anomalous trend</i>" to function as a distinction-type question to separate the A graders from the rest. While one can of course easily google out the answer, the point is students don't have access to the internet during the exam paper, which is where exploring beyond the basic syllabus throughout the year will help prepare determined students to get A grade.

              As with many other such terminology pairs (eg. heat vs reflux, energy vs enthalpy, shielding vs screening, oxidation state vs oxidation number, resonance vs mesomeric, etc), in most cases they can be used interchangeably and Cambridge will generally accept either term, except in specific contexts where one term is clearly more appropriate than the other.<p>To explain why molten or aqueous ionic compounds and metals conduct electricity, it's better to use "mobile". To describe the resonance effect, eg. why amides are much less basic than amines, it's compulsory to use "delocalized".</p>

                      The counter cation is spectatory hence irrelevant, it's the CN- anion nucleophile which is participatory and reacts. Beyond A levels, there are other considerations why a particular counter cation may be preferred, even if it's only spectatory, but these are not relevant for A levels.</p><p>
                      When Cambridge simply asks for "structural formula", they will accept any of the 3 types : displayed or full, skeletal, or condensed. It's only when Cambridge specifies 1 of the 3 types, then only that type of structural formula is accepted. Otherwise, any of the 3, including a hybrid of the 3, will be accepted. </p>

                  There is no shortcut to predicting products. You've got to apply all your chemistry knowledge from across different topics to determine which (in tougher questions, more than one type of reaction is possible, hence a mixture of different products may be obtained).<p>
                  For Fe2O3 and CO, unless otherwise specified by the (eg. data based) question, otherwise at O and A levels, the only possible reaction (covered by the syllabuses) is redox, where iron is reduced and carbon is oxidized.</p><p>

              For A levels, use the Data Booklet's redox potentials to determine which is the most thermodynamically feasible (ie. change in Gibbs free energy most negative), PLUS use familiarity of expected knowledge within syllabus PLUS look for clues in the question.<p>For O levels, use familiarity of expected knowledge within syllabus, ie. memorize the most stable OSes and expected redox products for commonly tested compounds.

              <p>The examiners' report for this question states:</p>
              <p>29% of candidates chose the correct answer C. The mst commonly
              chosen answer was D chosen by 29% of candidates. If a fixed mass of
              gas is behaving ideally the sum PV/RT gives a constant value. for
              both the conditions given in the question</p>
              <p>PV/RT =6.418 (if volume of 1dm3 and 0.5 dm3 are assumed.
              therefore gas is behaving ideally.</p>

              Cambridge and I are both correct. The error is yours, hoay. You gave the wrong temperature after compression.<p>
              Using Cambridge values, nR (before compression) / nR (after compression) = 1.00, hence the gas is behaving ideally.</p><p>

                  Gases which dimerize and monomerize are a select few, for A level purposes, most notably NO2 monomer which exists in equilibrium with N2O4 dimer, via a free radical mechanism. (Of courser, there's AlCl3 and Al2Cl6, but that's (s), (l), (g), (g) equilibria, and involves polymeric lattice structure in solid state as well, dimerization mechanism via dative covalent bonding).<p>
                  Yes, it's related to temperature, enthalpy and entropy, all 3 variables incorporated in Gibbs free energy. The NO2 - N2O4 equilibria is a perfect illustration of how all 4 variables are inter-connected, as well as how these 4 variables are connected to the shifting of position of equilibrium.</p><p><img src="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/Content/FileRepository/frg/images//Le%20chateliers%20priciple%20equilibrium%20of%20nitrogen%20dioxide%203.JPG"></p><p><a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00001739/le-chateliers-principle-the-equilibrium-between-nitrogen-dioxide-and-dinitrogen-tetroxide">http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00001739/le-chateliers-principle-the-equilibrium-between-nitrogen-dioxide-and-dinitrogen-tetroxide</a>

              Though often placed at the top of the alkali metal column in the periodic table, hydrogen does not, under ordinary conditions, exhibit the properties of an alkali metal. Instead, it forms diatomic H2 molecules, analogous to halogens and non-metals in the second row of the periodic table, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Diatomic hydrogen is a gas that, at atmospheric pressure, liquefies and solidifies only at very low temperature (20 degrees and 14 degrees above absolute zero, respectively). However, Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington predicted that under an immense pressure of around 4,950,000 bar or 4,890,000 atm or 71,800,000 psi, hydrogen would display metallic properties: instead of discrete H2 molecules (which consist of two bonding pair electrons bound between two nuclei protons), a bulk metallic phase would form with a solid metallic lattice of protons and the electrons delocalized throughout.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen</a>

              [ Biology / Medical ] - "The Upside of Bad Genes" by Moises Velasquez-Manoff<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/opinion/sunday/crispr-upside-of-bad-genes.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/opinion/sunday/crispr-upside-of-bad-genes.html</a>
                  </p><p><i>Sickle cell was a case in point. The gene is usually found in people who live in, or whose ancestors came from, sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab world and India; in those places, having one copy of the gene can prevent the worst symptoms of malaria. Of every four children our imaginary couple might have, one will probably be afflicted with sickle cell disease, but two would most likely be protected from malarial disease.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Ditto with the gene variants that cause the lung disease cystic fibrosis. In parts of northwest Europe, about 1 in 25 people carries a single copy of the gene. And while two copies cause disease, it has long been hypothesized that having just one protects against tuberculosis â€” the White Plague that ravaged Europe for a few hundred years.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Carriers of the ApoE4 variant have an up-to-fourfold increased risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In 2010, scientists at Northwestern University found that the gene was more prevalent in tropical and polar populations than in those from mid-latitudes, presumably because it served some function in those regions. Then, strangely, the gene was linked to enhanced cognitive performance in children living in Brazilian slums. And last year, Ben Trumble, an anthropologist at Arizona State University, and colleagues published an intriguing study suggesting that the gene might improve brain function in elderly people living in the Bolivian Amazon. The tribe he studied, called the Tsimane, subsist mostly on what they grow and hunt in the jungle, and about two-thirds have intestinal parasites. Dr. Trumble discovered that if elderly ApoE4 carriers harbored parasites, their cognitive abilities improved relative to noncarriers with parasites. Only carriers without parasites suffered cognitively.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City had recently discovered that ingesting cyanate salts could prevent the â€œsicklingâ€� of red blood cells that leads to the anemia and pain of sickle cell disease. Dr. Jackson knew that a related compound, cyanide, was common in foods across Africa, particularly in the staple crop cassava (which you may know as tapioca). She was also aware that, at the right dose, cyanide could directly protect against the malaria parasite. She realized that regular consumption of cassava â€” more common in the Southeast than the Northwest â€” could, by working as an antimalarial drug, affect the prevalence of the sickle cell trait, by making it less advantageous.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Something different was happening in the Northwest, though. Dr. Jackson, who is now at Howard University, thinks that while cassava consumption in the region was insufficient to protect against malaria directly, people who had two copies of the sickle cell gene still ate enough to partly avoid sickling. In that population, diet may have prevented a genetic disease from fully manifesting.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  We evolved in environments that are radically different from todayâ€™s, and some of our genes may work better in those environments. This complicates the idea of trying to perfect the human genome with technology. Given how much the world has changed in just the past 150 years, and how much itâ€™s likely to change again in the next 150, the question is, â€œWhat environment will we optimize our genes for?â€�

                                                <p>Hello! May I ask a question on The Periodic Table?</p>
                                <p>Qn : When sodium chloride is added to water, a solution is
                                formed which has a pH of 7. When phosphorous pentachloride is added
                                to water, the resulting solution has a pH of 1. Explain these
                                observations, and why these chlorides differ in their reaction with
                                water.</p>

                                Yo!<p>
                                Due to relatively low ionic charge densities, neither the Na+ ion nor the Cl- ion undergoes significant hydrolysis, hence pH of NaCl(aq) remains neutral.</p><p>
                                PCl5, being a covalent chloride, is electrophilic (since each Cl is significantly more electronegative than P), hence readily attacked by water nucleophiles to generate 1 mol of the weak acid H3PO4(aq), as well as 5 mol of the strong acid HCl(aq). Hence a strongly acidic solution results.</p>

                  Q1. From 1.34g of CO2(g), find mol of CO2(g). By stoichiometry, this is also the mol of metal carbonate. Giving sample mass of metal carbonate as 4.50g, and now you know the mol of metal carbonate, you can find the molar mass of the metal carbonate, hence can identify the metal.<p>
                  Q2. The first 0.720g of water lost is from the water of hydration, ie. nH2O. The 2nd 0.090g of water lost is from the decomposition of the hydroxide. From 0.090g of water lost, you can find the mol of water lost, which by stoichiometry is also the mol of the entire hydrated metal hydroxide. Hence n = (mol of water lost 0.720g) / (mol of water lost 0.090g).</p><p>Now that you know the value of n, you can work out the molar mass of the hydrated metal hydroxide in terms of an algebraic variable, eg. let M be the molar mass of the metal M. Since you know the mol of the hydrated metal hydroxide, and you know its sample mass is 1.575g, and you have its molar mass (in terms of M), hence you can equate the 3 terms together and solve for M, and therefore identify the metal M.</p>

                              <p>Hey UltimaOnline, heres a question from my sch paper</p>
              <p>A sample of positively charged chromium ions, Cr^n+, was beamed
              through an electric field and was deflected by an angle of +8
              degrees. A sample of No2^+ was beamed through the same elctric
              field and was deflected by an angle of +3.01 degrees. With
              reference to data booklet, calculate the amount of energy required
              to form 0.2 mol of gaseous Cr^n+ ions from 0.2 mol of gaseous
              Cr^(n-1)+ ions.</p>
              <p>Ans: angle of deflection of Cr^n+=(1/46 divide n/52)x8=3.01</p>
              <p>I dont understand why the angle of deflection of Cr is being
              derived as such. Thanks for the help!</p>

              (+1/46)x = +3.01, hence x = 1.3846x10^2
              <br>
              (+n/52)x = +8, hence n = +3<p>
              Hence energy required to form 0.2 mol of gaseous Cr^3+ ions from 0.2 mol of gaseous Cr^2+ ions = 0.2 mol x 3rd ionization energy (kJ/mol)</p>
