                      Amino acids are not just polar, depending on pH and specific amino acid, they can even be dinegatively anionic, uninegatively anionic, zwitterionic, unipositively cationic, or dipositively cationic.<p>All of these species (including the zwitterion) is even more 'polar' than a 'polar molecule' (the term implies overall neutral, and usually with no formal charges present), due to formal charges present and (other than the zwitterion) hence also ionic charges present.</p>

              In protein polypeptides, because the lone pair on the N atom is delocalized by resonance, hence the peptide bond in the resonance hybrid actually has partial double bond character, which means sigma bond rotation is restricted by the partial pi bond, which means that whichever geometric isomer (usually the more stable trans isomer) the protein polypeptide was originally generated with (ie. during the intra-cellular translation process involving ribosomes, mRNA and tRNA), that will be the permanent geometric isomer for that particular peptide bond in the protein polypeptide.

                                                  Here is your answer. Always cross reference across multiple sources, *plus* think critically for yourself : ask yourself which version should be more correct, and why? Apply yourself and your own free-will with self-respect and self-responsibility, instead of blindly following dogma (be it academic, family, cultural, societal, ethical, moral, religious, etc).<p><img src="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/complexions/dsplitcu.gif"><br><a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/complexions/colour.html">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/complexions/colour.html</a></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Crystal_Field_Splitting_4.png"><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_field_theory#Crystal_field_stabilization_energy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_field_theory#Crystal_field_stabilization_energy</a></p>

                                            Fyi, my own working is [ 5g / [ 3.29g / (molar mass of 4NO2+O2) ] x 2 ] - [ (molar mass of NO3) x 2] = 40.1g

                                            But your working will of course get full marks as well. Cambridge only marks the final answer, as long as your working is reasonable, you've some creative freedom to work it out as you wish.</p>

              In the A level exams, the reagents and conditions for each reaction, should be written in exactly the same way that either CS Toh, or Chan Kim Seng, or George Chong writes them (ie. above &amp; below the equation arrow) in the reaction equations. Cambridge will accept any of these alternative ways of writing the reagents and conditions. All JC students are advised to closely follow these 3 sources, over their own school lecture notes.

              At cathode, 4 H2O used (to supply the 4 H+), and O2 + 2 H2O + 4 OH- byproduct generated (not written in CS Toh's eqn, since he used 4 H+ instead of 4 H2O as reactant).<p>

              Therefore, overall balanced redox equation is  2 H2O(l) --&gt; 2 H2(g) + O2(g), and the solution becomes more concentrated (as H2O is electrolyzed away).</p><p>Note that Singapore JCs will insist you use H2O as the reactant for both cathode &amp; anode, instead of CS Toh's H+ and OH- respectively.</p><p>Cambridge will accept both versions, unless the solution being electrolyzed is strongly acidic or strongly alkaline; which is why Singapore JCs have decided it's safer to instruct JC students to just always use H2O as the reactant.</p><p>And if you can't figure out why, or which cathode &amp; anode equations are acceptable or not acceptable in such electrolytic setups of strong acidity or alkalinity, go ask your school teacher or private tutor.</p>

Because the amino acid residues with the R group interactions will be many residues apart, and because the polypeptide chain is non-linear (think of the polypeptide chain as curving and twisting convolutedly all over the place), hence you should have drawn the 2 amino acid residues as originating from different 'starting positions' on paper, either facing each other, or (more realistically) at an angle away from each other. See CS Toh's diagram on the bottom of page 381 (Advanced Study Guide).</p><p>Lastly, don't forget you're attempting to translate a 3D structure onto 2D paper. Each C-C bond is bent in 3D space, not linear. On 2D paper, it may not always be possible to illustrate perfect linearity (for all H bonds in all molecules), just do your best to reflect this. Cambridge will be reasonable.</p><p><br>                      </p><blockquote>

                  Yes, obviously. Lys-Ser and Ser-Lys amino acid residues certain do exist. But R group interactions do not usually exist between adjacent amino acid residues, and are far more important and meaningful (in terms of tertiary structure enabling biological function) when they occur between non-adjacent amino acid residues, as is mostly the case.

                                    <p>Yes Ultima, exactly. Whole class was taught  wrongly.
                                    Ultima, that's why i am very very thankful ,of you, helping us type
                                    out, and more importantly,  Elaborate out All(small and big,
                                    important and the nitty gritty ) the Details, and Most Importantly,
                                    teach and correct us  to learn the correct and right
                                    education. </p>
                                    <p>my only regret is i didn't discover BFJC earlier.</p>
                                    <p>I Feel Very Frustrated and sad that I've discovered so much that
                                    I've learnt throughout my life, is wrong. Happy because at least i
                                    discover it. </p>
                                    <p>i am very thankful that i receive education from BFJC, one of
                                    the only true educators and education.</p>
                                    <p> Another important skill I've acquired from BFJC is to
                                    learn to suspect and question and double check if something is
                                    taught wrong, and i seek clarification via books, online, and
                                    forums.</p>
                                    <p>some people don't even know they're learning the wrong
                                    things(like me in the past, receive without critically evaluating
                                    and discerning what I've learnt ), and once they discover,they'll
                                    be angry and happy.</p>
                                    <p>for me, I haven't been doubting Chem stuffs I've learnt until
                                    this year, it's late, i wished i was more inquisitive and a
                                    critical thinker last time, but better late than never</p>

                                    Very good, but at the end of the day, you still need to bring home to bacon. Being physically incarnate, the highest pinnacle of success necessitates success in all aspects of your life.<p>This includes academia. Even if you've now grown to understand Chemistry more deeply than your school mates, but at the end of the day, if you still fail to perform under examination conditions, and still fail to score an A grade (or whatever grade is to your personal satisfaction, for whatever goal), it means you've failed and disappointed yourself (not others), in that you've not lived up to your maximum potential.</p><p>For your own sake, don't disappoint yourself. Get the grade you know you can, for this year's upcoming A levels.</p>

              Do you realize (no you don't, and neither do 99.9% of Singapore JC students), that depending on the exact ion and molecule (ie. case by case), the so-called ion - permanent dipole interaction (don't be lazy, there are 2 types of ion - dipole interactions) may actually be a hydrogen bond (enhanced by the formal charge present)?<p>Positive formal charge = electron-withdrawing by induction, enhancing strength of H bond donated. Negative formal charge = more electron-rich, enhancing strength of H bond accepted.</p><p>True ion - permanent dipole interactions are inorganic (eg. Na+ and Cl- with H2O solvent) rather than organic (eg. amino acids), because you also need to consider the geometry (eg. tetrahedral) of the molecule. So understandably, Singapore JCs don't teach all these coz they (fairly enough) know Singapore JC students will be confused by all these. </p>

                      Obviously the R group imine is more basic than the alpha amine, especially in Arginine. Because now there are 2 reasons, not just 1. Induction (electron-donating by induction R group) and resonance (the conjugate acid is stabilized by having its positive formal charge delocalized by resonance over 2 N atoms).<p>Your confusion lies in thinking the lone pair of the R group N atom is delocalized *before* protonation, and hence less available to accept a proton. Nonsense.</p><p>First of all, only the R group amine's lone pair is slightly delocalized by resonance before protonation, but the R group imine's lone pair isn't, and it is the R group imine which is protonated (not the amine). Thereupon, the R group amine's lone pair then becomes extensively delocalized, in order to allow the positive formal charge on the conjugate acid to be effectively delocalized, across both N atoms.</p>

                  <p>Regarding option C, when 4 methylbenzoic acid reacts with

                  Because the benzene ring of para-methylbenzoic acid isn't sufficiently activated to attack the Br2(aq), since CH3 is only electron-donating by induction and hence weakly activating, while COOH is electron-withdrawing by both induction and resonance, and is hence moderately deactivating.<p>Even without the electron-withdrawing COOH group, methylbenzene still isn't sufficiently activated to be able to attack Br2(aq). You need anhydrous Br2 with AlBr3 or FeBr3 Lewis acid catalyst for that.</p><p>And if free radical substitution of the methyl group is desired, exposure to UV light is required.</p>

                  <p>For 2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn 2ciii, may I ask how is T
                  formed? What type of reaction could possibly occur to form the
                  alkene by-product? At first I thought that it could be SN1
                  mechanism since it is secondary alkyl halide. But it will not be
                  able to form an alkene, especially with the removal of O, since O
                  is needed for attacking the alkyl halide.</p>

                  <p>For 2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn3d, I had trouble deducing
                  Geraniol. I could deduce N,P,Q and R, but I wonder why Geraniol
                  doesn't have 2 terminal alkene. Since heating geraniol with excess
                  KMnO4 will give N and P, and we see that 2 carbon has been removed,
                  so why is there no 2 terminal alkene present? 2 CO2 could be
                  removed. Instead, the product is a diol. Are diols colourless
                  gases?</p>

                  Perhaps Supercat has difficulty taking a photo of the qns or uploading them. But as Flying Grenade said, everyone asking H2 Chem qns here, do try to take a photo and upload the qns whenever possible, for the sake of sharing and helping other JC students here, coz not everyone has access to all the Prelim papers.<p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 2 Qn 5 : Correct, ester group is electron-withdrawing by both induction and resonance, hence the benzene ring is deactivated, no halogenation via electrophilic aromatic substitution occurs.</p><p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn 2ciii : E2 reaction occurs in competition with SN2. While the Singapore A level H2 Chem syllabus simplifies the matter of whether nucleophilic aliphatic substitution (ie. SN1 vs SN2) or elimination (ie. E1 vs E2) occurs as simply a matter of solvent (ie. aqueous vs ethanolic), but in practice (ie. real-life and Uni level Chem), all 4 compete against each other, and there are other factors involved in the 4-cornered fight : SN1 vs SN2 vs E1 vs E2.</p><p>While E1 and E2 mechanisms are not required for the Singapore A level H2 Chem syllabus, but nonetheless as evidenced by the AJC Prelim paper (and all Singapore JC Prelim papers and significantly tougher recent Singapore-Cambridge A level H2 Chem papers since 2010), it pays for students gunning for A grade to have a deeper understanding of Chemistry beyond the basic A level H2 syllabus. Which is the advantage that H3 Chem, Olympiad Chem, and BedokFunland JC Chem students have over H2 Chem only students.</p><p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn3d : You're right that the 2 missing C atoms are eliminated in the form of CO2(g). But you're incorrect that 2 terminal alkene groups must therefore be present in geraniol. Because if that were the case, how would heating geraniol with acidified KMnO4 yield N and P and CO2(g)? The given formula of geraniol precludes the acidic hydrolysis of ester or amide group as a possible explanation.</p><p> Concordantly, the student is expected and required to deduce and elucidate that the functional group in question (that results in 2 C atoms eliminated as CO2) is either the =CHCH2OH group, or the =CHCH= group, either of which is oxidized by KMnO4 with oxidative cleavage into ethandial, which is further oxidized to ethandioic acid, which is further oxidized to 2 moles of carbonic(IV) acid, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence decomposes into, 2 moles of CO2(g) + H2O(l), with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, and with the position of equilibrium shifting to the RHS as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle (since CO2(g) leaves the aqueous reaction mixture).</p><p><br>

              <p>For E1 and E2, I searched them online. So I take it that
              nucleophilic sub occurs together with elimination? And SN1, E1
              favours sec/tertiary compounds while SN2, E2 favours pri/sec
              compounds? In this case, then I see nucleophilic elimination
              "similar" to normal elimiation reactions (dehydration) in the sense
              that a C=C bond is formed? From my understanding, alcoholic
              solvents tends to promote elimination while (aq) tends to promote
              substitution. Does acidic/alkaline conditions play a role too?</p>
              <p>Btw, why are methanoic acid and ethanedioic acid so special?
              They are the only 2 unique carboxylic acid that can be further
              oxidised to CO2 and H2O. Are there any reasons for this? Is it
              because of their structure?</p>

              Whether pH needs to be acidic or alkaline, depends on the specific elimination reaction. Ideally, you (ie. all JC students) should be able to draw out the elimination mechanisms, instead of blindly memorizing about it, which will enable you to effortlessly decide if acidic or alkaline conditions are required. Tip : Draw the elimination of HX from alkyl halide, and the elimination of H2O from alcohol. One requires alkaline pH, the other acidic, for reasons that will be obvious once you draw out the mechanisms. And ideally, you (ie. all JC students) should be able to draw both E1 and E2, to see the relationship with SN1 and SN2.<p>Because of the high O to C ratio for these molecules, allowing ease of further oxidation, and hence more positive oxidation potentials.</p>

                  First of all, "neutralization" is an O level term. At A levels, the only time you're allowed to use this term is "enthalpy of neutralization". For physical chemistry, you must state "Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction". For organic chemistry, you must state "proton transfer reaction". Using "neutralization" will get you penalized at A levels.<p>Ser's R group is an aliphatic alcohol, non-acidic OH group. Lys' R group is amine/ammonium. Hence R group interactions between Lys and Ser is hydrogen bonding.</p><p>To your next question, the answer is "obviously", but also "you're thinking it wrongly". If you have a deeper understanding of Chemistry, you'll realize that the protonation or deprotonation is not actually between particular R groups and other particular R groups (eg. "Asp transfers proton to Lys", etc), but each R group protonation/deprotonation actually occurs with the aqueous solvent environment in the biological organism (eg. human body tissue fluids). In other words, solvent catalysed Bronsted-Lowry acid-base proton transfer reactions.

                                1stly, how are you going to achieve a dinegative ionic charge without 2 uninegative formal charges? And how are you going to achieve 2 uninegative formal charges for the 2 S atoms, unless each S atom has 3 lone pairs and 1 bond pair?<p>2ndly, you're wrong, it's actually more thermodynamically favorable for period 3 elements to form more single bonds instead of double bonds, which is why CO2 has double bonds while SiO2 has single bonds, another classic example being nitrogen versus phosphorus molecules, etc. And do you know the correct explanation for this? Go ask your school teacher or private tutor, don't ruin the fun for others on the forum by posting the answer here.

              Yes, your E1 and E2 mechanisms are correct. But if you're using alkoxide ion as the base, then the correct reason why you need alkaline pH is to prevent protonation of your alkoxide base, so it can carry out the elimination.<p>Alkene is a nucleophile, as is also the H- ion from LiAlH4 and NaBH4, hence no reaction occurs (they're not gay). In contrast, H2(g) with nickel catalyst is able to provide both H+ and H- (as consequence of H2 adsorption-reaction-desorption with the transition metal catalyst with partially filled d orbitals), and hence can hydrogenate the alkene nucleophile / base.

              Jahn-Teller effect right? </p>

              The Jahn-Teller distortion is particularly notorious (and you're required by the A level syllabus to memorize this example) for the deep blue tetraamminecopper(II) coordination complex ion. All other 4 ligand coordination complexes, eg. tetrachlorocuprate(II), must be assumed to be tetrahedral, unless hints (eg. cis and trans isomers exist for a 4 ligand coordination complex) are given by the question that it's square planar.
