              <p>O is more electronegative than N. O withdraws some e- density
              from N. Magnitude of delta -ve on O decreases. The O-H bond in
              hydroyxlamine is less polar compared to O-H bond in water. Hence
              strength of H bond between hydroxylamine molecules is weaker than
              strength of Hbond between water molecules.</p>
              <p>Hence water has a higher B.P. than hydroxylamine even though
              hydroxylamine can from more Hbonds per molecule than water.</p>

              Indeed, the O-H bond in hydroxylamine is less polar, compared to in H2O or in alcohols, due to the electronegative N atom. So far so good. But here's where your school cocked up : the boiling point of hydroxylamine should actually be higher, not lower, than H2O, as number of H bonds formed is more important than strength of H bonds. Simply look at their melting points, and you'll see I'm right. However, in practice, hydroxylamine never gets to reach its theoretical boiling point (ie. above 100 deg C), because it readily decomposes (at 58 deg C) into water, ammonia, and either dinitrogen monoxide or nitrogen gas (depending on mechanism pathway and reaction conditions).

                                    A buffer solution's pH changes *slightly* when a *small* amount of strong acid or base is added to it. Note that highlighted words. And Cambridge will require you to write equations to explain exactly how a buffer works. The exact equations will of course, depend on exactly what is the conjugate acid-base pair of the buffer solution.

                  I've already given you detailed solution liao. If you still can't figure out this little bit by yourself (even if it didn't occur to you before reading my solution, after reading my solution you should now be able to figure out why), you'll have to go ask your school teacher or private tutor. Try to refrain from repeatedly asking too much on a single question, especially after I've already given you the answer on the forum.

              For every question's discussion, there will come a point where your own further doubts and misconceptions will have to be clarified face-to-face with a school teacher or private tutor, as it will be too inefficient to attempt further elaboration on the forum, especially after I've already described and explained the essential answer for everyone reading this (ie. the essential solution is already given, each person reading it will have unique further thoughts and doubts, for which they will have to figure out the nitty-gritty details for themselves, and/or consult their school teacher or private tutor).<p>You've reached that point for this question. Have a nice day.

                  By definition, metals are electropositive, non-metals are electronegative. To be electronegative, you need more protons in your nucleus vis-Ã -vis the other elements in your same period. Condordantly, as a non-metal you need to be on the right side of the periodic table. Ergo, you'll have a large number of valence electrons. So it's not a definition of non-metals, it's just a characteristic. Transition metals also have a large number of valence electrons, because both the (n-1)d and ns electrons (eg. 3d and 4s), are both considered valence electrons.

                  But if the ozone layer is thin, it will have holes. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't lepak for A levels and still score distinction A grade (unless you're me, Mr BedokFunland JC).

                                      <p>Hi I would like to ask something about Senior Chem Olympiad (for
                      JC1) and whether I should take it</p>
                      <p>So recently, i somehow got selected by my school for SChO
                      training, altho im like not very good, just a decent chem student
                      and the ppl who got selected are all quite beast in their studies,
                      like half of them are china scholars.</p>
                      <p>So i went for my first session and apparently for the olympiad,
                      the whole syllabus for A level chem needs to be covered as well as
                      some other university chem modules, which is pretty scary given
                      that the trainer only has now until end of Nov to finish it. And my
                      school also not very good at chem olympiads, for last years
                      olympiad 3 silver, 3 bronze, 1 merit</p>
                      <p>So right now im not very sure if i should continue as i need to
                      dedicate 2h per week for training and perhaps even more to complete
                      the homework/readings that the external trainer gives. And im not
                      very sure if it helps with my A levels Chem or is it too far
                      fetched. Im afraid it would affect my time for studies and other
                      stuff as in JC i find myself always havng v little time.</p>
                      <p>So any advice on whether to go for it would be appreciated!</p>

                      Don't bother going for formal Olympiad Chem training or H3 Chem lessons in school, it just takes up valuable time you yourself said you can not afford. Olympiad and H3 are only for students who are already scoring all As in all their H2 subjects, are confident they have the time to do so, and wish to apply for Medicine and/or scholarships.<p>If you like, read up and self-learn on Olympiad or H3 stuff yourself, for giving yourself the extra edge in H2 Chem. Or if you (ie. anyone reading this) join my BedokFunland JC tuition in the future, I'll teach you only the Olympiad and H3 concepts and strategies that will help you to get A grade in your H2 Chem.</p>

                                                     Ya know, it's annoying when you (ie. Singapore JC students) say things like that, and you'll lose marks in the A level exams for such ambiguous phrasing. They way you phrase it, makes you appear simple minded (ie. oversimplifying matters due to lack of depth of understanding) or dogmatic (ie. blindly memorizing school notes without deeper understanding), because it makes you seem to think "the more -ve o.s. is, more stable the atom is" holds true for all elements.<p>
                                    Obviously (at least it's obvious to me and should be obvious to anyone who truly understands Chemistry, but apparently this doesn't necessarily include the majority of Singapore JC students or even some teachers and tutors, does it?), metals being electropositive will find positive OSes more stable, and non-metals being electronegative will find negative OSes more stable.</p><p>
                                    As for the exact unique OSes preferred by each individual element, you can go figure out for yourself, and/or research online, and/or ask your school teacher and/or private tutor. At A levels, if you really understand your A level Chemistry, then you'll begin to get a glimpse of understanding as to the myriad of chemistry factors (some opposing each other) contributing to why different elements (eg. different transition metals) have different unique preferred OSes.</p>

              First, if you're not sure it's maximum buffer capacity (eg. because the question guai-lan and give different volumes and different molarities of both acid and base), do the ICF table to confirm it's maximum buffer capacity. With Cambridge questions getting tougher each year, it may be near, but not exactly maximum buffer capacity. So when in doubt, just do ICF table (which is arguably more important than ICE table, especially since Cambridge has stated they will accept the approximation of equilibrium molarity back to initial molarity).<p>If it's really exactly maximum buffer capacity, obviously neither ICF nor ICE table is required, and not even the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is required (since log 1 = 0). For maximum buffer capacity, pH = pKa1 or pKa2 or pKa3 (depending on which maximum buffer capacity it is during the titration of a polyprotic or multiprotic acid or base).</p>

              You can test for the presence of alcohols by adding an acyl halide. If a sweet smell is observed, meaning that an ester is generated, which in turn means the original analyte must have contained an alcohol.

                  Being a buffer soln, you *can* indeed use Ka, or even Kb. It's just that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation saves you time as you can work in moles instead of molarities. If you didn't get the correct answer, it means your molarities (ie. moles / new total volume of soln) of both HA and A- at that point (double-equivalence) are wrong. Obviously you need to plug in the molarities of both conjugate acid and conjugate base into the Ka (or Kb) equation, and not all questions will be as kind as this question to let you have maximum buffer capacity, so you better start practicing tougher questions in which the moles or molarities of both conjugate acid and conjugate base are different. Then try using all 3 formulae :  Ka, Kb, and Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to prove *to yourself* that all 3 formulae will give you the same final answer of the correct pH.

                  Both are acceptable by Cambridge, use whichever you prefer, IP or Qsp, to be compared with Ksp. Personally, I'll recommend Qsp (since it's closer in form to Ksp). For solubility (which is not the same as Ksp. ie. solubility product), always specify "molar solubility" (mol/dm3) or "mass solubility" (g/dm3).

              Your molar solubility based strictly on Ksp ignores the effect of pH, which is the usual case within the H2 syllabus. This DHS question goes beyond the H2 syllabus (which Cambridge often does) to include the effect on pH, which is why your answer is inadequate and thus wrong. If you do not add NaOH, how are you going to make the pH high (ie. alkaline)? That's why you add NaOH, which increases solubility by precipitating out the cation (in contrast, adding acid increases solubility by protonating the anion). There's no alternative method ; Wilbur's equation only covers acidic to neutral pH.

                  Wrong, in high pH, it's OH- that's relevant, not H+. "We" do *not* want to study the effect of [H+] in high pH, "We" only want to study the effect of pH on solubility, so Wilbur's equation (involving H+) is obsolete and can be retrenched.<p>Your mathematics-based answer will not be acceptable, because firstly, the H2 Chem syllabus is always testing students about shifting of position of equilibrium (use of acronyms like LCP not allowed in A level exams); and secondly, the actual question (on Wilbur's work, or similar) in the A levels might not give you an mathematical equation or formula at all, so if all you can give are mathematical reasonings (as opposed to chemical reasoning that's required by the mark scheme), you'll be screwed in the A levels.</p><p>BedokFunland JC exam tip : If you're exam-smart, you'll give a variety of reasons, whatever you can think of. As long as they don't contradict each other, you'll be given credit for whichever answer Cambridge wanted.</p>

              <i>Hi, I would like to ask how do I go about preparing for planning questions? I am doing pretty well in the normal papers but the 5% planning really a big handicap for myself.

              Louis, first of all, don't worry too much about the Planning Qn. You'll be better off focusing on polishing your remaining 95%, then the 5% whose preparation is notoriously difficult and not-worth-planning (pun intended) for.</p><p>For those of you who are still worried sick about the Planning Qn for H2 Chemistry, there are only 2 reliable sources for this (you can of course, try to buy online from ex-students, various Singapore JC notes on Planning, but note that I said *reliable* sources), namely Chan Kim Seng &amp; Jean Tan's H2 Chemistry Planning Book "Understanding Experimental Planning for Advanced Level Chemistry: The Learner's Approach" (<a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#Books_for_H2_Chemistry">see my website</a>), and Cambridge Mark Schemes on Planning Qns (<a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/#A_Level_Chem_Websites">I've included links to such websites here</a>).</p>

                  The topic of complex ions is actually more complex (pun intended) and cannot be fully understood at A levels. At A levels, you only need to know the basic principles and concepts, and you've to memorize the coordination numbers, geometries and colors of the commonly encountered coordination complexes.<p>For A level purposes, 3 simple concepts are relevant here : size of metal cation (if small, ie. period 2, only 4 ligands are possible, due to lack of vacant, energetically accessible d orbitals to accommodate an expanded octet), size of ligands (eg. water ligands small, so 6 are possible ; chloride ligands large, so only 4 are possible, to avoid excessive steric strain caused by van der Waals repulsions), charge on ligands (eg. water ligands neutral, so 6 are possible ; hydroxide ligands are negatively charged, so only 4 are possible, to avoid excessive steric strain caused by anionic repulsions between ligands).</p><p>Beyond these A level concepts, University level chemistry such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahn%E2%80%93Teller_effect">Jahn-Teller effect</a>, will be required to explain deeper questions on coordination complexes, eg. why [Cu(NH3)4]2+ has a square planar geometry instead of tetrahedral geometry.</p><p>Solubility is also a complex issue spread over several topics in the H2 syllabus, eg. chemical bonding, thermodynamics, solubility equilibria, Group 2, electrochemistry, organic chemistry, etc. The required answer at A levels depends on the context and H2 Chem syllabus topic that the question falls under. So there's no simple way to predict solubility (simple ways are for O levels, A levels are preparation for Uni level, in which everything becomes increasingly complex*). For the particular question you mentioned, falls under electrochem : only the oxidation potentials of Mg, Zn and Al, but not Cu, are sufficiently positive for their oxidation into aqueous and soluble metal cations when reacted with H+ from HCl (aq), to be thermodynamically feasible.</p><p>* In primary school, you thought you already knew everything in the Universe that could be known. In secondary school, you begin to realize you don't everything, but you still feel confident that you know almost everything. In JC and poly, you begin to understand that you don't really know all that much, and that the Universe is more complex than you thought. In University, you're humbled by the understanding that the Universe is so infinitely complex that you, and all sentient beings on Earth, actually know almost nothing relative to the infinitely vast Universe, but we know just enough to begin to appreciate and respect its beauty and complexity.</p>

              Your problem is you assume magnitude of hydration enthalpy always outweighs magnitude of endothermic lattice dissociation enthalpy, which is false. Either could outweigh the other. <p>Hence, without worrying about which magnitude outweighs which, you should simply add up the endothermic lattice dissociation enthalpy change (ie. positive value) with the exothermic hydration enthalpy change (ie. negative value) to obtain solution enthalpy change, which could be either endothermic or exothermic (ie. positive or negative value).

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">"Graphite is one of the
              allotropes of carbon. The graphite structure consists of hexagonal
              layers. Each carbon atom has one electron that can be delocalized
              parallel to the layers to make graphite a good electrical
              conductor.  </span></p>
              <p> Different atoms can be fitted in between the layers of
              carbon atoms to produce an usual set of â€œgraphite compoundsâ€�. When
              the graphite lattice contains atoms of alkali metal such as
              caesium, then a bronze-coloured solid is formed which has a greater
              conductivity than pure graphite.  </p>
              <p>In hexagonal boron nitride , the structure is composed of layers
              of hexagonal B3N3 ring. The boron atom utilizes all the three
              valence electrons to form covalent bonds with three neighbouring
              nitrogen atoms. Each nitrogen atom still has a lone pair of
              electrons which it utilizes to form a dative bond with an adjacent
              boron atom. Although graphite and hexagonal boron nitride have
              similar structures, they differ in electrical conductivity. Unlike
              graphite, boron nitride is an insulator.   </p>
              <p>When heated under pressure, this form of boron nitride is
