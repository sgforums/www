              <p>What mechanism and reaction will vinyl benzene + Br2(ethanolic) undergo? Im guessing electrophilic addition  of Br2 and the vinyl group. Is ethanolic purely a solvent like say CCl4? or is there a special reason for using an alcoholic medium which we usually encounter in elimination rxns for alkyl halide.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The common reason for using ethanol instead of aqueous or CCl4, is because many reactions involve one ionic (eg. KCN) and one non-polar (eg. aklyl halide) reactant, which will not be miscible if you use aqueous or CCl4 solvents. Instead, a middle-man which is part polar and part non-polar, such as alcohol, is used. And ethanol is the least toxic of the alcohols, and also the most balanced in terms of polarity. Thus ethanol is usually the solvent of choice.</p>
              <p>The other reason for using ethanolic solvent, say ethanolic OH- as opposed to aqueous OH-, is to control the behaviour (ie. reactivity) of the OH- ion. It can function as either a nucleophile (guy) or base (guy). As long as you shoot out your balls to grab someone else, you're a horny guy. But the girl can be either a petite H+ ion (really just a proton) or a voluptuous alkyl electrophile.</p>
              <p>With aqueous solvent, the OH- is better stabilized by more extensive H-bonding, and is thus less desperate to protonate itself (which it does so to stabilize itself), and will behave more as a nucleophile (rather than a base). With ethanolic solvent, it is less stabilized by less extensive H-bonding, and will be more desperate to stabilize itself, and thus behave more as a base (rather than nucleophile). I could go into more explicit analogies here (in terms of variant sexual behaviours), but I'm sure that won't be necessary.</p>
              <p>With vinyl benzene and  Br2 (ethanolic), the major product will be the addition product of Br+ and Br- across the double bond, and the minor product will be the addition product of Br+ and CH3CH2OH across the double bond, afterwhich the CH3CH2OH+ will lose a H+ and become the CH3CH2O alkoxy side chain on the alkyl side chain of the benzene ring.</p>

              <p>Hydrolysis is not addition of steam. That's called hydration (for organic chem context; in physical &amp; inorganic chem, hydration = solvation where water is the solvent). Hydrolysis in (physical + organic + inorganic) chemistry means "reaction with water", and in organic chem, can refer to OH- nucleophile in lieu of water nucleophile.<br><br>Aryl halides undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), of which nitration is but one such EAS reaction.</p>

              <p><br>When heated under reflux with hot acidified (or alkaline, followed by acidification) KMnO4, the diene 2HC=CH-CH=CH2 will undergo oxidative cleavage to generate carbonic(IV) acid + ethandial + carbonic(IV) acid, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence can decompose into CO2 + ethandial + CO2, which will be further oxidized to CO2 + ethandioic acid + CO2, which will be further oxidized to CO2 + carbonic(IV) acid + carbonic(IV) acid + CO2, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence can decompose into CO2 + CO2 + CO2 + CO2.<br><br>Hence the final product is just CO2.<br><br>Terminal =CH2 groups are oxidized to carbonic(IV) acid H2CO3, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence decomposes into CO2 and H2O.

              <p>Okay, I get it now, so Aryl Halides undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions in addition to electrophilic substitution. I wonder why nucleophilic substitution was not included in my notes for aryl halides. Thanks for clearing that up! </p>
              <p>Now, to apply the knowledge to the question, C6H5Cl doesn't react with hot ethanolic KOH due to the C-X partial double bond character( But i notice that this is a HOT ethanolic KOH solution... So should I say nucleophilic substitution reaction can occur? whereby the nucleophile is OH- ion)</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion, the rate of reaction of C6H5Cl is lower than that of C6H5CH2CH2Cl</p>
              <p>EDIT: I note that you mentioned conditions as 350 deg C and 200 atm required for nucleophilic substituion of Aryl Halides to occur. So I assume that no reaction take place between hot ethanolic KOH and C6H5Cl.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Yes, nucleophilic substitution does not readily occur with aryl halides (and again I repeat : for 'A' level purposes, you must state that aryl halides do [B][U]not[/U][/B] undergo hydrolysis or any other nucleophilic substitution under normal conditions, due to the C-X partial double bond character.</p>
              <p>This is why your JC lecture notes did not mention nucleophilic substitution for aryl halides, but only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">electrophilic aromatic substitution</span></strong> (it's annoying how JCs often leave out the word "aromatic", personally I would penalize all those JC teachers who leave out that word, but Cambridge accepts with or without the word "aromatic"... still, it's better to write the full name "electrophilic aromatic substitution" instead of "electrophilic substitution" for reactions in which the benzene ring is the nucleophile).</p>
              <p>Another annoying and lousy teaching by JCs is :<br>Remember how in 2011 Paper 3, there was a question which asked what is the type of reaction involved in generating an amide?<br>Many JCs teach "acylation" which is ambiguous and can refer to either Friedal-Crafts acylation (which is actually electrophilic aromatic substitution) or nucleophilic acyl substitution.</p>
              <p>The correct answer (to describe reactions which generate amides) is... and the exam-smart candidate will give all three answers (because they're all correctly describing different aspects of the same reaction) :<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nucleophilic acyl substutition; addition-elimination; condensation.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Some JCs only teach one or two out of the three keywords above. You should give all 3 answers, if you're exam-smart and want to secure your marks.</p>
              <p>You can <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> say "esterification" because here an amide, not ester, is generated.</p>
              <p>Yes, the rate of reaction of C6H5Cl is obviously and certainly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">much</span></strong> lower than that of C6H5CH2CH2Cl, and Cambridge expects you to be able to explain why (I already explained it many times on this forum).</p>

              <p><br>Right.</p>
              <p>FYI, nitration is a type of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) in which the benzene ring is the guy (nucleophile) and the nitronium cation is the girl (electrophile). You add on one NO2+ <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">electrophile</span></strong> and you lose one H+, so it's <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">substituting</span></strong> away a H+ for a NO2+ electrophile. And since the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">aromatic</span></strong> benzene is the nucleophile here, therefore we call this <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">electrophilic aromatic substutition</span></strong>.</p>

              <p>some questions to ask, pls help thank u!</p>
              <p>1. "down the group II, the elements dissolve in water with increasing ease." why is this so? is it because of lattice energy?</p>
              <p>2. when they say "higher lattice energy," i always can't tell if they mean higher as in the absolute value or higher in terms of the negative value. does it mean easier or harder to dissolve? ._.</p>
              <p>3. how to explain fully if they ask why a ring structure restricts the formation of cis-trans isomers?</p>
              <p>4. explain fully why the hydrogen radical cannot be formed? </p>
              <p>5. the enthalpy change of combustion for alkanes gets more and more negative as the carbon chain length increases. what is the explanation for that?</p>
              <p>6. just to clarify, is it true that ethanolic KOH/NAOH can not only do elimination, but also can do hydrolysis?</p>
              <p>7. explain why in SN2, the optical isomerism is reversed.</p>
              <p>8. also, is K or Kr larger in atomic radius? across the period the radius is supposed to get smaller, but my lecture notes says because van der waal's radii is measured for the group 0 elements, therefore it has the largest atomic radius. the answer from the book however, is K has the larger atomic radius.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q1.<br>For solubility of group II metals itself, look at oxidation potentials in Data Booklet. Bear in mind that by Hess Law, oxidation enthalpy = ionization enthalpy + hydration enthalpy. <br>For solubility of group II hydroxides versus carbonates &amp; sulfates, read :<br><a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group2/problems.html">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group2/problems.html</a></p>
              <p>Q2.<br>By default, Cambridge will always refer to the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the lattice energy. If this was Paper 3 or Paper 2, then you should be exam-smart and use the full terms "endothermic lattice dissociation energy" versus "exothermic lattice formation energy" (similarly for "endothermic bond dissociation energy" versus "exothermic bond formation energy" when describing covalent bond energies).</p>
              <p>Q3.<br>For small rings, only the so-called cis-isomer exists, because the trans-isomer will break the ring. For larger rings, the trans-isomer will exist, but may cause some degree of angle strain.</p>
              <p>Q4.<br>The hydrogen radical can indeed be formed, just that it's much less stable than most other radicals, and is therefore not encountered in the H2 syllabus, as other radicals (eg. alkyl, halogen, etc) would be preferentially formed instead during initiation and propagation steps.</p>
              <p>Q5.<br>Because we're not talking about more exothermic per C atom, but more exothermic per hydrocarbon molecule. The more C atoms present in a single molecule, the more bonds are broken (in reactants) but also formed (in products), and since combustion has proven to beexothermic, the magnitude of exothermic energy transfer always exceeds the magnitude of endothermic energy transfer, with this difference in magnitude increasing with an increasing number of C atoms per molecule.</p>
              <p>Q6.<br>Both are possible. In practice, all 4 reactions, SN1 vs SN2 vs E1 vs E2 are always in competition with each other. It's only in the simplified 'A' level syllabus that you simply state the major product when ethanol solvent is used, is the elimination product rather than substitution product. But in a tricky Cambridge question, you may still have to consider other (minor) possible products.</p>
              <p>Q7.<br>(If this was a Paper 3 or Paper 2 question, then)<br>Draw the diagram of the SN2 mechanism to clearly illustrate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN2_reaction">inversion of configuration</a> which occus during SN2 reaction, to secure full marks for such a question.</p>
              <p>Q8.<br>In a sense, it's true that you cannot make a fair comparison because Group 0 aka Group VIII noble gases only have van der Waals radius, while Group I metals only have atomic and ionic radius. But for simplified 'A' level purposes, just state that you expect the Kr atom to have a smaller atomic radius than K, because across the period, there is increasing effective nuclear charge.</p>

              <p>Q11. Ans is C. (ambiguous and debatable, cockanaden Cambridge, but this is the most likely the answer Cambridge wants, based on how Cambridge thinks. Notice Cambridge emphasized that the pH "increases <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">very slightly</span></strong>" which is absolutely correct when applied to a buffer).</p>
              <p>Q13. Ans is A. (ambiguous and debatable, cockanaden Cambridge, but this is the most likely the answer Cambridge wants, based on how Cambridge thinks. Actually, all 4 options are wrong. The y-axis should be (Vn-Vt) as the raw data, which should then be explained as being directly proportional the the molarity of the diazonium ion [C6H5N2+]. The 1/t is only relevant, but even then not at all necessary, if the volume of the gaseous product rather than molarity of aqueous reactant is used as the y-axis).</p>
              <p>Q23. Ans is B. (ambiguous and debatable, cockanaden Cambridge, but this is the most likely the answer Cambridge wants, based on how Cambridge thinks. Ideally, exact temperature and pressure should be given. But in the absence of such data, Cambridge's intention is to see if the student recognizes the reactivity of alkenes, which does indeed undergo hydration with H+ / H2O / heat, just more slowly if the temperature and pressure isn't high enough)</p>

              <p>Increasingly so in recent years (see 2010 paper), there will be a few such problematic questions in which even JC teachers will disagree with each other as to which is the best answer. Thus, these are arguably not fair questions to ask students. But Cambridge-SEAB would say, "<em>it's a bell-curve, so if it's not fair to everyone, it's still fair! *evil laughter*</em>"</p>

              <p>Q21.  As I said many times before (on these forums), the lone pair on the Cl atom delocalizes by resonance to generate a pi bond with the sp2 C atom of the alkene, giving the C-X bond in the resonance hybrid some partial double bond character, which makes it difficult for the Cl (leaving group) atom to be eliminated when a nucleophile (guy) tries to attack the electrophilic (girl) partial positive atom (partially positively charged, due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the more electronegative halogen atom).</p>
              <p>A secondary reason (which if Cambridge included it in the options, would then make this a ambiguous question with more than one arguable answer... but Cambridge didn't include this reason in the options) is that "guys only like girls, guys don't like guys" the pi-bond of the electron-rich alkene nucleophile repels the electron-rich OH- (or any other attacking) nucleophile.</p>
              <p>So the answer is obviously : C.</p>
              <p>Option A doesn't explain why, it just states a fact.<br>Option B is contradictory. If both are electron withdrawing (one by resonance and one by induction), then the C atom is destabilized, not stabilized.<br>Option D ambiguously states a fact (the restricted rotation is due to the partial double bond character, which is due to option C anyway) that doesn't answer the question directly (ie. doesn't explains the non-reactivity).</p>

              <p>Q27 is rather unfair. Though, evidently Cambridge knows this (that it's rather unfair), and thus gave an added hint in the form of solubility. So this question is testing the candidate for his/her understanding of solubilities, as much as (or even moreso than) testing for the candidates knowledge of reactivities of amines and amides.</p>
                                <p>What happens is that, after reacting PCl5 (electrophile) followed by NH3 (nucleophile), the intermediate is a benzene ring with two ortho substitutents : amide and amine. With these two ortho substitutents in close proximity, with sufficient heat and over sufficient time, the nucleophilic amine group is able to nucleophilically attack the electrophilic amide group (type of reaction : nucleophilic acyl substitution; mechanism : addition-elmination; alternative description : condensation), occuring simultaneously with a proton transfer reaction to generate product A and NH3(g).</p>

              <p>C6H5CH2Cl cannot undergo an E1 or E2 elimination of the hydrogen halide, because there is no beta-proton available to be abstracted by the base.

SN2 or SN1; SN1 is possible despite being a primary alkyl halide because the benzene ring can donate electrons by resonance to stabilize the carbocation), and oxidation (either by hot KMnO4, or by combustion).</p>

              <p><br>DIdn't you just finish your 'A' levels? If you continue to study Chemistry at higher levels, you'll learn to analyze in greater detail the factors the determine the relative % of products for a reaction, eg. one in which SN1 vs SN2 vs E1 vs E2 mechanisms are in competition with each other.<br><br>But to answer your question more directly, if it's not one single route, you've to open your mind to the possibility that it's several routes occurring simultaneously, to generate several products simultaneously. It's just a matter of (especially for 'A' levels) identifying the single most major route, mechanism and product.<br><br>For SN1 vs SN2, use electronics (electron-donating alkyl groups to stabilize carbocation intermediate) and sterics (steric hinderance by bulky alkyl groups on the incoming nucleophile).</p>
              <p>Both electronics and sterics collective predict SN2 for primary alkyl halides, SN1 for tertiary alkyl halides, and a mixture of both SN2 and SN1 for secondary alkyl halides.</p>
              <p>E1 and E2 mechanisms are not required for the H2 syllabus. If asked to draw elimination (eg. elimination of HX from alkyl halide using ethanolic NaOH), either E1 or E2 mechanisms will be accepted by Cambridge.</p>

              <p>Yes, simply because endothermic reactions generally have a significantly higher activation energy compared to exothermic reactions.<br><br>Also state that exothermic reactions are more energetically and thermodynamically favourable (just as positive entropy changes are more thermodynamically favourable compared to negative entropy changes).<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p>For 'A' level purposes, the assumption is that the enthalpy and entropy change values remain the same at different temperatures. In reality, these values do change with temperature (in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">addition</span></strong> to the temperature variable T, itself changing as well).</p>

                                <p>Because iodine (although non-polar) has very polarizable electron charge clouds (due to it's large no. of electrons and large atomic radius) and hence relatively stronger instantaneous dipole - induced dipole van der Waals (ie. London dispersion forces), in comparison to hydrogen iodide, which may be polar, but still has weaker permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (ie. Keesom forces) because it has a lot less electrons and H is much smaller, and accordingly it's molecular electron charge clouds are hence much less polarizable.</p>
                                <p>Polarity is therefore outweighed by no. of electrons, size of atom/molecule and hence polarizability of electron charge clouds. Permanent dipole - permanent dipole van der Waals (ie. Keesom forces) is only stronger than instantaneous dipole - induced dipole van der Waals (ie. London dispersion forces) in cases where the no. of electrons, size of atom/molecule, and hence hence polarizability of electron charge clouds, are comparable or similar.</p>

                                <p>Yes, such molecules are called meso compounds (assuming we're not talking about a racemic mixture of both enantiomers), which contain one or more chiral carbons, but are optically inactive due to either an internal plane of symmetry, and/or an internal center of inversion.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The yellow-white solid is simply solid aluminium chloride, which has a (sheet-like layered cubic) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">covalent polymeric structure</span></strong> or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ionic lattice structure</span></strong> (both description adjectives are acceptable and correctly describe the same structure, because there is both ionic and covalent character present in the bonds) in the solid state, as opposed to a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">simple covalent molecular</span></strong> structure in the liquid state (molecular dimer) or in the gaseous states (dimers at lower temperatures, monomers at higher temperatures).<br><br>The H2 syllabus only requires you to be able to draw the structures in the liquid and gaseous states (ie. the molecular dimer and monomer), so it's unlikely you'll be asked to draw the structure of AlCl3 in the solid state, but you should at least be aware that in the solid state it has a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ionic</span></strong> or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">polymeric</span></strong> lattice structure, and not simple molecular.<br><br>As your chemistry basics would have told you, simple molecular compounds are usually liquid or gaseous, not solid.<br><br>Check out an image of AlCl3 in the solid state here on Rod Beavon's webpage :<br><a href="http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/aluminiu.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #417e15;">http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/aluminiu.htm</span></span></a><br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>2011 'A' level exam qn :</p>
              <p><strong><em>Is PCl5 a simple molecular compound? If so, why is it solid at rtp? Draw it's structure in the solid state and describe the geometries involved.<br></em></strong><br>Answer :</p>
              <p>PCl5 exists as a simple molecular compound in the liquid state, but exists as ionic PCl4+ PCl6- in the solid state. The ionic geometries are tetrahedral and octahedral respectively for cation and anion.</p>
              <p>The P-Cl bond dissociation enthalpy is small, compared to the large amount of heat energy that can be evolved from forming the stronger ionic bonds. Hence formation of solid PCl5 is favoured under standard conditions.</p>
              <p>Simple molecular compounds (eg. water, methane, etc) are almost always liquid or gaseous at rtp, with the notable exception of iodine, for which the large no. of electrons and the large atomic radius, results in highly polarizable electron charge clouds, resulting in extensive and relatively strong instantaneous dipole - induced dipole van der Waals (ie. London dispersion forces), and hence iodine is a simple covalent molecular solid at room temperature.</p>
