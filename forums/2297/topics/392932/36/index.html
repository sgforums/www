                  Correct.<p>Because Group II or 2 ions are the cations with the polarizing power, hence the higher the cationic charge density and concordantly the greater the polarizing power up the Group, the higher the covalent character for the ionic compound.</p><p>Conversely Group VII or 17 ions are the anions with the polarizable electron charge clouds, hence the lower the anionic charge density and concordantly the greater the polarizability down the Group, the higher the covalent character for the ionic compound.</p>

                  That, plus less effective overlap of hybridized orbitals to form the sigma bond due to more diffused valence orbitals of the halogen atom down the Group.

                  U coconaden. Some tertiary alcohols can kena dehydrated into alkenes, some cannot. It's *not* a matter of whether it's a pri or sec or tert alcohol, rather it's a matter of availability of beta protons to be abstracted by the Bronsted-Lowry base in the E1 or E2 mechanism.<p>Figure out the mechanism for yourself, or go ask your school teacher or private tutor.</p>

              If the reagent were conc HNO3 + conc H2SO4 (ie. strong nitrating agent), then all 4 molecules would be nitrated. The question deliberately specified dilute HNO3 (ie. weak nitrating agent), to see if you can tell which benzene rings are sufficiently activated to react with dilute HNO3 (ie. weak nitrating agent).<p>Only D is sufficiently activated, because of the 2 electron-donating by resonance groups. If you're wondering why only mononitration occurs, it's because while OH and OR are both activating as they donate electrons by resonance, OH is a stronger activator than OR (why? I've already explained this somewhere among my 100+ questions on my BedokFunland JC website, go ask your school teacher or private tutor if you don't know), *and* NO2 group is strongly deactivating (ie. electron-withdrawing by *both* induction and resonance). Concordantly, while D is the only molecule sufficiently activated to undergo nitration with dilute HNO3 (ie. weak nitrating agent), but only mononitration occurs, ortho to the OH group.</p><p>C is not sufficiently activated (actually it's not activated at all), because by induction, the vinyl side-chain's sp2 C atom (ie. not being an sp3 C atom) does not donate electrons by induction. By resonance, the vinyl side-chain is in equal measure electron-donating and electron-withdrawing (vis-Ã -vis the benzene ring), and is hence neither. Concordantly, C is neither an activated or deactivated benzene ring, and requires conc HNO3 + conc H2SO4 (ie. strong nitrating agent) to undergo nitration.</p>

              Whether there'll be a mixture of products, or only 1 product, depends on other conditions and factors (eg. solvent, catalyst, pH, temperature, pressure, etc) beyond the A level syllabus. And it's not always just about bond strength enthalpy change alone which determines the product(s), but other factors are also relevant, eg. ring strain, angle strain, steric strain, torsional strain, induction, resonance, reagent mechanism, entropy, etc.
              <p>All of which you needn't bother with, in the context of this A level question (ie. Cambridge doesn't require or expect you to think about all these factors). If (in the 2016 A level exam), you're not sure which product you'll get, be exam smart and give both products, with qualifications and explanations as to why each alternative product is possible or possibly more favored / stable.</p>

                  Hi UltimaOnline, I have 2 questions here:</p>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
                   </p>

                  Q1: In a question which requires â€œstate what you would observe when
                  A is converted to Bâ€� or â€œstate the observationsâ€�, would a response
                  of â€œwhite fumes are evolvedâ€� (instead of â€œwhite fumes of HCl (g)
                  evolvedâ€�) suffice? I am of the opinion that given one cannot
                  possibly observe the identity of the fumes evolved, a response of
                  â€œwhite fumes are evolvedâ€� is sufficient and correct, and any
                  further details as to the identity of the gas is superfluous (and
                  wrong).</span></p>

                  When I mix A &amp; B or A &amp; C together, I will obtain AgCl (s),
                  which will be the white ppt soluble in ammonia as shown in row 1.
                  However, I do not understand the observations shown in row 2.
                  Mixing A &amp; C should produce iron (II) nitrate and silver
                  chloride - so where is there no white ppt produced, as per row 1,
                  and why is there a grey ppt (most likely it is iron)
                  formed?</span></p><br><br>Thank you, UltimaOnline :)<p></p>

              My thoughts: When I add iron (II) sulphate to bromine and chlorine,
              a redox reaction will occur and Fe3+ &amp; chloride/bromide will be

              the solution containing chloride and that containing bromide?
              According to the Eâ¦µ values, neither chloride nor bromide will be

              NJC Qn : this question has come up time and time again, because it is, as you suspect, a faulty question. While there is a slight difference in the color of solution (because color isn't just dependent on cation, but on ligand substitution equilibria as well), it is not sufficient to reliably distinguish between iron(III) chloride vs bromide. And while the differing magnitudes of thermodynamic feasibility translates into differing extents of equilibrium positions (and thus differing amounts of ppt obtained), this isn't an appropriate pedagogical assessment context for the H2 syllabus. In summary, this is a faulty question, but which by elimination still finds that option to be the most feasible (for MCQs, choose the 'most correct' answer, even if it isn't 100% correct).
              <p>YJC Qn : for such questions in the context of the A level H2 syllabus, instead of considering the transition metal orbitals in which the dative bond electrons reside in, treat such questions as simply asking you to deduce the OS of the metal cation, and concordantly, the electron-configuration. In other words, disregard the dative bonds residing in the transition metal orbitals.</p><p>NJC Qn : BaCO3 is significantly more stable than CaCO3, and at temperatures which decompose CaCO3, BaCO3 remains undecomposed and thus results in "effervescence" when mixed with HCl(aq).

              Geometrical isomerism consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis%E2%80%93trans_isomerism">cisâ€“trans isomerism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Z_notation">E-Z isomerism</a>. If there are only 2 R groups (need not be the same as each other), then cisâ€“trans isomerism can be used. If there are 3 or 4 R groups, then E-Z isomerism needs to be used.

                      Because of thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, which shifts the position of equilibrium (ie. it's an equilibrium, you'll still get some germinal diols).<p>As for why Tollen's can oxidize benzaldehydes while Fehling's can't, there are several reasons for this.</p><p>For A level purposes, the more relevant concept is the more positive reduction potential of Ag+ to Ag, compared to Cu2+ to Cu+.</p><p>At the same time, note that benzaldehyde is more resistant to oxidation compared to aliphatic aldehydes, as illustrated by the greater magnitude of oxidation state difference between the reactant (C atom's OS approximately 0.5 in the resonance hybrid for benzaldehyde, versus C atom's OS of +1 in aliphatic aldehydes) and the product (OS of +3 in the carboxylate ion).</p><p>Oxidizing benzaldehydes are not a problem for stronger oxidizing agents K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 (with more positive reduction potentials), which are (by virtue of higher oxidation states and charge densities of the Mn and Cr atoms) able to utilize a stronger ionic oxidation mechanism, as opposed to a weaker free radical oxidation mechanism for Fehling's and Tollen's, in which the more positive reduction potential for Ag+ to Ag over Cu2+ to Cu+ just sufficiently overcomes the larger thermodynamic barrier for the oxidation of benzaldehyde (as opposed to aliphatic aldehydes) via the weaker free radical mechanism (as opposed to the stronger ionic mechanism).

                                        Due to the restricted rotation of the sigma bonds within the bicyclic ring (if u dunno why the ring must be bicyclic, go ask ur school teacher or private tutor), it's impossible to have 2^2 optical stereoisomers (considering only the 2 chiral carbons); instead the configuration is fixed at either RS or SR or RR or SS (u can work out exactly which urself, using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules). And therefore its mirror image will be SR or RS or SS or RR (respectively). That's why the YJC answer considered both chiral carbons as just one chiral carbon, instead of 2, when working out no. of stereoisomers.<p>I suspect u still won't understand this, so u better go ask ur school teacher or private tutor. Move on.</p>

              <p>gaseous SOCl2 bubbled into a soln containing molecules with

Overall the only acceptable adjective is redox disproportionation (or disproportionation redox, Cambridge accepts either) reaction. It involves a hydride H- transfer, followed by a proton H+ transfer at the end. So to say it's a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base proton transfer, rather than more accurately a redox disproportionation reaction, is misleading and credit unworthy.<p>Due to the bicyclic rings, 4 chiral C atoms are 'merged' into 2 chiral C atoms, as far as calculation of stereoisomers are concerned. </p><p>However, because this is considered beyond A levels, hence in the A level exam, especially if it's MCQ, you may have to consider either possibility as correct (ie. Cambridge may think A level students aren't smart enough to understand or recognize the problematic bicyclic ring circumstance, and so the 'correct' answer may actually be the 'wrong' one; so if both possibilities appear as different options, then u jia lat liao).</p><p>If it's a P2 or P3 qn, the exam-smart BedokFunland JC student will give both possible answers, with qualifications and explanations.</p><p>Besides, this question (and hopefully Cambridge's questions) only asked for how many chiral C atoms, instead of asking how many stereoisomers are possible.</p>

Be like me, any ambiguous qn like these, just make a relaxed, stress-free educated guess on what Cambridge wants (based on what Cambridge thinks A level students know) and make ur choice, or (if u're really good enough like me), skip the qn also still can get A grade. *evil laugh*

              For every acidic group (this includes the conjugate acids of basic groups), there will be a specific pH of the solution in which you've equal molarities of conjugate acid and conjugate base (for this particular acidic group), correct? (this is common sense).<p>Chemists call this pH (which is unique for all acidic groups) the pKa value (for this particular acidic group).</p><p>Hence, when pH starts getting more alkaline, you get higher molarity of conjugate base, lower molarity of conjugate acid.

H3A2+, H2A+, HA, A-, etc, it's only a matter of correctly identifying the major species present at any given pH for A levels (at Uni levels, you need to identify the 1st most major species, the 2nd most major species, the 3rd, and so on, at any given pH).</p>

              Alkyl side-chain of benzene is considered an 'alkane'.<p>To determine product distribution of halogenation via free radical substitution, mathematically combine both factors :</p><p><b>No. of H atoms substitutable x Stability of alkyl radical intermediate</b> (also known as Kinetic Reactivity of Pri vs Sec vs Tert H atoms)</p><p>Take the halogenation of butane for instance. In terms of "No. of H atoms substitutable", you'd expect 1-halobutane to be the major product (since 6 H atoms vs 4 H atoms). In terms of "Stability of alkyl radical intermediate", you'd expect 2-halobutane to be the major product (since the secondary alkyl radical intermediate to generate secondary alkyl halide 2-halobutane, is more stable than the primary alkyl radical intermediate to generate primary alkyl halide, 1-halobutane ; the more stable the intermediate, the lower the Ea, hence the faster the rate of reaction, resulting in the major product).</p><p>Overall, to determine which factor outweighs which to result in the major product, you'd have to combine both factors mathematically (don't memorize the relative stabilities or reactivities, the exam question will provide it, as this factor depends on the specific halogen, as well as specific temperature).</p>

              <p>Edit. I think I get the answer. Reaction 3 specify that organic
              product produced has Mr of 138. Which means chlorine is removed. If
              reaction 3 is not there, can I assume that chlorine is attached to
              the ring instead of the alkyl group? The answer sheets say that
              reaction 1 shows that chlorine is attached to the alkyl group
              instead of the benzene ring, which doesn't make sense for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do I need to remember how to produce phenol from benzene?</p>

              Reaction 3 is a better choice, as only alkyl benzenes can be oxidized by KMnO4 to hydroxybenzoic acid. Reaction 5 is a weaker reason, as it could imply an acyl halide side chain (although the degree of unsaturation won't fit, but most H2 students won't know how to check for this anyway).<p>Without OH-(aq), only alkyl halides can be hydrolyzed upon warming (adding OH- would of course speed up the reaction). If the Cl atom was attached to the benzene ring as you suggest, then due to the C-Cl bond strengthened by having partial double bond character in the resonance hybrid, concordantly and consequently not only would OH-(aq) be required (now you understand why Cambridge didn't use OH-(aq)? now you understand the answer sheet?), but a much higher temperature is required (the question specified 'warm'), and besides, the nucleophilic aromatic substitution hydrolysis (via the elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate) of aryl halides to phenol is beyond the H2 A level syllabus.</p><p>At University and professional levels, there are many different ways to generate phenol from benzene, but none of these are taught at A levels. In other words, within the H2 A level syllabus, there is no (within syllabus) method you can generate phenol from benzene. Of course, if you're aiming for a distinction A grade, it's always useful to expose yourself beyond the syllabus.</p>

                                Whatâ€™s wrong with Choice B, given that acid strength increases from
                                HCl to HI? Interestingly when I researched on the pH of these
                                compounds in a fixed concentrations their pH are the same.

                                the solubility product, the ionic product being equal to the

                                Hi Gohby, no prob ;)<p>Q1: DHS/2015/P1/Q14. While acid strength (indicated by pKa) increases from HCl to HI, but due to the leveling effect, in aqueous solutions they are all strong acids which dissociate completely and hence result in the same pH.</p><p>Q2: DHS/2015/P1/Q34. You're right. Perhaps (lame, but) the DHS teacher question-setter was nitpicking that "likely" should be replaced with "definitely", since the maximum OS of V is +5 (based on electron configuration).</p><p>Q3: VJC/2015/P1/Q3. The question is asking for the configuration of M3+. "Ground state" must always be specified, otherwise there would be many permutations and combinations possible for excited states.</p><p>Q4: VJC/2015/P1/Q11 (it's Q11, not Q14). "Ionic product" is always intended to be "initial before precipitation". This is a somewhat unfair question, as the mathematics involved goes beyond A levels, but conceptually still examinable as a sadistic distinction question.</p><p>The VJC teacher question-setter's thinking (and feeling rather proud of him/herself for setting such a tricky question, no doubt) is that in sufficiently large excess of halide ions, not only would all the precipitate dissolve, but even the molarity of aqueous Pb2+ ion, would eventually decrease to become even less than at point V, due to large excess of halide ions pulling the position of equilibrium over to the RHS to form the coordination complex ion, ie. [PbCl4]2- and [PbI4]2-, which are not considered as Pb2+(aq).

                                The benzylic H atom requirement for side-chain oxidation is specifically for hydrocarbon level. Since the side-chain is already semi-oxidized to the carbonyl level, KMnO4 can indeed further oxidize the carbonyl side-chain to a benzoic acid.<p><br>            </p><blockquote>

                  Yeah, phenols don't even have a benzylic C atom, that's why.

                  Phenols are rather easily oxidized despite the absence of a
                  hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl bearing carbon. Among the colored
                  products from the oxidation of phenol by chromic acid is the
                  dicarbonyl compound </span><strong style="font-size: 42.056px; line-height: 1.3; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;">para-benzoquinone</strong></p>

                  Indeed, when this question came out for a top JC Prelim paper a couple of years ago, only my BedokFunland JC students were able to draw the oxidation product.<p>Why? I'll give you a hint : unlike Singapore JC H2 Chem students, only my BedokFunland JC students (together with H3 Chem and Olympiad Chem students), understand both the meaning of <b>resonance contributors vs resonance hybrid</b>, as well as my BedokFunland JC formula for calculating Oxidation State.</p>
