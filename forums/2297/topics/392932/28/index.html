                                                            Q8. No, deprotonation is necessary for this reaction because hydroxylamine (and all amines) are too weak a nucleophile to attack the ester (which is a weak electrophile because the partial positive charge on the C atom is only due to induction, not resonance ; resonance is the same reason why the weak nucleophile 2,4-DNPH only reacts with the more electrophilic aldehyde and ketone, but not the less electrophilic carboxylic acids, esters and amides).<p>
                                                            
                                                            Q9. Yes, there's an error in the mechanism. While it's not required for the basic H2 syllabus, but if you're serious about getting your A grade, it'll be good for you to understand and be familiar with such mechanisms (not blindly memorize, of course).</p><p>For A grade H2 Chem, H3 Chem and Olympiad Chem students, here is the SOCl2 mechanism by James Ashenhurst : <a href="http://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/12/03/reagent-friday-thionyl-chloride-socl2/">http://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2011/12/03/reagent-friday-thionyl-chloride-socl2</a></p><p>For A grade H2 Chem, H3 Chem and Olympiad Chem students who are seriously intending to study Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, Pharmacy, Dentistry or Medicine in the University, here is a more advanced discussion on the stereochemistry of the SOCl2 mechanism :</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/SNi_reaction_mechanism.gif"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNi"><br></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNi">Image source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNi</a>

                                                            Q10. Yes, carbocation rearrangements can be due to hydride or alkyl shifts. See Leah Fisch's YouTube video here : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSW9LDxtuoA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSW9LDxtuoA</a>, or Khan Academy's YouTube video here : <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry/substitution-elimination-reactions/e1-e2-tutorial/v/carbocations-and-rearrangements">https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry/substitution-elimination-reactions/e1-e2-tutorial/v/carbocations-and-rearrangements</a></p><p>
                                                            Q11. Yes, and yes. The condition for side-chain oxidation by KMnO4 is that at least 1 benzylic H atom or benzylic OH group must be present.</p><p>
                                                            Q12. Eh look carefully lah, there's only 1 possible dehydration (ie. elimination of H2O) product, as the 2 terminal or beta methyl groups are equivalent. </p><p>Also, when it comes to Markovnikov's or Zaitsev's rules, don't blindly apply or quote them. If Cambridge asks why such-&amp;-such is the major product, you'll need to explain *why*, ie. the basis for *how* and *why* Markovnikov or Zaitsev's rule works (or in more challenging qns, may fail to work).</p><p>Good that you can suggest suspecting the C=O group, but such groups undermine Markovnikov's rule, not Zaitsev's rule, so it's irrelevant to this particular question. For an example of how the major product can controlled to be the Hofmann product instead of the Zaitsev product, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaitsev%27s_rule#Steric_effects">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaitsev%27s_rule#Steric_effects</a>.</p>

Never be ambiguous in your A level exam answers, if Cambridge asks "what is this reaction?" you should specify "halogenation via _________ (mechanism)".</p><p>So what exactly are you asking?

                      Edited : <i>"for my Q12, I was wondering why the dehydration cannot occur
                                                with the H from the aldehyde (taking H from a C that is 'less rich'
                                                in H)."</i></p><p>Eh sial lah! From your statement above, it shows you're just blindly memorizing and applying Markovnikov's and/or Zaitsev's rules without a proper understanding of *how* or *why* they usually work (and thus when they sometimes won't work)! You (ie. most Singapore JC students) jialat liao lah, this is the kind of teaching in Singapore JCs which illustrates the superiority of my BedokFunland JC pedagogy : <b>*Understanding* then applying</b> (as opposed to "blindly memorizing then applying" as taught in Singapore JCs).</p><p>                         As to your Zaitsev qn : Ahhh ok, what you mean is you're thinking of generating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketene">ketene functional group</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyloin">acyloin functional group</a>, well you could have just said so ;Ãž</p><p>
                                                There are a couple of problems with your proposed reaction. First of all, it's not even thermodynamically feasible to generate a ketene (which is highly unstable and reactive) from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloketone">alpha-haloaldehyde/ketone</a>, much less from an alpha-hydroxyaldehyde/ketone (ie. the acyloin functional group).</p><p>The dehydration of alcohols to alkene involves the the E2 mechanism (pri &amp; sec alcohols) or E1 mechanism (sec &amp; tert alcohols) catalyzed by an acid (see <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/mechanisms/elim/dhethanol.html">Jim Clark</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry/substitution-elimination-reactions/elimination-reactions-tutorial/v/e2-reactions">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2012/10/10/comparing-the-e1-and-e2-reactions/">James Ashenhurst</a>).</p><p>But when you have an acyloin functional group, it's more kinetically and thermodynamically feasible to protonate the carbonyl group rather than the hydroxy group, in which case hydrolysis of the aldehyde into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminal_diol">germinal diol</a> occurs instead, which is unstable and simply dehydrates back into the aldehyde.</p><p>
                                                But since it's not entirely impossible or inconceivable (just less kinetically and thermodynamically favourable) for your proposed mechanism pathway to occur (ie. to generate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketene">ketene functional group</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyloin">acyloin functional group</a>) as a minor pathway or product via the E2 mechanism (E1 is even less feasible because of the destabilizing inter-nuclei repulsions between the partial and formal positively charged adjacent C atoms in the hypothetical carbocation intermediate), what happens then?</p><p>
                                                Under the reaction conditions to dehydrate an alcohol into an alkene (ie. concentrated H2SO4 acid catalyst), the highly unstable and reactive ketene product generated would be immediately acid-hydrolyzed into a carboxylic acid (try drawing out the mechanism for this reaction ; Cambridge asked data-based questions about the reaction of ketenes in both the UK / CIE and Singapore A level papers in recent years).
                                                </p><p>So the bottomline : good that you've considered the possibility* of obtaining a ketene as an alternative product, but unless the question gives you hints that the product is a ketene, you should stick to the more syllabus-familiar product of a normal alpha-carbonylalkene, rather than the more unstable ketene (H2 Chem students are expected to be able to deduce its instability by its structure). But nonetheless (as I said, good that you've thought-out-of-the-box* and considered the ketene product), in the A level exams, if you're not sure if the unusual product (here, the ketene) is a viable alternative product (or even one required by the Cambridge qn), then the exam-smart BedokFunland JC thing to do, is to give both answers (ie. draw structures of both alternative products), with labels or annotations as to which is likely to be the more stable (ie. thermodynamic) product, and hence major product.</p><p>* updated : actually it turned out you were just blindly applying Markovnikov's / Zaitsev's rule, not creatively thinking out-of-the-box... *sigh*

                                                  Yes, the BF3 molecule is an electrophilic Lewis acid (with the B atom being the dative bond acceptor). The term "Lewis acid" refers to its propensity to accept dative bonds, while the term "electrophile" refers to its propensity to seek electrons, so both terms are closely related, but not technically the same. In addition, the terms "nucleophile" and "electrophile" are by convention, favored for use specifically in Organic Chemistry, while the terms "Lewis base" and "Lewis acid" are overarching archetypes across all branches of Chemistry. For Cambridge A level Chemistry purposes, exam-smart students are advised to combine both terms (ie. any and all relevant terms or keywords for all questions in general) to secure the marks, even if Cambridge is usually reasonable and will accept either term.<p>In case you were asking *why* BF3 is an electrophilic Lewis acid, it's because the B atom only has 3 bond pairs + 0 lone pairs, and thus lacks a noble gas stable octet valence shell electron configuration, and thus has a propensity to accept a dative bond to achieve a stable octet electron configuration.
                                                  </p><p>
                                                  For 2 closely related reasons. Firstly, because Al has a larger atomic radius than B, and thus polarizability of the electron bond pairs of the H- hydride ions increase with increasing distance from the central 'cationic' atom, as predicted by Coloumb's law, and also due to increasing shielding effect from larger number of inner shell electrons. Secondly, the lattice dissociation enthalpy for the covalent bonds with the hydride ions becomes less endothermic (ie. bond weakens) as bond length increases from BH4- to AlH4-, due to less effective overlap of more diffused electron shell orbitals involved in forming the sigma bonds. For both reasons above, concordantly and consequently, LiAlH4 is a significantly more effective delivery agent of H- hydride ion nucleophiles, compared to NaBH4.</p>

              Because in the presence of acidic conc HCl, the product is the protonated conjugate acid phenylammonium ion (which is water soluble due to ion - permanent dipole interactions and hence difficult to separate from the other species present), which must thus be deprotonated by excess NaOH(aq) to obtain the desired product phenylamine, which must then be extracted via <b>steam distillation</b>.<p>The experimental details of steam distillation are beyond A levels, but Cambridge can (and have in past A level papers) set challenging questions on the chemistry concepts underlying practical procedures (including steam distillation). Students seriously intending to score a distinction A grade for your A levels, are strongly advised to study the following webpages.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Source : <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/aniline/preparation.html">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/aniline/preparation.html</a></p><p>Sodium hydroxide solution is added to the product of the first stage of the reaction. The phenylamine is formed together with a mixture of tetrahydroxozincate(II) and hexahydroxozincate(IV) complex tin ions formed from the tetrachlorozincate(II) and hexachlorozincate(IV) complex tin ions present during the acidic HCl stage. The phenylamine is finally separated from this mixture. The separation is long, tedious and potentially dangerous (and thus not experimentally carried out at A levels, but questions can still be asked on the procedure), involving steam distillation, solvent extraction and a final distillation.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Source : <a href="http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10531/preparation-of-phenylamine-aniline">http://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/10531/preparation-of-phenylamine-aniline</a></p><p>This is the procedure I (a Chemistry undergraduate student) carried out in the lab :<br>

              â€¢What is the reaction between the tin and hydrochloric acid?<br>
              â€¢Sn + 2HCl â†’ Sn2+ + 2Cl- + H2<br><br>
              â€¢What is the reducing agent, and to what is it oxidised?<br>
              â€¢The reducing agent is Sn2+, which is oxidised to Sn4+.<br><br>
              â€¢What is the initial precipitate, and what does it become on addition of excess sodium hydroxide?<br>
              â€¢Tin(IV) hydroxide Sn(OH)4 (s). This is amphoteric, and with more alkali forms the soluble Sn(OH)6 2- hexahydroxozincate(IV) complex ion.<br><br>
              â€¢Why is more water added to the solution?<br>
              â€¢This enables a technique called steam distillation. In the large-scale preparation steam is blown through the mixture; in this one the steam is generated in situ. Phenylamine distils over with the steam; any unchanged nitrobenzene and the inorganic materials do not.<br><br>
              â€¢Why is the initial distillate cloudy?<br>
              â€¢It is a mixture of water and phenylamine which formas a cloudy emulsion<br><br>
              â€¢What is the clear condensate?<br>
              â€¢Water; by now all the phenylamine has distilled over.<br><br>
              â€¢What is the purpose of adding sodium chloride?<br>
              â€¢Phenylamine is significantly soluble in water, but very much less so in saturated sodium chloride solution. This process is called 'salting out'.<br><br>
              â€¢What is the purpose of adding ethoxyethane?<br>
              â€¢Solvent extraction; phenylamine is much more soluble in ethoxyethane than it is in water.<br><br>
              â€¢Why are two portions of 4 cm3 used, rather than a single 8cm3 portion of  of ethoxyethane?<br>
              â€¢The theory of solvent extraction is a branch of chemical equilibria. It can be mathemically shown (and can be asked in data-based A level exam questions) that any solvent extraction is more effective if a given volume of extracting solvent is used in several portions rather than in a single one.<br><br>
              â€¢Suggest a reason for using KOH as a drying agent, rather than the more conventional calcium chloride or sodium sulphate.<br>
              â€¢The use of potassium hydroxide would also eliminate any traces of hydrochloric acid in the phenylamine.<br><br>
              â€¢Why must all flames in the laboratory be extinguished?<br>
              â€¢The vapour of ethoxyethane is very dense and will creep along bench-tops over a considerable distance. It is possible for an explosion to ensue even if the source of ignition is several metres away from where the ethoxyethane is being used.<br><br>
              â€¢Why is the water run out of the condenser?<br>
              â€¢Phenylamine has a sufficiently high boiling temperature for an air condenser to be efficient at condensing the vapour.<br><br>
              â€¢Why is the phenylamine kept condensing on the thermometer bulb before allowing distillation to proceed?<br>
              â€¢This allows the thermometer to come into thermal equilibrium with the vapour - a general necessity in distillation, but needing more care than usual if the boiling temperature of the distillate is high. Phenylamine boils at 184oC.

              For the HCJC qn, only C is possible, since the halogen radical only abstracts H atoms in propagation steps, leaving behind alkyl radicals which can form new C-C bonds with other alkyl radicals in termination steps. Options A, B and D require cleavage of C-C bonds, and/or other alkane molecules such as methane and ethane to be available. Try drawing out the reaction mechanisms, you'll find only C is possible.<p>For the MJC qn, the 2 factors which determine product distribution during free radical substitution are : no. of H atoms substitutable, and stability of alkyl radical intermediates (aka reactivities of pri vs sec vs tert H atoms). Based on no. of H atoms substitutable, ratio of 1-bromo-2-methylpropane to 2-bromo-2-methylpropane should be 9 : 1. Based on stability of alkyl radical intermediates, ratio of 1-bromo-2-methylpropane to 2-bromo-2-methylpropane should be 1 : 6. Hence, actual ratio obtained (ie. combining the 2 factors mathematically by multiplication) = 9 x 1 : 1 x 6 = 9 : 6 = 3 : 2

But it doesn't really matter, coz Cambridge doesn't use either term, rather, Cambridge will call it "displayed structural formula" or "full structural formula" (ie. the Kekule structure, with lone pairs not required to be shown unless the molecular or ionic geometry is also required), as opposed to <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Carbon-dioxide-octet-dot-cross-2D.png">dot-&amp;-cross structures</a>.</p><p>
                                Lastly, Singapore JC teachers also wrongly call the resonance contributor of benzene as "the Kekule structure of benzene". (Actually here, it's not totally the Singapore JC teachers' error, becoz in a way it was Kekule's own error when he drew out the structure of benzene over a hundred years ago, but don't blame him, he was still the first human to come closest to the correct structure of benzene (you should check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene#Ring_formula">alternative proposed structures of benzene by other rival chemists</a>), and back then, humans didn't understand the concept of resonance contributors and resonance hybrids (which Singapore JCs only properly teach to H3 Chem &amp; OIympiad Chem students, depriving poor H2 Chem students of a proper understanding of Chemistry), so Mr Kekule was still the best man with the best idea back then).</p><p>
                                This (what Singapore JCs call as the "Kekule structure of benzene") is more correctly called the Kekule/Lewis structure and skeletal structural formula (respectively) for the <b>resonance contributor</b> of benzene :</p><p>

And when drawing structures or mechanisms, Cambridge will accept either the resonance hybrid (ie. with the circle in the middle, which Singapore JCs anally insist you draw this instead of the resonance contributor with alternating double and single bonds, because they're afraid you JC H2 students are not intelligent enough to understand the intricacies of the differences between resonance contributor and resonance hybrid), or the resonance contributors (ie. with the alternating double and single bonds, which is actually the more correct structure to use when drawing reaction mechanisms, as you'll learn in the University, if you take Chemistry or Medicine in the University).</p><p>Cambridge will accept either the resonance contributor or hybrid, so no worries. Of course, the A level shortcut of using the resonance hybrid saves time, so go ahead and use it (most students can't even complete doing all questions in the A level paper during the A level exams). But if you want a deeper understanding of Chemistry, and also for some of the more challenging exam A grade distinction questions (eg. one of my BedokFunland JC H2 Chemistry questions : <b><i>Under certain conditions, para- aminophenol, also known as para- hydroxyphenylamine, can be oxidized to generate a product with molecular formula C6H5NO. By drawing the simplified free radical mechanism to represent the reaction, elucidate the structure of the product.</i></b>), you'll find that using the resonance contributor is actually superior to using the resonance hybrid.

                                N2O2 exists, but under standard conditions at 25 deg C, it decomposes into NO monomers with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, with the position of equilibrium lying so far towards the NO monomer side that the molarity of N2O2 dimer is negligible. You need to cool NO into its liquid state (âˆ’152 Â°C) to have a significant molarity of N2O2 dimer.

              Formation of dimers needn't necessarily involve dative covalent bonds lah, depending on the exact species involved, dimers can formed via hydrogen bonds or normal (ie. non-dative) covalent bond, especially for free radicals (they dimerize in a free-radical termination step, while dissociation into monomers is a free-radical initiation step).<p>Ur drawing of N2O2 is fine, now draw the electron-flow curved-arrow reaction-mechanism for both the forward (free-radical termination) reaction to generate the N2O2 dimer, as well as the backward (free-radical initiation) reaction to dissociate the N2O2 dimer into NO monomers.</p><p>A very similar question was asked by Cambridge a couple of years ago, but many students couldn't do it, coz many Singapore JCs didn't teach their students how to properly draw the curved arrow mechanism for termination steps (most schools just teach their students to write the mechanism, not draw it with curved arrows).</p>

              only so far as to generate BeO(s) or Be(OH)2(s), Cambridge will
              accept either equation, unless otherwise specified by the question.

                  Yah, N2O4 is a dimer of NO2, and NO2 is a monomer of N2O4. The terms monomer and dimer are relationship adjectives, and have no meaning on its own. So "N2O4 is a dimer" is a wrong statement, but "N2O4 is a dimer of NO2 monomers" is a correct statement.<p>For the most commonly asked at A levels H-bond dimer, click on the link below, followed by clicking on "images".</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=ethanoic+acid+dimer">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=ethanoic+acid+dimer</a></p>

                                                    <p>Having said that, there is a significant difference between CO2
                                    and XeF2, which is : in CO2, the central partially positively
                                    charged C atom has no lone pairs, while the central partially
                                    positively charged Xe atom has 3 lone pairs. Therefore the

                                    for XeF2. And yet XeF2 has a much higher melting point than CO2,
                                    because XeF2 has a lot more electrons, has much larger molecular
                                    size, and therefore has significantly more polarizable electron

                                    <p>I thought XeF2 would have a larger net dipole moment than CO2,
                                    hence more significant Pd-Pd than CO2??</p>

                                    Both XeF2 and CO2 are linear, and hence have no overall net dipole. However, because C has no lone pairs, it is more electron-deficient compared to Xe with 3 lone pairs. Hence, based on this factor alone, you might expect C to be more partial positive compared to Xe. However, as I pointed out years ago, the most important factor remains polarizability of electron charge clouds, and Xe being in Period 5, has a much larger atomic radius than C, as well as greater shielding effect from greater number of inner shell electrons, and as such, coupled with the greater electronegativity of F over O, the magnitude of partial positive charge on Xe will still be greater than on C. Consequently, the intermolecular van der Waals interactions (all 3 types of van der Waals forces : permanent dipole - permanent dipole Keesom forces, permanent dipole - induced dipole Debye forces, and instantaneous dipole - induced dipole London dispersion forces) will still be far stronger between XeF2 molecules compared to between CO2 molecules.<p>Based on the simplified (and often erroneous) teachings of Singapore JCs, almost all H2 Chem students (and even some JC teachers) will be instantly dismissive of the idea of any permanent dipole - permanent dipole intermolecular interactions between (overall) non-polar molecules like CO2. And yet permanent dipole - permanent dipole Keesom forces *does* exist between some non-polar molecules like CO2, On a related note, during hydration which occurs before hydrolysis, (overall) non-polar CO2 can actually even participate in hydrogen bonding. I won't elaborate or explain why here on the forum (where's the fun in that?), interested students can go figure out for themselves (or ask their school teachers or private tutors).</p>

                                Intermolecular permanent dipole - induced dipole Debye van der Waals forces exists between the polar part of a molecule (eg. polar carbonyl group of a large ketone), and the non-polar part of a neighboring (but same species) molecule (eg. non-polar alkyl group of a large ketone). This is why all 3 types of van der Waals forces usually exist between most molecules (and many Singapore JCs erroneously teach their students that dipole - dipole interactions isn't the same as van der Waals interactions, and in doing so mislead and confuse their students ; in fact all 3 types of dipole - dipole interactions *are* the 3 types of van der Waals forces). 
                                <p>
                                                  By definition of electronegativity (which Cambridge can test you in the Singapore A levels), electronegativity only affects bond pairs, not lone pairs. Hence, no matter how electronegative F is, only the electron density of the bond pairs will be polarized towards F. The 3 lone pairs on the Xe atom remains unpolarized.</p>

                  All your structures are wrong. The question specified the products are generated as a result of intra and inter molecular esterifications, and dehydration of alcohol to alkene is not involved (as verified by the degree of unsaturation). O1 (hence M1 and G1 as well) is/are wrong because geminal diols spontaneously dehydrate to generate aldehydes / ketones, with a negligible molarity of the geminal diol present at equilibrium (it's true that KMnO4 and K2Cr2O7 oxidizes aldehydes via their hydrolysis into geminal diols, but KMnO4 and K2Cr2O7 are able to thusly shift the position of equilibrium to the RHS as the geminal diol is oxidized into carboxylic acid). Your O2 (and thus M2, G2, M3, G3 as well) is/are wrong because your M2, M3 and G3 suffers from excessive ring strain due to angle strain (an approximately 90 deg 4-membered ring is already strained from sp3 C atoms ideally 109.5 deg, let alone sp2 vinylic C atoms ideally 120 deg C). Now that I've revealed your structures of O are wrong, there's only 1 possible structure left, which is the correct structure of O, and hence the correct M and G follows accordingly.<p>Because of both sterics and electronics : the electrophilic C atom in benzaldehyde suffers from greater steric hindrance (for the incoming nucleophile) compared to methanol ; in terms of electronics methanal has a valid resonance contributor in which the carbonyl C atom has a unipositive formal charge, while in benzaldehyde the unipositive formal charge is delocalized from the benzylic C atom over to the ortho, para and ortho C atoms in the benzene ring, consequently in their resonance hybrids, the magnitude of partial positive charge and hence electrophilicity, is significantly greater in the methanal C atom than in the benzaldehyde C atom.</p><p>The O-Mg bond in the intermediate R-O-Mg-X upon nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagent, has significant covalent and ionic character both. Unless otherwise specified by the question, Cambridge will accept it whether you draw &amp; describe the bond as ionic (with significant covalent character), or as covalent (with significant ionic character). It's actually better to draw it as ionic (ie. O- +Mg with formal charges between them), to show Cambridge that you're aware of the greater magnitude of electronegativity difference between O &amp; Mg compared to C &amp; Mg (which is more covalent than ionic).</p>

If the ligands are huge, eg. Cl- ligands, then to avoid excessive steric strain from van der Waals repulsions between the ligands, there will only be 4 instead of 6 ligands. When you know there are 4 ligands, then whether the geometry of the coordination complex is tetrahedral or square planar depends on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahn%E2%80%93Teller_effect">Jahnâ€“Teller effect</a> (which is of course way beyond the A level H2 syllabus), as well as other conditions that favor either stereoisomer (some coordination complexes can exist as an equilibrium between tetrahedral and square planar, with the position of equilibrium affected by other factors beyond A levels).<p>For A level purposes, unless the coordination complex is well-known and student familiarity is expected (eg. such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraamminecopper(II)_sulfate">Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin">Cisplatin</a>), Cambridge (and AJC here) will accept either square planar or tetrahedral, as long as the corresponding bond angles are correct.

And the AJC qn was closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisplatin">Cisplatin</a>, which is a famous chemotherapy drug and hence you should be aware that it's square planar and has cis-trans isomerism (although it's not in the Singapore H2 syllabus, but it's in the IB and other A level Chem syllabuses, and if you're serious about A grade, you should expose yourself to stuff like this beyond your own A level syllabus).

                          Because I know how Cambridge marks, I know the distinction A grade boundary and I know how the bell-curve works, hence I can choose to skip whichever questions or practical procedures I'm not interested in doing, and still get my A grade every year. So I don't get 100% full marks because I deliberately skip many questions or practical procedures, but the questions that I choose to do will be 99.9% correct, give or take a couple of silly careless mistakes (you don't actually need to outrun the bear, you only need to outrun the other guy who is also being chased by the bear).</p>

Which means there are multiple correct or acceptable names for most organic molecules. For instance, look at the "Other names" below the "IUPAC name" for 2-Nitrotoluene here : 
                                                                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Nitrotoluene">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-Nitrotoluene</a>. All these "other names" are also correct, IUPAC is a just a guideline.<p>For A level purposes, Cambridge too, allows for flexibility in naming as long as it is unambiguous. And on a more relevant and practical note for JC students, is that Cambridge doesn't test naming much at A levels, the question can give a complex name for an organic molecule and the student must be able to draw it out, but not vice-versa.</p><p>As a general rule (remember Chemistry, like real-life, must be intelligent and sensible, not dogmatic and meaningless), instead of memorizing priorities from your school lecture notes, just ask yourself, which functional group is more chemically reactive (ie. the most nucleophilic, electrophilic, lower Ea, etc), then such a functional group should be highlighted first in the name (because the most reactive functional group defines the molecule's most important properties), and hence give it priority. Do this because it makes intelligent sense to do so, not because your school lecture notes dogmatically say so.                                                
                                </p><p>PS. Just like how you (ie. everyone reading this) are advised to always be an intelligent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought">free-thinking</a> individual who is self-responsible for what you choose to believe, be the captain of your own soul, instead of blindly following religious dogma of any religion.

              Molecules are not ions, hence cannot have ion - permanent dipole interactions with protic polar water.<p> For A level purposes, Solution enthalpy / entropy = Lattice dissociation enthalpy / entropy + Hydration enthalpy / entropy, is specifically for ionic species. (While it can theoretically be applied to covalent species, but due to the varying nature of different covalent species and their lack of a lattice structure under standard conditions, the relevant data becomes difficult to obtain and infeasible to apply with this Hess law derived formula, so instead direct experimental techniques are used instead).</p><p>Look at polarity and proticity. Molecule P is non-ionic (ie. no positive for negative formal charges present), aprotic, and relatively non-polar, hence is insoluble in water.</p><p>Yes, for instance, Cambridge can ask why amino acids are least water-soluble in their zwitterionic form at isoelectric point.</p>

                  Zero marks. The website you quoted from failed to explain *why* precipitation rather than solvation (when the solvent is water, better to specify hydration) occurs at isoelectric point.<p>I won't reveal the correct answer here, JC students can go ask your school teacher or private tutor. FlyingGrenade, no doubt you're gonna keep googling for the answer, but don't post the answer here and ruin the self-learning experience for others.</p>

              Hi Hoay,<p>Yes, this is the classic Cambridge "ester group condensed structural formula" trick question. C is the answer. B is wrong because when the condensed structural formula of an ester is read from left to right as R1<b>COO</b>R2, the same ester read from right to left must be written as R2<b>OCO</b>R1 (and not R2COOR1). Hence, B would be correct only if it is changed from CH3<b>COO</b>CH2CH(OH)CH3 to CH3<b>OCO</b>CH2CH(OH)CH3.</p><p>Bonus related question (for A grade H2 Chem students) :<br>Draw the relevant resonance contributors and resonance hybrid of the ester's conjugate base to explain why that particular proton is the most acidic and is hence abstracted from the ester in the presence of a non-nucleophilic and strong Bronsted-Lowry base, eg. lithium diisopropylamide.</p>

              The nucleophile here, is the conjugate base of the ester. As such, the product of nucleophilic addition (of the conjugate base of the ester unto the aldehyde electrophile) will naturally include the condensed structural formula of the ester, and hence my previous post about how the ester is written from left to right, versus from right to left, is relevant in differentiating between options B and C.

"<i>Draw the major product, and explain why it is the major product.</i>"). To get full marks, you need to draw both mechanisms (or at the very least, both the carbocation intermediates) for both products, then specify which carbocation is the more stable carbocation (ie. benzylic carbocation &gt; allylic carbocation &gt; tertiary carbocation &gt; secondary carbocation &gt; primary carbocation), then explain "The more stable the intermediate, the lower the Ea required, hence the faster the rate of reaction, hence we get more of the product, which we label as the major product." <br><br><br>            <blockquote>

                  <p> I dont understand what is the meaning of hydrolysed. Does
                  it mean that it is water of crystallisation? And whats the
                  difference between hydrogen chloride and hydrochloric acid.</p>

                  Ok, so your own queries isn't actually about CS Toh's worked solution, which you understand perfectly?<p>
                  Hydrolysis (noun) or hydrolyze (verb) or hydrolyzed (adjective), refers to chemical reaction with water. If you ask your school teacher or other private tutors or websites, a lot of them will tell you it means 'water-splitting' (hydro-lyze), but it could be either water or the other reactant, or both that is being lyzed or split, so "chemical reaction with water" is actually a superior definition, in terms of chemistry concepts. In this question, germanium chloride reacts with water to generate germanium oxide.</p><p>Hydrogen chloride refers to HCl(g) or HCl(l), while hydrochloric acid refers to HCl(aq), which is actually hydroxonium chloride, ie. H3O+(aq) and Cl-(aq).

                                            Tertiary alkyl halides (such as in ur qn part d), undergo SN1, and primary alkyl halides undergo SN2, for 2 reasons : sterics and electronics.<p>
                                            Sterics and electronics are also the reasons why aldehydes are more electrophilic than ketones, so if you only have 1 mole of a nucleophile reacting with 1 mole of an electrophile with both aldehyde and ketone groups present, it is the aldehyde, not the ketone, which will be the electrophilic group accepting the nucleophile.</p><p>Electronics refers to the relative magnitudes and distribution of charges (both formal charges in resonance contributors and partial charges in resonance hybrids) as a consequence of either induction or resonance or hyperconjugation (the 1st 2 of which are more important for the H2 syllabus).</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steric_effects">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steric_effects</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_effect</a>
