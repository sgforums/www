                  Find OS of Fe in the reactant in terms of n. Find moles of electrons transferred per mole of anion. Hence find new OS of Fe in terms of n, in the product. Equate to actual OS of Fe in product. Hence solve for n.

                  Don't forget, all reactions are equilibrium reactions (it's a matter of where, and how far, the position of equilibrium lies, under what conditions, and conditions are changing all the time). What you call 'reactants' are actually products for the opposite reaction. And every species that exist in the Universe is part of a multiple web of different chemical reactions simultaneously. It's beautifully complex : infinite diversity in infinite creation.<p>One more thing about your statement "even when Ea of reaction is not achieved", you've apparently forgotten the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution : it's about the % of molecules with energy equals or exceeding Ea, not a binary 1 or 0, all or nothing. Even at low temperatures, a small % of molecules will have the required Ea for the reaction.

              It means the dipole moment (in Debye units) has a larger magnitude. The larger the magnitude of electronegativity difference between the 2 atoms of different elements, the more polar the bond, the larger its dipole moment.<p> Eg. the dipole moment in H-F is 1.91 D, which is larger than the dipole moment in H-Cl which is 1.08 D, which is larger than the dipole moment in H-Br which is 0.80 D.</p>

                  What do you mean, "how does it undergo intramolecular nuclophilic substitution?". It undergoes because of the mechanism, that's how (by definition)!<p>If you mean "how do you know" then it's because the no. of C atoms in A and D are the same, and the degree of unsaturation increases by 1 (due to formation of cyclic ring), that's how you know.</p>

                      The amide group isn't hydrolyzed in the reaction, rather the N-H group is being deprotonated, ie. removal of H+, leaving behind a uninegative formal charged N atom as illustrated in the question.<p>The mechanism is significantly beyond A levels. For A level purposes, use simple pattern recognition and mathematics. Based on the original reaction equation given, and based on the new reactants of ethanoate and methanoate ions in a 1:1 ratio, let A = H atom, B = methyl group, we mathematically obtain carbonyl molecules with AA, AB, BA and BB groups, hence we obtain a 1:2:1 ratio of methanal, ethanal and propanone. Notice that Cambridge isn't asking for an explanation, but merely "suggest the products formed and the ratio they're obtained".</p><p>KMnO4 oxidizes methanal to methanoic acid to carbonic(IV) acid, which decomposes into CO2(g) + H2O(l), with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change (since CO2(g) is gaseous), and as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle, since CO2(g) leaves the reaction solution, pulling the position of equilibrium over to the RHS.</p>

                      Singapore JCs often use electronegativity to explain the deviation from the basic bond angles of period 2 elements as predicted by VSEPR theory, when discussing period 3 elements. Other than cases involving electronegative F (eg. why NF3 bond angles deviate from NH3 bond angles), using electronegativity to explain the deviation is actually incorrect, or rather, only a secondary factor (Chemistry, being a microcosm of real-life, is multi-factorial).<p>The more important reason, is due to the significantly lesser extent of orbital hybridization (which requires energy, and thus only thermodynamically justified for less diffused valence orbitals of period 2 elements), due to the significantly lesser extent of electron-pair repulsions, due to the significantly more diffused valence orbitals (which the lone pairs reside in, or the bond pairs are formed from the overlap of) of period 3 elements.</p><p>Consequently, the atoms of period 3 elements use their mostly unhybridized orbitals for their lone pairs to reside in, and for overlapping head-on or end-on to form sigma bonds. In the case of C-S-H, the S atom uses it's mostly unhybridized p orbitals to overlap head-on or end-on to form its sigma bonds with the C and H atoms, as well as for 1 of the lone pairs to reside in, with the remaining lone pair residing in the mostly unhybridized s orbital. This results in the C-S-H bond angle (with 2 orthogonally oriented p orbitals used for head-on or end-on overlap with the C and H atoms) being close to the unhybridized p orbital bond angle of 90 degrees.</p><p>So you're partially right that it's about the size, though you'll need to elaborate (as I did) to secure your marks. Your school (and Singapore JCs in general) aren't entirely wrong, it's just that electronegativity isn't the most important contributing factor here (unlike in cases such as NF3 vs NH3).</p><p>However, all this discussion may be moot, because as far as A levels are concerned, Cambridge won't require the student to give any answer other than the basic bond angles as predicted by VSEPR theory for period 2 elements, ie. just state 104.5 degrees as if the S atom were an O atom, and include the usual explanation about the S atom having 2 lone pairs and 2 bond pairs, and that lone pair - lone pair repulsions &gt; lone pair - bond pair repulsions &gt; bond pair - bond pair repulsions, that would gain you full marks.</p><p> After writing the basic answer above, if you like, if you have the time, or if (unexpectedly, though I'd see it as a pleasant surprise) Cambridge specifically asks you to explain why the C-S-H bond angle deviates from the C-O-H bond angle, then you can elaborate further to why the C-S-H bond angle is actually less than the C-O-H bond angle, giving either my (more correct) explanation, or your school's (less correct) explanation, or both. But again, because asking this would be beyond the A level syllabus, it is rather unlikely for Cambridge to ask why the C-S-H bond angle deviates from the C-O-H bond angle for the actual A level exam (ie. your question, which you presumably took from your school's mid-year revision package).</p>

                                      If it stays the same color from beginning to end point, how the hell would u know you've to stop adding the strong acid from the burette?!? Then the indicator would be utterly useless, wouldn't it?!?<p>And u seem to suffer from a ridiculously basic (pun intended) conceptual error, that "alkaline color" for the indicator means the solution must actually be alkaline (ie. &gt;7). Nonsense! The "alkaline color" of the indicator could still be in acidic pH, eg. 4.5 for yellow colored methyl orange. It's "alkaline" only relative to the "acidic color" for which the pH is lagi acidic, eg. 3.0 for red colored methyl orange.</p><p>The underlying idea, is that the suitable indicator must change color sharply over the vertical portion of the titration curve (the sharp change is due to the fact that at equivalence point, it is no longer a buffer region, so just a single drop of excess strong acid added will change the pH sharply, resulting in the sharp color change), ie. the pKa of the indicator must be as close as possible to the pH of the solution at equivalence point.</p><p>So if u started using with a weak base in the conical flask (and stop ur acronym nonsense, Mr lazy <a href="https://onlprd.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/pics/589/main/photo_wasabi_paste.jpg">WA SA BI</a>), the methyl orange color would begin as yellow, until just enough strong acid is added from the burette to go past the buffer region into the equivalence point, thereby sharply changing the pH of the solution upon addition of 1 excess drop of strong acid, thereby sharply changing the methyl orange color to red, which indicates the change in pH of the solution has just transited past the pKa of the indicator (which if correctly chosen should be close to the equivalence point pH for this titration), which in turn indicates that the equivalence point has been reached.</p><p>Lastly, don't forget that end point merely approximates equivalence point. But as long as you repeat the titration until you obtain 2 concordant or consistent titers, you're good to go, that's already as accurate as is humanly possible.</p><p>And you prolly won't fully understand what I've said above, coz you (like most Singapore JC students) prolly have a terribly weak understanding of this topic. I've already given u an adequate response. If u still dun fully understand, go ask ur school teacher or private tutor. Move on to ur next qn on the next topic.</p>

                              It is.<p>I already told u, don't trust Singapore JC teachers (who routinely disagree with each other, both across and within JCs).</p><p>From the Chemistry department of the University of California, Los Angeles :</p><p><a href="http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/notes/FG_01.pdf">http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/notes/FG_01.pdf</a></p><p>And here is the most important evidence why you should trust BedokFunland JC &gt; Singapore JCs : to an actual recent A level Chemistry exam question which asked, "<i>Name this functional group</i>", the official Cambridge A level Mark Scheme answer is : "<b>benzene / arene / aryl / phenyl</b>"</p><p>Which shows you that unlike the anally dogmatic marking of Prelim papers by Singapore JC teachers, Cambridge will reasonably accept a variety of reasonable answers, otherwise with the totally different phrasing of mark scheme answers of different Singapore JC Prelim papers, even Singapore JC teachers themselves would fail if they sat for each other's Prelim papers. Fortunately for you guys, Cambridge is more reasonable than anal.</p><p>The only thing you need to be careful is, if groups like OH or NH2 or CONHR group are directly bonded to the benzene ring, instead of giving "benzene ring" and "alcohol / amine / amide" separately, you will need to say "phenol" or "phenylamine" or "benzamide", etc.</p>

                  Only Keesom van der Waals forces. The magnitude of partial positive charge on H atom in H2S is insufficient to donate H bonds. To accept H bonds, not only must the F, O or N atom have at least 1 lone pair available, there must also be a formal (stronger H bonds) or at least partial (weaker H bonds) negative charge on the F, O or N atom (in the molecule's resonance hybrid).

              Always draw out (if you're unable to visualize) the mechanism (for either forward and/or backward reaction), that'll lead you to the correct structure and answer. In this particular question, the forward reaction is more thermodynamically feasible than the backward reaction, but for the sake of elucidating J, we'll imagine the backward mechanism here.<p>Br- attacks C, NRH gets kicked out as NRH-, gets protonated as NRH2. Another Br- attacks the other C (of the R group), NH2 gets kicked out as NH2-, gets protonated as NH3. What's left behind is J, which includes the 2 Br atoms.

So the actual OS of the 2 S atoms in the resonance hybrid, will be somewhere between 0 and -1 for the terminal S atom, and somewhere between +4 and +5 for the central S atom.</p><p>As far as A level purposes are concerned, you only need to be able to work the overall average OS for the purpose of balancing redox equations. Being able to work out OSes of individual atoms in individual contributors will also be useful for some questions. And if you're asked (unlikely for Cambridge A levels) to work out the OS of the different atoms in the resonance hybrid, just draw out the most relevant resonance contributors with the OSes of the different atoms labeled, and accordingly explain in your answer that the OS of each (labeled) atom in the resonance hybrid should therefore be between such and such (as I've done above). <br><br><br>                  </p><blockquote>

But it's ok if you want to do so, and Cambridge will just ignore it (whether you got it right or wrong) if the question didn't ask for it.</p><p>In CS Toh's update, the reason why it's incorrect to put either "slow" or "fast" is because the structure shown is the transition state, not the intermediate (there is no intermediate for SN2). Note that "slow" and "fast" must refer to actual steps converting reactant to intermediate, intermediate to intermediate, or intermediate to product. Transition states are simply human-imagined states in-between (ie. transitioning) actual steps, and thus cannot be either "slow" or "fast".

              I'll leave you with a final parting statement in reply to your question quoted above : it depends on the state/phase of the CO2, and besides, Cambridge won't ask which predominates for the different states/phases, you need only state "<b>van der Waals forces</b>" (ie. all 3 types of van der Waals forces) as the intermolecular interactions between CO2 molecules, regardless of state/phase.

                                In an octahedral coordination complex, the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals have a higher energy level compared to the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals.<p>Since n = 4 (ie. 4 unpaired electrons) is calculated from the formula given, and since Cr2+ is [Ar] 4s0 3d4, it means that all 4 electrons of the Cr2+ ion are unpaired, which in turn means the Cr2+ ion in this particular octahedral hexaaquachromium(II) coordination complex must be high spin (ie. small magnitude of energy gap between d-d* orbitals). This is consistent with H2O being a (relatively) weak field ligand.</p><p>On the other hand, if the 6 ligands were stronger field ligands, eg. cyanide CN- ligands in the octahedral hexacyanochromate(II) coordination complex, then you would expect to calculate n = 2 (ie. 2 unpaired electrons), which means that all 4 electrons of the Cr2+ ion must occupy the 3 lower energy  dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals, which in turn means the Cr2+ ion in this particular octahedral hexacyanochromate(II) coordination complex must be low spin (ie. large magnitude of energy gap between d-d* orbitals). </p><p>To show the electron distribution in the transition metal within the coordination complex as required by the MJC question, check out the low spin vs high spin electron distributions for the Fe3+ (ie. [Ar] 4s0 3d5) example on this Wikipedia page, and modify it for Cr2+ (ie. [Ar] 4s0 3d4).</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_states_(d_electrons)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_states_(d_electrons)</a><br><br><br>Due to inter-electron electrostatic repulsions, it is both kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable to add a negatively charged electron onto a negatively charged anionic coordination complex such as hexacyanochromate(III), and therefore you can expect the standard reduction potential to be significantly less positive, or concordantly more negative ; compared to a when adding a negatively charged electron onto a positively charged cationic coordination complex with the same transition metal ion with the same oxidation state such as hexaaquachromium(III).

                                                      There's no such thing as a "non polar amino acid". What your school teacher is referring to, is the R group of the amino acid. And whether an R group is protic polar, aprotic polar, or non-polar, is a matter of common sense that should be instantly obvious to you from a 1-second glance, which you sure as hell shouldn't need to rely on your school teacher (or whatever he/she says) to figure out, ffs.<p>I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt, and imagine you're asking the more intelligent questions on <b>why tryptophan's R group cannot accept H bonds despite having an N atom, and is thus hydrophobic ; or why there isn't a 3rd pKa value for tryptophan despite a protonated N atom conjugate acid seemingly possible.</b></p><p>But then you cock this up by asking the coconaden question about why proline's R group is non-polar?!?</p><p><img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/f7/f71beaed2b2a0d18a081fe28448c68ec43cc052c8c1539addfdaeede78e59800.jpg"></p><p>As to the more intelligent questions (that you didn't explicitly ask) : I'll give you a generous hint : RESONANCE. </p>
