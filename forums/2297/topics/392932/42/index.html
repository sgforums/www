              What nonsense! Now I don't doubt that Debi Bernardes is an expert triathlon coach, but she seems to have failed her H2 Chemistry, to make such a ridiculous error in her statement. If Cambridge asks, you do know how to explain what her conceptual error is, don't you?</p>

              A classic question that is now making the rounds in Singapore JCs' tutorials again. Have fun with it. As usual, BedokFunland JC students can ask me how to solve it during tuition, all other students can go ask their school teacher or private tutor.<p>

              Xenon and fluorine were mixed in a 1:1 ratio by volume and sealed in a vessel attached to a barometer. After some time, crystals were found to have formed on the walls of the vessel and the barometer showed that the pressure had dropped to 70% of the original pressure. Analysis of the gases remaining indicated 4 parts xenon to 3 parts fluorine. Construct a balanced equation for the reaction. Assume constant temperature throughout.</b></p>

Hence 2 mol of M3+ accepts 2 mol of e-, ie. final OS of metal = +2.<p>

Each mol of MnO4- accepts 5 mol of e- upon reduction in acidic pH. Hence each mol of FeC2O4 will react with 3/5 mol of MnO4-.

              While in many instances, Cambridge will accept either term (unless of course, "warm" or "heat with distillation" is specifically required for some reactions), however as a general rule, it is advised that students write "heat" for distinguishing chemical tests, and "heat under reflux" for organic synthesis pathways.<p>Cambridge can ask, and in the past, have indeed asked, questions on drawing the reflux apparatus, and on when or why reflux is preferred or required in certain practical setups. For this, the following Wikipedia page is useful for students.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Reflux_labled.svg/200px-Reflux_labled.svg.png"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux#Reflux_to_regulate_energy_in_chemical_reactions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflux#Reflux_to_regulate_energy_in_chemical_reactions</a></p>

              [Physics / Chemistry / Biology / Medicine] - Global warming is causing disease epidemics through complex mechanisms humans never suspected possible.<p>
              <i>Haley remembered, it had not been very cold that year. There was only one night of hard frost; everyone had talked about it, grateful they did not have to dash out to wrap plants and turn off hose taps while thermometers plunged. The investigators downloaded federal weather data for each year since West Nile first arrived in Texas and plotted the metrics against the case counts. The epidemic year was an outlier on every measure, with the warmest winter, the warmest spring and the heaviest early rainfall in 10 years. As it turns out, the climate changes such as heavier rainfall resulted in greater breeding numbers, allowed more mosquitoes to survive the warmer and shorter winters, causing them to wake sooner, spill out earlier from their winter hiding places, and bite more people than in any other previous year, transmitting so many deadly viruses that killed an unprecedented number of victims.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/why-the-menace-of-mosquitoes-will-only-get-worse.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/why-the-menace-of-mosquitoes-will-only-get-worse.html?_r=0</a></p><p>Global warming is also now melting permafrost and ice that have been frozen for thousands or even millions of years, slowly releasing long-dormant bacteria and viruses that could potentially wipe out humanity.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=global+warming+viruses+frozen">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=global+warming+viruses+frozen</a></p>

                          </p><p>More on the Biology, Chemistry and Medicine of HAMLET (Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumour cells)</p><p><i>Endogenous human alpha-lactalbumin is complexed with a calcium ion and serves as a cofactor in lactose synthesis, but has no tumoricidal properties. The alpha-lactalbumin must be partially unfolded to allow for release of the calcium ion and replacement with an oleic acid molecule. The partially folded conformation is essential to the cytotoxicity of HAMLET, as mutagenesis studies have shown that completely unfolded alpha-lacalbumin does not retain the functional properties of HAMLET. The oleic acid is necessary for stabilizing this molecule in this partially unfolded state. 
                  
                  </i></p><p><i>HAMLET carries out independent attacks on many distinct cell organelles, including mitochondria, proteasomes, and histones, and interferes with cell processes such as macroautophagy. It has been shown that HAMLET binds to the cell surface and rapidly invades cells, with tumor cells taking up far more protein than healthy, differentiated cells. The mechanism of its entry is poorly understood, but recent studies indicate that the oleic acid in the HAMLET complex interacts with phosphatidylserine and o-glycosylated mucin on the plasma membrane, both of which are expressed in greater amounts on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, possibly providing for HAMLETâ€™s specificity.
                      </i></p><p><i>
                      One of the most prominent targets of HAMLET once inside the cell is the mitochondrion. Electron microscopy has revealed physical damage to the mitochondrial membranes and assays have found cytochrome c release and activation of the caspase cascade, the most notable ones being caspases 2, 3, and 9. It is interesting to note that cell death is not prevented by caspase inhibitors, or by BCL-2 or p53 mutagenesis, indicating that the traditional apoptotic caspase cascade is not the ultimate cause of cell death.
                      </i></p><p><i>
                      Another target of HAMLET is the proteasome. 26S proteasomes are activated in response to large quantities of unfolded HAMLET protein in the cytoplasm, but degradation of HAMLET by the proteasome is unusually slow. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that HAMLET is capable of binding the catalytic 20S subunit of the proteasome and disabling its enzymatic activity, an effect that has never before been demonstrated for any protein. However, proteasome inhibition alone does not seem to be responsible for HAMLET-induced cell death, as proteasome inhibitors have been shown to reduce the cytotoxicity of HAMLET.

                      HAMLET also targets the nucleus, where it interacts with histones to interfere with transcriptional processes. Studies have shown that HAMLET is mostly localized to the nucleus within one hour of invading a tumor cell. Hamlet has been shown to bind with high affinity to individual histone proteins, to be specific H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, as well as entire nucleosomal units. This interaction irreversibly blocks transcription and leads to activation of p53. This process has been demonstrated to be similar to histone hyperacetylation and it was found that histone de-acetylase inhibitors potentiated the effects of HAMLET.

                      HAMLET cells showed the physiological characteristics of macroautophagy, a process in which cellular components are sequestered in double membrane-bound vesicles that fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Cells also showed decreased levels of mTOR, a known inhibitor of macroautophagy. HAMLET cells and cells under conditions of amino acid starvation (a known initiator of macroautophagy) showed similar expression patterns of autophagocytotic proteins and responded equally well to addition of macroautophagy inhibitors.</i></p><p>
