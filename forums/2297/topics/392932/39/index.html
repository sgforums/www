                                 From the Hendersonâ€“Hasselbalch equation, plug in the pH and the pKa value, to solve for the mole ratio of conjugate base (HPO4 2-) to acid (H2PO4 -).<p>Since the molarities for both are the same, the ratio of moles = ratio of volumes, and that's the answer ie.

              Remarks: I do not understand the titration curve. My understanding
              is as follows - the first unlabelled equivalence point between A
              and B signifies the end of neutralisation between maleic acid and
              sodium hydroxide, and at the point, only -O2CHCHCO2- is present.
              However, why is the second equivalence point is at C, (when an
              additional 10cmÂ³ of maleic acid is added from the first equivalence
              point), instead of an addition 30cmÂ³ of maleic acid (given that
              there is 30cmÂ³ of -O2CHCHCO2- at first equivalence pt)? Can I
              confirm that at D, the only compound present is HO2CHCHCO2-? So
              where is â€œmixtureâ€� to resist the pH change? If there were an option
              further down the graph from D, I would have picked that, but D
              doesnâ€™t seem correct to me.</span></p>

              Remarks: I understand that elimination is out because it wouldnâ€™t
              yield a product which rotates plane-polarised light. I also
              understand that both SN1 (since an optically pure enantiomer of
              2-bromobutane was used since an optically pure enantiomer of
              2-bromobutane was used) and SN2 mechanisms will yield an optically
              active product. Am I supposed to draw any inference from the
              reduction of the angle of rotation or is that just a red
              herring?</span></p>

              Remarks: I can understand that C is not the answer because it
              cannot be deduced from the information above. However, how do I
              know whether C-16O bond is stronger than C-18O bond?</span></p>

              Hi Gohby,<p>
              DHS14/P1/12. Since you're adding a weak acid to a strong acid, hence maximum buffer capacity is double equivalence point instead of half equivalence point. Being a diprotic acid, there are of course, 2 maximum buffer capacities. The 1st being equal molarities of HA- and A2- (which occurs at [10+20]/2=15 cm3), and the 2nd being equal molarities of H2A and HA- (which occurs at 40 cm3). Clearly, the more effective buffer occurs at equal molarities of H2A and HA- (ie. weak acid and amphiprotic species) rather than equal molarities of HA- and A2- (ie. amphiprotic and strong base), as illustrated by the larger horizontal region of the titration curve. Besides, 15cm3 isn't even an option in this MCQ.</p><p>DHS14/P1/20. If it were SN1 only, and the reaction was complete (as implied), then the product would be optically inactive. If it were SN2 only, and the reaction was complete (as implied), then the product would rotate plane polarized light by 13.5 degrees in either direction. Hence a mixture of both SN1 and SN2 must have occurred.
              </p><p>
              DHS14/P1/25. Option D is correct because the reactant is cyclic, hence there is only 1 hydrolysis product, not 2. Addressing your specific query : heavier isotopes form stronger bonds. This is Uni level Chemistry, and for A level purposes, Cambridge can still tempt the students with beyond-syllabus MCQ choices, to test if the student is sufficiently proficient to recognize the within-syllabus correct MCQ answer, and disregard the other options.</p><p>DHS14/P1/28. Problem is alcohol, being part non-polar and part protic polar, is miscible with both water and alkyl halide. Addding [water and excess conc HCl] serves to protonate the alcohol, which then migrates into the aqueous layer. Discard the aqueous layer by decantation. Add excess Na2CO3(aq) to remove excess HCl(aq) in the form of CO2(g) and NaCl(aq). Add S2O3 2-(aq) to reduce all the I2(s/aq/alc) to I-(aq), forming S4O6 2-(aq). Add water to remove all ionic impurities, then carry out decantation to leave behind the alkyl halide. </p><p>No prob, Ghoby! :)</p>

              <i>A researcher accidentally mixed 50.0 cm3 of 0.100 mol dmâ€“3 MgSO4 solution with 50.0 cm3 of 0.100 mol dmâ€“3 FeSO4 solution in the laboratory. It is suggested that the metal ions can be separated through selective precipitation by adding solid sodium hydroxide. At 298 K, the solubility product of Mg(OH)2 is 1.8x10^â€“11 mol3 dmâ€“9, and that of Fe(OH)2 is 4.1x10â€“15 mol3 dmâ€“9. What would be the pH of the resultant solution when maximum separation has occurred?</i><p>Your error is assuming maximum separation occurs when Qsp = Ksp of Fe(OH)2, when it should be Mg(OH)2, ie. the more soluble ionic compound. You have to add as much OH- as possible to precipitate all the less soluble Fe(OH)2, without precipitating out any of the Mg(OH)2. Hence at that point, Qsp = Ksp of Mg(OH)2, not Fe(OH)2.

              <p>Why are there only 2 optical isomers for R? Is it due to
              internal plane of symmetry? I counted a total of 4 chiral carbons
              in R. Did I do additional counting??</p>

              There are only 2 chiral C atoms. But due to an internal plane of symmetry, the R,S and S,R stereoisomers are the meso isomer and thus optically inactive, and hence the only 2 enantiomeric optical isomers are S,S and R,R.

Consequently and concordantly, all factors considered, HI has a higher melting and boiling point compared to HCl.<p>            </p><blockquote>

                                                    <p>Guys I'm really trembling in fear... First i screw up paper2
                                    (actually all my friends said it was hard) so i think i score
                                    around low B for that paper itself. Than for Paper 3, it was so
                                    easy! , but fml yeah i screw it up and my whole organic part was
                                    blank and i mixed up my R&amp;C and haix. So my paper 3 was about
                                    low B too. yeah although i screw up, low B was quite possible. So
                                    based off p2 and p3 i got around 60-64%. Today's paper 2, i scored
                                    27/40. First page all wrong idk what was i even thinking if not
                                    couldve 31 sia. but yeah its over. With those 3 papers i think i
                                    should be around 65 % AT MOST. Lets say spa affects my grades a
                                    little, will i drop to a D? I really do not want a H2 D... Haix. my
                                    uni course is AAB sia but i might end up with AAD if my chem really

                              <p>A MCQ from CIE June 2016, which i cannot reproduce here, gives a

              63.5 showing 100% abundance.</p>
              <p>The question was to prove which mass spectrum would give an Ar

              <p>My question is all isotopes of an element have Whole number

              Correct. The molar mass of any single isotope must be an integer (since there is no such thing as non-integer number of protons or neutrons), only averaged molar masses (ie. taking into consideration the relative abundance of various isotopes) can be non-integers.

                  More accurately periplanar rather than exactly coplanar, but Cambridge will accept coplanar.

As solid, 4 (for the specific crystalline structure of ice relevant to A level syllabus).

                                They can, but when you're talking about intermolecular H bonding between NH3 molecules, notice the ratio of H bond acceptors (ie. the N atoms) to H bond donors (ie. the H atoms) is 1:3, while the required ratio per H bond is 1:1.<p>Analogously, in a class of 1 guy and 3 girls, how many (monogamic heterosexual) couples can you have at most? Concordantly, on average only 2 atoms (1 N and 1 H) can participate in H bonding between NH3 molecules.<br><br><br>            </p><blockquote>

              Bone cancer survivor scores four distinctions<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/bone-cancer-survivor-scores-four-distinctions">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/bone-cancer-survivor-scores-four-distinctions</a><p>
                  To be realistic, the odds are stacked against her, because of her 'N' level academic background, and (this applies to all Singaporean students) because of the overly small number of places available in local medical schools. And if her medical condition does not resolve itself immediately or fully (only her oncologist will know her medical prognosis), it may continue to post further financial and time burdens that may distract her from performing her best along the way.
                  </p><p>
                  However, should she indeed perform spectacularly well (ie. perfect scores for all subjects and all modules all the way here on out), her 'N' level academic background and her bone cancer medical condition, could actually help her stand out amongst the pool of candidates vying for a coveted place in medical school, as positive indications of her tenacity, perseverance and determination.
                  </p><p>Of course, the rich (especially ultra-rich) will always have multiple advantages over everyone else. If her family can afford it, then applying for overseas medical schools (of which there are thousands, though only a few dozen or so are recognized for practicing medicine in Singapore), in addition to local medical schools, will naturally increase her chances of fulfilling her career ambitions. And if you're rich enough to locate yourself overseas permanently, you could even go for medical schools not recognized for practicing medicine in Singapore, as a last resort.</p><p>
                  I wish her all the best in her health and in her medical doctor career ambitions.</p>

              Yes, the fact that CO2 is overall non-polar, yet possesses 2 significant individual dipoles in a linear molecular geometry, results in its sublimative property (ie. only existing at solid and gaseous states) at 1 bar or 1 atm. The liquid state is only possible at significantly higher pressures, as illustrated in its phase diagram.<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/742px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png"></p><p><i>Image credits : Wikipedia</i></p>

              Drinkable ethanolic drinks (eg. beer, wine, liquor, etc) are taxed heavily by governments (a considerable source of money for governments because who doesn't like an ethanolic drink?), so unethical and unscrupulous importers, distributors or retailers sometimes adulterate their ethanolic drinks with cheap, untaxed methanol to sell to unsuspecting customers. In many cases, most of the victims go permanently blind as a result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_toxicity">methanol poisoning</a>, if they manage to survive at all.<p>
