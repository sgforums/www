                                    Yes, this is true for the transition metals, as the electrons in the inner 3d orbitals will repel the electrons in the outer 4s orbitals, raising the 4s orbital to a higher energy level than 3d. Consequently, during ionization process, electrons are removed from the outer 4s orbital before electrons are removed from the inner 3d orbitals.

              <b>Why is F2 a stronger oxidizing agent compared to Cl2 even though F2 has a less exothermic EA compared to Cl2?</b>
              <p>
              Oxidizing strength is primarily related to electronegativity, but secondarily to hydration enthalpy, because in the natural world, redox reactions occur mostly in the aqueous environments (ie. water being the solvent that brings the reactants together and allowing chemical reactions to occur), hence the redox potentials that are relevant are in the aqueous state.</p><p>Yes, F2 a stronger oxidizing agent than Cl2 even though F2 has a less exothermic EA compared to Cl2. First, understand why Cl2 has a more exothermic EA compared to F2 : it's because even though F is more electronegative than Cl, but the charge density of F- is too high due to small ionic radius, concordantly the inter-electron repulsions within the small F- ion are highly destabilizing. Consequently, the EA for F isnt as exothermic, as F- isn't as stable as might be imagined solely due to electronegativity (as would be the case with Cl to Cl-), as there is also a destabilizing (ie. endothermic) component to the EA process for F (but not for Cl), ie. the inter-electron repulsions of the high anionic charge density F- ion.</p><p>Next, if the EA of Cl is more exothermic compared to that of F, shouldn't Cl2 be a stronger oxidizing agent (ie. more positive reduction potential) compared to F2? Yet the Data Booklet clearly shows F2 having a more positive reduction potential compared to Cl2, and F2 is thus the stronger oxidizing agent. This is because as I mentioned earlier, we're interested in redox reactions occurring in the aqueous solvent or phase, and thus concordantly by Hess Law, reduction enthalpy = electron affinity enthalpy + hydration enthalpy ; and likewise oxidation enthalpy = ionization enthalpy + hydration enthalpy.</p><p>Because F- has a much higher anionic charge density compared to Cl-, it's hydration enthalpy is also that much more exothermic (ie. much stronger ion - permanent dipole interactions formed). And after Hess Law is applied, the overall reduction potential of F2 to F-, is still more positive compared to the reduction potential of Cl2 to Cl-, and thus in aqueous environments, F2 is still a much stronger oxidizing agent compared to Cl2.

              <p>I told you before : in the natural world, these redox reactions occur mostly in aqueous environments / solvents / phases. Do you think the highly unstable O2- ion is able to exist in aqueous environment? Of course not! It will kena immediately hydrolyzed to OH-, and (depending on pH) can be further protonated to H2O.</p><p>So for the oxidizing power of O2, look in the Data Booklet for the reduction potential of O2 to either OH- or H2O (depending on pH). (Ignore obscure &amp; rare reduction products like peroxides, super oxides, ozonides, etc, unless otherwise specified by the question).</p>

              Being able to solve A level questions is necessary but not necessarily sufficient. If you stick to doing A level papers only, without Prelim papers, you may or may not get A grade. Of course, just by doing Prelim papers (with or without A level papers) is by itself no guarantee that you'll get A grade either. Every year, there are dozens (sometimes over a hundred) of unfortunate students who do worse (eg. B grade) for their A levels compared to their Prelim exams (eg. A grade).<p>My advice would be to focus on the style of A level papers, but at the same time broaden your understanding by learning from the "ridiculously" difficult questions and mark schemes from the JCs. Unless of course, you already find A level papers difficult, in which case confusing yourself with the even tougher Prelim papers would be counter-productive.</p>

                                                      For a simplified version (which will suffice for A level purposes), you can think of it as : to maintain your orbit further from the nucleus, you (as an electron in the outer electron shells) naturally require more energy to sustain your further orbit and resist the electrostatic pull of the positively charged nucleus.<p>Going any deeper like the classic scientific enigmas of "<a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=why+don%27t+electrons+fall+into+the+nucleus"><i>Why don't electrons fall into the nucleus?</i></a>", and "<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force">Why don't the protons in the nucleus repel each other and cause the nucleus to fall apart?</a></i>" (also see <b><a href="https://cordus.wordpress.com/2014/09/12/what-holds-protons-and-neutrons-together-in-the-atomic-nucleus/">Cordus physics</a></b>) that goes significantly beyond A levels (so we we're *not* going discuss it here, and it's a safe bet that neither your school teacher nor your private tutor will entertain you on this), and at University levels, physicists and chemists have come up with a few different theories or explanations or ways of looking at these enigmas. You may come across some of these ideas in the future if you choose to study Physics or Chemistry in the University. For now, if you're still curious (though you should of course focus on your A levels), you can google out some preliminary reading for your entertainment and satisfaction.</p>

              2 separate points :<p>The amino group is electron-donating by resonance, hence destabilizing the negatively charged sulfonate group in the conjugate base. In addition, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid exists as a zwitterion in aqueous and solid states, and because ammonium groups (ie. conjugate acid of amines) are very weak acids with small Ka values, hence zwitterionic 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is a much weaker acid than non-zwitterionic benzenesulfonic acid.

              Hi Nelexus, glad to hear you chose to read Chemistry in the University. Btw, while both NUS and NTU Chemistry are (approximately) equally good, the Science bookstore at NUS is better stocked compared to the Science bookstore at NTU. Fyi.<p>
                                                                                                                                                            Generally (for everyone reading this), please do not PM me Chemistry questions (PM me only if you're interested in joining my BedokFunland JC tuition), but post Chemistry questions on the forum for discussion so that everyone can participate, learn and benefit together.</p><p>

                                                            Conjugation (not to be confused with hyperconjugation) *allows* for delocalization of electrons to occur via resonance.</p><p>In the benzoate ion, the negative formal charge on the O atom, cannot be delocalized by resonance into the benzene ring, as evidenced from the impossibility of drawing the required mechanism to delocalize the negative formal charge into the benzene ring (since resonance cannot involve the breaking or forming of sigma bonds).</p><p>However, note that in the conjugate acid form, the pi electrons in the benzene ring can indeed be delocalized by resonance to the COOH group, ie. the COOH group is electron-withdrawing from the benzene ring by resonance, and is hence deactivating and meta directing. When deprotonated however, the COO- group, being electron-rich, ceases to be electron-withdrawing by resonance from the benzene ring, as the high electron charge density of the dinegatively charged COO2- resonance contributor is excessively destabilizing.</p><p>The real reason why the benzene ring can help to stabilize the benzoate ion conjugate base (thus making benzoic acid a stronger acid than say, ethanoic or propanoic acid), is because the sp2 C atoms of the benzene ring have a higher % s orbital character, and is thus electron-withdrawing by induction (but not by resonance).</p><p>
                                                            Yes, the formula pH = 1/2 (pKa1 + pKa2) or pH = 1/2 (pKa2 + pKa3), is applicable for all solutions containing only an amphiprotic species, eg. at equivalence point for polyprotic or multiprotic acids, such as zwitterionic amino acids.</p><p>A solution at its isoelectric point contains the highest possible molarity of its zwitterionic form (ie. no net ionic charge), and very low and equal molarities of both the cationic (ie. conjugate acid) and anionic forms (ie. conjugate base) forms. The molarities of the ionic forms at pI can be calculated using the relevant Ka values.</p><p>Amino acids can (depending on the exact amino acid's R group) exist as dinegative anionic, uninegative anionic, neutral zwitterionic, unipositive cationic, and dipositive cationic. So if you were carry out a titration of an amino acid, you would usually start with either the fully deprotonated anionic form (if you're adding acid from burette), or the fully protonated cationic form (if you're adding alkali from burette).

                      <p>Qn : write the reaction for titration of 100ml of 0.100M
                      anilinium bromide (aminobenzene â€¢ HBr) with 0.100M NaOH. Sketch the

                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Species present at equivalence pt is phenylamine.</p>
                      <p>Oh use equation of dissociation of phenylamine ?</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Why cannot use amphiprotic formula in this case?since
                      phenylamine is the cj base of phenylammonium cation </p>
                      <p>So not every time at equivalence point use amphiprotic formula,
                      is it?</p>
                      <p>Thanks for those guidance in thought process that you've written

                      Use amphiprotic formula only when the species present is amphiprotic. At the various equivalence points for acid-base titrations, the species present could be either only acidic (eg. H3PO4), only basic (eg. PO4 3-), or amphiprotic (eg. H2PO4- or HPO4 2-).<p> Instead of blindly memorizing formulae without understanding (like the majority of pitiful Singapore JC students), you should intelligently understand what's going on, intelligently identify on a case-by-case basis what's the nature of the species present, and hence intelligently apply the relevant formula.</p><p>And btw, phenylamine is a base, bases do not undergo dissociation (as erroneously taught in Singapore JCs), bases undergo hydrolysis.</p>

                  Because of a complex combination of reasons, which you needn't worry about for A levels. Most relevantly, the oxidation state of the heteroatom in the oxidizing agent (ie. +7 versus +6), but also the electronegativity, the charge density, the electron affinity enthalpy, hydration enthalpy, electron configuration, reaction mechanism, etc.<p>So when you explore these issues at Uni level, you'll realize there are no longer any short, simple answers (those are the O level days of naivety), but a beautifully complex balance of separate (and oftentimes opposing factors). A levels is a transition state or intermediate between naively simplistic O levels, and beautifully complex Uni levels.</p>

              CS Toh was deliberate and conscientiousness when he wrote that. If Br2 (in CCl4) was used on the analyte, and decolorization of the Br2, together with steamy fumes (indicating HBr) were both observed, that would be indicative of 2 other functional groups (covered in the H2 syllabus), but not the alkene functional group.<p>Guess what these 2 functional groups are? I don't want to spoil the fun, so I won't spoonfeed you guys the answer on the forum. I'll encourage everyone reading this to figure it out for yourself.

                                    See, your problem is you (and most Singapore JC students) rely on memorizing from notes. If you understood mechanisms, you could have easily figured out the answer for yourself, even if you've never came across such a reaction in your notes.<p>Sure, you can google out the answer now (ie. non-exam conditions), but what happens when Cambridge thinks up some new reaction that you've never come across before, to be used as an A grade exam question in the A levels?</p><p>Well, I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of Singapore JC students wouldn't know the answer as well, in such a case, so I guess you needn't worry too much. It's a bell-curve, afterall.</p>

                          Proticity refers to how many protons a Bronsted-Lowry acid can donate, or how many protons a Bronsted-Lowry base can accept. Eg. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, hence PO4 3- is a triprotic base.<p>Since H3PO3 (Latin name phosphorous acid, Stock name phosphoric(III) acid, IUPAC name phosphonic acid) is a diprotic acid, hence upon complete deprotonation using excess NaOH(aq) in a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, the salt generated is Na2HPO3 (Latin name disodium phosphite, Stock name disodium phosphate(III), IUPAC name disodium phosphonate).</p>

                                    Because partial pressure = mole fraction x total pressure. As inert gases are introduced, the mole fractions of the active gases decrease, while the total pressure increases, hence mathematically cancelling each other out.<p>If you're asking why the position of equilibrium doesn't shift, it's because the molarities of the active reactants and products (of the reaction) doesn't change upon addition of inert gases, so neither Qc nor Kc changes, hence the position of equilibrium doesn't shift.</p>

                  Not so simple. At O levels, everything is simplistically 'always'. At Uni levels, nothing is simplistically 'always'. A levels is between O levels and Uni levels, expect anomalies and having to examine case-by-case.<p>'Like dissolves like' is usually applicable for most cases, but the question can add in more variables to get you to discuss relative solubilities of a polar solute in 2 or 3 different solvents, all of which are polar (for example).</p><p>Not all ionic salts are soluble, hence you have Qsp and Ksp. But species like phenylammonium ions and phenoxide ions, are indeed more soluble than their molecular conjugate acid/base forms, due to ion - permanent dipole interactions which are stronger than hydrogen bonds (provided the formal charge is on a small period 2 atom).</p><p>Even if a molecule can form hydrogen bonds with water, it may not be very soluble, because of the non-polar parts of the molecule (eg. benzene ring) thermodynamically preferring to form van der Waals forces with the non-polar parts (eg. benzene ring) of the other solute molecules, while the snobbish water solvent molecules thermodynamically prefer to form hydrogen bonds with other water solvent molecules. Hence, aqueous solubility of alcohols decrease with increasing length of its non-polar hydrocarbon chain.</p><p>So once you see it as a beautiful complex spectrum of solubilities, rather than an oversimplistic black-and-white binary system of just 'soluble' or 'insoluble', you can let go of your frustrations and it will finally make logical sense for you.</p><p><br><br>            </p><blockquote>

                      Best to use the phrase "thermodynamically feasible". Because a positive cell potential = a negative Gibbs free energy change, by the formula (tested in the new H2 Chem syllabus) : <b>delta G = - n F cell potential</b>

                  From electron geometry, you can work out orbital hybridization. The greater the % s orbital character, eg. sp &gt; sp2 &gt; sp3, the more electron rich that atom is, because the unhybridized p orbitals (not used for hybridization to form sigma bonds) can overlap sideways to form pi bonds. Eg. Triply-bonded nitrile sp &gt; doubly-bonded imine sp2 &gt; singly-bonded amine sp3.
