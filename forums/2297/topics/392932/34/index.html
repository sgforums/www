                                    In this case, you're wrong, but your teacher isn't fully correct either.<p>Vanadium's maximum OS is +5, not +3.</p><p>Based on standard oxidation potentials of V 3+, compared to the standard reduction potential of Cu+2 to Cu, you need only consider oxidation of V 3+ to VO 2+ (ie. OS of V = +4), and to nothing further (eg. to VO3 - or VO2 +) under standard conditions. But of course, the exam question can be more sadistic and replace V 3+ with V, and Cu2+ with a stronger oxidizing agent, then you need to consider each and of the possible oxidation products for vanadium all the way to +5, including memorizing (if asked by the question) all the color changes.</p><p>Minor point : Your teacher used the 'minus' version of the cell potential formula, but the 'plus' version is actually more meaningful, chemistry-wise (ie. for students &amp; teachers who understand their chemistry more deeply).</p><p>Cell potential = Reduction potential @ Cathode + Oxidation potential @ Anode = (+0.34 V) + (-0.34V) = 0.00 V</p><p>If the calculated (standard or otherwise) cell potential is 0 V, it means the system with standard molarities on both sides of the equation would be at equilibrium (ie. Qc = Kc; it just so happens that in rare cases like this case, also that Kc = 1).</p><p>If the system is already at equilibrium, no net visible change occurs (since rate of forward reaction = rate of backward reaction, but be careful : k(forward) = k(backward) only if Kc = 1, a rare case). But note that at initial, you only mixed standard molarities (ie. 1M) of V 3+ and Cu 2+ together, which means Qc is not yet = Kc. Hence a net visible change will indeed occur, until Qc = Kc (which happens to be Kc = 1 in this reaction). But (your teacher didn't mention this) the reaction will be significantly slower (exactly how much slower, depends on kinetics and activation energy for the forward reaction), compared to if the calculated (standard or otherwise) cell potential was a lot more positive. This is because of the intimate relationship between electrochemistry and equilibria and kinetics. </p>

                              <p>Hi, for 2015 tjc paper 3 qn 3i, on why aspirin is insoluble in
              water, my answer differs fromthe answer scheme.<br>
              I said that the formation of predominantly instantaneous dipole
              induced dipole interactions due to large non polar benzene ring
              between aspirin and h2o molecules releases insufficient energy to
              overcome hydrogen bonds between h2o and idid interactions between
              aspirin. Dissolution is energetically unfavourable.<br>
              is my answer acceptable?</p>

                          </blockquote><br>
              
              No, your answer is not acceptable.<p>1st error : between polar and non-polar molecules, it's not instantaneous dipole - induced dipole London dispersion van der Waals interactions, it's permanent dipole - induced dipole Debye van der Waals interactions.</p><p>2nd error : you didn't mention that the COOH and OCO groups of aspirin can and will participate in limited hydrogen bonding with the water solvent, but the solubility of aspirin as a whole is still limited by the  weaker permanent dipole - induced dipole Debye van der Waals interactions of the non-polar hydrophobic benzene ring with water solvent.</p><p>Lastly, and this is partly the question's fault : if you say "dissolution is energetically unfavourable", it implies aspirin is completely insoluble (eg. like SiO2 or diamond, etc), but aspirin is actually slightly soluble and does dissolve slightly in water under standard conditions. Which is why it's better to state and explain why "the solubility of aspirin is hence limited" in water.</p>

                                                        <p>Hi UltimaOnline, Sorry to trouble you again, but here are some
                                        questions which I have <img alt="smile.png" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png"></p>
                                        <p>NJC/2012/P1/Q22</p>
                                        <p>Why canâ€™t B be an answer, given that acyl chlorides can be made
                                        by reacting thionyl chlorides with carboxylic acid?</p>
                                        <p>NJC/2012/P1/Q25</p>
                                        <p>I understand that C is the answer
                                        (http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/haloalkanes/making.html),
                                        but why canâ€™t the other options be prepared with distillation?</p>
                                        <p>NJC/2012/P1/Q27</p>
                                        <p>I think there are 3 ways which the elimination can take place
                                        given that there are 3 B hydrogens. Applying Saytzeffâ€™s Rule, I can
                                        only eliminate the option where the hydrogen is abstracted from the
                                        methyl substituent. The other options (where the hydrogen is
                                        abstracted from the CH2, and where the hydrogen is abstracted from
                                        the cyclohexane substituent) seem equally substituted to me. So
                                        what would be the major product of the reaction? Further, wouldnâ€™t
                                        either of the products contain 2 double bonds, thereby making the
                                        total number of stereoisomers 4?</p>
                                        <p>Once again, thank you for your help. :)</p>

                                        Hi Gohby, no prob :)<p>NJC/2012/P1/Q22 : B is incorrect because the amine group present is even more nucleophilic than the OH of COOH, and hence would react even more readily with the thionyl halide electrophile, in this case the primary amine would undergo 2 consecutive nucleophilic substitutions with the thionyl bromide to generate the N=S=O group, eliminating 2 molecules of H-Br. This is beyond the A level H2 syllabus, and so isn't completely fair, but nonetheless Cambridge *could* ask this question as a challenging A grade question, to determine if the candidate understands the concepts of relative nucleophilicities and electrophilicities, and choose the best possible option among the 4 presented.</p><p>Cambridge has done indeed so many times in the past, especially in recent years, deliberately presenting 2 likely options : 1 option going beyond the A level H2 syllabus so candidates cannot be sure if it's correct, the other option within the A level H2 syllabus so competent candidates should be sure if it's correct or wrong, and therefore choose accordingly.</p><p>NJC/2012/P1/Q25 : Options A &amp; D can be carried out at room temperature, and hence doesn't require this setup (and therefore should not be used). B requires heating under reflux. The setup shown is heating with distillation to separate out the desired product which has a lower boiling point compared to the reactants.</p><p>NJC/2012/P1/Q27 : This reaction involves competition between the Zaitsev aka Saytzeff elimination, and the Hofmann elimination. While the Bronsted-Lowry base employed is the sterically unhindered OH- ion, nonetheless the cyclohexane ring does pose some degree of steric hindrance, but in this case the Zaitsev product should ultimately still dominate (and conveniently also because the Hofmann elimination isn't taught in the H2 syllabus).</p><p>The major product which is the Zaitsev product, is therefore the product that has the double bond with the cyclohexane ring, as this product would be a more substituted internal alkene (with no H atoms bonded to its sp2 C atoms), compared to the alternative product that has the double bond with the alkyl side chain (with 1 H atom bonded to its sp2 C atoms).</p><p>The number of stereoisomers of the major product is therefore 2 (ie. as a result of the pre-existing alkene double bond in the longer side chain), instead of 4 (cis-cis, cis-trans, trans-cis, trans-trans).

If for questions that give totally different answers (and there will be many), and if you're not sure which answer is better or more correct, post about it here, and I'll advise you.</p><p>Don't bother doing Prelim papers, coz at this late stage when you've not yet started preparing for H2 Chem, doing Prelim papers will only demoralize you and be counterproductive. Better to focus on doing only Sg TYS papers.</p><p><br><br>            </p><blockquote>

Bras Basah, which carry a wider variety of stock. If you get topical, harder to cross reference across all 2 or 3 different TYS. And at this late stage, no point practicing Topical. You should practice yearly format across all topics.<p>In addition, if you have Android handphone with internet data access and/or can read Google Play ebooks on your phone or PC, and you can use your parents' or your own credit or debit cards, I strongly recommend you also buy CS Toh's TYS solutions (only soft copy available, but not pdf formal, you need to login to access the Google server each time you want to read CS Toh's ebook), to cross reference against the other 2 or 3 hardcopy TYS you're gonna buy from Popular.</p><p>Trust me and use this approach : I myself have bought and use 4 different TYS solutions every year, and have noted that answers vary widely across the different TYSes (just as they would across different Singapore JCs for Prelim papers and TYS papers, since every H2 Chem teacher in every JC has a different opinion of what the best answer should be). Your best bet is to cross reference the different answers across the TYSes, pick 2 of the best answers, and combine their points to write the best possible answer that would secure your marks in the 2016 A levels.</p><p>Lastly, be sure to post here on this forum, whenever you come across any such different answers and you're not sure which is the best answer. There are hundreds of JC students who lurk on the forums here, and they'll also benefit from your questions here. I'll advise all of you on which are the best answers to write for your A levels.</p><p>Purchase CS Toh's H2 Chem TYS ebooks on Google Play here :<br><a href="http://www.post-1.com/step-by-step/?a=book_al_soln_chem">http://www.post-1.com/step-by-step/?a=book_al_soln_chem</a></p><p><br>            </p><blockquote>

                                        No, don't read the Study Guide, then do the yearly TYS. Rather, use the yearly TYS directly now to start learning &amp; revising as you go from question to question, based on the different solutions from different publishers. And for each question, also cross reference with CS Toh's A level Study Guide (ie. essential H2 Chem syllabus lecture notes you need to memorize). Learn and Revise as you go through each question in the TYS, that's the only feasible approach now at this late stage, only 3 months away from A levels.<p>
                                    
                                    Yes, no worries about Planning and Paper 5. For Paper 5, just follow the given instructions carefully. For Planning Qn (Paper 2), skip it first. Complete the rest of the Paper, then go back to it after you're done with the rest of the Paper, and write whatever you can.</p><p>If you *really* want to prepare for Planning Qn (ie. if you need A grade for H2 Chem because of your desired Uni course), you should buy and study Chan Kim Seng &amp; Jeanne Tan's H2 Chem Planning Book, available from Popular Bookstore (the larger outlets, not the smaller outlets) :</p><p><a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9565">http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9565</a></p>

              The 2 factors are opposing, you have to decide (based on experimental evidence), which factor outweighs which factor. Indiscriminately writing in both factors in the A level exam in a shotgun approach, will be shooting yourself in the foot, and you'll get zero marks (because Cambridge will be thinking, <i>"KNN! This bugger trying to cheat by giving both opposing factors, expecting us Cambridge examiners to choose the correct answer for him! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl">PCB</a>!"</i>

                              <p>thanks for your reply. sorry to bother you so late. i saw this
              formula on my brother's old uni notes but not on my lecture
              notes... My lecture notes also mention that 'a quantitative
              treatment is not required', which i assume we have to explain
              without numbers/ formulas... and this is where i am having problems
              with... this is my explanation: when temperature increased for an
              exothermic reaction, TdeltaS also increases. Hence deltaG becomes
              more negative since deltaG = deltaH - TdeltaS and deltaH is
              negative. Hence the reaction occurs more readily and more products
              are formed. Since K = [Products]/[Reactants], and [Products]
              increases while [Reactants] decreases, K increases correspondingly,
              thus the equilibrium shifts to the right... do you think my
              explanation is correct?</p>

              Your explanation is incomplete, because you failed to specify if entropy change was positive or negative. Otherwise it's ok.<p>
              Just because 'a quantitative treatment is not required', does NOT mean you "*have* to explain without numbers/ formulas", and it also does NOT mean that Cambridge won't accept your explanation using mathematical formulae, as long as the formulae is valid, correct and relevant, even if the formulae isn't taught within the syllabus.
              </p><p>Lastly, to 'show understanding that the position of equilibrium is dependent on the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction' as specified in the syllabus, all you need to do is simply state in words, that when the position of equilibrium lies on the LHS, Gibbs free energy change (Î”G) is positive and cell potential (EÂ°cell) is negative ; conversely and concordantly when position of equilibrium lies on the RHS, Gibbs free energy change (Î”G) is negative and cell potential (EÂ°cell) is positive; no further explanation in either words or formulae is required.

                              Depends on context. Even in contexts where drawing out the structures and/or mechanisms is acceptable by Cambridge as an alternative to the written equation, you'll need to be careful in the stoichiometry and balancing the reaction correctly. If unsure of acceptability of context, always play safe and give both (ie. draw out structures and/or mechanism if it helps you, *and* write out the balanced equation), as long as you know your chemistry well and have good time management.<p>In the context of your particular question, if all you mean is drawing out the benzene ring, yes it's acceptable to do so (instead of just writing the formula), particularly since in this case phenol is tribrominated (on all 3 of the ortho and para positions) and hence in this case there are no positional isomer ambiguity problems (eg. if it was only monobrominated or dibrominated, then you would have a mixture of different positional isomers, in which case it would be more correct to write the condensed structural formula C6H4BrOH instead of drawing it out).</p>

                  Yes, but depending on the sterics of both the Bronsted-Lowry base and acid, either the Zaitsev product or the Hofmann product would dominate as the major product.

                  Chemistry is a microcosm of Real Life. When there are opposing factors, in some cases the 1st factor wins, in some cases the 2nd factor wins.<p>Considering K vs Ca, the factor of increased nuclear charge outweighs the factor of inter-electron repulsion, consequently ionization enthalpy for Ca is more endothermic than for K. Considering P vs S, the factor of inter-electron repulsion outweighs the factor of increased nuclear charge, consequently the ionization enthalpy for S is less endothermic than for P.</p><p>In Chemistry, including for A levels, you can only show your understanding of both (or all) opposing factors, then carry out experiments to determine which factors outweigh which. To discuss this deeper at higher levels (beyond A levels), yes it's possible to show with more involved calculations why this factor outweighs that factor at this point in the periodic table, but these would not be relevant or useful for A level purposes, and would only confuse the A level student and is therefore counterproductive.</p>

                                Your student's school teacher is wrong here. Because the monomer (undergoing condensation polymerization) here is a hydroxycarboxylic acid, so for 2 repeat units, you just require 2 R groups (usually illustrated by a shaded-box at O levels) in the section of the polymer. Exactly as you've drawn.<p>The reason for your student's school teacher's error, is because in some other instances of condensation polymerization, 2 different monomers are required, eg. a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid in Nylon 66. In such instances, 2 repeat units must include 4 R goups and 0.5+3+0.5 amide linkages, ie. -- diamine -- dicarboxylic acid -- diamine -- dicarboxylic acid --.</p><p>Thus, perhaps by misguided instruction from the HOD, many secondary school teachers just apply this requirement blindly across the board, including for condensation polymers that only involve a single monomer, eg. hydroxycarboxylic acid.</p><p>Long story short : you're correct, Metanoia. Your student's school teacher is wrong.</p><p><br>            </p><blockquote>

              Oh no worries (about your student being distraught over conflicting answers). just tell your students what I tell my students, "<i>For your school exams, write your answers the way your school teachers taught you.

                  is it because cr(h2o)63+ have high charge density, high polarising
                  power, undergoes cation hydrolysis by polarising oh bond in h2o,
                  causing h atom to ionise to form h+. Since solution is acidic it
                  undergoes acid base neutralisation with na2co3 to form co2</p>

                  Q1. The C-H sigma bond is strong due to sp-s overlap, but more importantly, HCN is a weak acid because the conjugate base is significantly unstable due to the relatively low electronegativity of C atom that bears the negative formal charge (it is only the sp hybridization that just barely allows the C atom to bear the negative formal charge). The weakness of HCN as an acid results in high Ea for the alkene to act as a Bronsted-Lowry base to abstract the proton from HCN, hence the relative inertness.<p>Q2. You can go straight into "In the presence of the 6 NH3 ligands, the d orbitals become non-degenerate... etc etc".</p><p>Q3. Yes, that's correct. But in addition to a textual explanation, you also need to write out the relevant balanced equations to obtain full marks.

              Compared to most other C-H bonds which are 2sp2-1s or 2sp3-1s overlap. H-Cl bond is even weaker because it is 3sp3-1s overlap.<p>Orbital hybridization applies for all molecules, eg. 3sp3d2 hybridization for octahedral centers (eg. PCl6- ion).</p><p>If you draw out the mechanism (for the reaction that does not readily occur due to high Ea required), you'll see that you're breaking the 2p-2p pi bond of the alkene (ie. the weak Bronsted-Lowry base), as well as the 2sp-1s sigma bond of the H-CN (ie. the weak Bronsted-Lowry acid).</p>

                  Whether the student can determine the ortho-para-meta directing nature of each substituent, is up to the student to learn about this as you/he/she wills. Different JCs, different teachers, different private tutors, teach to differing extents. Depending on your own willingness and choice, you can read up about this on your own, even if your school teacher chooses not to teach it.<p>The phenolic OH group is electron-donating by resonance moreso than it is electron-withdrawing by induction, hence each phenolic OH group is activating and ortho-para directing. The alkyl group (sp3 C atoms) in L-Dopa is electron-donating by induction (relative to the sp2 C atoms of the benzene ring), and is hence a weak activator and an ortho-para director. The benzaldehyde group in Vanillin is electron-withdrawing by both induction (due to a significant partial positive charge on the carbonyl sp2 C atom as a result of both induction and resonance) and resonance (due to the sideways overlap of the unhybridized p orbitals of sp2 C and O atoms of the carbonyl C=O group), and is hence deactivating and meta directing.</p><p>Hence, the strongest activator (for both L-Dopa and Vanillin) being the phenolic OH group, wins and gets to direct the incoming electrophile. Because L-Dopa contains 2 phenolic OH groups, Cambridge will accept any of the 3 possible answers, although the Mark Scheme answer is the major product due to least steric hindrance.

                                      <p>Hi UltimaOnline, just a little concept clarification. Is there a
                      buffer region for weak acid and weak base titration? Thanks</p>

                      Technically, yes. Buffer regions still occur when you've close to equal molarities of HA and A-, as well as close to equal molarities of B and BH+ (note that the actual maximum buffer capacities of the solution, however, is no longer based simplistically on having equal molarities of both members of each conjugate acid-base pair, since the other conjugate acid-base pair also exerts its influence on pH and buffering capacity; exact calculations here are significantly beyond the scope of A levels).<p>In addition, there is an additional (albeit weaker) buffer region (unique to weak acid - weak base titrations) that spans from the 1st buffer region (ie. near half-equivalence point) all the way to the 2nd buffer region (ie. near double-equivalence point), including the titration equivalence point, since both cation and anion of the salt at equivalence point, are themselves a weak acid and a weak base.</p><p>If Cambridge were to ask Singapore students to calculate the pH at equivalence point of a weak acid - weak base titration, 99.99% of Singapore H2 Chem students (and even many JC teachers and private tutors) would die. But if you're interested to challenge yourself, try solving such a question. Hint : you'll need to solve simultaneous equations which takes into account the simultaneous hydrolysis of both cation and anion of the salt.

                  Of course, it's possible for cycloalkenes to have geometric isomerism for both the double bond as well as substituents. In which case (for A levels), u just need so specify whether the cis-trans isomerism refers to the substituents or the double bond, eg. "<i>This molecule is cis in regard to the double bond, but trans in regard to the 2 Cl atoms on the ring</i>". Cambridge won't require you to name such complicated molecules with more than 1 set of cis-trans isomerism present simultaneously.

                      If starch solution is added at the start of the titration, the insoluble dark blue colored triiodide - starch clathrate precipitate formed will cause a time delay in releasing the triiodide ion (to be reduced by the thiosulfate ion), which may cause your titer volume and hence your titration results to be inaccurate. In other words, you may already have added enough thiosulfate solution from the burette to reach end point (which approximates equivalence point), but the dark blue color may remain for several seconds longer, fooling you into adding another couple of drops of thiosulfate solution from the burette, ruining the accuracy of your titration results.<p>This is much less of a problem if the starch solution is added only near the end of the titration, as there will be a much smaller amount of triiodide ions left to be released from the decomposition of the much smaller amount of dark blue colored triiodide - starch clathrate precipitate, which will take much less time (almost instantaneous) and hence poses little risk of error to your titer volume and titration results.</p>

              That's exactly right. Since the lone pair on the O atom in phenol *is* indeed delocalized by resonance into the benzene ring, obviously the lone pair doesn't occupy an sp3 hybridized orbital, geddit?
