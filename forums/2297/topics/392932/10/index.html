              <p>When a few drops of water are added to the solid, streamy white fumes are evolved and a white solid remains, which is insoluble in water.</p>
              <p>Can I have some clue as to what reaction occurs when water is added to solid aluminium chloride?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, take note that the reaction and equations commonly tested at 'A' levels involve adding excess water to generate an acidic solution of AlCl3(aq), which is really [Al(H2O)5(OH)]2+(aq) + H3O+(aq) + 3Cl-(aq).</p>
              <p>However, this question is asking what happens when limiting amounts of water are added to excess AlCl3(s).</p>
              <p>Even though the initial reactant AlCl3 may be regarded as covalent, but because the final product is more ionic than covalent, and has the empirical formula Al2O3, it'll be more easier for you to follow mathematically if I illustrate the reaction mechanism using two units of AlCl3 rather than one.</p>
              <p>Six (per two units of AlCl3) water nucleophiles / ligands / Lewis bases attack (ie. donate dative bonds to) the (high charge density and thus a strong) Lewis acid Al3+ ion of AlCl3 (empirical formula), thereby eliminating six (per two units of AlCl3) Cl- ions which instantaneously functions as a Lewis / Bonsted base to abstract the six (per two units of AlCl3) protons from the positive formal charged (O atoms of the) six water nucleophiles which attacked earlier, consequently generating the steamy fumes of six HCl(g) molecules and the intermediate Al2(OH)6 which readily dehydrates (due to the high charge density or 'electrophilicity' of the Al3+ ion making it a strong Lewis acid, half of the OH- ligands / nucleophiles / Lewis bases present readily donate a second dative bond and thus loses another proton; furthermore the reaction is exothermic and the high temperature provides additional activation energy *and* favours the positive increase in entropy as predicted by Gibbs free energy during the dehydration process) to generate the insoluble white solid Al2O3 (empirical formula) and three water molecules are simultaneously eliminated (accounting : these three H2O molecules came from the elimination of the 3 OH- ligands/nucleophiles combining with the 3 protons eliminated, when the other 3 OH- ligands/nucleophiles donated a 2nd dative bond to the Al3+ ion).</p>
              <p>But because the ions involved are O2- and Al3+, and since the electronegativity difference between oxygen and aluminium is sufficiently large to qualify as predominantly ionic, the so-called 'dative covalent bonds' donated to the Al3+ during the mechanism are now to be regarded as ionic bonds, in the final ionic product Al2O3.</p>
              <p>Hydolysis (ie. nucleophilic / Lewis base attack of H2O) :<br>2 AlCl3 + 6 H2O → 6 HCl + 2Al(OH)3 or Al2(OH)6</p>
              <p>Dehydration of Al(OH)3 :<br>2  Al(OH)3 or Al2(OH)6 → Al2O3 + 3 H2O</p>
              <p>Overall :<br>2 AlCl3(s) + 6 H2O(l) → Al2O3(s) + 6 HCl(g) + 3 H2O(l)</p>
              <p>Cancelling the three H2O molecules on both sides of the equation :<br>2 AlCl3(s) + 3 H2O(l) → Al2O3(s) + 6 HCl(g)</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>I have another doubt pertaining to the 'A' level question asked ealier: 2011 'A' level exam qn :<br><br>Is PCl5 a simple molecular compound? If so, why is it solid at rtp? Draw it's structure in the solid state and describe the geometries involved.<br><br>In your answer, you stated: <strong>The P-Cl bond heterolytic dissociation enthalpy is small, compared to the large amount of heat energy that can be evolved from forming the stronger ionic bonds. Hence formation of solid PCl5 is favoured under standard conditions.<br><br></strong>I understand that the P-Cl bond dissociation enthalpy is referring to the formation of simple molecular PCl5. But I dont understand how the formation of simple molecular PCl5 requires the bond dissociation of P-Cl.<br><br>Unless, simple molecular PCl5 also exists as PCl4+ and PCl6- ions initially, and PCl6- loses a Cl- to donate to PCl4+, thus forming 2 PCl5 molecules.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we begin from the molecular PCl5, then the P-Cl heterolytic (not homolytic) bond dissociation generates the ionic species PCl4+ and PCl6-, as temperature decreases and PCl5 solidifies.</p>
              <p>As temperature increases, because molecular PCl5 is able to possess more kinetic energy as liquid and gaseous simple molecules, compared to solid ionic PCl5 (whose atoms can only vibrate about fixed positions), hence the P-Cl heterolytic (not homolytic) bond dissociation now generates the molecular PCl5 from the ionic species.</p>
              <p>In other words, whether you're generating the ionic from the molecular, or the molecular from the ionic, you'll need to heterolytically dissociate a P-Cl bond (and of course, form one as well). The molecular and ionic species exist in equilibrium with each other, it's only a matter of who predominates in which temperatures, pressures and solvents.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Case 1 :</p>
              <p>You're right, this is more hypothetical than feasible, because vanadium is a metal that is only interested in losing electrons to be oxidized to cationic form, not gaining electrons to be reduced to anionic form.</p>
              <p>The short answer is : both configurations are possible, depending on other factors (that you needn't concern yourself with at 'A' levels).</p>
              <p>However, the more important lesson here is, the exam-smart candidate will :</p>
              <p>If this was a P1 qn, then consider both possible, but (if both options are present, then) assume the more direct answer, ie. 3d4 4s2.</p>
              <p>If this was a P2 or P3 qn, then intelligently (ie. with explanation) write both configurations in your answer :</p>
              <p>"<em>When a particle with initial configuration [Ar] 3d^3 4s^2 gains an electron, it first attains an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d^4 4s^2, which may (or may not) subsequently rearrange itself (as observed in the example of chromium) to have an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d^5 4s^1, by transferring an electron from its 4s orbital, to one of its 3d orbitals, to achieve a more stable half-filled 3d subshell.</em>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Case 2 :</p>
              <p>This is pretty straightforward. No rearrangement takes place (as far as the electron configuration of the Fe2+ ion is concerned, when asked at 'A' levels) because Fe2+ is ionic and readily stabilizes itself in other ways (ie. as an alternative to rearranging its electron configuration) such as by forming ionic bonds, and/or coordination complexes (the electrons-in-boxes diagram will include both its own electrons, as well as those of the coordinate dative bonds donated by the ligands).</p>
              <p>Bottomline :</p>
              <p>At 'A' levels, when removing electrons from d-block elements, remember to just kick away electrons from the 4s orbital (which is further away from the nucleus, thus easier to remove), before removing any electrons from its 3d orbital (which is nearer to the nucleus, thus more difficult to remove).</p>

              <p><br>Good attempt, with a couple of errors. Here are the correct answers.</p>
              <p>A : chlorocyclopropane</p>
              <p>B : 1-chloroprop-1-ene or 2-chloroprop-1-ene (the halogen atom must be bonded to a sp2 hybridized C atom, allowing resonance delocalization of a lone pair on the halogen atom to form a pi bond with the C atom, thus giving rise to C-X having partial double bond character, as evidenced by the observed resistance to nucleophilic substitution by the CN- nucleophile)</p>
              <p>C : (based on either species B above)<br>either<br>1-bromo-1-chloropropan-2-ol (major product) or 2-bromo-1-chloro-propan-1-ol (minor product)<br>or<br>1-bromo-2-chloropropan-2-ol (major product) or 2-bromo-2-chloro-propan-1-ol (minor product)</p>
              <p>D : cyclopropylmethanoic acid</p>
              <p>E : sodium cyclopropylmethanoate</p>
              <p>F : tetra(cyclopropyl) ammonium chloride (with byproduct of HCl(alc) &lt;---&gt; HCl(g) )</p>
              <p>About writing the balanced equation to generate F, you can either write the 4 individual equations (better yet, draw the repeated nucleophilic subsitution mechanism), or a combined overall equation (to generate 3 HCl and 1 RRRRN+Cl-)</p>
              <p>Cambridge will accept either, since they didn't specify which was required.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>thank you very much.</p>
              <p>just some questions, since the question state that E is an ion, as Nish said, the answer should be cyclopropylmethanoate ion, right?</p>
              <p>But since sodium is present, wouldn't sodium react with the ion to form the salt sodium cyclopropylmethanoate?</p>
              <p>Another question is about the naming, is cyclopropylmethanoic acid=cyclopropanoic acid?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Cambridge will usually ask you to identify unknown compounds such as E, as a full ionic compound (ie. a metal carboxylate, in this case, sodium cyclopropylmethanoate), rather just as one of the ions present. But yes, if the prelim exam question specifies E as an ion, they're indeed asking for "cyclopropylmethanoate".</p>
              <p>In aqueous or alcoholic solvent, sodium compounds are soluble, meaning that the Na+ cation and the cyclopropylmethanoate anion, are both ion - permanent dipoled (or for the anion, hydrogen bonded) to the water or alcohol solvent, rather than ionically 'stuck' to each other, which would be the case if the solvent was aprotic non-polar (eg. CCl4, methylbenzene, etc).</p>
              <p>No, as Nish pointed out already, the name "cyclopropanoic" is incorrect because it implies only 3 Cs are present. The correct name "cyclopropylmethanoic acid" implies there are 3 Cs + 1 C = 4 Cs present in total, which is indeed the case here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>To add on another question is: I didn't quite understand why the halogen must be bonded to the sp2 carbon for B.</p>
              <p>You said: "B : 1-chloroprop-1-ene or 2-chloroprop-1-ene (the halogen atom must be bonded to a sp2 hybridized C atom, allowing resonance delocalization of a lone pair on the halogen atom to form a pi bond with the C atom, thus giving rise to C-X having partial double bond character, as evidenced by the observed resistance to nucleophilic substitution by the CN- nucleophile)"</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>It is the same concept or explanation with "why doesn't chlorobenzene undergo hydrolysis? in contrast to chloroalkanes".</p>
              <p>Most JCs give the orbital overlap explanation, while I personally prefer the resonance delocalization explanation. Cambridge will accept both, as long as you specify that the end-result is that the C-X bond has partial double bond character and is difficult to cleave, and therefore the halobenzene or haloalkene, is resistant to nuclophilic substitution.</p>

Usually Cambridge and Prelim papers will specify "heat under reflux with KMnO4", and student is expected to give "benzoic acid" as the product. But a potential trick question, is to "heat under reflux with K2Cr2O7", in which case you only get oxidation of the alcohol (and not the entire side chain), but there will be a % of students who don't read carefully, and wrongly give "benzoic acid" as the answer.</p>

              <p><br>You need to write out (eg. in table format, or in normal writing format, this is optional and up to you), a list of structural deductions, based on the data given in the question.</p>
              <p>For example :<br>"<em>Since a positive iodoform reaction occurs when compound A is warmed with alkaline aqueous iodine to generate CHI3, either the -CH(OH)CH3 group or the -C=OCH3 group is present in compound A.

              <p>Mechanisms for such "Structural Deductive Elucidation" type are not required, unless specifically asked for in the question.

              <p>To order to mechanically break apart a piece of diamond, a lot more energy is required to overcome the much stronger covalent bonds in diamond. In contrast, in order to mechanically slice away layers of graphite (which we do when we write using pencils), less energy is required to overcome the weaker van der Waals attraction between the graphene layers of graphite.</p>
              <p>A comparison (note the use of comparative adjectives more / less / higher / lower / stronger / weaker in my answer above) must be made to contrast the requirements for mechanically breaking apart pieces of both allotropes, rather than just describing the bonding in only either allotrope.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Turns out that to completely melt graphite, you need to overcome both the intramolecular covalent bonds within the graphene layers, as well as the van der Waals forces between the graphene layers.</p>
              <p>Still, this question is rather unfair, because this is still not the full picture. Each C atom in graphite is sp2 hybridized and the covalent bonds within the graphene layers is actually stronger (due to partial double bond character) than the covalent bonds within diamond.</p>
              <p>So you have greater number of covalent bonds within diamond, versus stronger covalent bonds within graphite. So who wins? Turns out the melting points of diamond and graphite are actually pretty close (despite graphite being soft and diamond behing ultra-hard).</p>
              <p>So, this is still not a fair question (so Cambridge is also arguably at fault), because students (especially at 'O' levels) can't be expected to be aware of, and compare the magnitude of energy required, to overcome the greater number of covalent bonds in diamond, versus the stronger covalent bonds in graphite.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, the examiner report confirms what I said in my previous posts, about usage of comparative adjectives, difference in number of covalent bonds, and strength of covalent bonds (stronger in graphite, weaker in diamond).</p>
              <p>The so-called 'weak bonds' (in the examiner's report) do not refer to covalent bonds, but van der Waals forces. This should be specified more clearly in the examiner's report, which are to be read by teachers, not students, so Cambridge shouldn't use oversimplified (and technically erroneous) terms like "weak bonds" when referring to van der Waals forces, lest it may confuse some people reading it.</p>

              <p>usually for SN1 mechanism, the nucleophile can attack the carbocation from both sides, hence forming 2 isomers cuz of the chiral centre. but what if there is a tertiary halogenoalkane, and all the groups bonded to it are -CH3? then can the nucleohiple still attack from both sides? how to draw the mechanism and end product? <img class="inlineimg" title="Frown" src="http://forums.sgclub.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""> .</p>

              <p><br>Two enantiomers are obtained only if the product contains a chiral carbon. If the carbocation intermediate involved is the trimethylmethyl carbocation, the product would not contain a chiral carbon, and hence does not have optial isomers. Therefore, there would only be one possible product, regardless of which side the nucleophile attacked the trigonal planar carbocation.</p>

              <p><br>No need to draw two mechanism pathways (ie. one from either side of the trigonal planar carbocation attacked), since there is only one product. Just draw the trigonal planar carbocation intermediate being attacked by the nucleophile from either direction.</p>

              <p> <br>Using K2Cr2O7 won't make a difference. Using hot KMnO4 however, will oxidize methanol to methanal to methanoic acid to carbonic(IV) acid, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence can decompose into, CO2 and H2O. Efferversence of CO2 can be thus observed for methanol, but not for propanol.</p>

              <p>This question requires the student to consider both factors in his/her calculations : number of H atoms substitutable and stability of alkyl radical intermediates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get J :</p>
              <p>(number of H atoms substitutable) x (stability of alkyl radical intermediates)</p>
              <p>= 1 x 21 = 21</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To get K :</p>
              <p>(number of H atoms substitutable) x (stability of alkyl radical intermediates)</p>
              <p>= 9 x 1 = 9</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence ratio of products J to K = 21 / 9 or 7J : 3K</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Cambridge asks "what factors affect product distribution in free radical substitution?" the student should qualitatively explain both factors.</p>
              <p>But if Cambridge asks "what is the relative percentages of the expected product distribution?", then :</p>
              <p>If the Cambridge exam question does not provide data for the relative stabilities of alkyl radical intermediates (which can be phrased as "relative rates of reaction to generate primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides" as seen in the original question above), then the student need only give a quantitative answer based on calculations that only consider "number of H atoms substitutable".</p>
              <p>If the Cambridge exam question does provide data for the relative stabilities of alkyl radical intermediates (such as in the original question above), then the student needs to consider both factors "number of H atoms substitutable" and "stability of alkyl radical intermediates" by multiplying the values associated with both factors, to obtain the true product distribution.</p>
              <p>Most schools only teach the simpler factor of "number of H atoms substitutable", but this is misleading because in practice, both factors (which you would notice tend to contradict each other : tertiary alkyl halides have the least no. of H atoms to substitute away, but yet tertiary alkyl radicals are the most stabilized by hyperconjugation from the alkyl groups) are equally important and teaches the student that in Chemistry, just as in Real Life, it is myopic and does oneself injustice, to simply consider one side of the story or one particular viewpoint only; one must consider all sides of the story or all relevant viewpoints to understand and appreciate the truer, bigger, more beautiful picture of the Universe and of Life.</p>
