              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">So suggested answer is potassium,
              as the valence electrons of the atom of K experience the weakest
              nuclear charge effect among the 4 options above</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">And Kr is the atom which valence
              electrons experience the strongest attraction to the nucleus,
               as nuclear charge effect increases across the same period
              while shielding effect remain approximately constant across the
              same period, hence effective nuclear charge increases across the
              period </p>

              It's not a fair comparison, because K (being a metal) doesn't have van der Waals radius, while Kr (being unreactive) *only* has van der Waals radius. You could say it's Cambridge's fault for setting this problematic question, but for A level purposes, since in the H2 syllabus, you focus only on the concept of increasing electronegativity and ionization energy across a period, instead of the different types of atomic radii (specifically covalent radius versus van da waals radius) which isn't really in the H2 syllabus, thus Cambridge (reasonably) expects you to just apply the concept of increasing electronegativity and ionization energy across a period, and that's it. Don't need to care about covalent radius versus van der Waals.
              <br><br>Other than atomic radius, Cambridge can test you on comparing the *ionic* radii of iso-electronic species, eg. K+ vs Cl- (both isoelectronic with Ar atom). That's about it. No covalent vs van der Waals radius.

                                                                                                        <br><br>As nitrogen (the most abundant gas in the atmosphere) is inevitably present in the air used by blast furnaces (air is afterall, the cheapest source of oxygen, and obviously all industries are profit-oriented and want to make as much money as possible by reducing costs), at such high temperatures of blast furnaces, it's inevitable that various oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are generated. Such oxides of nitrogen are toxic to humans, and are known to be an industrial medical health hazard for blast furnace workers.
                                                                                                        <br><br>While the O level syllabus doesn't specifically include mention of this health hazard suffered by blast furnace workers, nonetheless (assuming you believe Cambridge wants you to including nitrogen as the correct answer) at O levels and A levels, students are arguably expected to put 2 and 2 together (presence of nitrogen and oxygen, and at high temperatures) and conclude oxides of nitrogen may (and are) being produced in blast furnaces, albeit as undesirable (and medically hazardous) side-products.<br><br><br>            <blockquote>

                                    shouldn't be faulted to include nitrogen also.  </p>

                                    TYS publishers are not certainly not Cambridge. TYS publishers pay MOE for the right to publish the questions (the answers are by the various authors hired by the publishers), as the copyrights are co-owned by Cambridge and MOE. The official Cambridge mark schemes are (by law, due to a legal agreement between MOE and Cambridge) confidential and cannot be revealed to the public. It is fairly common (especially for A levels, when it becomes even more complicated) for all the different TYS publications available on the market to all give different answers for an ambiguous, challenging or problematic, open-ended Singapore A level exam question (every year there's a couple of such qns). This happens even for MCQs, but naturally to a lesser extent.

                      2013 Paper 2 Q3(a)(i) - You've only a small chance that Cambridge might show you mercy and give you that mark, for 3 reasons. 1stly, Cambridge is testing to see if the student knows that phenol, being more acidic than alcohols, can be deprotonated just by the use of NaOH(aq) alone. 2ndly, NaOH is a lot cheaper and less hazardous than Na. You should always only use the cheaper and safer reagent, if both reagents have the same effect. 3rdly, beyond the H2 syllabus, Na being such a strong reducing agent, can actually (under certain circumstances or with certain co-reagents) reduce the benzene ring (eg. Birch reduction).

                      Q4(a)(i) - Acronyms are not acceptable by Cambridge in the A levels. Don't over-use them even in your own self-revision. No, your answer is relevant only for period 2 and 3 elements excluding d block metals. For this question, you need to specify that 3d orbitals (being more diffused) provide relatively poor shielding for the 4s orbitals electrons, which are consequently more strongly electrostatically attracted to the positively charged nucleus, of which Fe and Cu have 6 and 9 more protons compared to Ca.

                      2012 Paper 2 Q2(a)(ii) - You won't get any marks for your answer. Because in the 1st place by definition of hydrocarbon, there is no nitrogen present (immediately zero marks for this part of the question liao). Next, even if some organic fuels contained nitrogen (eg. amine group, nitrile group, amide group, imine group, etc), that isn't the main mechanism (which Cambridge is testing you for) by which oxides of nitrogen are formed. It's the atmospheric N2 which reacts with atmospheric O2 at high temperatures that is being tested here. Be sure you mention the strong NN triple bond, the high activation energy involved, and the high temperatures present in combustion engines.

                  Aqueous can be concentrated aqueous. Different from liquid. Yes you can obtain some dihalide (previous qn stated *maximum possible*, which could be a minor product, not necessarily major), but it won't be 100% yield, so you won't get marks for using this method. You should still specify X2 in CCl4 when asked.

              In absence of OH-(aq), you write the hydrated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ form. With OH-(aq), you get Zn(OH)2(s) ppt.
              <br><br>
              No need to memorize ligand strength or ligand field strength (google if you don't know the difference). Just apply common chemistry sense (eg. ligand strength, nucleophilic strength and Bronsted-Lowry basicity strength, all parallel each other because all 3 are functions of Lews basicity strength, with some exceptions you needn't care about at A levels), and most importantly, follow the clues given in the question. If there's a colour change upon adding a reagent, it implies ligand substitution aka ligand exchange has occurred.
              <br><br>
              On a related note, whether the coordination complex generated has 4 or 6 ligands, is a complex matter (pun intended), and the underlying reasons cannot be fully covered at A levels. For A level purposes, try to familiarize (no need to blindly memorize 100+ coordination complexes, their geometries and colours, etc) yourself with the dozen or so complexes more commonly encountered at A levels. For this purpose, Chang Kim Seng &amp; Jeanne Tan's book, and George Chong's book, will be more useful than CS Toh's book (which is summarized lecture notes). Your own JC should have given you a list as well.
              <br><br>
              Tips : if the ligands are small and neutral, eg, H2O ligands, there will usually be 6 ligands, ie. octahedral geometry. If the ligands are large, eg. Cl ligands, there will usually be only 4 ligands, ie. tetrahedral geometry, due to steric hindrance or van der Waals repulsions. If the ligands are small but have high anionic charge densities, eg. OH- ligands, there will usually be only 4 ligands, ie. tetrahedral geometry, due to anionic electrostatic repulsions.
              <br><br>
              The notable special case (which the H2 syllabus specifies you need to memorize), is the deep-blue coloured and with square planar geometry, tetraamminecopper(II) ionic coordination complex, [Cu(NH3)4]2+. The reasons why Cu2+ only accepts 4 NH3 ligands, and why the ionic complex's geometry is square planar instead of tetrahedral, is because of the Jahnâ€“Teller effect and other reasons too complex to be dealt with at A level purposes. For A level purposes, other than the few commonly encountered coordination complexes you need to memorize (their colours and geometries), simply follow the clues which will be provided by Cambridge in the question.
              <br><br>
              Yes, NH3 ligand is stronger than H2O ligand, but don't forget molarity (ie. concentration) also determines the position of equilibrium in the Kstab or Kf equation (google it), and therefore determines which ligands substitute or exchange away which ligands. In other words, a weaker ligand with a higher molarity, can substitute away a stronger ligand with a lower molarity. Which is why the Cambridge question will specify, "added in excess" to ensure the ligand substitution occurs, due to the molarity affecting the position of equilibrium.

                                                                                                                                                                                - % s orbital vs p orbital character of hybridized orbitals, as mentioned above, affects availability of lone pair on Lewis base (ie. nucleophile and/or Bronsted-Lowry base; eg. why amines are more nucleophilic &amp; basic over imines, and imines over nitriles; for amides the resonance factor takes precedence), affects strength of covalent bond required to be cleaved (and hence activaiton energy required), and affects stability of charge (both in nucleophile / Bronsted-Lowry base, as well as in the leaving group after elimination).

You made 2 errors right here : 1st of all, in this question OH- isn't a ligand at all. It's a counter ion which precipitates out Zn2+ as Zn(OH)2(s). *If* you had added excess NaOH(aq), giving a sufficiently high molarity of OH-, then the excess OH- can start to function as ligands, and that's how you get the tetrahydroxozincate(II) coordination complex.
                                                                                          <br><br>

                                                                                          <br><br>

But most importantly, you need to be able to explain to Cambridge *why and how* the 'sparingly soluble' metal hydroxide solid precipitate, eg. Cu(OH)2(s) dissolves when adding in excess a solution containing a suitable ligand, eg. NH3(aq), <b>in terms of shifting of positions of equilibria across 2 (or more) reaction equations.</b>

When excess ammonia solution is added, the position of equilibrium in Eqn 3 shifts to the RHS, resulting in a decrease in molarity of Cu2+(aq), which causes the position of equilibrium in Eqn 2 to shift to the LHS, which causes the copper(II) hydroxide precipitate to dissolve.

              If you didn't change conditions, and Qc &lt; Kc, then you say position of equilibrium LIES to the RHS.
              If you didn't change conditions, and Qc &gt; Kc, then you say position of equilibrium LIES to the LHS.
              <br><br>
              If at first Qc = Kc, ie. system is at equilibrium, but then you changed experimental conditions, then you say position of equilibrium SHIFTED to either RHS or LHS.<br><br>
              If you increased or deceased the moles or molarities or partial pressures of reactants or products, then it's Qc which changes, not Kc.
              <br><br>
              If you or increased or decreased temperature, then it's Kc which changes, not Qc.
              <br><br>
              If Qc now &lt; Kc, then you say position of equilibrium has SHIFTED to the RHS.<br>

                                                          Aspartic acid's R group is a COO- group. Valine's R group is an alkyl group. Tyrosine's R group is a phenol group. The question isn't asking for interactions between discrete amino acids. It's asking for <b>interactions between R groups of these amino acid residues within a polypeptide chain</b>. Don't lose your marks carelessly like this, it'll cost you at least 1 grade (with steep bell-curves).

                                    <p>Is it because :in this qn, the amino acids are part of a
                                    polypeptide chain, e.g. val-tyr-asp- etc etc</p>

                                    <p>Thats why will have ionic interactions instead of h bonding?</p>
                                    <p>But if its in water, then hydrolysis would occur,  then
                                    wouldnt the nh2 and cooh group on val and tyr able to interact?

                                    1st of all, hydrolysis only occurs partially, it's an acid-base *equilibrium* remember?<br><br> 2ndly, technically (Singapore JCs don't teach this well so it's not surprising JC students don't really understand this), while COOH and NH2 groups are only capable of (both donating and accepting) H bonds,  COO- and NH3+ groups are actually capable of participating in both H bonds (COO- can only accept H bonds, while NH3+ can only donate H bonds) as well as ionic bonds, depending on who the other party is.<br><br>And yes, Cambridge expects you to automatically first deprotonate COOH groups at pH7, and protonate NH2 groups at pH7.

                                Hydrogen bonding is possible, between the partial positive H atom of NH3+ (the H bond donor), and the partial negative O atom of phenol (the H bond acceptor).<br><br>Cambridge already stated in the question, regarding extent of deprotonation of phenol at pH 7.

                  You need to either heat under reflux or use biological enzymes, plus at strongly acidic or strongly basic pH lah. That's how your strongly acidic stomach digests the meat you eat, with proteases enzymes.<br><br>Acidic COOH groups and basic NH2 groups do ionize via hydrolysis to generate COO- groups and NH3+ groups.<br><br>Different from hydrolysis of the protein's peptide bond within the amide group in the polypeptide chain of a protein (the word "peptide" refers to *either* the peptide bond within the amide group in a polypeptide chain of a protein, *or* the amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain of a protein). Because the amide group within a polypeptide chain bonds two amino acid residues or 'peptides' together, the amide group in proteins is called the peptide group, and the C-N bond within the amide group is called the peptide bond, linking two 'peptides' or amino acid residues together.<br><br>Hydrolysis means "chemical reaction with water" (where chemical reactions involve breaking or forming of sigma bonds, while resonance involves breaking or forming of pi bonds only), while hydration means "physical interaction with water" (physical, inorganic &amp; organic chemistry) or "addition of water" (in some organic chemistry contexts, eg. hydration of alkenes to alcohols).

                                                                                                                                      <br><br>

So for those of you interested (and ready ; if any of these confuses you, then you're not ready and you should skip this entirely), here are the mechanisms

Hence, the Gibbs free energy is expected to be more negative (ie. thermodynamically feasible) for the SOCl2 reaction compared to the PCl5 reaction, due to thermodynamically favourable positive entropy change.

In fact, the mechanism for both water H2O (inorganic chemistry) and alcohol ROH (organic chemistry) reacting with PCl5, is exactly the same (up to a point), because did you notice that water (H-O-H) is a 'type' of alcohol (R-O-H) in which the R group is a H atom, and thus it should make natural and logical sense to you (did your school teach this to you?) that the reaction mechanism (up to a point) is exactly the same : HOH with PCl5 gives POCl3 and 2HCl, while ROH with PCl5 gives POCl3 and RCl + HCl.<br><br>You can try drawing the mechanism for further hydrolysis of POCl3 to give H3PO4 + 3HCl (notice that the OS of all elements remain unchanged during hydrolysis reactions, so based on the starting OS, you can deduce the final OS which will help you deduce the structure or formula of the final hydrolysis product). The mechanism involves 3 water molecule nucleophiles (one by one) attacking the electrophilic P atom of POCl3, thereby eliminating the 3 Cl- ion leaving groups one by one, followed by proton transfers to generate the final products of H3PO4 and 3 HCl. Cambridge could ask you to draw out this fairly simple mechanism (of which the balanced equation you have to memorize under the Periodicity topic anyway, so might as well you draw out the mechanism to make sense of it for yourself instead of blindly memorizing the equation like most JC students do... which is just sad. Learning should always be fun and meaningful.)

Flying Grenade) who may be interested in studying Chemistry at the Uni level. Did you know that other than SN1 (racemization) and SN2 (inversion of configuration), there's a 3rd mechanism called SNi (retention of configuration) whose secret existence, bewildered chemists figured out, when trying to figure out why some reactions like SOCl2 with alcohols mysteriously resulted in alkyl chlorides with retention of configuration instead of the expected racemization or inversion of configuration (ie. meaning it was neither SN1 nor SN2). If hearing this excites you, then yup, you should certainly consider studying Chemistry at Uni level. Enjoy! :)

              When describing trends of ionization energy and electronegativity across a period, Just keep it clear and simple and write, "<b>Valence shell electrons are shielded from the positively charged nucleus most significantly from *inner shell* electrons; hence shielding effect remains approximately constant across a period.</b>" to get 1 mark when explaining the trend of ionization energy and electronegativity across a period.<br><br>The 2nd mark is stating "<b>The number of protons in the nucleus increases from left to right across a Period, hence valence shell electrons are more strongly electrostatically attracted to the positively charged nucleus, and atomic radius decreases.</b>" and conclude with "<b>Therefore, ionization energy becomes increasingly endothermic from left to right across a Period because of the increasing magnitude of energy required to remove an electron across a Period.</b>"
                              <br><br>
                              When asked to explain electronegativity trend across a period, the 2nd marking point is slightly modified to "<b>The number of protons in the nucleus increases from left to right across a Period, hence valence shell *bonding* electrons are more strongly electrostatically attracted to the positively charged nucleus, and atomic radius decreases.</b>" and conclude with "<b>Therefore, electronegativity increases from left to right across a Period because of the increasing effective nuclear charge</b>.".
                              <br><br>
                              When describing and explaining ionization energy or electronegativity trends down a group, the common error taught by Singapore JCs, and for which Cambridge penalizes thousands of Singapore JCs students every year, is to say "<b><i>effective nuclear charge decreases down a group</i></b>". The moment you write that, you get zero marks for the question. <br><br>Instead, write "<b>Ionization energy decreases down a Group despite increasing nuclear charge, for 2 reasons : due to the increasing atomic radius as a result of increasing number of electron shells,</b> (<i>not "principal quantum shells"!!!</i>)<b> hence as predicted by Coulomb's law, less energy is required to remove the increasingly further-from-nucleus valence shell electrons going down the Group; in addition, the valence shell electrons are also increasingly shielded from the positively charged nucleus by an increasing number of inner shell electrons going down the Group, thereby further reducing the magnitude of energy required to remove the valence shell electron to carry out ionization.</b>"
                              <br><br>Of course, you don't have to phrase it exactly the way I did. Unlike Singapore JC teachers who anally insist you phrase your answer exactly the way they phrased it in their own lecture notes or else they'll penalize you in your Promo/MidYear/Prelim exams (and therefore you can expect JC teachers to also heavily penalize other JC teachers, both within a JC and across to other JCs, so few JC teachers will be able to get an A grade for Prelim papers when marked by other teachers from other JCs), Cambridge is *reasonable* (not lenient, but reasonable, there's a critical difference). So as long as you have the required Mark Scheme points, phrased in your own way (with some degree of creative freedom), you'll get the marks.

              For H2 Chemistry, if asked to name the enantiomers, Cambridge will accept either (+)/(-) or d/l labelling based on optical activity, or the R/S labelling based on the Cahnâ€“Ingoldâ€“Prelog priority rules (which are also used for E/Z labelling system for alkenes, which is more versatile than the limited cis/trans system, and is also accepted by Cambridge for H2 Chemistry) though the R/S and E/Z labels are not compulsory for H2 Chemistry as it's not within syllabus, and only required for H3 Chemistry. The D/L labelling is used in biochemistry (H2/H3 Biology).

              For oxytocin, there is no C terminus, because the C terminus (belonging to glycine) has reacted (in a nucleophilic acyl substitution, addition-elimination, condensation reaction) with NH3 to become the amide group you see at the bottom-left corner of oxytocin. You *must* write it the correct way around to get the 1 mark.<br><br>

                                                      Eh don't anyhow misuse his name. Markovnikov (Chinese for "horse cough you also cough") would turn in his grave if he heard you say that. Markovnikov's rule is only for hydrohalogenation via electrophilic addition across a double bond (if you know why it usually works to predict the major product, you'll also know when it'll fail, for challenging tricky qns). This is halogenation via free radical substitution, nothing to do with Markovnikov (he'll say å…³æˆ‘å±�äº‹!). Because free radical substitution cannot be controlled, you'll get a mixture of many monohalogenated products. To determine which monohalogenated intermediate was used for this qn, observe the structures of the final product upon dehydrohalogenation (ie. this qn isn't asking you to state which is the major product, but rather identify the intermediate that could give you the final products drawn). But assuming you're jus curious if that's the major product of halogenation via free radical substitution, it *is* the major product, based solely upon the factor of stability of alkyl radical intermediate (in actuality, you need to mathematically combine both factors at a specified temperature to determine the actual major product). Then yes, your reasoning (though you wrongly labeled your explanation using Markovnikov's name) is correct : tertiary alkyl radical is more stable than secondary alkyl radical is more stable than primary alkyl radical. This factor is more pronounced for Br, less for Cl, and even less so for F (I is irrelevant here, because iodination via free radical mechanism cannot be carried out; you know why? asking you to explain why, was a Singapore TYS A level exam qn).<br><br>
                                                      No, the dienes you drew cannot be generated. Why? Asking you to explain why, was 2014's Singapore TYS A level exam qn. Hints (any or all of these terms may be used in your explanation) : orbital hybridization, electron geometry, ring strain, angle strain, thermodynamic instability, thermodynamic infeasibility.

                                You got the idea.<br><br>Cumulated dienes can indeed be generated, just not within a small ring like this molecule, because of the resultant ring strain due to angle strain (due to the significant deviation from the ideal bond angles about the sp hybridized C atom as predicted by VSEPR theory, which is to maximize thermodynamic stabilities by minimizing electron pair electrostatic repulsions) making it thermodynamically unstable and thus its formation thermodynamically unfeasible. <br><br>
                                Conjugated dienes (such as the final product in this Cambridge qn) are thermodynamically favored due to the resonance stabilization energy (for the same reason why only benzene, but not the non-resonance mythical version, cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene, exists), which results in the resonance hybrid enjoying overall stronger C-C bonds (ie. 3 C-C bonds all with partial double bond characters, is overall still stronger and still has a more exothermic formation enthalpy compared to 2 full double bonds and 1 strictly single bond), a more exothermic formation enthalpy, and thus more thermodynamically stable and formation more thermodynamically favored.

              Go google up on how these factors influence product distribution during halogenation via free radical substitution, and the reactivity-selectivity principle (in the context of halogenation via free radical substitution, which requires an understanding of the Hammond postulate).

                                Not the same. In fact, the two factors are opposing. Take propane for example. Based on each factor, what is the expected major product? 1 factor predicts 1-halopropane as the major product, while the other factor predicts 2-halopropane as the major product.<br><br>If the Cambridge A level exam question requires you to calculate out the overall product distribution mathematically (which has appeared in past CIE A levels and Pre-U papers), the question has to provide you with the relative reactivities of a pri vs sec vs tert H atom (corresponding to the relative stabilities of a pri vs sec vs tert alkyl radical) in numerical values, for you to apply mathematically (ie. multiply both factors together). Such values differ across halogens, and across temperatures.<br><br>If your school JC teacher didn't teach you about these 2 factors (see the benefits of a Chemistry education @ BedokFunland JC ?), you can google up yourself, and/or read the following webpages :<br><br>

                                                  Yes of course it's acid-base equilibria, and your school JC teacher *did* teach you this, didn't he/she? It's basic (no pun intended) acid-base equilibria. Of course any equilibrium can be linked to Le Chatelier's principle, and also to Organic Chemistry (eg. acid-base equilibria of amino acids). Everything can be linked, once you understand Chemistry deeply enough.<br><br>

                                                  Diagrams of structures are optional (as indicated in the question phrasing). Cambridge will award you the marks if the required points are present in your answer, whether in words, in balanced equations, in your diagrams, or all 3. Unless you're supremely confident you can include all the required points are present in words alone, or equations alone, or diagrams alone, it's usually a good idea (assuming your time management is good enough) in such questions to use at least 2 out of the 3 forms in your answers (even if the question doesn't compulsorily require it), to ensure all the required points are present in your answer to secure full marks. So to address your question directly, no need, as long as the required marking points are present (go see a TYS publisher's answer for this).

                                    My postulation: The change in water level would mean that the
                                    gaseous pressure has increased. The answer canâ€™t be D because
                                    ammonium chloride would be formed (so presumably the gaseous
                                    pressure exerted on the LHS would decrease since an ionic salt is
                                    formed). However, what will happen when CO or N is pumped into the
                                    set up? Am I right in saying that the answer is B because methane

                                    Q2. Fe(OH)3 has a higher molar mass than Fe(OH)2.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Q3. Only CH4 has a lower molar mass than NH3. At constant temperature, the rate at which gas particles diffuse is inversely proportional to their molar mass.

                                    <p>For 1 - how does diffusion take place in solids when the atoms
                                    are arranged in fixed positions? As for 3 I agree with what you

                                    Hi Gohby, no prob, as always :)
                                    <br><br>
                                    Q3. CH4 (being lighter) diffuses into the porous container faster than NH3 (being heavier) can diffuse out, resulting in an increase in gaseous pressure within the porous container.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Q1. This isn't taught at either O levels or A levels, but Truth is Truth, Chemistry is Chemistry, and diffusion *does* occur in solids (the thermodynamic motivation for diffusion, is of course, thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, which is also the thermodynamic motivation for Le Chatelier's principle).

                                Hi Gohby,
                                <br><br>
                                Your own answer for the last question about electrophilic addition of hydrogen halide across an alkene double bond is correct. Don't put too much trust in Singapore secondary schools' teachers' answers, or Singapore assessment practice books' answers, or Singapore TYS publishers' answers.
                                <br><br>
                                Q1. Al is oxidized to Al3+, and NO3- (OS of N = +5) is reduced to NH4+ (OS of N = -3). Thus a total of 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol of NH4+ is deprotonated by the OH- to generate 0.2 mol of NH3, which works out to be 4.8 dm3.
                                <br><br>
                                Q2. You need to use insoluble bases (ie. hydroxides and carbonates), as soluble alkalis are corrosive and will damage your mouth, throat and esophagus before it can reach your stomach to reduce acidity. (Medical note : aluminium is toxic and causes brain damage, thus shouldn't be used in drugs or additives, yet its use continues to be widespread, contributing to Alzheimer's disease and other related dementia medical conditions)
                                <br><br>
                  Q3. Either A or B could be correct, depending on the molarity of KI. If the molarity of KI is sufficiently low, it's *possible* for the mass of ppt generated in experiment 2 to be *less* than in experiment 1 (despite the moles of Pb2+ in experiment 2 being more than in experiment 1), because the total volume of solution in experiment 2 is greater. The secondary school teacher who set this question was being a smart-ass and must have been proudly confident of having set the trickiest O level Chemistry prelim paper question among all the secondary schools for that year (there's always an informal competition to set the toughest prelim papers, just look at the top JCs' prelim papers, most JC teachers themselves wouldn't be able to get an A grade if they sat for the top JCs' prelim papers within the allocated time). Unfortunately, he/she didn't realize that since the molarity of KI wasn't specified, if the molarity was sufficiently high, then even with a larger volume of solution, 99.9% of the moles PbI2(s) could be precipitated out in both experiments, then *your* answer would be correct. So this question has insufficient data to conclusively rule out either A or B.

                                If it's part of a benzene ring side chain (with a benzylic H atom).

                                If you use a chemical oxidizing agent stronger than KMnO4, eg. concentrated HNO3.

                                If you burn it.
