              <blockquote>
              <div style="font-style: italic;">For the question regarding benzylamine and ethylamine I argued that benzylamine was more basic cause I saw the benzene ring as electron rich, and hence the C6H5CH2- alkyl group attached to the nitrogen atom in benzylamine would have a higher electron density around the nitrogen atom which makes the lone pair more available for protonation? I see arguments are that the benzene ring causes the lone pair to partially delocalise into the benzene ring but isn't that inductive effect hindered by the carbon atom between the lone pair and the benzene ring?</div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nice try (with the idea of the electron rich benzene ring attracting protons); proton substitution (via electrophilic aromatic substitution) of the benzene ring does indeed occur, but only under strongly acidic conditions, and not proton addition (which is the definition of basicity), as such would disrupt its aromaticity.</p>
              <p>If you read my previous posts, I've already explained why the benzene ring actually reduces electron density on the N atom in benzylamine by induction (due to greater % s orbital character of benzene's sp2 C atoms). Majority of H2 students, who (blindly followed school notes and) mentioned "delocalization of the lone pair into the benzene ring due to overlap of p orbitals... etc", ie. resonance, got it wrong, as resonance decreasing basicity applies only to phenylamine, not benzylamine.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ah yes, this was one of the problematic questions for this year's Paper 2 (since 2011 when Cambridge began their sadism spree, there has always been several problematic / ambiguous / debatable questions for each H2 Chem A level exam; watch out for tomorrow's Paper 1!).</p>
              <p>Ethers are indeed activating, because they donate electrons by resonance, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">though not as strongly activating as the phenolic group.</span></strong><br><br>Therefore, one could argue for both answers : mono-substitution, or tri-substitution.<br><br>This is truly Cambridge's fault (for setting a question in which there is arguably more than one correct answer), should the Mark Scheme not accept both answers.<br><br>(To exacerbate this matter, the exact same problem arose twice in the question : halogenation and nitration). <br><br>As such, there is no way of saying for sure, that assuming Cambridge will only accept 1 of the answers, whether Cambridge is looking for mono-substitution or tri-substitution.<br><br>However, in such scenarios, the exam-smart candidate, will have to play the Criminal Minds psychological profiler game, and get into the minds of the Cambridge question setter. From the look of the question, specifically the structure of the reactant molecule, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cambridge was probably testing the H2 Chem student on directing effects</span></strong> (ie. ortho / para / meta), as you will notice that the (other) ortho and para positions relative to the phenolic group (ie. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the single strongest activator</span></strong>) were blocked.<br><br>And because both the halogen and nitro substituents are deactivating, it could be argued that Cambridge was testing the candidate to see if he/she knows, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">should only mono-substitution occur, where would it occur?</span></strong> <br><br>Therefore, in conclusion, it is more likely, that (assuming Cambridge only accepts 1 answer; though it would be fairer if Cambridge, perhaps in retrospect after marking of exam scripts begin, hopefully revise their mark scheme to accept both answers), Cambridge was seeking mono-substitution (on the correct ortho position) rather than tri-substitution, as the single best correct answer.<br><br>Conclusion and Final Advice :<br>For tomorrow's Paper 1, if Cambridge again dishes out such frustrating annoyances, be exam-smart and play the Criminal Minds game and profile the Cambridge question setter's psyche.</p>

              <p>When considering the electron pairs repulsion in a molecule, why does a lone pair of elctrons repel more strongly than a bonding pair???</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> <br>For A level purposes, it should be regarded and imagined that a lone pair of electrons is positioned 'horizontally' (ie. both electrons equally close to the atom's nucleus) and thus occupies more space that is in closer proximity to the nucleus, and hence experiences greater repulsions with the other electron pairs around the atom, compared to bond pairs which are positioned 'vertically' away from the nucleus (ie. the dot closer to one atom, and the cross nearer to the other atom bonded with; in fact, this is how Cambridge prefers A level students to draw their dot-and-cross diagrams, as opposed to how some schools erroneously teach), and thus the bond pair's repulsion is 'shared' between (repelling) electrons of both atoms, and hence lesser in magnitude, compared to the repulsion that occurs between lone pairs and other electron pairs of the atom.</p>
              <p>As an illustrative analogy, imagine you're on the MRT train.</p>
              <p>The passengers standing upright holding onto (ie. bonded to) the overhead support handles represent the bond pairs, while the passengers lying down on the floor, not bonded to the overhead support handles, represent the lone pairs.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the passengers lying down on the train floor (ie. the lone pairs), would occupy more floor space, annoying and repelling other passengers to a greater extent, compared to the passengers standing upright (ie. the bond pairs).</p>

                                <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Solution :</em></span></p>
                                <p>Halogen atoms are terminal, similar to hydrogen atoms, and thus may be considered as H atoms.</p>
                                <p>As far as degree of unsaturation is concerned, the molecular formula now stands as C15 H(x+4) N2 O2 S.</p>
                                <p>The presence, addition or subtraction of oxygen and sulfur atoms does not affect the molecule's degree of unsaturation, due to the bivalency of O and S.</p>
                                <p>As far as degree of unsaturation is concerned, the molecular formula now stands as C15 H(x+4) N2.</p>
                                <p>Without affecting the molecule's degree of unsaturation, each nitrogen atom that is inserted between a C atom and a H atom, also carries with it an additional H atom, due to the trivalency of N.</p>
                                <p>As far as degree of unsaturation is concerned, the molecular formula now stands as C15 H(x+4-2) = C15 H(x+2).</p>
                                <p>From the data given in the question,</p>
                                <p>1 benzene ring + 2 non-aromatic rings + 2 double bonds + 2 triple bonds<br>= 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12 degrees of unsaturation.</p>
                                <p>Since a completely saturated, acyclic hydrocarbon with 15 C atoms is expected to have the molecular formula C15 H32, hence the same molecule with 12 degrees of unsaturation is expected to have the molecular formula C15 H(32-24) = C15 H8.</p>
                                <p>Based on our work above,   C15 H(x+2)   =   C15 H8</p>
                                <p>This implies  x + 2 = 8 , hence  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">x = 6</span></strong>.</p>

              <p>To fully understand oxidation of aromatic species, necessarily involves the full mechanism (including the MnO4- species and multiple intermediates), which is not just beyond H2 &amp; H3 A levels, but is also beyond much of Uni level Chemistry as well (in which you will have to choose to focus on your specialties and subspecialties; this holds true for all sciences and all disciplines).</p>
              <p>As such, even your school JC teachers, and even some of the Cambridge examiners, themselves would not know the mechanism for this reaction (*particularly* for this aromatic oxidation reaction, which is significantly more complicated than say, oxidation of alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, etc).</p>
              <p>Bottomline : as far as A levels H2 Chemistry is concerned, Cambridge only requires you to appreciate that the <strong>alkyl side chain (containing at least 1 benzylic H atom) of a benzene ring, can be oxidized by heating under reflux with acidified KMnO4 to generate benzoic acid, and other by-products (usually including CO2)</strong>.</p>
              <p>If the benzene ring's side chain contains a C=C group, you have to treat it as an alkene and oxidize it accordingly to generate the expected products on the other side of the C=C goup. Any remaining C atoms between the benzylic C atom and the double bond, you may assume to be oxidized to CO2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Last but not least,hot alkaline oxidation and its difference between hot acidified oxidation by KMnO4</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> <br>For A level purposes, temperature together with pH matters only for oxidation of alkenes, ie. cold alkaline KMnO4 generates vicinal diol, while hot acidified KMnO4 results in oxidative cleavage.</p>
              <p>Other than alkenes, the H2 syllabus ignores any differences between acidified vs alkaline KMnO4 (but "heat under reflux" must always be specified), other than (obviously!) the required protonation or deprotonation of the oxidation products. </p>

              <p><em>Cyanuric acid, a weak triprotic acid, has the empirical formula CHNO, and a molar mass of 129.1g, and exists as an equilibrium mixture of two tautomers. Draw their structures.</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span></p>
              <p>From the molar mass and empirical formula, we work out the molecular formula as C3H3N3O3.</p>
              <p>From the molecular formula, we work out the degree of unsaturation as 4.</p>
              <p>4 degrees of unsaturation could imply a benzene ring, but since there are only 3 C atoms present per molecule, and there are 3 N atoms available, we modify the benzene ring by alternating the C and N atoms within the ring, ie. obtaining an aromatic triazine ring.</p>
              <p>Note that the 3 phenolic OH groups (for the 1st tautomer) or the 3 NH groups (for the 2nd tautomer) are responsible for the triproticity of cyanuric acid, as the conjugate base(s) are stabilized by having the negative charge(s) delocalized by resonance and dispersed by induction over the multiple electronegative, electron-withdrawing O and N atoms.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding hydrogen reacting with iron :</p>
              <p>First of all, you probably mean hydrogen reacting with compounds or oxides of iron (rather than iron itself). At room temperature and at standard molarities or partial pressures, the reaction will occur at a negligible rate. So at O levels, it's correct to say "iron is less reactive than hydrogen", at standard conditions. </p>
              <p>However, when sufficient heat energy is supplied to overcome the Ea barrier, together with higher molarities or partial pressures of gaseous hydrogen, then the reaction may proceed (depending on the exact redox reaction). For industrial and pragmatic purposes, a transition metal catalyst is almost always employed to increase the rate of the redox reaction when employing gaseous hydrogen.</p>
              <p>Moreover, if the reaction you're referring to, is the reduction of iron(III) oxide to iron(II) oxide, then note that the standard reduction potential of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is +0.77V, and thus the reaction with gaseous hydrogen is indeed expected to proceed under standard conditions. If the reaction you're referring to are the reduction of other metal oxides with hydrogen, then be aware that as long as the overall redox potential isn't too negative, some reaction can still occur with heat and at higher than standard molarities, it's only a matter of the % yield at equilibrium. </p>
              <p>Regarding concentrated nitric acid :</p>
              <p>This is because both the cation H+ and the anion NO3- are strong oxidizing agents, and when both are present in high molarities, can work together to oxidize even relatively unreactive metals (ie. with low or slightly negative oxidation potentials).</p>
              <p>The NO3- in nitric(V) acid (ie. with nitrogen having the maximum OS of +5) can be reduced to species such as HNO2 (OS of +3) or NH4+ (OS of -3).</p>
              <p>For an even more powerful oxidizing agent, which can oxidize even gold and platinum (which are even less reactive than copper), see Aqua regia :</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_regia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_regia</a></p>
              <p>The chemistry of Aqua regia involves both redox as well as coordination complex reactions, and can be used by Cambridge to craft an excellent and challenging H2 Chemistry A level exam qn.</p>

              <p>Even more toxic and terrifying, is hydrofluoric acid HF. It's legendary toxicity (if you get a single drop of hydrofluoric acid on your finger, you may need to amputate your entire arm immediately or risk dying a horrifying death) is not due to its (weak) acidity, but due to its biochemically disruptive properties.</p>
