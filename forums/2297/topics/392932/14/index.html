                                                  <p>To elaborate further on your original qn, why "give more than one electron to the same oxygen atom when allocating the 3- charge" :<br><br>For an O atom to have a dinegative formal charge without violating it's octet configuration (since O is in period 2 and does not have vacant, energetically accessible 3d orbitals to accomodate an expanded octet), it would have to have 4 lone pairs, and 0 bond pairs, ie. the oxide O2- anion. Obviously, such a species can not be part of a polyatomic species, but stands alone as a monoatomic ion.<br><br>To address your new qn :<br><br>A dative covalent bond is really just a normal bond. The idea of 'dative' bonding is flawed and misguided. It is caused by physical and inorganic chemists being more lazy than organic chemists (specifically in this particular regard). The organic chemist's approach of not using the dative bond arrowhead symbol, is actually more correct. Afterall, a dative bond arrowhead is really nothing more than a mini-mechanism (for which an organic chemist would draw two stages, using curved arrows).<br><br>Next, assuming you draw your structure as a unipositive formal charged P atom singly bonded to 4 uninegatively formally charged O atoms (ie. your dative bonding version), that's fine as well, and is indeed one of the resonance contributors that contribute to the actual structure, termed as the resonance hybrid.<br><br>In other words, in the multiple resonance contributors possible, each O atom 'takes turn' to become doubly bonded with no formal charge. Hence in the resonance hybrid, the magnitude of negative charge on each O atom, is somewhere between 0 and 1-, and the central P atom bears a significant partial positive charge, due to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span></strong> the induction effect and resonance effect.<br><br>Similarly, the fact that carbonyl C atom of aldehydes and ketones bear a significant partial positive charge and are hence significantly electrophile, is actually due to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span></strong> induction effect and resonance effect, and not just because of induction effect, as many JCs oversimplify and erroneously teach to H2 Chem students.</p>
                                                  <p>Lastly, you should always draw the Kekule structure first (what some JCs call the Lewis structure, and what Cambridge calls the displayed structural formula), and then redraw it as a dot-and-cross diagram. For dot-and-cross diagrams, do not indicate formal charges, because the positive formal charge looks like a cross. But as long as it is not a dot-and-cross diagram, you should always indicate all formal charges (either before or after dative bond formation, depending on whether metal atoms are present or not; if metal atoms are present, eg. in complex ions, then OS is more accurate than formal charges, and in such case OS is equivalent to formal charges before the dative bonds were formed, ie. negative formal charges on the ligands instead of the metal ion, since metals are electropositive and ligands are more electronegative).</p>

                                                  <p>As an aid. Coz dot-and-cross structures are (quite frankly) childish, a remnant from the little days of the 'O' levels. We do not use dot-and-cross structures in the University. Hence, drawing Kekule structures (ie. displayed structural formulae) should become 2nd nature for all 'A' level students, and only if the exam question requires it, then you convert it (by drawing next to the Kekule structure) to a dot-and-cross diagram.<br><br>When converting Kekule structures to dot-and-cross diagrams, bear in mind the following :<br><br>1) A dative bond must be represented by either a dot-dot or cross-cross. Cambridge will penalize you for drawing a dative bond arrowhead in a dot-and-cross diagram (ie. the way you would do it for a Kekule structure).<br><br>2) An anion must have a hollow dot, to represent the additional electron gained from (what used to be) the cation, which is usually a metal.<br><br>For instance, in the nitrate(V) ion, NO3-, there are two singly bonded O atoms with a uninegative formal charge each. One of these singly bonded O atoms gained this uninegative formal charge because it accepted a dative bond (ie. dot-dot or cross-cross bond pair), while the other singly bonded O atom gained the uninegative formal charge from the loss of a proton (H+ ion) from it's conjugate acid form of HNO3, and it is this singly bonded (non-dative bond, so use a dot-cross for this bond) O atom that will contain a hollow dot in one of its lone pairs. The hollow dot represents an electron from the H atom, before the H+ ion dissociated.<br><br>In heterolytic bond cleavage, the bond pair becomes a lone pair on the more electronegative atom, which is why when a proton is transferred from an acid to a base, the curved arrows are from the base to the acid, and the proton's old bond pair becoming a lone pair on the O atom of the conjugate base (assuming it's an oxoacid).</p>

              <p><em>Is it chemically correct to write, "more branched structure"?</em></p>
              <p>UltimaOnline replied :</p>
              <p>It's even more chemically correct to write, "a more extensively branched isomeric structure".<br style="clear: both;"></p>
              <p>Kickme asked :</p>
              <p><em>Would the following statement to answer why a particular structure has a lower boiling point be correct? <br><br>A, having a more extensive branched isomeric structure as compared to B has a more spherical electron cloud which reduces the surface area for induced dipole-induced dipole(id-id) interactions, resulting in weaker id-id interactions which require less energy to overcome.</em></p>
              <p>UltimaOnline replied :</p>
              <p>Yes that's fine, but the correct term required by Cambridge (don't trust Singapore JCs) is "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">instantaneous dipole - induced dipole</span></strong>", and the full term is "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">instantaneous dipole - induced dipole London dispersion van der Waals</span></strong>" forces or interactions.</p>

              <p>UltimaOnline replied :</p>
              <p>Yes that's fine, but specify covalent or ionic. <br><br>Did you know??? (ie. more stuff that Singapore JCs do not teach you)<br><br>There's a technical difference between "energy" and "enthalpy", but for 'A' level Chem purposes and for most reactions to 3 sig fig, these two terms may be used interchangeably.<br><br>Energy change is heat change under constant volume.<br>Enthalpy change is heat change under constant pressure.<br><br>For some reactions, there can be a significant difference between enthalpy change and energy change. For instance, in the exothermic reaction of reacting an acid with a metal carbonate, since some heat energy will be used up by the liberated CO2 to do work to push away atmospheric gases, enthalpy change will be slightly less exothermic compared to energy change.<br><br>Did you know???<br><br>There are actually two types of "lattice energy/enthalpy", one endothermic, one exothermic.<br><br>The energy/enthalpy associated with the breaking of ionic bonds is more correctly called "endothermic lattice dissociation energy/enthalpy".<br><br>The energy/enthalpy associated with the forming of ionic bonds is more correctly called "exothermic lattice formation energy/enthalpy".<br><br>There are actually two types of "covalent bond energy/enthalpy", one endothermic, one exothermic.<br><br>The energy/enthalpy associated with the breaking of covalent bonds is more correctly called "endothermic bond dissociation energy/enthalpy".<br><br>The energy/enthalpy associated with the forming of covalent bonds is more correctly called "exothermic bond formation energy/enthalpy".<br><br>Cambridge, by default, is referring to "endothermic bond dissociation energy/enthalpy" when asking about covalent "bond energy".

              <p>[Singapore] - Millionaire Medical Doctor dying of Cancer at 40</p>
              <p><em>Below is the transcript of the talk of Dr. Richard Teo, who is a 40-year-old millionaire and cosmetic surgeon with a stage-4 terminal lung cancer and came to share with the D1 class his life experience on 19-Jan-2012.</em></p>
              <p>Hi good morning to all of you. My voice is a bit hoarse, so please bear with me. I thought I'll just introduce myself. My name is Richard, I'm a medical doctor. And I thought I'll<br>just share some thoughts of my life. It's my pleasure to be invited by prof. Hopefully, it can get you thinking about how... as you pursue this.. embarking on your training to become dental surgeons, to think about other things as well.</p>
              <p>Since young, I am a typical product of today's society. Relatively successful product that society requires.. From young, I came from a below average family. I was told by the media... and people around me that happiness is about success. And that success is about being wealthy. With this mind-set, I've always be extremely competitive, since I was young.</p>
              <p>Not only do I need to go to the top school, I need to have success in all fields. Uniform groups, track, everything. I needed to get trophies, needed to be successful, I needed to have colours award, national colours award, everything. So I was highly competitive since young. I went on to medical school, graduated as a doctor. Some of you may know that within the medical faculty, ophthalmology is one of the most highly sought after specialities. So I went after that as well. I was given a traineeship in ophthalmology, I was also given a research scholarship by NUS to develop lasers to treat the eye.</p>
              <p>So in the process, I was given 2 patents, one for the medical devices, and another for the lasers. And you know what, all this academic achievements did not bring me any wealth. So once I completed my bond with MOH, I decided that this is taking too long, the training in eye surgery is just taking too long. And there's lots of money to be made in the private sector. If you're aware, in the last few years, there is this rise in aesthetic medicine. Tons of money to be made there. So I decided, well, enough of staying in institution, it's time to leave. So I quit my training halfway and I went on to set up my aesthetic clinic... in town, together with a day surgery centre.</p>
              <p>You know the irony is that people do not make heroes out average GP (general practitioner), family physicians. They don't. They make heroes out of people who are rich and famous. People who are not happy to pay $20 to see a GP, the same person have no qualms paying ten thousand dollars for a liposuction, 15 thousand dollars for a breast augmentation, and so on and so forth. So it's a no brainer isn't? Why do you want to be a gp? Become an aesthetic physician. So instead of healing the sick and ill, I decided that I'll become a glorified beautician. So, business was good, very good. It started off with waiting of one week, then became 3weeks, then one month, then 2 months, then 3 months. I was overwhelmed; there were just too many patients. Vanities are fantastic business. I employed one doctor, the second doctor, the 3rd doctor, the 4th doctor. And within the 1st year, we're already raking in millions. Just the 1st year. But never is enough because I was so obsessed with it. I started to expand into Indonesia to get all the rich Indonesian tai-tais who wouldn't blink an eye to have a procedure done. So life was really good.</p>
              <p>So what do I do with the spare cash. How do I spend my weekends? Typically, I'll have car club gatherings. I take out my track car, with spare cash I got myself a track car. We have car club gatherings. We'll go up to Sepang in Malaysia. We'll go for car racing. And it was my life. With other spare cash, what do i do? I get myself a Ferrari. At that time, the 458 wasn't out, it's just a spider convertible, 430. This is a friend of mine, a schoolmate who is a forex trader, a banker. So he got a red one, he was wanting all along a red one, I was getting the silver one.</p>
              <p>So what do I do after getting a car? It's time to buy a house, to build our own bungalows. So we go around looking for a land to build our own bungalows, we went around hunting. So how do i live my life? Well, we all think we have to mix around with the rich and famous. This is one of the Miss Universe. So we hang around with the beautiful, rich and famous. This by the way is an internet founder. So this is how we spend our lives, with dining and all the restaurants and Michelin Chefs you know.</p>
              <p>So I reach a point in life that I got everything for my life. I was at the pinnacle of my career and all. That's me one year ago in the gym and I thought I was like, having everything under control and reaching the pinnacle.</p>
              <p>Well, I was wrong. I didn't have everything under control. About last year March, I started to develop backache in the middle of nowhere. I thought maybe it was all the heavy squats I was doing. So I went to SGH, saw my classmate to do an MRI, to make sure it's not a slipped disc or anything. And that evening, he called me up and said that we found bone marrow replacement in your spine. I said, sorry what does that mean? I mean I know what it means, but I couldn't accept that. I was like “Are you serious?” I was still running around going to the gym you know. But we had more scans the next day, PET scans - positrons emission scans, they found that actually I have stage 4 terminal lung cancer. I was like "Whoa where did that come from?” It has already spread to the brain, the spine, the liver and the adrenals. And you know one moment I was there, totally thinking that I have everything under control, thinking that I've reached the pinnacle of my life. But the next moment, I have just lost it.</p>
              <p>This is a CT scan of the lungs itself. If you look at it, every single dot there is a tumour. We call this miliaries tumour. And in fact, I have tens of thousands of them in the lungs. So, I was told that even with chemotherapy, that I'll have about 3-4months at most. Did my life come crushing on, of course it did, who wouldn't? I went into depression, of course, severe depression and I thought I had everything.</p>
              <p>See the irony is that all these things that I have, the success, the trophies, my cars, my house and all. I thought that brought me happiness. But i was feeling really down, having severe depression. Having all these thoughts of my possessions, they brought me no joy. The thought of... You know, I can hug my Ferrari to sleep, no... No, it is not going to happen. It brought not a single comfort during my last ten months. And I thought they were, but they were not true happiness. But it wasn't. What really brought me joy in the last ten months was interaction with people, my loved ones, friends, people who genuinely care about me, they laugh and cry with me, and they are able to identify the pain and suffering I was going through. That brought joy to me, happiness. None of the things I have, all the possessions, and I thought those were supposed to bring me happiness. But it didn't, because if it did, I would have felt happy think about it, when I was feeling most down..</p>
              <p>You know the classical Chinese New Year that is coming up. In the past, what do I do? Well, I will usually drive my flashy car to do my rounds, visit my relatives, to show it off to my friends. And I thought that was joy, you know. I thought that was really joy. But do you really think that my relatives and friends, whom some of them have difficulty trying to make ends meet, that will truly share the joy with me? Seeing me driving my flashy car and showing off to them? No, no way. They won’t be sharing joy with me. They were having problems trying to make ends meet, taking public transport. In fact i think, what I have done is more like you know, making them envious, jealous of all I have. In fact, sometimes even hatred.</p>
              <p>Those are what we call objects of envy. I have them, I show them off to them and I feel it can fill my own pride and ego. That didn't bring any joy to these people, to my friends and relatives, and I thought they were real joy.</p>
              <p>Well, let me just share another story with you. You know when I was about your age, I stayed in king Edward VII hall. I had this friend whom I thought was strange. Her name is Jennifer, we're still good friends. And as I walk along the path, she would, if she sees a snail, she would actually pick up the snail and put it along the grass patch. I was like why do you need to do that? Why dirty your hands? It’s just a snail. The truth is she could feel for the snail. The thought of being crushed to death is real to her, but to me it's just a snail. If you can't get out of the pathway of humans then you deserve to be crushed, it’s part of evolution isn't it? What an irony isn't it?</p>
              <p>There I was being trained as a doctor, to be compassionate, to be able to empathise; but I couldn't. As a house officer, I graduated from medical school, posted to the oncology department at NUH. And, every day, every other day I witness death in the cancer department. When I see how they suffered, I see all the pain they went through. I see all the morphine they have to press every few minutes just to relieve their pain. I see them struggling with their oxygen breathing their last breath and all. But it was just a job. When I went to clinic every day, to the wards every day, take blood, give the medication but was the patient real to me? They weren't real to me. It was just a job, I do it, I get out of the ward, I can't wait to get home, I do my own stuff.</p>
              <p>Was the pain, was the suffering the patients went through real? No. Of course I know all the medical terms to describe how they feel, all the suffering they went through. But in truth, I did not know how they feel, not until I became a patient. It is until now; I truly understand how they feel. And, if you ask me, would I have been a very different doctor if I were to re-live my life now, I can tell you yes I will. Because I truly understand how the patients feel now. And sometimes, you have to learn it the hard way.</p>
              <p>Even as you start just your first year, and you embark this journey to become dental surgeons, let me just challenge you on two fronts.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, all of you here will start to go into private practice. You will start to accumulate wealth. I can guarantee you. Just doing an implant can bring you thousands of dollars, it's fantastic money. And actually there is nothing wrong with being successful, with being rich or wealthy, absolutely nothing wrong. The only trouble is that a lot of us like myself couldn't handle it.</p>
              <p>Why do I say that? Because when I start to accumulate, the more I have, the more I want. The more I wanted, the more obsessed I became. Like what I showed you earlier on, all I can was basically to get more possessions, to reach the pinnacle of what society did to us, of what society wants us to be. I became so obsessed that nothing else really mattered to me. Patients were just a source of income, and I tried to squeeze every single cent out of these patients.</p>
              <p>A lot of times we forget, whom we are supposed to be serving. We become so lost that we serve nobody else but just ourselves. That was what happened to me. Whether it is in the medical, the dental fraternity, I can tell you, right now in the private practice, sometimes we just advise patients on treatment that is not indicated. Grey areas. And even though it is not necessary, we kind of advocate it. Even at this point, I know who are my friends and who genuinely cared for me and who are the ones who try to make money out of me by selling me "hope". We kind of lose our moral compass along the way. Because we just want to make money.</p>
              <p>Worse, I can tell you, over the last few years, we bad mouth our fellow colleagues, our fellow competitors in the industry. We have no qualms about it. So if we can put them down to give ourselves an advantage, we do it. And that's what happening right now, medical, dental everywhere. My challenge to you is not to lose that moral compass. I learnt it the hard way, I hope you don't ever have to do it.</p>
              <p>Secondly, a lot of us will start to get numb to our patients as we start to practise. Whether is it government hospitals, private practice, I can tell you when I was in the hospital, with stacks of patient folders, I can't wait to get rid of those folders as soon as possible; I can't wait to get patients out of my consultation room as soon as possible because there is just so many, and that's a reality. Because it becomes a job, a very routine job. And this is just part of it. Do I truly know how the patient feels back then? No, I don't. The fears and anxiety and all, do I truly understand what they are going through? I don't, not until when this happens to me and I think that is one of the biggest flaws in our system.</p>
              <p>We’re being trained to be healthcare providers, professional, and all and yet we don't know how exactly they feel. I'm not asking you to get involved emotionally, I don't think that is professional but do we actually make a real effort to understand their pain and all? Most of us won’t, alright, I can assure you. So don't lose it, my challenge to you is to always be able to put yourself in your patient's shoes.</p>
              <p>Because the pain, the anxiety, the fear are very real even though it's not real to you, it's real to them. So don't lose it and you know, right now I'm in the midst of my 5th cycle of my chemotherapy. I can tell you it’s a terrible feeling. Chemotherapy is one of those things that you don't wish even your enemies to go through because it's just suffering, lousy feeling, throwing out, you don't even know if you can retain your meals or not. Terrible feeling! And even with whatever little energy now I have, I try to reach out to other cancer patients because I truly understand what pain and suffering is like. But it's kind of little too late and too little.</p>
              <p>You guys have a bright future ahead of you with all the resource and energy, so I’m going to challenge you to go beyond your immediate patients. To understand that there are people out there who are truly in pain, truly in hardship. Don’t get the idea that only poor people suffer. It is not true. A lot of these poor people do not have much in the first place, they are easily contented. for all you know they are happier than you and me but there are out there, people who are suffering mentally, physically, hardship, emotionally, financially and so on and so forth, and they are real. We choose to ignore them or we just don't want to know that they exist.</p>
              <p>So do think about it alright, even as you go on to become professionals and dental surgeons and all. That you can reach out to these people who are in need. Whatever you do can make a large difference to them. I'm now at the receiving end so I know how it feels, someone who genuinely care for you, encourage and all. It makes a lot of difference to me. That’s what happens after treatment. I had a treatment recently, but I’ll leave this for another day. A lot of things happened along the way, that's why I am still able to talk to you today.</p>
              <p>I'll just end of with this quote here, it's from this book called Tuesdays with Morris, and some of you may have read it. Everyone knows that they are going to die; every one of us knows that. The truth is, none of us believe it because if we did, we will do things differently. When I faced death, when I had to, I stripped myself off all stuff totally and I focused only on what is essential. The irony is that a lot of times, only when we learn how to die then we learn how to live. I know it sounds very morbid for this morning but it's the truth, this is what I’m going through.</p>
              <p>Don’t let society tell you how to live. Don’t let the media tell you what you're supposed to do. Those things happened to me. And I led this life thinking that these are going to bring me happiness. I hope that you will think about it and decide for yourself how you want to live your own life. Not according to what other people tell you to do, and you have to decide whether you want to serve yourself, whether you are going to make a difference in somebody else's life. Because true happiness doesn't come from serving yourself. I thought it was but it didn't turn out that way. With that I thank you, if you have any questions you have for me, please feel free. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Aleoca333 asked :</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                <p>Does Gibbs free energy have anything to do with shifting of POE (position of equilibrium)? A negative G means POE lies very much to the right of reaction?</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p><br>Yes that's right.</p>
                                <p>But beware the difference between delta G (Gibbs free energy) and delta G-standard (standard Gibbs free energy).</p>
                                <p>Delta G-standard = - n x F x cell potential</p>
                                <p>and Delta G-standard = - R x T x ln K</p>
                                <p>Notice that in both formulae above, we can relate standard Gibbs free energy of any reaction, to it's equilibrium constant (K or Kc or Kp) and to its cell potential (cell potential = reduction potential @ cathode + oxidation potential @ anode).</p>
                                <p>When cell potential is positive, we say the reaction is thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous, and the current flows in the predicted direction from our designated anode to our designated cathode. The more positive the cell potential, the more the position of equilibrium lies to the right. The more negative the cell potential, the more the position of equilibrium lies to the left.</p>
                                <p>When delta G-standard &lt; 0, then Kc &gt; 1 and the reaction is product favoured.</p>
                                <p>When delta G-standard = 0, then Kc = 1 and the reaction is neither reactant nor product favoured.</p>
                                <p>When delta G-standard &gt; 0, then Kc &lt; 1 and the reaction is reactant favoured.</p>
                                <p> </p>

                                <p> <br>Yes of course (to both your questions).</p>
                                <p>As an example, lets look at aldehydes and ketones.</p>
                                <p>The carbonyl C atom of ketones and aldehydes have a partial positive charge, due to both induction (O being more electronegative than C, consequently the resonance hybrid has a partial positive charge on the C atom, and a partial negative charge on the O atom) as well as by resonance (the pi bond can delocalize onto the O atom as a lone pair, resulting in a resonance contributor which has a unipositive formal charge on the C atom and a uninegative formal charge on the O atom, consequently the resonance hybrid has a partial positive charge on the C atom, and a partial negative charge on the O atom). Hence the electrophilic atom is the carbonyl C atom, within the electrophile molecule of ketones and aldehydes.</p>
                                <p>In CarboCations (ie. C atom with a 3 bond pairs, 0 lone pairs; 3 + 0 = 3 but since C is in Group IV, hence) the C atom has a unipositive formal charge.<br>In CarbAnions (ie. C atom with a 3 bond pairs, 1 lone pair; 3 + 2 =5 but since C is in Group IV, hence) the C atom has a uninegative formal charge.<br>  <br>The conjugate base of water, the (uninegative ionic charged) hydroxide ion, has a uninegative formal charge on the O atom (ie. O atom with 1 bond pair, 3 lone pairs; 1 + 6 = 7 but since O is in Group VI, hence a uninegative formal charge).<br>The conjugate acid of water, the (unipositive ionic charged) hydroxonium ion, has a unipositive formal charge on the O atom (ie. O atom with 3 bond pairs, 1 lone pair; 3 + 2 = 5 but since O is in Group VI, hence a unipositive formal charge).</p>
                                <p>Ionic charge is the sum of formal charges.</p>
                                <p>The fully protonated conjugate acid form of a diprotic diamine (ie. a molecule with 2 amine groups) has 2 N atoms with a unipositive formal charge, hence the ionic charge for this species, is dipositive (ie. 2+).</p>
                                <p>The fully deprotonated conjugate base form of a diprotic dicarboxylic acid (ie. a molecule with 2 carboxylic acid groups) has 2 O atoms with a uninegative formal charge, hence the ionic charge for this species, is dinegative (ie. 2-).</p>

And if a particular temperature is required, that must also be written in (eg. &gt; 60 deg C to obtain dinitrobenzene).<br><br>However, in some other industrial organic synthesis, due to the complex industrial machinery setup used (in which reflux apparatus is not appropriate and possibly even counter productive), only a particular temperature and catalyst must be specified, and "heat under reflux" should not be written.<br><br>H2 Chem students are required by the syllabus to memorize the large-scale industrial synthesis methods, which means that although in a small lab on a small scale synthesis, "heating under reflux" may be appropriate, but if the large-scale industrial method does not use "reflux", then you should not include "reflux" in your description.

"Reflux" must not be written for these reactions.<br><br>Generally, if asked to describe a simple test to distinguish between two organic compounds, in which the test is to be carried out on a small scale in test tubes, then "heat" must be written, and not "heat under reflux". Because that would require reflux apparatus, which cannot be connected to a test tube, and which would not constitute a "simple" test, and would be a (Cambridge) frowned-upon waste of resources.<br><br>In contrast, in answering a "design a synthesis pathway" question, to have a reasonably good yield of the product at equilibrium, especially if one or more of the reactants are volatile (ie. low boiling point), then "heat under reflux" must be written, and not just "heat" alone. Low yield syntheses as a result of lazy failure to use reflux apparatus, are a (Cambridge) frowned-upon waste of resources.<br><br>When in doubt (don't trust Singapore JC notes, as all 20 different JCs have significant differences in their notes across all topics), you should use reliable sources of H2 Chem study material to memorize the syllabus required descriptions, including when to write "heat" and when to write "heat under reflux".<br><br></p></div>

                                <p>First of all, don't (mis)use the term "discharge", which means "to remove a charge". Hence, while you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span></strong> say Cu2+ ions are discharged as they are reduced to Cu at the cathode, you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span></strong> say Cu atoms are being "discharged" as they are oxidized to Cu2+ at the anode, because they are now attaining a charge, not losing a charge.<br><br>Heck, just totally don't use the word "discharge" at all. Seriously.<br><br>Cambridge prefers you to phrase the answer as follows (notice there is no "discharge" in the answer) :<br><br>At the anode, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">copper metal is being oxidized since most of the anode itself is made up of copper</span></strong>. Cu(s) ---&gt; Cu2+(aq) + 2e-. (There are two reasons why you can't just oxidize only the zinc, and not oxidize the copper at all. Firstly, not all the zinc particles are on the exterior of the anode, some zinc particles are trapped in the interior of the anode and cannot be oxidized until the outer copper layers have oxidized away into the electrolyte solution. Secondly, the power supply is forcing the flow of electrons, which means the anode has no choice but to oxidize away whatever is available, or else the current can no longer flow and human civilization would be destroyed. There simply isn't enough zinc impurities to keep the current flowing at the rate determed by the power supply. So copper has no choice to but be oxidized en masse, together with the tiny bits of zinc, to keep the current flowing).<br><br>Little bits of metallic zinc impurities within the anode are also oxidized, since the oxidation potential of Zn to Zn2+ is more positive compared to the oxidation potential of Cu to Cu2+. Bits of metallic silver impurities at the anode, are not oxidized, because the oxidation potential of Ag to Ag+ is less positive compared to the oxidation potential of Cu to Cu2+.<br><br>While both Cu2+(aq) and Zn2+(aq) ions both migrate towards the cathode, however because the reduction potential of Cu2+ to Cu is significantly more positive, compared to the reduction potential of Zn2+ to Zn, hence the Cu2+ ions are preferentially reduced at the cathode, leaving the Zn2+ ions in the aqueous state in the electrolyte solution.<br><br>Consequently, the cathode now consists of pure copper, without either the less reactive silver impurities, or the more reactive zinc impurities, that were initially present at the anode.<br><br></p>

                                <p>Denaturation refers to the loss of a protein's intended biological function or activity, due to the disruption and loss of its original secondary and/or tertiary structures, as a result of any of the following : high temperatures, extreme pH, heavy metal ions, mechanical agitation, non-aqueous protic solvents.</p>
              
                                <p>If the question asks you in more detail about how each R group interaction is disrupted, you will need to go into more detailed explanations, diagrams or equations, eg. for how heavy metal ions disrupt ionic and disulfide bonds/bridges/linkages.</p>

              <p>With great difficulty. Ok seriously, these two are equations that will be much easier to handle by just memorizing the coefficients. Balancing them manually is too time consuming. Also, the chance that Cambridge will ask you to write out these balanced equations is not high, so if you find it difficult to memorize or balance, just skip this part.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p>You have difficulty balancing the equation when you add the spectator counter ions, because you're considering the Na+ counter cations; there is actually one other counter ion present - the NO3- counter anion (the coordination compound in Tollens' reagent is actually diamminesilver(I) nitrate).<br><br>To save yourself trouble, leave out the spectator counter ions, and only write in the participating ions.<br><br>FYI, the RJC Organic Chem book does teach students step-by-step how to balance both the Fehling's and Tollens' equations.<br><br>Yes, Cambridge accepts the name "Tollens' reagent", you do not need to write out the name or formula of the diamminesilver(I) nitrate active species present.

              <p>Silly school, sabotaging you students with counter-productive answers. That's why I always advise, don't over-trust in Singapore schools, nor over-rely on their notes.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three</span></strong> reasons why your school's instructions are silly (and downright risky) :<br><br>1) You're wasting valuable time under exam conditions, writing out unnecessarily long answers.<br><br>2) You're annoying the Cambridge marker (didn't your school teach that it's bad manners to annoy someone who's holding your 'A' level grades in his/her hands), because now he/she has to do more work to check your spelling and formulae, when all he/she wanted was a short and sweet "Tollens' reagent", so he/she can complete his/her marking workload sooner and return home earlier to a nice dinner with his/her loved ones.</p>
              <p>3) If you make a typo error (eg. for names such as bistartratocuprate(II)*, or formula such as [Ag(NH3)2]+, etc), you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span></strong> be penalized.<br>* Your school committed a grevious error, Fehling's solution <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">isn't</span></strong> copper(II) tartrate. The active species in Fehling's solution is the coordination compound <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">disodium dipotassium bistartratocuprate(II). </span></strong>See my point?</p>

              <p>Q1. <br>For the purpose of Inorganic Chem - Periodicity, eg. explaining trend of Melting Points across Period 3, you have to write them as S8, P4, Cl2, Ar, etc. This will enable you to explain why melting point decreases across the period :<br><strong>The greater the number of electrons present, and the larger the molecular size, hence the more polarizable the electron charge clouds, hence the greater the magnitude of (instantaneous and induced) dipoles and partial charges, hence the stronger the electrostatic attractions, and hence the stronger the intermolecular van der Waals forces of attraction (required to be overcome), and therefore the higher the melting and/or boiling point.</strong> <br><br>Q2.<br>At room temperature, the reaction will occur, but very slowly (ie. thermodynamically feasible, but kinetically non-feasible). Hence, for synthesis questions, you must specify "heat under reflux" for hydrolysis to occur at an acceptable rate. Heating speeds up the reaction by increasing the percentage of reactant particles with energy equals or exceeding the required activation energy.<br><br>Nonetheless, on a related note, consider this : upon mixing AgNO3(aq) and alkyl halides (dissolved in ethanol), nucleophilic substitution will occur at a significant rate at room temperature, even without heating. <br><br>This is due to the exothermic (hence thermodynamically favourable) coupling of the Ag+ silver ion with the X- halide ion, to generate the precipitate, which not only provides the activation energy required (hence also kinetically feasible), but also (as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle) shifts the position of equilibrium over to the right.<br><br>In fact, the time taken for the silver halide precipitate to be observed, is an important test in the H2 syllabus to differentiate between acyl halides and alkyl halides, and between the different akyl halides. (Notice that acyl and alkyl fluorides and generally fluorine compounds, behave exceptionally from the other halogens/halides, and are hence exempted from the H2 syllabus).<br><br>The candidate needs to be able to explain this in terms of covalent bond dissociation enthalpies, in turn due to the effectiveness of (head-on or end-on) orbital overlap to form the sigma bond, in turn due to the varying diffuseness of the varying valence quantum shell orbital used. <br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p>I'm having some misconception about the hybridisation of H2O <br>H2O has sp3 hybrid orbitals is it because that it does not have any pi bonds from the central atom to the terminal atoms?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For orbital hybridization, look at the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">electron geometry</span></strong>, not the molecular or ionic geometry.<br><br>(A further example would be ammonia : with 1 lone pair and 3 bond pairs, the electron geometry is tetrahedral and the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. Last example : the uninegative triiodide ion, I3-, has 3 lone pairs and 2 bond pairs on the central I atom, hence the electron geometry is trigonal bipyramidal, and the ionic geometry is linear, since lone pairs occupy the equatorial positions for trigonal bipyramidal electron geometry; but note that lone pairs occupy the axial positions for octahedral electron geometry.)<br><br>In water, the valence shell of the O atom has 2 lone pairs and 2 bond pairs. Hence, with 4 valence electron charge clouds, its electron geometry would be tetrahedral, as predicted by VSEPR theory (whose objective is to maximize stabilities by minimizing electron pair repulsions).<br> <br>If the O atom were to utilize its unhybridized orthogonal p orbitals to form its sigma bonds (via a head-on or end-on overlap with the s orbital of H), the H2O bond angles would be likewise orthogonal (ie. 90 deg). This would not be optimally stable, due to (guys only like girls, guys don't like guys) significant bond pair - bond pair repulsion.<br><br>Hence, in order to achieve the ideal tetrahedral bond angles, the O atom hybridizes its orbitals to achieve 4 equivalent sp3 orbitals which are 109.5 deg away from each other (assuming the guys are heterosexual, guys need a healthy amount of personal space between them and other guys, to maintain social stability). Of these four sp3 orbitals, 2 of them are fully filled (ie. lone pairs), and 2 of them are half-filled, which are therefore used to overlap head-on or end-on, with the s orbitals of the H atoms, to form the two sigma bonds in H2O.</p>
