                  He means that as compared to conjugation in straight chain, complete conjugation throughout a ring (with same no. of double bonds in the resonance contributors) confers greater stability (this is known as aromaticity). Why? Count the no. of partial double bonds in the resonance hybrid for straight chain vs ring.

                  Minor contributive point. Doesn't make it to the top 3 reasons.<p>And instead of overthinking and obsessing over conceptual stuff like these (which the rest of the Singapore JC cohort just memorize and move on, efficiently albeit blindly ; your desire to focus more deeply on understanding is commendable and serves you well up to a certain easy-to-accidentally-pass point, beyond which being anally obsessive is like missing the forest for the trees, allowing you to win the battle but lose the war), and you J2 students really ought to be practicing as many Prelim papers as you can right now. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">You'll be far better off (as far as your A level results and hence the quality of the rest of your life are concerned)</a> focusing on doing and asking about Pelim paper qns here, instead of OCDing about conceptual ideas too much.</p>

                  If you're a BedokFunland JC student, you'll be exam-smart enough to write out both answers, with qualifications, ie. "<i>If this solvent is used, this product is obtained ; if that solvent is used, that product is obtained</i>". Cambridge examiner will exclaim, "<i>Excellent student! Must be BedokFunland JC!</i>"

                              <p>Hi UltimaOnline,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've a few questions here to consult you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q1: IJC/09/P1/39</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In which sequence are the compounds listed in order of
              increasing ease of hydrolysis?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Choice 3 (chlorobenzene, chloromethane, chloroethane) is not a
              correct choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remarks: In ascertaining the ease of hydrolysis, I'll first have
              to see the C-X bond strength. Since it's the same in this choice,
              I'll have to consider either (I) Resonance within the reactant and
              (II) stability of the intermediate products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this case, shouldn't 3 also be correct? What's the difference
              in the electron donating effect between the methyl and ethyl
              substituent?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2: In relation to VJC/09/P1/29:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remarks: How do I establish the relative acidity of an alcohol
              (CH3CH2OH) to that of an acidic salt (CH3CH2NH3+Cl-)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3: VJC/09/P1/23</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remarks: It must have been my blind spot, but why is A not an
              acceptable answer as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you very much Ultima! </p>

              Hi Gohby, no prob.<p>Q1. The diff btwn Me and Et groups, is the stability (and hence Ea required) of the intermediate (if SN1) or transition state (if SN2). Et group is more strongly electron-donating by induction, which can better stabilize the intermediate or transition state.</p><p>Q2. Acidic salts (notice the adjective?) are always more acidic than alcohol (which is considered neutral, and even less acidic than neutral water).</p><p>Q3. A is the *only* acceptable answer. </p>

              OH- being a stronger nucleophile than H2O increases the rate of reaction (hydrolysis then ionic precipitation). But the reaction will still proceed (albeit a lot more slowly) at rtp and at neutral pH. The exothermic ionic precipitation shifts the position of equilibrium over to the RHS and makes the reaction thermodynamically feasible. But the kinetics is influenced by temperature and strength of nucleophile.

COO- vs COOO-, to explain why resonance delocalization of the negative formal charge is not possible in COOO-. Because unless it involves complete delocalization around a ring, ie. aromaticity, otherwise, lone pairs (in unhybridized p orbitals) cannot delocalize into being lone pairs on other atoms by resonance, lone pairs can only at most delocalize into pi bond pairs.</p><p>In the case of COOO-, the central O atom's lone pair occupying a unhybridized p orbital can indeed delocalize by resonance as a pi bond pair with the acyl sp2 C atom, which can indeed accept the pi bond pair (which happens in the resonance stabilized COO- conjugate base) without having to expand its octet (which it can't do so, being in period 2), because the C=O pi bond can simultaneously delocalize into a lone pair on the O atom.</p><p>However, the lone pair on the terminal O atom bearing the negative formal charge in the COOO- conjugate base, *cannot* at the same time delocalize by resonance to form a pi bond with the central O atom in any resonance contributor (ie. regardless of whether the central O atom has delocalized it's lone pair unto the acyl C atom or not), because the central O atom is unable to accommodate an expanded octet configuration (forcing the central O atom to accept a pi bond from the terminal O- atom will result in the central O atom having either 2 lone pairs + 3 bond pairs in a resonance contributor, or 1 lone pair + 4 bond pairs in another resonance contributor, which cannot be done because period 2 elements only have 1 x 2s orbital and 3 x 2p orbitals, and do not have vacant, energetically accessible 3d orbitals to accommodate an expanded octet).</p><p>If (like all other H2 students) you've no experience with drawing resonance contributors and hybrids, the above will be tough for you to understand. It's best if you get your school teacher or private tutor to draw them out for you.</p><p>Of course, Cambridge will be delighted if you are able to do so (ie. draw out the resonance contributors and hybrids) as part of your explanation, but at the very least, giving your school's (ie. Singapore JCs') simpler answer will be sufficient to obtain the 1 mark for this question. No worries, when the question goes beyond the H2 syllabus and it's not fair to everyone*, it's still fair : it's a bell-curve afterall.</p><p>*Of course, H3 Chem, Olympiad Chem, and BedokFunland JC students will know how to draw out resonance contributors and hybrids. It's still fair because they've put in additional effort to understand Chem deeper. Why else join H3 Chem, Olympiad Chem, and BedokFunland JC?</p>

                      Your school teacher's answer and your own answer are both incomplete. You also need to define what a chiral carbon is, and/or what an optically active molecule entails, as part of your answer.

                                Q3a) Instead of blindly memorizing and applying a mathematical formula, use common sense. For a uninegatively charged species : when mass is 37g, deflection is merely -1 degrees. Hence when mass is 1g (ie. much lighter), deflection should concordantly be -37 degrees (ie. larger magnitude deflected). Since mass of He is 4g, hence deflection should be -9.25 degrees (if uninegatively charged). Since He nuclei is dipositively charged, hence deflection should be +18.5 degrees.</p><p>Q3d) Bond length here is only indirectly relevant (since bond length is inversely proportional to bond strength, <i>ceteris paribus</i>).

              Cambridge was unfortunately somewhat ambiguous in this MCQ. Instead of "unbranched", Cambridge meant (and should have used the more correct term) "acyclic". As such, this TYS question required you to draw the acyclic isomeric form (below left). Being acyclic with 1 degree of unsaturation, you can deduce the double bond is C=O, since the question specified no C=C present. Hence, the answer to this MCQ is 5 mol of Na, 2.5 mol of H2.<p><img src="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/introduction-to-chemistry-general-organic-and-biological/section_19/5df38314007b0d4b2339d3c3b62022c2.jpg"></p><p>Source : <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/introduction-to-chemistry-general-organic-and-biological/s19-04-cyclic-structures-of-monosacch.html">http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/introduction-to-chemistry-general-organic-and-biological/s19-04-cyclic-structures-of-monosacch.html</a></p>

              Enols exist in equilibrium with their prototropic tautomer, ketones / aldehydes. Draw the mechanism (either neutral pH or acid catalysed, up to you) to prototropically tautomerize ethenol to its carbonyl tautomer, ethanal.<p>As a challenging A grade question (which I will not provide the answer here, go ask your school teacher or private tutor), Cambridge may ask you to explain where the position of equilibrium lies, and (more challengingly) exactly why.

                  For f, since deltaH = deltaH2 - deltaH3 + deltaH(H2O), am i correct
                  to say that residual heat from experiment 1 (hcl+naoh) causes the
                  temperature change for experiment 2 (mg+hcl) to be higher than
                  expected, making the value more exothermic. Furthermore, heat lost
                  to the surroundings (mgo+hcl) causes the temperature
                  change for experiment 3 to be lower than expected, making
                  the value less exothermic. I feel that my answers are contradicting
                  themselves as there should be residual heat from both experiment 1
                  and 2 causing the enthalpy change for 3 to be incorrect.</span></p>

                  f) The discrepancy is due to the differing state symbol of water. In the experiment, it's H2O(g). In the calculations, it's H2O(l).<p>g) Since the enthalpy change of hydration applies equally for both alternative intermediate steps in our enthalpy cycle generating [Mg(H2O)n]2+(aq), they in effect cancel out (when applying Hess' Law) and hence does not affect our enthalpy change calculations of Mg to MgO.</p>

                                <p>Regarding Q3 (VJC/09/P1/23), What's wrong with choice B in
                                fulfilling all the conditions? It reacts with bromine because of
                                the C=C bond, it has 2 Cl substituents which will become 2 alcohol
                                groups in the presence of hot alkaline and it reacts with PCl5
                                because of the carboxylic acid.</p>
                                <p>2014/HCI/P1/Q40</p>
                                <p>Which site gets deprotonated first? I'd have thought that in a
                                neutralisation reaction with a base the most acidic component will
                                be deprotonated first (i.e. the NH3+), followed by the COOH not
                                connected to the CH2, followed by the last COOH. Is my
                                understanding correct? (the answer scheme suggests otherwise)</p>

                                    <p>How to derive half life? Since it's a first order reaction, I
                                    know k = (ln2)/half-life.</p>
                                    <p>I know that 10 mins into reaction, Pa + Pb = 600Pa,</p>
                                    <p>And at the end of reaction, Pa + Pb = 400Pa.</p>
                                    <p>What should I do with the data given?</p>

                                    At end of reaction, partial pressure of B is 400 Pa. Hence initial partial pressure of A is 800 Pa. Hence, 1 half-life into the reaction, partial pressure of A is 400 Pa, and B is 200 Pa. That's a total pressure of 600 Pa. Hence, each half-life must be 10 min. Since half-life = ln 2 / k, hence k = ln 2 / half-life, which is calculated out to be 0.0693 min-1.<p>For A level purposes, such questions will be kept mathematically simple (such as in this case), to avoid necessitating the use of calculus and integrated rate laws.</p><p>A possible (but still kept mathematically simple) extension of the above question would be : modifying the total pressure after 10 min to 500 Pa (instead of 600 Pa), then what would the half-life be?</p>

                                    Aromaticity resists hydrogenation. For A level purposes, unless hinted by the question with extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, you are to take it that the benzene ring does not get hydrogenated under normal reaction conditions required to hydrogenate or reduce other organic functional groups.

              If CF3 radical, then trigonal pyramidal. If CH3 radical, then trigonal planar. Reasons for the difference are beyond the H2 syllabus (<i>a hint for A grade students : ask yourself what possible thermodynamic advantage could a CH3 radical gain by adopting sp2 hybridization, versus what possible thermodynamic advantage could a CF3 radical gain by adopting sp3 hybridization, taking into consideration the contrasting natures of s and p orbitals</i>), go ask your school teacher or private tutor if you're interested.<p>Cambridge is reasonable. As long as you give chemically reasonable justifications for your answer, Cambridge (in most cases) will accept a variety of reasonable answers (eg. a range for bond angles, explanation &amp; justification for either geometry for either radical), especially for beyond-syllabus questions such as these.

                  Most carboxylate salts are basic enough, but here the 3 Cl atoms are collectively strongly electron-withdrawing by induction, resulting in the CCl3COO- ion being too weak a base to undergo significant hydrolysis.

              Correct. This is a really lousy question set by Cambridge. The question should specify "sigma bonds", because all 4 bonds specified actually have partial double bond character in the molecule's resonance hybrid, ie. sp2-sp2 sigma bonding, with partial p-p pi bonding for all 4 bonds.

                                    The trickiness of this question (other than the disulfide bond / linkage / bridge), is that the last amino acid residue gly's COOH terminus has been acylated (ie. biochemically catalyzed nucleophilic acyl substitution, addition-elimination, condensation) with NH3 to generate a terminal amide, which Cambridge deliberately employed to confuse students as to whether or not to begin with Gly or Cys as the N terminus.<p>This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification">post-translational modification of proteins (H2 Biology)</a>. Since NH3 isn't an amino acid, the C terminus remains as Gly, and hence the only correct acceptable answer is to begin with the correct N terminus, ie. Cys.</p><p>Yes, Cambridge will accept either phenol or amine as the answer. Don't be confused : phenol and amine exist in equilibrium with phenoxide and ammonium respectively, it doesn't mean at pH 7, phenol is completely deprotonated (it's not), or that amine is completely protonated (it's not). That's why Ka and Kb values exist, to describe the position of equilibrium and extent of hydrolysis for acidic and basic groups. </p>

                                    Sekali it's not totally colorless, but only looks colorless coz it's a dilute solution, then how?<p><br>            </p><blockquote>

                              <p>err.. so do we take Volume of KMnO4 to turn soln into a
              permanent pink color, minus 1cm3 ? since that 1 extra drop is in
              excess</p>

              No. Becoz in titration, no matter how many drops (and each drop isn't exactly 1cm3 in the first place) you use to reach endpoint, the moles of titrant used will always technically be either slightly before, or slightly after, the equivalence point anyway.<p>So if you minus 1 drop, your moles of titrant used will be slightly before equivalence point. If you don't minus 1 drop, your moles of titrant used will be slightly after equivalence point. Since either way it'll be slightly inaccurate (can't be helped), so it makes more sense to just use the titre volume to reach endpoint, without further complicating errors by minusing away 1 drop.</p><p>Now you understand why we call this 'endpoint' instead of 'equivalence point'? Endpoint merely approximates equivalence point.
