              <b>Considering only the 1st proton dissociation (ie. regardless of proticity), ie. magnitude of Ka1 value, H2SO4 is a stronger acid compared to H2SO3, just as HNO3 is a stronger acid compared to HNO2, which is indeed expected and concordant to the general trend of acidic strength in any given series of oxoacids. However, bucking the trend are the oxoacids of phosphorus, in which H3PO3 is actually a stronger acid compared to H3PO4. There are actually 2 independent reasons for this unusual behavior, the combined effect of both, outweighs the expected general trend for oxoacid families (I assume you know how to explain the much easier within-H2-Chemistry-syllabus question of why H2SO4 is stronger than H2SO3, and why HNO3 is stronger than HNO2... do you?).

                  diazomethane,CH2N2.</p>

                  <p>Am i right to say that in the first step of the mechanism,CH2N2
                  deprotonates RCO2H to form RCOO- and CH3N2 respectively?And then
                  subsequently the C-N bond in CH3N2 breaks and the bond pair is
                  donated to positive charged N atom to form N2,before the RCOO-

                  Almost correct, but your described mechanism would be 3 steps, when Cambridge already specified 2 steps. The reason for this is the instability of the methyl carbocation, which is why the next step (after the proton transfer) is SN2, not SN1. Ideally, for the student to demonstrate a correct understanding of this reaction, both resonance contributors of diazomethane should be drawn, with the student showing to Cambridge that he/she knows which resonance contributor more appropriately functions as the Bronsted-Lowry base in the 1st step of the reaction mechanism.

              Ellipsisss of HCJC,<p>
              Here are my comments on your attempted answers.</p><p>
              For Q1, your order of basicity is wrong, and your explanation has multiple errors (including an internal inconsistency, prolly just ur careless typo), and a word of advice : for A levels, never use "it", but specify exactly which, otherwise Cambridge will think you're trying to smoke your way through and you'll kena penalized (even if your answer is otherwise correct). Hint : your answer would be somewhat less wrong (but there are still errors) for a typical alpha-amino acid, but Histidine happens to be anomalous amongst alpha-amino acids (this is afterall a BedokFunland JC Challenge, ie. difficult even for A grade students, and for some private tutors and school teachers as well), but still totally explainable, if you understand your chemistry well enough. You can 'cheat' a little and google out where the 3 pKa values belong, and thus 'reverse engineer' the basicity of the 3 N atoms (the least basic N atom doesn't even have a Kb value, if Cambridge asks why, do you know how to explain?).</p><p>
              Q2. Correct, well done. More than half of all JC H2 students wouldn't know how to solve this.
              </p><p>
              Q3. Ok, I was admittedly being unfairly sadistic in setting this question, as the pH values for the more extreme ends of the titration cannot be correctly obtained by using the A level acid-base equilibria within-syllabus methods, which are only approximations that fail when dealing with fairly strong acids and bases. In addition, do note that if the initial molarity of the acid or base is not sufficiently larger than the change in molarity (ie. as indicated by the magnitude of the relevant Ka or Kb value), it becomes inaccurate and indeed invalid to neglect the change in molarity, and to simply approximate equilibrium molarity back to initial (as taught by Singapore JCs, and as you had done in some of your calculations). But no worries, Cambridge probably wouldn't be as sadistic, and would also usually set initial molarities to be much larger than the change, so you usually wouldn't need to solve quadratic or cubic equations for H2 Chemistry (though all students should still bring 2 calculators as a backup, a non-graphing and a graphing). So as far as A levels are involved, very well done, your titration pH values are mostly correct.
              </p><p>
              Q4.
              Correct, well done. Most Singapore JC students are confused by the effect of temperature change on the Gibbs free energy change value VERSUS the equilibrium constant Kc value, because they simplistically assume that the larger the Kc value, the more negative the Gibbs free energy change. This is only true for constant temperature. When temperature changes, you must consider both the enthalpy and entropy changes. The effect of temperature on Kc is controlled by the enthalpy change, while the effect of temperature on Gibbs free energy change is controlled by the entropy change. Interested A grade H2 students, H3 students and Olympiad students, can explore this aspect of thermodynamics deeper for themselves, including the Van 't Hoff equation.
              </p><p>
              Q5. Almost correct, but not quite. Did it not occur to you that the decarboxylation (both with and without enzyme catalyst) is kinetically feasible only due to the zwitterionic nature of amino acids? An intermediate with a uninegative formal charge on a C atom that is not delocalized by resonance is prohibitively destabilizing making your mechanism kinetically unfeasible. On a related note : writing C- or H- for Grignard reagents and LiAlH4, is an oversimplification, and does not actually exist as an intermediate, but only as a transition state (so to speak). On another related note : investigate the mechanism for decarboxylation of beta-keto-carboxylic acids (which Cambridge used in a Singapore TYS Qn) followed by prototropic tautomerism, notice there is no C- intermediate there either.
              </p><p>
              Overall, a very good attempt by Ellipsisss of HCJC, you should be able to get your A grade if you don't screw up your remaining P2, P3 and P1.</p>

              Excellent recommendation by CKTR!<p>
              The ACJC 2017 prelim papers certainly belong to the upper difficulty tier of 2017 prelim papers, together with RJC / VJC / DHS / SRJC etc.

              Indeed in some ways, this might be just be my favorite set of 2017 prelim papers, due to it's multiple extensive questioning (ie. 5 questions across P2 &amp; P3) of unfamiliar (ie. not taught within the H2 syllabus) curved-arrow electron-flow reaction mechanisms, which as some of you might know, is in line with BedokFunland JC style (ie. I would be utterly delighted if the actual Singapore A Level exam papers used the ACJC 2017 prelim papers).

              So all JC2 students serious about scoring a distinction grade, be sure you thoroughly go through this upper-tier set of ACJC / RJC / VJC / DHS / SRJC papers before next week's P2 &amp; P3. Any questions post em here.

                                            To be precise, "accepts... from", not "forms... with". But bear in mind I- is an anion, and the adduct is an anion, so for dot-and-cross diagrams (if required), while the dative bond should still be shown with a dot-dot or cross-cross, a hollow-dot (ie. electron accepted from the species which reduced 1/2 I2 to the I- reactant, presumed to be the counter-cation present throughout, eg. K+) must be clearly shown as part of a lone pair in both the I- reactant and I3- product.<p>
                                        Yes, of course (isn't it obvious why the ionic geometry of the adduct is linear?), Cambridge can certainly ask you to draw out the full mechanism (in which case no 'dative' arrowhead bonds should be shown anywhere in the product, just a curved arrow from the I- or Br- nucleophile to the I2 electrophile, then all straight lines (ie. normal bonds) in the product, any 'dative' arrowhead bonds shown will be penalized), as this mechanism is already much easier than the other ones asked in 2017 ACJC Prelim papers.

                                            The conceptual basics (eg. trend of redox potentials), yes. The technical details (eg. memorization of equations), no. But distinction A grade students are indeed expected to be exposed beyond the syllabus, and/or are expected to be intelligent enough to figure out the reaction, equation and products (eg. using Data Booklet for hints) even without prior exposure. So yes, Cambridge can indeed ask on these not-in-syllabus reactions, although Cambridge would probably be a little kinder, and give slightly more hints than Singapore JC prelim papers.

              Ellipsisss, here's a chance for your 'redemption' (you were game enough to attempt my earlier BedokFunland JC Challenge Qn, but as I said, I'll only reveal the answers for such Challenge Qns to my own BedokFunland JC students, so I left you hanging back there regarding the imidazole ring of histidine, well, here's a simpler question that has a higher probability of being asked by Cambridge for the new H2 syllabus).<p>
              Since the new syllabus specimen paper asked for the hybridization of N atoms (where in the old syllabus, questions were restricted to C atoms), almost all the 2017 Singapore JC Prelim Papers started following suit. So here's a BedokFunland JC question for all of you.</p><p>
              <b>State *and* explain the hybridization of the N atom in the amide functional group.</b></p><p>Note : At Uni levels, the actual hybridization will be x% this, y% that, z% something else, but at A levels, you're expected to identify the single 'major' hybridization that contributes most to the actual hybridization.
              </p><p>I'll leave it to you guys (feel free to attempt and post what you would write as your answer if this question comes out in this coming week's P2 or P3) to discuss this very easy question, I'm sure you guys don't need me to spoonfeed you the answer, but try to resist googling out the answer before attempting it yourself, that's just lazy.

In contrast, your HCJC friend really only lost about 5 marks for P2, enough to make up for his P4 errors. So MapPwner, yourself, you're well on track for A grade (so far overall score &gt; 80%, yes?).<p>
                                                                    Agree with you that the calorimetry question is a good challenging question for Singapore JC H2 students. I can actually think of 5 different reasons why benzoic acid is used as a standard for calorimetry (just as I can think of 3 different reasons why LiAlH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4), but Cambridge as expected, is already very lenient : any 1 reason (for both the benzoic acid and LiAlH4 questions) will suffice to score the 1 mark allocated. But the majority of Singapore JC H2 students are unlikely to have prior exposure to such questions, which is why these are, all things considered, good and fair distinction questions (not too unreasonable as to require 3 reasons for each question, but challenging enough to differentiate A graders from the rest).</p><p>
                                                                    Similarly for the Naphthalene aromaticity question (from your description, the entire question is about Naphthalene being aromatic with resonance delocalization of pi electrons, while in the basic H2 syllabus only the simplest aromatic species, benzene, is taught), another excellent question that (from your description), didn't disappoint me, in the sense it is interesting and A grade differentiating.</p><p>
                                                                    But as you (and your sarcastic school teachers) pointed out, Cambridge has already been very fair, since these are only a sprinkling of challenging questions amidst mostly easy or standard questions. So (unless P3 and P1 are hellish... hell yeah! I should set the A level papers Lol!) I doubt the bell-curve will deviate too much from past years.
                                                                    </p><p>

                                                  So P2 was mostly easy to average, with only a couple of tough questions. But since you're the top 20% of the national cohort, MapPwner, perhaps the average Singapore H2 student found this paper mostly average in difficulty, with quite a few tough questions. But that's still totally within expectations of a Cambridge paper, so the bell-curve shouldn't have too many surprises this year.

Only metal ions that have H2O ligands can have their H2O ligands deprotonated into OH-, and thereby (subsequently generating) the hydroxide ppt.

                  electrophilic sub of No2, will you expect harsher or milder
                  conditions? </p>
                  <p>2) Iâ€™m confused with the common ion effect.. and how you can
                  compare just the solubilities of say Ca in Caco3 and Mg in Mgco3 to
                  determine whether they precipitate or dissolve. Is there a way to
                  understand this common ion effect? And if if were to be Na2co3 why
                  wouldnâ€™t it work this way? (similar to sajc p3 q5) </p>

                  Q1. Ortho-para directors outweigh meta-directors. When 2 ortho-para directors compete, the stronger activator wins. When 2 meta directors compete, the stronger deactivator wins. After which, take into consideration steric hindrance.<p>
                  In aqueous solvent, phenolic OH group is as strong an activator as NO2 is a deactivator, ie. consider the strength of the activator versus strength of the deactivator. Hence in your case, conditions remain unchanged, neither harsher nor milder.
                  </p><p>
                  Q2. The common ion effect reduces the solubility of ionic compounds (that contain the common ion), as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.</p><p>All Na+ and K+ compounds are fully soluble, that's why these compounds are used to supply the common anion, and similarly, soluble nitrate(V) compounds are used to supply the common cation.</p><p>If the stoichiometries of both ionic compounds involved are the same, eg. CaCO3 vs MgCO3, then comparing either the molar solubility or Ksp, will indicate which precipitates 1st, when increasing the molarity of the common anion, here CO3 2-.</p><p>If the stoichiometries of both ionic compounds involved are different, as in the 2017 SAJC P3 Qn, then you'll have to manually calculate the molarity of the common ion (in the qn, CrO4 2-) required to initiate precipitation for both compounds separately (ie. using the Ksp value for each), to determine which precipitates 1st, when increasing the molarity of the common anion, here CrO4 2-.

                  I'll give the correct approach, then you see if you can figure out whether your approach (which isn't very clear, without showing your actual working with values) is right or wrong. Did you get the final answer correct? if you did, you'll may even get full marks, because if you did get the final answer correct, and Cambridge doesn't see anything overtly wrong with your working, however weird it is, you may still get full marks.<p>
                  Your approach (since you just gave a generic description, it's difficult to explain what's wrong, if you gave full working with all values included, it's easier to point out which step you got wrong, and why that step is wrong, ie. your exact misconception at that step) seems to be wrong (I say seems, because your approach isn't very clear), because of a couple of reasons :</p><p>
                  Just because Zn is the reducing agent, you can't assume the OS of vanadium in G and H differs by 2, since excess Zn (ie. non-stoichiometry) is used to reduce the vanadium. You can only deduce such, only if the moles of Zn is the same as the moles of the vanadium species it reacts with, which is not the case here (you're using excess Zn, so you've no idea how much Zn was reacted).</p><p>
                  You idea of "subsequently equating the difference to be for every +1 in O.S" can be used only for comparing the relative amounts of MnO4- required for oxidizing the same amount of vanadium in G versus in H, ie. 24.6 - 16.4 = 8.2 cm3 of MnO4- magnitude difference, which implies 1.64 x 10-5 mol of MnO4- magnitude difference, which implies 8.2 x 10-5 mol of e- magnitude difference, which upon division by amount of vanadium species present 8.2 x 10-5 mol (see my working below), gives you 1.0 OS magnitude difference, which is correct, ie. the magnitude difference between V2+ is H and V3+ in G, is 1.0 OS magnitude difference.

                  Based on Data Booklet redox potentials, you can show (ie. by calculating standard cell potentials for each redox step) that under standard conditions, using Zn as the reducing agent, the vanadium species can be reduced to dipositive V2+, ie. OS of +2, and no further. This is the easy part, which almost all students should be able to get. (Though for 3 marks, Cambridge won't require you to waste time writing out all the individual redox steps and calculating all the standard cell potentials, just a brief statement explaining how you know the final OS of vanadium is +2 will suffice).
                  </p><p>
                  The 1st portion of G reacts with 3.28 x 10-5 mol of MnO4-, ie. 1.64 x 10-4 mol of e- transferred.</p><p>
                  The 2nd portion has now been reduced to contain V2+ as solution H, and reacts with 4.92 x 10-5 mol of MnO4-, ie. 2.46 x 10-4 mol of e- transferred.</p><p>
                  Since the final oxidized vanadium species is stated as VO2+ (ie. OS of +5), and the initial vanadium species was V2+, for each mol of V2+, 3 mol of e- is lost.</p><p>
                  Since 2.46 x 10-4 mol of e- was lost, hence mol of V2+ oxidized = 8.2 x 10-5 mol</p><p>
                  This implies 8.2 x 10-5 mol of vanadium species was also present in the 1st portion (since both are of equal volumes).</p><p>
                  Hence, no. of mol of electrons lost per mol of the original vanadium species, in being oxidized to VO2 + (ie. OS of +5), must have been (1.64 x 10-4) / (8.2 x 10-5) = 2 mol of electrons.</p><p>
                  Since the final OS of vanadium in VO2+ is +5, the initial OS of vanadium must have been +3.</p><p>
                  Hence molarity of V3+ in G = mol / volume = (8.2 x 10-5) / (25 / 1000) = 3.28 x 10-3 M</p><p>

                          MapPwner and do12453's estimated scores (for P3, and prolly for all the other papers too) are excellent and approximately on par. As long as you keep it up and score close to full marks for MCQ (which I expect should be no problem for both of you), the 2 of you should be getting between overall 75% to 80%, a confirmed A grade (as I've said many times before, the A grade boundary almost never exceeds 75% ; if students expecting A grade fail to get A grade, it's because they had overestimated their scores ; don't believe that bullshit about A grade boundary for H2 Chem being 80+% or 85+%, that's just ridiculous).<p>
                          
                          delurach, how is your overall % score so far? You shared on the Reddit thread that you didn't do very well for P3, but as long as you score close to full marks for P1, you should be able to get somewhere in between 70-75% overall score, yes? That would give you a good chance of scoring an A grade, and considering that this year's Papers are somewhat tougher than the last few years.</p><p>Most people agree that this year's P3 is considered on the difficult side (relative to past few years TYS), mostly because it is rather time-consuming, so most students won't be able to finish P3.</p><p>As such, I know most students are hoping that, (and this will indeed likely be the case, if P1 is of similar difficulty to the other 3 Papers so far), the bell-curve and A grade boundary will slide down a little more away from 75% and down towards 70% (eg. 72%). So if you manage an estimated 70-75% overall score, you've a very good chance of scoring an A grade this year.

              While hardly rigorous evidence, it is nonetheless indicative of the general sentiment from students across the entire cohort :</p><p>Difficulty of 2017 H2 Chemistry Paper 3 : <a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/14368146/r">http://www.strawpoll.me/14368146/r</a>

                                        As 'longaf' said on Reddit : <i>"no one can give an exact overall percentage"</i> for the A grade boundary for this year, in fact not even Cambridge or SEAB, simply because the papers haven't been marked by Cambridge, and the raw scores haven't been submitted to SEAB, and no one right now knows how this year's cohort of students have performed (even after P1 is completed, let alone today is before P1), because that's the very idea of a bell-curve, ie. dependent on how every single student in this year's cohort has performed, which right now, neither Cambridge nor SEAB has any idea on this, because the papers aren't marked yet.<p>
                                        </p><p>
                                        And the astute will note that I'm certainly not giving an "exact overall percentage", I'm merely stating that, just as an atomic orbital is the region of space around a nucleus in which the probability is the highest (but never 100%) of finding an electron associated with that orbital, similarly, I'm merely stating from experience, that the A grade boundary has the highest probability of residing between 70% to 75% (hardly an exact percentage, you see), and of course it's entirely possible (just extremely unlikely), that this year's A grade boundary might go below 70% or above 75%, because nobody knows how easy / tough P1 is, and nobody knows how every single student in this year's 2017 cohort has performed.

                                        You're probably hoping for me to just directly reveal whether I have insider info from SEAB, or if these values are nothing more than my own personal estimates without evidence, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response">without revealing too much, let's just say it's 'somewhere in between'</a>, ie. I have very good reasons for giving this confident 70% to 75% estimate for the A grade boundary, unlike say, show-off school teachers who delight in sadistically bragging to their students, "<i>I just saw this year's Paper and it's ridiculously easy! The A grade boundary for H2 Chem this year confirm 82.5% liao! Wahahaha!!!</i>"</p>

              Hate to be a bearer of bad news here, but you *might* get penalized for all 3 of the questions you asked on, but not for the reasons you think. See below.<p>
              
              Q1. Similar to the discussion on how I had doubts over how most students chose to answer the acid-base nature of oxides across Period 3 (although on 2nd thoughts, I've recanted that one, Cambridge was probably just being generous with those 6 marks), it seems most students merely described the trend of thermal stabilities down Group 17, rather than the visual observation of their individual decompositions, as Cambridge probably wanted.</p><p>As such, most students see 3 marks allocated and try to fill in more points relating to the trend (such as effectiveness of orbital overlap), but still missing out the individual thermal decomposition descriptions. Quoting Data Booklet bond dissociation enthalpy values for this question gets no marks, unfortunately for you (and many students).</p><p>Based on my interpretation of what Cambridge probably wanted (as opposed to most students' interpretation), Cambridge could or should have fairly allocated 4 marks for this question (in contrast, Cambridge was inconsistently generous to allocate 6 marks for the acid-base nature of oxides across Period 3) ; that they stingily allocated only 3 marks here (and as such misleading many students) is likely thus : 1 mark for describing the trend down the Group (including a generic decomposition equation and stating that HCl is thermally stable and does not decompose), 1 mark for explaining the trend (just relationship between bond length and ease of bond dissociation will suffice, no need effectiveness of orbital overlap, no need quote Data Booklet values), and 1 mark for describing the different visual observations for HI and HBr upon heating.
              </p><p>
              Organic Questions :</p><p>
              "Limited" is actually indeed required to ensure monochlorination, and should have been included for a good answer. Cambridge has in some past papers let it slide, but in some other past papers penalized it. So you may or may not get away with this one.</p><p>
              For nitration of a benzene (whether activated or deactivated), what Cambridge required was "heat under reflux" ideally, although they *may* accept "maintained at 55 degrees Celsius", so you *may* get away with this one.</p><p>The irony is that while many (but certainly not all) Singapore students managed to correctly recognize that the aryl ketone substituent was deactivating, they erroneously thought that Cambridge was being sneaky-cunning and had required "more than 55Â°C" for the answer, when ironically, <a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/arenes/nitration.html">retired A level examiner-marker Jim Clark</a> warns that :</p><p>
              "<i>Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric (sic) acid at a temperature not exceeding 50Â°C. At higher temperatures there is a greater chance of getting more than one nitro group substituted onto the ring. You will get a certain amount of 1,3-dinitrobenzene formed even at 50Â°C.</i>"</p><p>
              That's for benzene, so for deactivated benzene, 55Â°C is actually (and ironically for you) reasonable. But then again, that's <a href="https://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/arenes/nitration.html">Jim Clark's opinion (different A level syllabuses in the UK used slightly different temperatures)</a> ; in the pre-2017 H2 syllabus, Cambridge actually wanted "50Â°C &lt; T &lt; 60Â°C" as the ideal student answer for nitration of unsubstituted benzene.</p><p>But for the 2017 P3 Qn, Cambridge actually only required (and wanted) "heat under reflux" (more correct than just "heat", since this is a synthesis question, but fortunately for many students, Cambridge will probably accept just "heat", but seriously you students should have known better), since this new syllabus no longer requires (or even wants, ie. Cambridge will ignore) specific temperature values submitted by the student. </p>

              But Cambridge really nonsense this year, some questions so time-consuming only so few marks allocated, then some questions only got short answers yet so many marks allocated. Sheesh. *clap*clap* good job, Cambridge.
              </p><p>
              But on an objective note, like MapPwner said, it's not that the paper's questions are super difficult, it's mostly that the entire paper (all the questions collectively) is time consuming, which results in a paper on the difficult side.
              </p><p>
              So overall this year, the consensus amongst the general student population is that this year's Papers (assume P1 is of similar difficulty to all the other Papers) are significantly tougher than previous years, so yeah I expect the A grade boundary to slide down closer towards 70%.</p><p>
              Then of course, like over at Reddit, you have students, or more accurately, friends of students, and school teachers, who brag that this is a ridiculously easy paper, it's a walk in the park, etc.</p><p>
              Hey, the questions are easy for me as well, but you don't see me bragging (oh, I see what I did there) that this is an easy paper, because I think this is a time-consuming hence difficult paper, relative to previous years. So I agree with MapPwner that the A grade boundary should slide down towards 70%, but (let's be realistic), SEAB will resist lowering the A grade boundary to anything less than 70% (or the Universities will complain to MOE of grade inflation making it harder to select students for elite Uni courses).</p><p>
              Thing is, this so-called grade inflation over the years is not because the papers are getting easier, it's rather that more Singaporeans are studying more desperately to do better for the sake of their futures, but that's harsh cruel reality of physical incarnation for you : like what elite PAP ministers say : Singapore can't have all doctors and lawyers and graduates, the economy needs lower non-graduate qualifications for lower pay jobs as well.

                              Cambridge probably will accept lah, no worries.
                          <p>
               At least for this year (1st year of new syllabus), they'll probably accept. If too many students all write the same answer which is not the Mark Scheme answer, especially if Cambridge recognizes it's a new syllabus teething problem caused by an entire country of teachers still teaching from the old syllabus, the Cambridge Markers will submit this issue to the Cambridge Chief Marker for him/her to make a decision on the matter, and the Cambridge Chief Marker will usually make a fair decision, so as not to unfairly penalize an entire country of students.</p>

              Ok, gone through all the trickiest / toughest MCQs of P1 liao. Thanks again for the uploads, MapPwner.
                  <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/L60Vc">https://imgur.com/a/L60Vc</a>
              </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/7fevex/a_level_chemistry_paper_1_2017/?limit=500">https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/7fevex/a_level_chemistry_paper_1_2017/?limit=500</a>
                  </p><p>My personal comments (this isn't reddit so can't be downvoted for speaking bluntly) : while this year's P1 MCQs may be considered at least as tricky / tough as previous years A levels (with possibly 2 MCQs being even trickier / tougher than previous years standards generally), but overall, this year's P1 is actually slightly easier than previous years, because of time allocation : 30 MCQs versus 40 MCQs for the same 1hr duration.</p><p>This new syllabus arrangement (a result of repeated feedback complains to Cambridge) allows almost all students to be able to quite comfortably complete all 30 MCQs of P1 this year without needing to rush, while in all previous years (ie. old syllabus), with an additional 10 MCQs (ie. 40 MCQs) in the same 1hr duration, many / most students struggle to complete the P1, with many / most students rushing through the last 10 MCQs, and a significant % of students actually not having enough time to even attempt the last 5+ MCQs (which I'm sure is no longer a problem with the new syllabus).
                  </p><p>
                  This factor of consideration, goes unnoticed for almost all new syllabus students, because when you guys practice the TYS old syllabus P1s, it's either without enforcing exam conditions of 1hr time duration, and/or because you guys simply skipped the out-of-syllabus MCQs, thus making it seem easier to complete the entire Paper 1s within 1hr.
                   </p><p>
                  Nonetheless, notwithstanding, nice to see a general increase in quality and difficulty of questions across all 4 Papers starting from this year new syllabus. But as you already said it like it is (and kena downvoted for it), the overall score A grade boundary will definitely remain at (more likely slightly above) 70%. As the poll shows, majority of JC students scored 80+% for yesterday's P1 (in large part because now with the new syllabus you guys can actually complete the entire P1 without rushing).
