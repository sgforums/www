              <p>Thanks for the reply! Not sure if anyone had asked this before. For electrochem cell, polarity of anode is negative while cathode is positive. How come the polarity is reversed for the case of electrolytic cell?<br>Anode is oxidation, so electrons are released into the electrolyte hence it is negative electrode and vice versa for cathode.</p>

              <p>In an electrolytic cell, electrons flow from the power source to the electrode, where some species (usually a cation) accepts electrons to be reduced. Hence, this electrode is called the cathode. And as far as you (the species accepting the electron to be reduced) are concerned, the cathode is your source of negatively charged electrons, hence the cathode is the negative electrode, and therefore the anode is the positive electrode.</p>
              <p>In a Galvanic aka Voltaic cell, electrons flow from the anode where oxidation occurs. Think of any oxidation half-equation, eg. Al ---&gt; Al3+ + 3e-. See the electrons being released? It flows from the anode to the light bulb. As far as you (the light bulb accepting the electrons to light up) are concerned, the anode is your source of negatively charged electrons, hence the anode is the negative electrode, and therefore the cathode is the positive electrode.</p>

              <p><br>No. You have to give the tri-halogenated product.</p>
              <p>Don't forget that any alcohol generated from the hydrolysis will be further oxidized as well. This is the tricky bit.</p>
              <p>NaBH4 can only be used to reduce aldehydes and ketones, absolutely nothing else. NaBH4 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LiAlH4 because of the difference in size of their 'balls'. Translation : because Al has one entire electron shell compared to B, thus the valence electron charge clouds and hydride ions of AlH4- are more polarizable and available for nucleophilic attack, compared to that of BH4-.</p>
              <p>Both LiAlH4 and NaBH4 cannot reduce alkenes to alkanes because LiAlH4 and NaBH4 are not gay. Guys only like girls, guys hate other guys. Because all species here (alkenes, and hydride ions from LiAlH4 and NaBH4) are all healthy, full-blooded horny males (ie. nucleophiles) pumped full of testosterone, and will only seek out attractive fertile chio-bu (ie. electrophiles) to attack. Electron-rich nucleophiles (eg. alkenes) repel other electron-rich nucleophiles (eg. H- ions from LiAlH4 and NaBH4).</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that's right. Whether it's CN- (from NaCN) or H- (from LiAlH4), or R- (from Grignard reagent), the mechanism is exactly the same : guys like girls, so nucleophiles like electrophiles, the nucleophiles shoot out their 'balls' (ie. lone pair) for attack (ie. donate a dative bond) to the electrophile (eg. ketone or aldehyde or carboxylic acid or ester) being reduced.</p>
              <p>Alkenes to alkanes, is indeed electrophilic addition, but because the term "hydrogenation" is more precise and informative, you must give "hydrogenation" rather than "electrophilic addition" for converting an alkene to an alkane.</p>

              <p>thanks. For the last part, i went to wiki and it said it is not electro add. Not sure if my reasoning is sound:<br>In hydrogenation, pt/ni as act a heterogenous catalyst, thus h2 and alkene molecules will be adsorb at the surface of the cat. In the case of electro addition, there is an unequal sharing of e, but hydrogen has only 1 electron, thus partial +ve/-ve charges cannot be formed. Also, there is no carbocation intermediate, thus hydrogenation is not electrophilic addition</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>You're confusing mechanism with reaction type. "Electrophilic addition" is not a mechanism.</p>
              <p>The mechanism for hydrogenation of alkenes require a transition metal catalyst, therefore the mechanism is described as "catalytic hydrogenation".</p>
              <p>But as long as alkene is the nucleophile (guy) here, and hydrogen (when interacting with the transition metal catalyst) behaves as the electrophile (girl) here, the reaction type is still considered "electrophilic addition", since you're adding the smaller electrophile (girl) to the larger nucleophile (guy).</p>
              <p>As for your statement "<em>since hydrogen has only 1 electron, thus partial +ve/-ve charges cannot be formed</em>" shows you're confusing partial charges with formal charges and ionic charges.</p>
              <p>Edit : You made one more glaring error.</p>
              <p>Wikipedia says hydrogenation <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></strong> an electrophilic addition. Look under "<span>Typical electrophilic additions" :</span></p>

              <p>2011 H2 'A' Level Exams Paper 2 Qn.</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>Qn : Why is CCl4 inert to hydrolysis while SiCl4 is supsceptible to hydrolysis?</p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p>Ans : 2 reasons.</p>
                                <p>Reason #1 : Because unlike C, Si has vacant energetically accessible 3d orbitals to use to expand their octet, and as such, is able to accept dative bonds from water nucleophiles without needing to first cleave existing Si-Cl covalent bonds, resulting in a lower activation energy required for the hydrolysis.</p>
                                <p>Reason #2 : The Si-Cl bonds are longer (but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> weaker! See Data Booklet bond energies) compared to the C-Cl bonds. Accordingly, the partially (or delta) negatively charged Cl atoms in SiCl4 provide poorer shielding against the incoming water nucleophiles, compared to the Cl atoms in CCl4.</p>

              <p>Inductive effects can be due to two reasons :</p>
              <p>1) Formal charges, if any. Eg. In NH4+, each H atom is extra-strongly delta +ve, due to the +ve formal charge on the N atom, causing the N atom to be extra-strongly electron-withdrawing by induction.</p>
              <p>2) Electronegativity differences, in the absence of formal charges. Eg. in NH3, each H atom is strongly delta +ve, due to the greater electronegativity of the N atom compared to the H atom, causing the N atom to be strongly electron-withdrawing by induction.</p>

              <p>Hints / Partial Solutions :</p>
              <p>Q1.<br>Such questions are often ambiguous. But assuming that the contraction refers to overall contraction, but at rtp, then 230 - 90 = 140cm3 refers to excess O2 + CO2 generated. Since pyrogallol removes O2, the further reduction of 20cm3 tells you that 20cm3 is excess O2, hence CO2 generated is 140-20 = 120cm3. From this data you can determine the formula of the hydrocarbon, using stoichiometric ratios of C to H in the products.</p>
              <p>Q2.<br>Each mole of Cu2+ requires 2 moles of electrons to reduce. Hence x moles of Cu deposited = 2x moles of electrons.<br>Each ydm3 of hydrogen gas = y/22.4 moles of hydrogen gas, which requires 2(y/22.4) moles of electrons to generate (since 2H+ + 2e- ---&gt; H2)<br>Hence answer = add up total number of electrons in terms of x and y.</p>
              <p>Q3.<br>Total Ag+ - excess Ag+ = Ag+ which precipitated out as Ag3AsO4.<br>Hence moles of Ag+ used / 3 = moles of AsO4 3- = moles of As. Sample mass = moles x molar mass.</p>
              <p>Q4.<br>1 A solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)<br>2 A solution of iron (II) chloride<br>3 A mixture of aqueous sodium hydroxide and iron (II) sulfate</p>

              <p>Q2) after doing MCQs for organic chem. I realized quite a few tys questions required us to assume that phenol can straight away react with acyl chloride without the need to generate the phenoxide ion by reacting with naoh(Aq). Case in point are questions (n2010/I/q39) , (n2008/I/q27). So do we just assume that phenol can react with acyl chloride? Btw all the above q can be found in the Ty's section carboxylic acids and derivatives.</p>
              <p>Q3) nov2009/I/29 , nitrogen compounds. It's the q on insulin. I couldn't place the question in this post as this structure is very complicated. The ans is b. my question is why the amino group of the side chain does not break up even with 6 mol of hcl? Don't tell me they broke up initially and form back via condensation..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer is C. Due to resonance delocalization of the lone pair on the I atom (directly bonded to the benzene ring) forming a pi bond with the benzene ring, the C-I bond (of the resonance hybrid) has partial double bond character and does not cleave readily in the presence of OH- nucleophiles (extremely high temperature and pressure is required to hydrolyze aryl halides). A secondary reason for the resistance of aryl halides against hydrolysis, is due to [Guys only like Girls, Guys don't like Guys] the repulsion between the two electron-rich nucleophilic species : the benzene ring and OH- ion.</p>
              <p>The OH- nucleophile substitutes away both chlorine atoms of the geminal dihalide group in the alkyl side chain on the benzene ring, generating a geminal diol, which due to the close proximity of the two OH groups, readily undergoes dehydration to generate the aryl ketone product.</p>

              <p>No, you'll need HBr or PBr3 to do the job. Mechanism for the latter involves the alcohol guy (nucleophile) attacking the PBr3 girl (electrophile). Mechanism for the former involves upgrading the poor leaving group OH into an excellent leaving group H2O+ by simple protonation (that's the role of the H+ in HBr), so that the Br- guy (nucleophile) can attack the partial +vely charged C atom girl (electrophile).</p>
              <p><em>Did you know?</em><br>The +ve formal charged O atom is even more electron-withdrawing than usual, and enhances the magnitude of the partial +ve charge on the C atom, making it more electrophilic in this way, in addition to itself (the H2O+ group) being a far more viable leaving group for elimination, compared to the OH (since OH- has high charge density and is thus unstable).</p>

              <p>First of all, your reactant is faulty. You probably meant C6H5C(CH3)3 or C6H5CH(CH3)2. If the former, then no, KMnO4 is helpless and cannot oxidize it, as there is no H atom available to be removed. If the latter, then yes, heated under reflux with KMnO4 will generate benzoic acid.</p>

              <p>Q30. There is a sp3 hybridized C atom only in the intermediate, which is not shown in the question (only the reactants and products are shown)..</p>
              <p>Q12. Do an ICE table. Solving for x, you get Equilibrium pressures of 2, 14, 14. Using the kinetics formula (your JC may not have taught you this formula, so learn this now) of [Desired Molarity] / [Initial Molarity] = (1/2)^n where n = number of half-lives for an overall 1st order reaction. You get n = 3, hence time taken = 3 x 20min = 60min.</p>
              <p>Q2. You must first find the molarity of pure water. Molarity = moles / volume. In 1dm3, moles = sample mass / molar mass = 1kg / 18g = 55.56 moles. Hence [H2O] in pure water = 55.56 mol/dm3. These steps (described above) are also required for the challenging exam question : what is the pKa of H2O at 25 deg C? Ans : 15.74.</p>
              <p>Q7. There is no such thing as "half-life of an experiment". Option 1 is sheer nonsense.</p>
              <p>Q13. You can compare Ksp of two species to determine their relative solubilities, only if their stoichiometry is the same, eg. AgCl vs AgBr, or PbCl2 vs PbBr2. When the stoichiometry is different, eg. AgCl vs PbBr2, you cannot just look at their Ksp values. You must work out their molar solubilities (calculated from Ksp) and/or check which species will have its ionic product exceeding Ksp, at any given concentration of the common ion.</p>

              <p>No. K2Cr2O7 does <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> oxidize alkenes, alkyl benzenes, methanoic acid and ethandioic acid. Only KMnO4 can oxidise these classes of compounds.</p>

              <p>Use of data booklet is relevant to this question.</p>
              <p>In the aromas red sands aquifer, the drinking water source for part of California, there are high levels of soluble, toxic chromium(VI) compounds.<br>Which compound in the aquifer's sands is most likely to be responsible for the formation of the chromium(VI) compounds from the sparingly soluble chromium(III) bearing rocks?</p>
              <p>A) Al2O3<br>B) CuO<br>C) Fe2O3<br>D) ZnO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer is (C)</p>
              <p>For such questions, when there are more than one possible answer, choose the best answer. In this context, to oxidize chromium from an OS of +3 to +6, choose the strongest oxidizing agent among the options, ie. the species with the most +ve reduction potential.</p>
              <p>The reduction potential of Fe3+ to Fe2+, is more positive, than the reduction potentials of Al3+ to Al, Cu2+ to Cu, and Zn2+ to Zn.</p>

              <p>Okay! Thank you! But can I ask you an extra qn I'm curious about? " I have checked the data booklet and found that the e values are lower than that of chronium. Is it due to solubility or acidity?" Are Fe2O3 and CuO soluble?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>All the oxides listed here are insoluble (only ZnO is very slightly soluble). Although the Data Booklet redox potentials are for aqueous ions, but if all are insoluble, then it's still a fair comparison using the aqueous redox potentials.</p>
              <p>Although redox potentials, solubilities and acidities are all related (because these are all properties determined by effective nuclear charge, electronegativities, ionization energies, charge densities, lattice dissociation enthalpies, hydration enthalpies, etc), but there is no simple or direct correlation between them at 'A' levels.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this related question will interest you :<br><strong><br>Generally, the more reactive a metal, the more positive it's oxidation potential. So why is it that K is more reactive than Li (explain why this is so), but yet the oxidation potential of Li to Li+ is more positive than the oxidation potential of K to K+ (explain why this is so)?</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Bonus Answer :</span></strong></p>
              <p>K is more reactive than Li because the 1st ionization energy of K is less endothermic than the 1st IE of Li. This is due to the greater atomic radius and shielding effect of the K atom, allowing it to lose a valence electron more readily.</p>
              <p>However, oxidation potentials as given in the Data Booklet, is defined as for the aqueous state. And by Hess Law, oxidation enthalpy = ionization enthalpy + hydration enthalpy.<br> <br>The 1st IE of K to K+ may be more favourable (ie. less endothermic) than that for Li, but the significantly more favourable (ie. more exothermic) formation of stronger ion - permanent dipole bonds between the higher charge density Li+ ion and polar water molecules during the hydration process, more than compensates for the more endothermic 1st IE of Li, compared to for K.</p>

              <p>ACJC 08<br>1. An equimolar mixture of A and B at an initial total pressure of 2 atm was allowed to reach equilibrium. The equation for the reaction is<br>A(g) + 2B(g) &lt;---&gt; 2C(g)<br>At equilibrium the total pressure was reduced to 1.8 atm. What is the value of Kp?</p>
              <p>Solution :</p>
              <p>A + 2B &lt;---&gt; 2C</p>
              <p>1 | 1 | 0</p>
              <p>-x | -2x | +2x</p>
              <p>1-x | 1-2x | 2x</p>
              <p>Since total = (1-x) + (1-2x) + (2x) = 2-x = 1.8 atm, hence x = 0.2</p>
              <p>Hence Equilibrium partial pressures = 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.4</p>
              <p>Hence Kp = (Pc)^2 / [(Pa)^1 x (Pb)^2] = 5.556 x 10^-1</p>

              <p>Answer :</p>
              <p>At such low molarity of HCl, you have to add the [H+] generated from the auto-ionization (aka auto-dissociation) of water, to the [H+] generated from the dissociation of HCl.</p>
              <p>Doing so will get you the correct answer of (most acidic) Y, W, X (least acidic).</p>

              <p>Except tertiary alkyl groups eg. C6H5C(CH3)3, since these have no H atom available to be removed, and thus cannot be oxidized by KMnO4.</p>
              <p>The only way to oxidize such compounds (and in fact, *any* organic compound, eg. ketones, that cannot be further oxidized by chemical oxidizing agents), is to burn it alive. Students often forget that combustion is also considered oxidation.</p>
