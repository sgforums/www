              <p>For Q1. , the four are intangibility, perishability, inseparability and variability.</p>
              <p>I will give you an example for intangibility,offering of tangible clues like membership cards. The rest you think up on your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Q2. , the six factors are cultural, demographic, economic, natural, political, and technological factors. You will have to chose four and come up with your own examples of each factor though ( e.g. Change in trade laws )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Q3. , The purpose for segmenting a market is to allow your marketing/sales
              program to focus on the subset of prospects that are "most likely" to
              purchase your offering, and hence help to insure the highest return for your marketing/sales expenditures. The 2nd part should be easy to answer if you understand this 1st part.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Q4. , there are 12 types of pricing strategies, premium pricing, penetration pricing, economy pricing, price skimming, psychological pricing, product line pricing, optional product pricing, captive product pricing, product bundle pricing, promotional pricing, geographical pricing and value pricing. The 2nd part should be more or less common sense why prices changes affect these industries.</p>

              <p>No they are not really linked together..</p>
              <p>By 1st part I mean the first part of the same question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will give you some hints, but I hope that you can think of some examples by yourself instead of following mine.</p>
              <p>For Q1. ,</p>
              <p>intangibility - offering membership cards for diners/ hotel users</p>
              <p>perishability - modify pricing to help balance supply (e.g. amount of rooms in a hotel ) and demand (e.g. amount of people going to the hotel )</p>
              <p>inseparability - ensure most, but not all service are delivered by people ( service orientated, instead of things being self-help )</p>
              <p>variability - customizing to ensure that the service fits the customers, as every customers are different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Q2. ,</p>
              <p>demographic environment - The basic thing you need to know is that the people makes up the market. Hence, the age distribution, size, ethnicity...etc. all matter, as you cannot open a modern 'disco-cum-restaurant' in a place where over 90% of the people are above 65 years old.</p>
              <p>economic environment - It is important to look into the available purchasing 
                                    power in a market, which depends on stuffs such as current prices and credit availability. You can't expect to have rooms in a hotel which cost $1k a night when 90% of the people in the region are barely surviving on $1k a month.</p>
              <p>political environment - This environment 
                                    consists of laws, government groups and even activists that influence and limit and your hotel/resaurant plannings. It won't do for you to open up a hotel in a place where the government is ruthlessly demanding 75% of your earnings.</p>
              <p>cultural environment - This is considerably the simplest one. Different societies have different upbringings, views, and beliefs, so you will be careful to note these things. You can imagine opening a pork restaurant in a muslim country...</p>
