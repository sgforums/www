              Each of the 10 types in the book, is further subdivided into many different individual experiments, for a total of approx 70+ experiments. So yeah, Chan Kim Seng's Planning Book covers all the possible experiments that can be asked at A levels.

                  serious conceptual qn
                  
                  when we construct the electrochemical cell fully already, there will be a emf value shown on the voltmeter, doesn't this mean redox reaction already take place?
                  
                  why in part iii, when qn say 'write the full balanced redox reaction that would take place if the electrodes of the cell were connected by an external circuit' ,
               as if the reaction will only happen after connected to an external circuit ,and hence the full redox balanced eqn can only be written after connecting to an external circuit??
              
                  also, what does connecting the electrodes to an external circuit means? 
              change from an electrochemical cell to an electrolytic cell??
              the electrochemical cell is already complete, not sure why need 'connect to an external circuit' ?

                  is what my cher say true?he said that if 2 cl radicals forms in the beginning ,there will be only 2 cl atoms substituted in the end. means it's not like nuclear fission, whereby one U-238 splits to give 3 neutrons and as a result hit three more U-238 to give a total of 9 neutrons in the 2nd stage
                  
                  does chain reaction means no. of reactants increase?
                      
                  my jc school teacher say *Cambridge examiner reports(CER) says* :
                  *Since the rxn is exo, the heat involved increases the temp of environment , hence, results in an increase in the rate of rxn*
               
                 (CER/answer didnt include the increasing number of clâ€¢ radicals, nor discussed it. based on my memory, take it with a pinch of salt. Frustratingly they didnt print for us as they say they couldn't, and they only show us for awhile, i couldn't take photo nor copy down in time. But i did finish reading it but did not retain 100%, no photographic memory, but did retain more than 80% )

              Before you connect the 2 half-cells, no redox reaction occurs. The moment you connect the wire (including voltmeter), then the redox reaction begins *at that moment), which is why you immediately see a voltmeter reading *at that moment*.

              Yes, lower Ea, due to less covalent bonds required to be broken. Being more volatile helps, as the heat from combustion can more readily vaporize the species being combusted, which (being gaseous) in turn allows for more access to atmospheric oxygen during combustion process.

              You're confusing answering the question "Why only a short flash of UV light required" versus the question "Why rate of reaction increases".<p>The former has to do with free radical substitution being a chain reaction ensuring the continued existence (ie. propagation) of free radicals as a result of the propagation steps. The latter has to do with the fact that stronger bonds are formed while weaker bonds are broken, and hence the reaction is exothermic (which is why iodination does not occur, because the reaction is endothermic).

              Acidic hydrolysis will generate H2O (if you dunno why then *facepalm*). Alkaline hydrolysis will not (if you dunno why then *facepalm*). But Cambridge doesn't care if you include H2O or not (if you dunno why then *facepalm*) when answering this question.

              <p>part 2 just say what kind of measurements u will make, and explain the significance. </p>
              <p>so part 3 just say what reaction will occur when the electrodes were connected to an external circuit(Which just simply means you finish setting up the electrochem cell setup now) and write the balanced chemical eqn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>cos part 1 involves drawing of the full set up and part 2 involves writing of the half eqns when answering the qn </p>

              No, this is my bad. My 2015 post is in error. I've just deleted it away. Based on stoichiometry, for every 1 free radical generated, 1 radical is also used up in each of the propagation steps. The initial flash of UV light generates a fixed no. of free radicals, and the propagation steps ensures this no. of free radicals remain constant, until the termination steps slowly uses them up.

              For A level purposes, Hâ€¢ is not generated during halogenation via free radical substitution. If you've further questions for this topic, go ask your school teacher or private tutor.
