              That's also correct and equivalent. Both reagents obviously (if you don't know why, you're screwed) have to be anhydrous. No point if only 1 reagent is anhydrous when you're gonna mix them anyway, is there? Common error by Singapore JC students is to write "Br2(aq) with anhydrous FeBr3", zero marks.

              <p>Thank you very much, I understood your explanation. For the same question (2014 AJC Prelim, paper 2 Qn
              5), for option B, there won't be bromination then? Since it is COOCH3, I infer that it is also electron withdrawing but still not sufficient for bromination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn 2ciii, may I ask how is T formed? What type of reaction could possibly occur to form the alkene by-product? At first I thought that it could be SN1 mechanism since it is secondary alkyl halide. But it will not be able to form an alkene, especially with the removal of O, since O is needed for attacking the alkyl halide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For 2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn3d, I had trouble deducing Geraniol. I could deduce N,P,Q and R, but I wonder why Geraniol doesn't have 2 terminal alkene. Since heating geraniol with excess KMnO4 will give N and P, and we see that 2 carbon has been removed, so why is there no 2 terminal alkene present? 2 CO2 could be removed. Instead, the product is a diol. Are diols colourless gases?</p>

                  Instead of replying you immediately, I've always said I encourage student-to-student interaction on the forum, help each other learn, that's a good way to practice and check your own understanding as well. So any other students wanna have a go at replying Supercat's qns? Even if no one else volunteers to post, FLYING GRENADE it's time for you to show me that you're capable of answering other students' (eg. Supercat's) questions, which is a prerequisite before you can say you're ready to get A grade for the (just 3 months away) 2016 A levels!!!

                  Perhaps Supercat has difficulty taking a photo of the qns or uploading them. But as Flying Grenade said, everyone asking H2 Chem qns here, do try to take a photo and upload the qns whenever possible, for the sake of sharing and helping other JC students here, coz not everyone has access to all the Prelim papers.<p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 2 Qn 5 : Correct, ester group is electron-withdrawing by both induction and resonance, hence the benzene ring is deactivated, no halogenation via electrophilic aromatic substitution occurs.</p><p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn 2ciii : E2 reaction occurs in competition with SN2. While the Singapore A level H2 Chem syllabus simplifies the matter of whether nucleophilic aliphatic substitution (ie. SN1 vs SN2) or elimination (ie. E1 vs E2) occurs as simply a matter of solvent (ie. aqueous vs ethanolic), but in practice (ie. real-life and Uni level Chem), all 4 compete against each other, and there are other factors involved in the 4-cornered fight : SN1 vs SN2 vs E1 vs E2.</p><p>While E1 and E2 mechanisms are not required for the Singapore A level H2 Chem syllabus, but nonetheless as evidenced by the AJC Prelim paper (and all Singapore JC Prelim papers and significantly tougher recent Singapore-Cambridge A level H2 Chem papers since 2010), it pays for students gunning for A grade to have a deeper understanding of Chemistry beyond the basic A level H2 syllabus. Which is the advantage that H3 Chem, Olympiad Chem, and BedokFunland JC Chem students have over H2 Chem only students.</p><p>2014 AJC Prelim, paper 3 Qn3d : You're right that the 2 missing C atoms are eliminated in the form of CO2(g). But you're incorrect that 2 terminal alkene groups must therefore be present in geraniol. Because if that were the case, how would heating geraniol with acidified KMnO4 yield N and P and CO2(g)? The given formula of geraniol precludes the acidic hydrolysis of ester or amide group as a possible explanation.</p><p> Concordantly, the student is expected and required to deduce and elucidate that the functional group in question (that results in 2 C atoms eliminated as CO2) is either the =CHCH2OH group, or the =CHCH= group, either of which is oxidized by KMnO4 with oxidative cleavage into ethandial, which is further oxidized to ethandioic acid, which is further oxidized to 2 moles of carbonic(IV) acid, which exists in equilibrium with, and hence decomposes into, 2 moles of CO2(g) + H2O(l), with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, and with the position of equilibrium shifting to the RHS as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle (since CO2(g) leaves the aqueous reaction mixture).</p><p><br>

              <p>Hi Flying grenade, prelim papers are available on the internet, I googled them online.</p>

              <p>^ AJC 2014 prelim</p>
              <p>For E1 and E2, I searched them online. So I take it that nucleophilic sub occurs together with elimination? And SN1, E1 favours sec/tertiary compounds while SN2, E2 favours pri/sec compounds? In this case, then I see nucleophilic elimination "similar" to normal elimiation reactions (dehydration) in the sense that a C=C bond is formed? From my understanding, alcoholic solvents tends to promote elimination while (aq) tends to promote substitution. Does acidic/alkaline conditions play a role too?</p>
              <p>Btw, why are methanoic acid and ethanedioic acid so special? They are the only 2 unique carboxylic acid that can be further oxidised to CO2 and H2O. Are there any reasons for this? Is it because of their structure?</p>

              Whether pH needs to be acidic or alkaline, depends on the specific elimination reaction. Ideally, you (ie. all JC students) should be able to draw out the elimination mechanisms, instead of blindly memorizing about it, which will enable you to effortlessly decide if acidic or alkaline conditions are required. Tip : Draw the elimination of HX from alkyl halide, and the elimination of H2O from alcohol. One requires alkaline pH, the other acidic, for reasons that will be obvious once you draw out the mechanisms. And ideally, you (ie. all JC students) should be able to draw both E1 and E2, to see the relationship with SN1 and SN2.<p>Because of the high O to C ratio for these molecules, allowing ease of further oxidation, and hence more positive oxidation potentials.</p>
