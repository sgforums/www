              I-Cl may be conceptualized as I+ and Cl-, due to the greater electronegativity of Cl over I. Br- from KBr is a reducing agent (since it's electron rich), and can be oxidized to Br2, while reducing I+ to I2.<br><br>I+ from I-Cl is an oxidizing agent (since it's electron deficient) and can be reduced to I2, while oxidizing Br- to Br2.<br><br>Br- isn't able to further reduce I2 to I-, because I- is itself a stronger reducing agent (due to having a larger ionic radius and hence also having a more positive oxidation potential compared to Br-).<br><br>I+ isn't able to further oxidize Br2 to positive OSes of +1, +3, +5 or +7, which requires a stronger oxidizing agent and/or self-disproportionation under alkaline conditions and/or heating.<br><br>Hence the overall reaction for this question should be 2 I-Cl + 2 KBr --&gt; I2 + 2 KCl + Br2.

              Q1. The hydrogen bonds in Nomex are longer, more strained, and hence weaker compared to those in Kevlar ; hence Nomex possesses greater flexibility compared to Kevlar.
              <br><br>
              Q2. Depends on the larger structures and the other rings to which cyclooctene was attached to. If the cis isomer generates an unacceptable level of ring strain in the other connected rings, then it's a no-go.

              No, as that's an insignificant point relative to the more relevant points required by the mark scheme.<br><br>However, the JJC mark scheme can nonetheless be further improved in 2 aspects : <br><br>1) Intramolecular hydrogen bonding is possible for both species, hence you should not use it as a reason for why TEA has a higher boiling point than DEA.<br><br>2) To explain the more extensive hydrogen bonding between TEA molecules : while both DEA and TEA have 3 protic groups that can function as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, but only TEA has an additional 4th group that can function as a hydrogen bond acceptor.

              Because your described structure fulfills the conditions for isomer I, and the question describes isomers I, II and III as *different* structures, hence the use of the term "isomer".

                      Q1b) Although AgBr is less soluble than AgCl, but due to the greater electronegativity of Cl over Br, we have Br+ (not Br-), hence the products would be AgCl(s) and (covalent) BrNO3. BrCl is a strong oxidizing agent, but neither Ag+ nor NO3- (with N already in it's most positive OS) can be readily oxidized (it is difficult to oxidize Ag+ and O atoms having OS of -2).
                      <br><br>
                      Q1c) The AgCl ppt would dissolve in NH3(aq), as the soluble ionic diamminesilver(I) coordination complex is generated. The Br atom of BrNO3 would also be nucleophilically attacked by NH3 and H2O, but the reaction products are not readily observable (hence irrelevant to the question).
                      <br><br>
                      Q13. This qn tests you on the thermal stabilities of Group 2 carbonates (determined by cationic charge densities). As a fire retardant, you would want two things : greater moles of CO2(g) generated per mole of retardant, and lower thermal decomposition temperature to release the CO2(g) more readily. 
                      <br><br>
                      Q24. The mechanism involves 2 x nucleophilic substitution (first SN2 on the less sterically hindered terminal C atom, followed by deprotonation, then intramolecular SN2 or SN1 attack on the 5th C atom, followed by deprotonation) of the Br atoms on the 1st and 5th C atoms, by the NH3 nucleophile, to generate the required product Coniine.

              Q1c) NH2Br + HNO3, and BrOH + HNO3, all of which are colourless.
              <br><br>
              Q13. Each metal carbonate will decompose according to their own temperature, and you can treat each mineral as a mixture of two separate metal carbonates. Eg. For Mg3Ca(CO3)4, magnesium carbonate decomposes first, followed by calcium carbonate. Hence BaCa(CO3)2 is the worst fire retardant because Ba2+ has the lowest cationic charge density and thus requires the highest temperature to decompose, so by the time sufficient CO2(g) is released, your house would have burnt down completely.

              You really love George Chong's book, doncha? He's busy climbing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc">Mont Blanc</a> right now even as we type, but up there in the lonely peaks of Mont Blanc, he'll surely appreciate the support of a loyal fan! ;Ãž

                              Your proposed synthesis pathway will score some marks, but not full marks.
                              <br><br>
                              You'll be penalized *mostly* because your proposed synthesis pathway isn't the shortest possible (ie. George Chong's answer). Always give the shortest possible pathway, because using a longer-than-necessary synthesis pathway will result in a lower atom economy and/or equilibrium yield, and hence will always be penalized by Cambridge. (But hey, if you can't think of any shorter pathway, getting some marks is certainly preferable to getting no marks, so go ahead and just write the shortest pathway you can think of, even if it's 1 or 2 steps longer than specified by the qn).
                              <br><br>
                              In addition (this is a minor point), although your step 2 will indeed obtain the required intermediate (used in your step 3) as the major product, but nonetheless there will still be a mixture of products, which should still be avoided in synthesis qns whenever possible (it's perfectly fine to use it when there's no other choice, but in this qn, there *is* another, even shorter pathway, ie. George Chong's answer).
                              <br><br>
                          But I emphasize that the main problem with your answer is that it isn't the shortest possible synthesis pathway. If it had the same no. of steps as the shortest possible pathway, then Cambridge (in most cases) wouldn't penalize you for using electrophilic addition of aqueous halogen. No worries.
                              <br><br>
                          On this note, using halogenation via free radical substitution will always get you penalized for synthesis qns (as it generates a variety of products, hence low overall atom economy which means wasteful on resources), unless there is absolutely no other choice for that qn.

              You're right that the position of equilibrium has shifted to the RHS, generating a *slightly* greater number of moles of RHS species at equilibrium.
              <br><br>
              However, because the volume has doubled (ie. *greatly* increased), hence even with the *slight* increase in moles of RHS species, the new equilibrium molarities of the RHS species still decrease (though the decrease is not as much as the LHS species, whose moles and molarities *both* decrease).

                  Your structure is in error. Ensure that you satisfy the valencies of O and C such that all atoms have a stable octet but no formal charge.<br><br>Update : MrWorry, you probably got the correct structure, but you expressed the condensed structural formula wrongly. You should write it as follows (ie. the way I wrote it below).                  <br><br>
                  The correct answer should be :  CH2(OH)CH2CHO

              Yes, your answers are fine. The given answer is fine for the 2nd qn, but wrong for the 1st qn (count the no. of H atoms).

              <p>^Q3(d) .... I know that the observed colour is the complement of the colour absorbed but i cant seem to understand how to interpret this graph....there is high absorption in the blue-violet region which should yield a green-yellow colour according to the colour wheel. Furthermore, the high absorption in the orange-red region should yield a blue-green colour. I cant understand what the final colour will be since there are so many being absorbed and so many combinations possible.</p>

              <p>^Q3(b) from above paper : Same issue as before...a range of wavelengths is being absorbed. For the Copper-Ammonia Complex, max absorption is in green-orange region which yields violet,dark blue and blue according to colour wheel. For the aqua-copper complex there is no absorption at all in both blue AND green regions so shouldnt the colour observed be bluish-green. The MS states it will be pale blue but how can i interpret it by only using the graph.</p>

              1st paper : Cambridge is challenging the candidate to think more directly : since almost all colors of the spectrum are absorbed except green / yellow, the color observed is green / yellow. You don't even need to use the color wheel to check the complementary color.
              <br><br>
              2nd paper : Cambridge is testing whether the candidate notices the exact phrasing of the question : (i) says "State" (ie. from memory, without using spectra graph), while only (ii) then says "Using the spectra above".

              <p>Hi, the following qns are asked with reference to VJC_P3_2014</p>
              <p>1. 1(a)(iii) not very sure how to calculate the ratio </p>
              <p>2. 2(d) how do we know how to construct the equation between P and NaOH? </p>
              <p>3. 3(i) why KMnO4 cannot be used?</p>
              <p>4. 4(b) I know that J contains COOH. However when it is reduced won't it be converted to primary alcohol and alcohol will react with conc sulfuric acid so I am a bit confused. </p>
