              No time liao to bother with this (and you need to come for my tuition to discuss this properly, it's too inefficient back and forth on an online forum). But for those who feel they're prepared for tmrw's paper liao, and are keen on understanding this (it's *possible* Cambridge can ask this), can read : <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group2/problems.html">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group2/problems.html</a>

                  There are only 3 ways for a ketone to be further oxidized :<br><br>
                  If it's part of a benzene ring side chain (with a benzylic H atom).
                  <br><br>
                  If you use a chemical oxidizing agent stronger than KMnO4, eg. concentrated HNO3.
                  <br><br>
                  If you burn it.

              The question didn't even ask for the OS of Co in salt A, only in salt B. So if the question didn't ask, how can there be an answer (for a question that wasn't asked)? But yes you're right, the OS of cobalt in salt A is 0 (formal charge 4-) and in salt B is +3 (formal charge 3-).

              Ah ok, the formatting on the version I have is screwed up, with overlaps, so I couldn't read the question properly. Yes, the OS of Co in that salt A is definitely zero. What probably happened : the MJC teacher wrote the wrong answer in an earlier version of the Prelim paper with the wrong OS of +4 (that you have), subsequently when other MJC teachers pointed out the error, the MJC teacher released a later version of the Prelim paper with the correct OS of 0. Good for you that you realized the given answer couldn't have been correct.<br><br>Another frequently encountered neutral coordination complex (you cannot say "complex molecule", there is no such thing, unlike "complex ion" which is an acceptable shortcut for "ionic coordination complex") is the iron(0) pentacarbonyl coordination complex, in which Fe has an OS of 0 and formal charge of 5-, C has an OS of +2 and formal charge of 0, and O has an OS of O is -2 and a formal charge of 1+. Overall ionic charge (which is sum of formal charges and also the sum of oxidation states) is therefore zero, and that's why it's a neutral coordination complex.<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Fe%28CO%295.png"><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pentacarbonyl">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pentacarbonyl</a>

              <p>Hi Ultima, was just hoping you could provide some advice on these questions:</p>
              <p>1. This is pertaining to the 2 factors that affect the basicity of amines:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1i. Factor 1 would be the availability of the lone pair of electrons on N. Generally, we learn that it can be affected by the presence of electron donating alkyl groups. In applying what we've learnt about steric hindrance, I was wondering if this factor can also be affected by bulky alkyl groups not because of their electron donating capabilities but also if they can "obstruct the protons from reaching the lone pair of electrons for coordinate bonding" due to their size / steric hindrance. Is that a flawed reasoning or will it be accepted?</span></p>
              <p>1ii. Factor 2 would be on amine/ammonium salt solubility. On doing papers I realised there are 2 different explanations for this factor, one would be that the presence of bulky non-polar groups makes the amine insoluble and thus less basic (regardless of whether it has been protonated or not) (case in point used by the solutions being why benzylamine is less basic than ethylamine). Another explanation would be based on the ability to form hydrogen bonds, where if an amine has a lack of H atoms attached to the N atom (case in point being N,N,N-trimethylamine), it would be less basic . Both still address the main factor of solubility. However, which explanation of this Factor 2 would be more acceptable in your opinion?</p>
              <p>2. This is pertaining to the acidic hydrolysis of acid anhydrides. Following the "pattern" of the hydrolysis of esters, why does the carbonyl segment of the acid anhydride not become a H2CO3 but a CO2 instead? Under what circumstances would H2CO3 exist more preferentially then?</p>
              <p>3. This is pertaining to the oxidation of alcohols. Generally, we learn that tertiary alcohols do not tend to undergo oxidation, but why does a tertiary benzyl alcohol (pardon for the loose nomenclature) undergo oxidation?</p>
              <p>4. This is pertaining to the aqueous bromination of phenols. When this common question is asked in papers, the generally accepted answer / product for such a reaction is tribromophenol. However, must we take into consideration the ionisation / deprotonation of the tribromophenol in the given aqueous condition to give tribromophenoxide instead? Is that overthinking and how should we reconcile such "environmental" factors in determining the end product of reactions?</p>
              <p>5. This is related to Question 4 on tribromophenols. The general baseline is that tribromophenols are highly insoluble and give a white ppt. But with more and more permutations given in exams (with other groups present on the benzene such that we only get dibromo or even monobromo), do nontrihalogented phenols still give a white ppt? Can we say that as long as the benzene seems "highly substituted" with non-hydrogen groups (besides Br and halogens), it will be a white ppt? In what cases will it then be soluble? Also do we consider a dibromophenol soluble? </p>
              <p>Thanks so much!</p>

                                        we learn that tertiary alcohols do not tend to undergo oxidation,
                                        but why does a tertiary benzyl alcohol (pardon for the loose
                                        nomenclature) undergo oxidation?</p>
                                        <p>4. This is pertaining to the aqueous bromination of phenols.
                                        When this common question is asked in papers, the generally
                                        accepted answer / product for such a reaction is tribromophenol.
                                        However, must we take into consideration the ionisation /
                                        deprotonation of the tribromophenol to give tribromophenoxide
                                        instead? Is that overthinking and how should we reconcile such
                                        "environmental" factors in determining the end product of
                                        reactions?</p>
                                        <p>5. This is related to Question 4 on tribromophenols. The general
                                        baseline is that tribromophenols are highly insoluble and give a
                                        white ppt. But with more and more permutations given in exams (with
                                        other groups present on the benzene such that we only get dibromo
                                        or even monobromo), do nontrisubstituted phenols still give a white
                                        ppt? Can we say that as long as the benzene seems "highly
                                        substituted" with non-hydrogen groups (besides Br and halogens), it
                                        will be a white ppt? In what cases will it then be soluble?</p>
                                        <p>Thanks so much!</p>

                                        Q1i. Steric hindrance affects nucleophilicity much more than it affects basicity (as H+ or H3O+ ions are small and thus relatively unaffected by steric hindrance*). So use steric hindrance to explain reduced nucleophilicity rather than basicity. Note that any Bronsted-Lowry base can potentially also function as a nucleophile, and vice-versa, as they're all Lewis bases.
                                        <br><br>
                  * Evidence : The deliberately built-in steric hindrance of lithium diisopropyl amide forces it to function only as a Bronsted-Lowry base, but not as a nucleophile. It's function as a Bronsted-Lowry base is uncompromised, but it's function as a nucleophile is completely nullified.
                       <br><br>
                                        Q1ii. Solubility only indirectly affects basicity, but hydrogen bonding directly affects basicity. Because the more stable the conjugate acid, the stronger the base. Magnitude of hydrogen bonding stabilization energy for primary ammonium &gt; secondary ammonium &gt; tertiary ammonium, conjugate acids.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Q2. When 1 mole of acid anhydride is hydrolyzed (no need for acidic or alkaline conditions), the only products are 2 moles of carboxylic acids. No carbonic(IV) acid or CO2 is generated. On a separate note, carbonic(IV) acid exists in equilibrium with, and hence can decompose into, gaseous carbon dioxide and liquid water, with thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change. Moreover, gaseous carbon dioxide leaves the reaction mixture, pulling the position of equilibrium over to the RHS. Which is why (unless you're actively pumping in carbon dioxide gas to shift the position of equilibrium over to the LHS*), the position of equilibrium always lies on the RHS, and any carbonic(IV) acid will instantaneously decompose (mechanism : after intramolecular Bronsted-Lowry acid-base proton transfer reaction, elimination of H2O yields CO2) to carbon dioxide gas.
                                        <br><br>
                                        * Even then, H2CO3 will undergo Ka1 proton dissociation (or hydrolysis) to yield HCO3- and H+ (or H3O+). Molecular H2CO3 can only be isolated under exceptional conditions, not under standard aqueous conditions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Q3. As long as a benzene ring has a benzylic H atom, the functional group (as far as oxidation by KMnO4 is concerned) is no longer considered a typical alcohol or ketone or alkyl group, but falls under "oxidation of benzene ring side chain (provided a benzylic H atom is present) to benzoic acid".
                                        <br><br>
                                        Q4. It is precisely the Ka partial proton dissociation of the phenolic OH group, that makes the phenolic OH group strongly electron donating by resonance, due to the negative formal charge present on the O atom of the phenoxide C6H5O- ion. With a negative formal charge on the O atom, the electron-rich O- atom is no longer electron withdrawing by induction (unlike the OH phenolic group), allowing for the full effect of its electron donating by resonance capabilities. When you state the product as "tribromophenol", you're already implicitly stating "tribromophenol (and it's conjugate base in an acid-base equilibrium)" because anyone with any chemistry sense knows that all acids exist in equilibrium with their conjugate base (provided, of course, that the solvent employed allows for this).
                                        <br><br>
                                        Q5. As you're aware, aqueous solubility of halogenated phenols (and phenylamines) decreases significantly with the multiplicity of halogenation. Hence aqueous solubility of mono-halogenated phenol &gt; di-halogenated phenol &gt; tri-halogenated phenol. Similarly, for other substituted groups other than halogens (which of course, you must take into consideration the polarity, proticity (can accept and/or donate H bonds?) and presence/absence of formal/ionic charge, of these other substituents, as such would contribute to the overall solubility/insolubility of the entire molecule). So whether a ppt is observed or not, depends on its molarity, its molar solubility and the temperature. In conclusion there isn't a simplified rule for this (ie. case-by-case basis, but for A level purposes it's quite safe to state that tri-halogenated phenols usually forms a ppt under aqueous conditions, while mono-halogenated phenols usually do not), and because Cambridge knows this, they'll set reasonable MCQ options (or for P2 &amp; P3, accept reasonable answers in this context), eg. by eliminating the other more obviously wrong options.
