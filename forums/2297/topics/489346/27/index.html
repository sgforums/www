              Your problem is you assume magnitude of hydration enthalpy always outweighs magnitude of endothermic lattice dissociation enthalpy, which is false. Either could outweigh the other. <p>Hence, without worrying about which magnitude outweighs which, you should simply add up the endothermic lattice dissociation enthalpy change (ie. positive value) with the exothermic hydration enthalpy change (ie. negative value) to obtain solution enthalpy change, which could be either endothermic or exothermic (ie. positive or negative value).

              Giant covalent tetrahedral lattice structure similar or analogous to diamond, in which each N atom has a unipositive formal charge, and each B atom has a uninegative formal charge, because all N and B atoms have a stable octet of 4 bond pairs and 0 lone pairs (just like the C atoms in diamond).

                      Yes, this is true for the transition metals, as the electrons in the inner 3d orbitals will repel the electrons in the outer 4s orbitals, raising the 4s orbital to a higher energy level than 3d. Consequently, during ionization process, electrons are removed from the outer 4s orbital before electrons are removed from the inner 3d orbitals.

                  Yes, F2 is a stronger oxidizing agent compared to O2 (and F2 is the strongest *elemental* oxidizing agent, but that are rare &amp; unstable compounds that are even stronger oxidizing agents compared to F2), but since HF is highly toxic while H2O is non-toxic, and O2 is easy to store while F2 is corrosive, so overall O2 is a better choice even though F2 is a stronger oxidizing agent. It's like when you're buying a supercar, it's not just the speed which matters, how cool it looks and the price tag must also be taken into consideration.<p>I'll explain the following just once. For further discussion (eg. in case you still don't fully understand), go ask your school teacher or private tutor.</p><p>Oxidizing strength is primarily related to electronegativity, but secondarily to hydration enthalpy, because in the natural world, redox reactions occur mostly in the aqueous environments (ie. water being the solvent that brings the reactants together and allowing chemical reactions to occur), hence the redox potentials that are relevant are in the aqueous state.</p><p>Yes, F2 a stronger oxidizing agent than Cl2 even though F2 has a less exothermic EA compared to Cl2. First, understand why Cl2 has a more exothermic EA compared to F2 : it's because even though F is more electronegative than Cl, but the charge density of F- is too high due to small ionic radius, concordantly the inter-electron repulsions within the small F- ion are highly destabilizing. Consequently, the EA for F isnt as exothermic, as F- isn't as stable as might be imagined solely due to electronegativity (as would be the case with Cl to Cl-), as there is also a destabilizing (ie. endothermic) component to the EA process for F (but not for Cl), ie. the inter-electron repulsions of the high anionic charge density F- ion.</p><p>Next, if the EA of Cl is more exothermic compared to that of F, shouldn't Cl2 be a stronger oxidizing agent (ie. more positive reduction potential) compared to F2? Yet the Data Booklet clearly shows F2 having a more positive reduction potential compared to Cl2, and F2 is thus the stronger oxidizing agent. This is because as I mentioned earlier, we're interested in redox reactions occurring in the aqueous solvent or phase, and thus concordantly by Hess Law, reduction enthalpy = electron affinity enthalpy + hydration enthalpy ; and likewise oxidation enthalpy = ionization enthalpy + hydration enthalpy.</p><p>Because F- has a much higher anionic charge density compared to Cl-, it's hydration enthalpy is also that much more exothermic (ie. much stronger ion - permanent dipole interactions formed). And after Hess Law is applied, the overall reduction potential of F2 to F-, is still more positive compared to the reduction potential of Cl2 to Cl-, and thus in aqueous environments, F2 is still a much stronger oxidizing agent compared to Cl2.

              <p>I told you before : in the natural world, these redox reactions occur mostly in aqueous environments / solvents / phases. Do you think the highly unstable O2- ion is able to exist in aqueous environment? Of course not! It will kena immediately hydrolyzed to OH-, and (depending on pH) can be further protonated to H2O.</p><p>So for the oxidizing power of O2, look in the Data Booklet for the reduction potential of O2 to either OH- or H2O (depending on pH). (Ignore obscure &amp; rare reduction products like peroxides, super oxides, ozonides, etc, unless otherwise specified by the question).</p>
