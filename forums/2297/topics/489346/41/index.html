                  First of all, "neutralization" is an O level term. At A levels, the only time you're allowed to use this term is "enthalpy of neutralization". For physical chemistry, you must state "Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction". For organic chemistry, you must state "proton transfer reaction". Using "neutralization" will get you penalized at A levels.<p>Ser's R group is an aliphatic alcohol, non-acidic OH group. Lys' R group is amine/ammonium. Hence R group interactions between Lys and Ser is hydrogen bonding.</p><p>To your next question, the answer is "obviously", but also "you're thinking it wrongly". If you have a deeper understanding of Chemistry, you'll realize that the protonation or deprotonation is not actually between particular R groups and other particular R groups (eg. "Asp transfers proton to Lys", etc), but each R group protonation/deprotonation actually occurs with the aqueous solvent environment in the biological organism (eg. human body tissue fluids). In other words, solvent catalysed Bronsted-Lowry acid-base proton transfer reactions.

              Wrong lah. S2- is 4 lone pairs, 0 bond pair for that 1 S atom. S2 2- is 3 lone pairs, 1 bond pair, for each S atom with a uninegative formal charge, hence dinegative ionic charge.

              Yes, your E1 and E2 mechanisms are correct. But if you're using alkoxide ion as the base, then the correct reason why you need alkaline pH is to prevent protonation of your alkoxide base, so it can carry out the elimination.<p>Alkene is a nucleophile, as is also the H- ion from LiAlH4 and NaBH4, hence no reaction occurs (they're not gay). In contrast, H2(g) with nickel catalyst is able to provide both H+ and H- (as consequence of H2 adsorption-reaction-desorption with the transition metal catalyst with partially filled d orbitals), and hence can hydrogenate the alkene nucleophile / base.

              The Jahn-Teller distortion is particularly notorious (and you're required by the A level syllabus to memorize this example) for the deep blue tetraamminecopper(II) coordination complex ion. All other 4 ligand coordination complexes, eg. tetrachlorocuprate(II), must be assumed to be tetrahedral, unless hints (eg. cis and trans isomers exist for a 4 ligand coordination complex) are given by the question that it's square planar.

                  1stly, how are you going to achieve a dinegative ionic charge without 2 uninegative formal charges? And how are you going to achieve 2 uninegative formal charges for the 2 S atoms, unless each S atom has 3 lone pairs and 1 bond pair?<p>2ndly, you're wrong, it's actually more thermodynamically favorable for period 3 elements to form more single bonds instead of double bonds, which is why CO2 has double bonds while SiO2 has single bonds, another classic example being nitrogen versus phosphorus molecules, etc. And do you know the correct explanation for this? Go ask your school teacher or private tutor, don't ruin the fun for others on the forum by posting the answer here.

              In this case, you're wrong, but your teacher isn't fully correct either.<p>Vanadium's maximum OS is +5, not +3.</p><p>Based on standard oxidation potentials of V 3+, compared to the standard reduction potential of Cu+2 to Cu, you need only consider oxidation of V 3+ to VO 2+ (ie. OS of V = +4), and to nothing further (eg. to VO3 - or VO2 +) under standard conditions. But of course, the exam question can be more sadistic and replace V 3+ with V, and Cu2+ with a stronger oxidizing agent, then you need to consider each and of the possible oxidation products for vanadium all the way to +5, including memorizing (if asked by the question) all the color changes.</p><p>Minor point : Your teacher used the 'minus' version of the cell potential formula, but the 'plus' version is actually more meaningful, chemistry-wise (ie. for students &amp; teachers who understand their chemistry more deeply).</p><p>Cell potential = Reduction potential @ Cathode + Oxidation potential @ Anode = (+0.34 V) + (-0.34V) = 0.00 V</p><p>If the calculated (standard or otherwise) cell potential is 0 V, it means the system with standard molarities on both sides of the equation would be at equilibrium (ie. Qc = Kc; it just so happens that in rare cases like this case, also that Kc = 1).</p><p>If the system is already at equilibrium, no net visible change occurs (since rate of forward reaction = rate of backward reaction, but be careful : k(forward) = k(backward) only if Kc = 1, a rare case). But note that at initial, you only mixed standard molarities (ie. 1M) of V 3+ and Cu 2+ together, which means Qc is not yet = Kc. Hence a net visible change will indeed occur, until Qc = Kc (which happens to be Kc = 1 in this reaction). But (your teacher didn't mention this) the reaction will be significantly slower (exactly how much slower, depends on kinetics and activation energy for the forward reaction), compared to if the calculated (standard or otherwise) cell potential was a lot more positive. This is because of the intimate relationship between electrochemistry and equilibria and kinetics.</p><p>(Flying Grenade, do you think your school JC students, or even your school JC teachers, already understand all the above?)</p>
