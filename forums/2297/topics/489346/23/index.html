                              since N withdraws electron density away from O, wouldn't that cause
                              O to have a even larger partial negative charge?</p>

                              Hi IronAge, welcome to the forum. Are you a JC2 student this year? Or a private tutor? Or an MOE school teacher? Honest reply please.<p>N doesn't withdraw electron density from O, but it just donates less to O than either H or R would. Can you see how that results in a less polar O-H bond? Or do you need me to explain further?</p>

              Depends on my mood *shrugs*.<p>
              I can choose to do just 3 questions (eg. if 2 of the questions bore me), and I can still get my A grade. Or I can choose to do all 5 questions (and complete within the time allocated), and I still get my A grade.</p><p>But if you students do just 3 questions, you won't have enough marks to get A grade. If you students try to do all 5 questions, you won't have enough time to complete the paper.</p><p>So you should focus on yourself, and stop asking about me.</p>

              First of all, both your analytes' formulae have a typo error, if there are 2 substituents on the benzene ring, it's -C6H4-, not -C6H5-.<p>No, you can't. No group in either molecule can react with LiAlH4. You have to use K2Cr2O7 (but not KMnO4), heat, and observe for color change, which will occur for only 1 of the analytes.</p><p>For an alternative method, if both analytes are present in ppt form, only 1 will dissolve with NaOH(aq).</p>

                      Write out the products generated when you use K2Cr2O7, versus for KMnO4, then you'll see why.<p>Yes, that might work, but the yield will not be high due to the deactivating amide group (which withdraws electrons by both induction and resonance). Although this isn't a synthesis question, but if the yield is minimal, any observation wouldn't be clearly visible, making this a poor method to distinguish between the two analytes.</p><p>An alternative and better method would be to use LiAlH4, followed by alkaline aqueous iodine.</p>

                                    This is the toughest question in the paper for 2 reasons : because it's slightly beyond the A level syllabus, and also because it's extremely difficult to visualize (solely using imagination) the rotation of 3D structures.<p>Going beyond the syllabus, ie. at Uni level, the correct way to approach such questions is to assign priorities to the 4 different groups based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog_priority_rules">Cahnâ€“Ingoldâ€“Prelog priority rules</a>, and concordantly label each of the 2 chiral C atoms present as either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_configuration#By_configuration:_R-_and_S-">R (Rectus) or S (Sinister)</a>. The 4 optical stereoisomers would then be (2R,3R), (2R,3S), (2S,3R) and (2S,3S), where (2R,3R) &amp; (2S,3S), and (2R,3S) &amp; (2S,3R), are the 2 sets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer">enantiomers</a>, while (2R,3R) &amp; (2S,3R), (2R,3R) &amp; (2R,3S), (2S,3S) &amp; (2S,3R), and (2S,3S) &amp; (2R,3S), are the 4 sets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastereomer">diastereomers</a>.
                                    </p><p>Alternatively, or simultaneously, if you can obtain (or make for yourself) a 3D 'ball-&amp;-stick' model of the molecule, and rotate each end, it'll help you to better visualize and solve this question. Of course, you won't be allowed to bring in such tools or toys in the A level exams, so you'll have to settle with using your hands : orientate your fingers (using both hands) in a tetrahedral geometry, with 1 finger towards you (the wedge), 1 finger away from you (the hash or dash), and 2 fingers (1 from each hand) neither towards or away (the normal bonds), then slowly rotate your hands. While simultaneously mentally keeping track of which finger representing which group of atoms, *and* the priority of each group (if you're assigning R vs S configuration to help you answer this question). Not an easy task, unfortunately.</p><p>You could say this question is unfair to be asked at A levels. But it's a bell-curve anyway, so since it's unfair for everyone, it's arguably still fair. Such questions are intended for only the top few % of the A level cohort to be able to answer correctly, otherwise too many people would score A grade. Regardless of where you're ranked in the cohort, exam-smart students would always skip such time-consuming questions first, complete the rest of the paper, then go back to such 'skipped' questions last. It'll be penny-wise-pound-foolish to waste 15 min struggling on this 3 marks question, then find out at the end of the exam that you only have 3 min left with 15 marks of much easier questions left unanswered.</p>

              <p>Prior to researching i only know Al2O3 is amphoteric,</p>

              <p>We only learnt and memorised that Al2O3 is amphoteric. So how can we determine(or  how can we extrapolate the Only info that we know  and memorised Al2O3 is amphoteric) which species is amphoteric when a qn ask?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know Be2+ and Al3+ have high charge density, but i dk how to link this fact to the 2 ions being able to react with acid and bases</p>
              <p>Is the reason for amphoterism high charge density? If it is, then i just memorise which ions have high charge density then amphoteric species?</p>

              <p>First of all, i dont understand why G and H are not similar to

              shouldnt we get F.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how does rotating right hand side of J by 60o
              clockwise make ot identical to F as suggested by the examiner
              report. And why is Chirality of Left hand carbon of both G and H

              Indeed, the O-H bond in hydroxylamine is less polar, compared to in H2O or in alcohols, due to the electronegative N atom. So far so good. But here's where your school cocked up : the boiling point of hydroxylamine should actually be higher, not lower, than H2O, as number of H bonds formed is more important than strength of H bonds. Simply look at their melting points, and you'll see I'm right. However, in practice, hydroxylamine never gets to reach its theoretical boiling point (ie. above 100 deg C), because it readily decomposes (at 58 deg C) into water, ammonia, and either dinitrogen monoxide or nitrogen gas (depending on mechanism pathway and reaction conditions).

                  Yes, mathematically, a solution can be considered a valid buffer as long as the ratio of molarities of conjugate acid-base pairs lies within 1:10 and 10:1, ie. pH = pKa (+1 or - 1)
