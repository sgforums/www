              <p><br> No. Becoz in titration, no matter how many drops (and each drop
              isn't exactly 1cm3 in the first place) you use to reach endpoint,
              the moles of titrant used will always technically be either
              slightly before, or slightly after, the equivalence point
              anyway.</p>
              <p>So if you minus 1 drop, your moles of titrant used will be
              slightly before equivalence point. If you don't minus 1 drop, your
              moles of titrant used will be slightly after equivalence point.
              Since either way it'll be slightly inaccurate (can't be helped), so
              it makes more sense to just use the titre volume to reach endpoint,
              without further complicating errors by minusing away 1 drop.</p>
              <p>Now you understand why we call this 'endpoint' instead of
              'equivalence point'? Endpoint merely approximates equivalence
              point.</p>

              <p>this is sibei confusing.</p>
              <p>in the first place, small concentration of MnO4- is pale purple right? (pale pink not accepted?)</p>
              <p>Mn2+ is pale pink in color.</p>
              <p>if Mn2+ is in low concentrations, almost colorless, very faint pink</p>

                  U coconaden. Some tertiary alcohols can kena dehydrated into alkenes, some cannot. It's *not* a matter of whether it's a pri or sec or tert alcohol, rather it's a matter of availability of beta protons to be abstracted by the Bronsted-Lowry base in the E1 or E2 mechanism.<p>Figure out the mechanism for yourself, or go ask your school teacher or private tutor.</p>

                      Instead of spoon-feeding you the answer (and I don't like it when you openly criticize/point out the author's typos on the forum, even though in your mind you think you're doing them a favor by pointing out their typos ; or worse, when you ask *me* to publicly confirm who's right who's wrong, eg. Chan Kim Seng vs George Chong vs CS Toh etc), so I'll leave it to yourself to solve this problem, quite easily done, by drawing out the hydrolysis mechanism (try drawing both acidic vs alkaline mechanisms), and you'll get your answer.</p><p>And don't post the answer here on the forum (as you are wont to do). Anyone else interested can go draw out the mechanisms for themselves to arrive at the answer.</p>

              Fair enough, I meant you "criticize/point out the author's typos", rather than criticize the authors themselves (I'll go edit my previous posts to be fair to you).<p>Regardless, like everyone else who asks me Chem qns here on the forum, I'd rather you focus on asking about TYS or Prelim Papers qns, instead of comparing notes and books and narrowly zooming in on nitty-gritty details and OCDing over who's right who's wrong (which you can actually settle yourself by cross referencing and applying common, ok, chemistry sense).</p>

              stable, relative to say, ethoxide,</p>
              <p>must we say 'hence -ve formal charge is more dispersed'</p>
              <p>as in , e.g. : phenoxide ion is more stable than ethoxide ion
              because the negative formal charge on O atom of phenoxide is
              delocalised by resonance into the benzene ring, (hence -ve formal
              charge is more dispersed ), hence more stable, hence phenol is more
              acidic than alcohol</p>
              <p>the words in bracket need write? or can straight away write more
              stable after saying electron delocalisation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my school trains us to always mention about  (+ve or -ve)
              charge dispersal when discussing stability of cations e.g. (in
              phenylammonium)/anions(phenoxide)</p>

              Don't need to add that line. If you want to add, then say "negative charge more dispersed", not "negative formal charge more dispersed", because formal charge is on an individual atom within an individual resonance contributor.
