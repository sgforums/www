                  Just as O levels you were lied to that all compounds are either covalent or ionic, then at A levels you learnt the truth that all compounds lie within a spectrum between covalent and ionic; concordantly A levels is similarly simplified for the purpose of preparing you for University studies, which is when you start to properly learn the leading-edge relative truths, to the best of capacities of human science on this planet as of now.

              Eh don't confuse yourself in the last few hours before each paper lah! Don't worry so much lah, if Chan Kim Seng or George Chong or CS Toh say "heat", then you write "heat" lor. In almost all cases for H2 syllabus, just "heating" without "reflux" is acceptable. But if Cambridge asks you questions about reflux, or why / when it is needed, I wrote about it a few weeks ago :<br><br>
              You need to know how to draw, label and describe the use of the reflux apparatus (when it came out in the Singapore A levels a few years ago, most Singapore JC students couldn't do this question). There are 2 main types of reflux setups that can be tested at A levels : <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Reflux_labled.svg/200px-Reflux_labled.svg.png">simple reflux</a>, and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg/480px-Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg.png">reflux with distillation</a>.<br><br>Heating is required for most organic chemistry reactions (other than those whose reactants or products are vulnerable to thermal decomposition or undesired side reactions, then room temperature or warming is required instead of heating), as most organic chemistry reactions involve breaking of covalent bonds and hence involve high Ea.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, heating alone without reflux (ie. the use of a condenser) causes problems : organic reactants and solvents, being simple covalent molecular with weak intermolecular van der Waals are volatitle (ie. low boiling point). As such, either the solvent, or one or more of reactant(s), may vaporize and escape, instead of remaining in the reaction mixture, which sabotages the reaction by preventing it from continuing and/or reaching equilibrium yield for the product.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Hence heating under reflux (ie. with the use of a condenser) has 2 main purposes :
                                    <br>1) Ensuring the solvent does not vaporize away and cause the reaction vessel to boil dry, stopping the reaction. In addition, as a particular solvent has its own fixed boiling point, hence by careful choice of solvent, you can control the temperature within a very narrow range, to allow the reaction will proceed at the temperature ideal for that particular reaction. The constant boiling action also serves to continuously mix the solution, ensuring the reactants can continue to effectively mix and collide and thus reach equilibrium yield for the product.
                                    <br>2) Ensuring that the organic, volatile reactants (1 or more of which may have boiling points below the solvent and products) do not vaporize away and cause the reaction to slow down and stop, which prevents reaching the maximum equilibrium yield possible.

                  Either HSO4- or SO4 2-, depending on context. Unless the question specifies "compound" (ie. meaning both the main cation / anion, together with its counter anion / cation, has to be specified), in most cases Cambridge will accept your answer even if you do not include the counter ion, as long as your main product is correct.

              <p>Eh don't confuse yourself in the last few hours before each
                          paper lah! Don't worry so much lah, if Chan Kim Seng or George
                          Chong or CS Toh say "heat", then you write "heat" lor. In almost
                          all cases for H2 syllabus, just "heating" without "reflux" is
                          acceptable. But if Cambridge asks you questions about reflux, or
                          why / when it is needed, I wrote about it a few weeks ago :<br> <br> You need to know how to draw, label and describe the use of the
                          reflux apparatus (when it came out in the Singapore A levels a few
                          years ago, most Singapore JC students couldn't do this question).
                          There are 2 main types of reflux setups that can be tested at A
                          levels : <a rel="nofollow" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Reflux_labled.svg/200px-Reflux_labled.svg.png">simple reflux</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg/480px-Fractional_distillation_lab_apparatus.svg.png">reflux with distillation</a>.<br> <br> Heating is required for most organic chemistry reactions (other
                          than those whose reactants or products are vulnerable to thermal
                          decomposition or undesired side reactions, then room temperature or
                          warming is required instead of heating), as most organic chemistry
                          reactions involve breaking of covalent bonds and hence involve high
                          Ea.<br> <br> However, heating alone without reflux (ie. the use of a condenser)
                          causes problems : organic reactants and solvents, being simple
                          covalent molecular with weak intermolecular van der Waals are
                          volatitle (ie. low boiling point). As such, either the solvent, or
                          one or more of reactant(s), may vaporize and escape, instead of
                          remaining in the reaction mixture, which sabotages the reaction by
                          preventing it from continuing and/or reaching equilibrium yield for
                          the product.<br> <br> Hence heating under reflux (ie. with the use of a condenser) has 2
                          main purposes :<br> 1) Ensuring the solvent does not vaporize away and cause the
                          reaction vessel to boil dry, stopping the reaction. In addition, as
                          a particular solvent has its own fixed boiling point, hence by
                          careful choice of solvent, you can control the temperature within a
                          very narrow range, to allow the reaction will proceed at the
                          temperature ideal for that particular reaction. The constant
                          boiling action also serves to continuously mix the solution,
                          ensuring the reactants can continue to effectively mix and collide
                          and thus reach equilibrium yield for the product.<br> 2) Ensuring that the organic, volatile reactants (1 or more of
                          which may have boiling points below the solvent and products) do
                          not vaporize away and cause the reaction to slow down and stop,
                          which prevents reaching the maximum equilibrium yield possible.</p>

              Yah typo. Don't lose marks with typos like these : they can cost you your A grade if your score is around the grade boundary (which we'll have a better idea of after tmrw's P3).

              Because this is both an alpha and a beta keto-carboxylic acid, and thus being a beta-keto-carboxy acid, decarboxylation is possible. You can try drawing the mechanism for this, which I teach my BedokFunland JC students.<br><br>Not gonna answer any more qns here liao. Will come back to the forum again only after Paper 3.

              Look at overall % score, not individual papers. Of course, if all your individual papers score &gt; 75%, then obviously your overall score is &gt;75%, then your A grade is safe. <br><br>(Disclaimer : if you thought your overall score &gt; 75% but you didn't get an A grade, it means your overall score was &lt; 75%, and some of your answers you thought were acceptable by Cambridge, weren't. So always play safe and calculate your marks conservatively, if you're not sure if you got the mark for a certain qn, just assume you didn't). <br><br>The actual A grade boundary for almost every year lies somewhere between 70% and 75%, depending on the bell-curve for the cohort. P2 and P3 were of average difficulty, hence A grade boundary as it stands should be approx 72.5%, give or take 1-2% (depending on this cohort's performance). If P1 this coming Thurs turns out easier than average, A grade boundary will be shifted up closer to 75% (possibly exceeding slightly). If tougher, may be shifted downwards closer to 70% (but it will never be lower than 70%). So should you be hoping for an easy or tough Paper 1? Pros and Cons.

              <p><br> Excellent point, Sugarfortress (are you a H2 or H3 student? or not
              even a student?).<br> <br> This *appears* to be irreconcilable at A levels, given the
              stoichiometry and magnitudes of the relevant oxidation and
              reduction potentials. A easy workaround would be to suggest that
              excess I- be required (again, non-standard molarities). However, as
              it turns out, there's actually a more important reason that enables
              the redox reaction to proceed to generate CuI(s) even without
              excess I-. Which is, the reduction potential of Cu2+(aq) to Cu+(s)
              precipitate is actually far more positive than given in the Data
              Booklet, which is for aqueous species, ie. Cu2+(aq) to Cu+(aq). So
              much so that as CuI(s) precipitates out, the magnitude of the
              decrease in oxidation potential of I- to I2, is still far
              outweighed by the magnitude of increase in reduction potential of
              Cu2+(aq) to Cu+(aq) to Cu+(s). As such, admittedly my earlier
              explanation is simplified and incomplete, but would still suffice
              for A levels, should Cambridge ever ask this question.</p>

              <p>Hi Ultima,</p>
              <p>Really sorry for the late reply! I'm a H2 student. Also, thanks for that clarification pertaining to CuI!</p>
              <p>On another note, could I seek your advice pertaining to the Mcq question below? The answer provided is C, but we couldn't figure out why. We understand that they are asking for fractions instead of just concentration of X so it's less clear cut, yet we know that there is more than 1 variable in the fraction changing at any point in time (ie LHS, RHS, fraction numerator, fraction denominator). How should we approach such questions? </p>

              Your past posts revealed a deeper insight than possessed by most Singapore JC students, Sugarfortress. If indeed as you say you're currently only a JC student, you'd do well to consider taking Chemistry related disciplines in the University, eg. Medicine. 
              <br><br>
              This MCQ is a classic killer A level Chemistry MCQ that is designed to sieve out only the most able students for an A grade, and has been recycled over the years across different JC prelim papers. There are 2 parts to this MCQ. <br><br>Firstly, the shape of the curve (at either pressure). The shape is consistent with either a product of an endothermic reaction, or the reactant of an exothermic reaction. Concordantly, 1 and 2 are possible options.<br><br>Secondly, at higher pressures, there is less of the species, which is consistent with the species being gaseous, and belonging to the side (ie. LHS vs RHS) with greater moles of gas. Concordantly, 1, 2 and 3 are possible options.
              <br><br>
              As such, the correct answer to this MCQ is B (1 &amp; 2 only), instead of C (2 &amp; 3 only).
              <br><br>
              Assuming that's your paper and handwriting, you and your friends actually correctly worked it out, but were sabotaged by your teacher's wrong marking. Don't let the term "fraction" confuse you. Just replace it with the word "moles" or "molarity", then you're good to go.<br><br>You were probably confused with the use of the term "fraction" only after you got back your script, and only because of your teacher's wrong marking, misleading you into thinking the use of the term "fraction" adds some deeper, more insidious, tricky element on the question. Btw, why didn't you and your friends go ask your school teacher or private tutor (whoever wrongly marked you wrong) to explain why he/she marked you wrong? Or if you did, what did he/she retort? ;Ãž 
              <br><br>
