              Because CS Toh expects you to be able to work out such reactions yourself. And for A levels, students are expected to know that, phenol being a weaker nucleophile than alcohols, will need to first be deprotonated before it can react with the less reactive electrophiles.

              <p>Does it mean aryl alcohols with less c  atoms, around 6? Just now didn't think of this cos haven't read page 331,and most aryl alcohols we encounter only with 6 c atoms i.e. phenol? </p>
              <p>My guess from page 331, term "lower alcohol" is used, it means lower number of c atoms? </p>

              Lower = not too many C atoms present. Aryl = benzene ring present. Idea is simply : most alcohols are liquid at rtp (due to both van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding present), unless it's a large molecule with many C atoms, which would be solid at rtp. Cambridge question will give guidance or hints, don't worry about details like "which alcohol liquid? which solid?".

              You can test for the presence of alcohols by adding an acyl halide. If a sweet smell is observed, meaning that an ester is generated, which in turn means the original analyte must have contained an alcohol.

              <p>is it because, inside the solution, its not just the weak acid inside,  there's the cj base too? Help my concept please T-T</p>

                  <p>for part ii) , why is this thought process wrong : i want find
                  [H+] . i use ka formula. tried, but didnt get the correct
                  answer. </p>
                  <p>(p.s. , i've internalised the 2 methods/approach that was taught
                  to me , but want to know why above concept wrong. )</p>
                  <p>is it because, inside the solution, its not just the weak acid
                  inside,  there's the cj base too? Help my concept please
                  T-T</p>

                  Being a buffer soln, you *can* indeed use Ka, or even Kb. It's just that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation saves you time as you can work in moles instead of molarities. If you didn't get the correct answer, it means your molarities (ie. moles / new total volume of soln) of both HA and A- at that point (double-equivalence) are wrong. Obviously you need to plug in the molarities of both conjugate acid and conjugate base into the Ka (or Kb) equation, and not all questions will be as kind as this question to let you have maximum buffer capacity, so you better start practicing tougher questions in which the moles or molarities of both conjugate acid and conjugate base are different. Then try using all 3 formulae :  Ka, Kb, and Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to prove *to yourself* that all 3 formulae will give you the same final answer of the correct pH.

                  Both are acceptable by Cambridge, use whichever you prefer, IP or Qsp, to be compared with Ksp. Personally, I'll recommend Qsp (since it's closer in form to Ksp). For solubility (which is not the same as Ksp. ie. solubility product), always specify "molar solubility" (mol/dm3) or "mass solubility" (g/dm3).

              Your molar solubility based strictly on Ksp ignores the effect of pH, which is the usual case within the H2 syllabus. This DHS question goes beyond the H2 syllabus (which Cambridge often does) to include the effect on pH, which is why your answer is inadequate and thus wrong. If you do not add NaOH, how are you going to make the pH high (ie. alkaline)? That's why you add NaOH, which increases solubility by precipitating out the cation (in contrast, adding acid increases solubility by protonating the anion). There's no alternative method ; Wilbur's equation only covers acidic to neutral pH.

                  Wrong, in high pH, it's OH- that's relevant, not H+. "We" do *not* want to study the effect of [H+] in high pH, "We" only want to study the effect of pH on solubility, so Wilbur's equation (involving H+) is obsolete and can be retrenched.<p>Your mathematics-based answer will not be acceptable, because firstly, the H2 Chem syllabus is always testing students about shifting of position of equilibrium (use of acronyms like LCP not allowed in A level exams); and secondly, the actual question (on Wilbur's work, or similar) in the A levels might not give you an mathematical equation or formula at all, so if all you can give are mathematical reasonings (as opposed to chemical reasoning that's required by the mark scheme), you'll be screwed in the A levels.</p><p>BedokFunland JC exam tip : If you're exam-smart, you'll give a variety of reasons, whatever you can think of. As long as they don't contradict each other, you'll be given credit for whichever answer Cambridge wanted.</p>

                          I understand the discussion about OH- , with the cation, can
                          precipitate out an ionic solid, and , in acidic pH, anion is
                          protonated. But i dont see how these is relevant for the
                          explanation in iv) .</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px; color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.32px;">
                          I dont see how "NaOH might precipitate out Ca(OH)2 , which would
                          decrease [Ca2+] , therefore potentially increasing solubility of
                          CaC2O4 at high pH" (given answer solution) addresses the question
                          of iv) , which is to study the effect of (high) pH on
                          solubility.</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px; color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.32px;">
                          We want to study<span class="" style="display: inline;"> the
                          effect of pH on solubility. <br>
                          For part iv) , understood, Wilber's equation is obsolete for
                          alkaline pH.</span></p>

                          <p style="margin: 0px 0px 6px;">For part iv) , Then, why is adding
                          NaOH a problem?  it should be Wilber's equation that's the
                          problem.</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px;">i dont see how adding NaOH is a problem
                          studying effect of pH on solubility.</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px;">Adding NaOH IS A Problem if we want to
                          study effect of pH on solubility, USING Wilber's equation.</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px;">I dont see a link here. maybe i dun
                          understand/disagree with the phrasing of the qn, and the ans. might
                          be my command/understanding of english is inadequate.</p>
                          <p style="margin: 6px 0px;">Ok real sorry, just move on, i dont
                          mean to annoy you, sorry, its ok if u dont reply to this qn<br>
                          Just move on</p>

              <p>I understand this : </p>
              <p>By Hess law,</p>
              <p>ðŸ”ºHsoln =  ðŸ”ºHhyd + ðŸ”ºLEdissociation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can help me check where i've gone wrong thinking in this way?? : </p>
              <p>ðŸ”ºHsoln = energy released on hydration by hydrated ions Minus Energy absorbed by Ionic solid to dissociate     </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So ðŸ”ºHsoln = (-ve enthalpy change) minus (positive enthalpy change )</p>
              <p>If i put modulus on the RHS terms, then it becomes all +ve</p>
              <p>Help please thanks! </p>
