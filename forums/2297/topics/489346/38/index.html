              Correct. Well done, Flying grenade.<p>
              Fyi, my own working is [ 5g / [ 3.29g / (molar mass of 4NO2+O2) ] x 2 ] - [ (molar mass of NO3) x 2] = 40.1g 
              </p><p>
              But your working will of course get full marks as well. Cambridge only marks the final answer, as long as your working is reasonable, you've some creative freedom to work it out as you wish.</p>

              In the A level exams, the reagents and conditions for each reaction, should be written in exactly the same way that either CS Toh, or Chan Kim Seng, or George Chong writes them (ie. above &amp; below the equation arrow) in the reaction equations. Cambridge will accept any of these alternative ways of writing the reagents and conditions. All JC students are advised to closely follow these 3 sources, over their own school lecture notes.

              Because your mistake (a common error for Singapore JC students) is that you wrongly eliminated a H- when the reaction required the elimination of a H+. H- is extremely unstable, and thus will attack right back. It is therefore a non-viable leaving group. H- does exist, but must always be carried by a more stable, larger, lower charge density species, the carrier species known as the reducing agent which delivers the H- ion.

              Also, if you're observant, you'll realize that whenever you mistakenly eliminate a H- instead of a H+, the O or N or C atom that was bonded to the H atom will consequently lack a stable octet, which will alert you to the error. When H+ is eliminated, it leaves its electrons behind, allowing the O or N or C atom to keep its stable octet.

                          You only need to fully display out the part of the R group which is directly responsible for the R group interaction. The rest of the R group can be condensed or skeletal.<p>As far as possible, always show linear H bonding. Yes, your drawing of (3) is acceptable (except it can be improved, see next sentence below).</p><p>Regarding originating from the same vertical starting
                          position : your drawing is actually misleading and incorrect.</p><p>Don't put a hypen between "lys" and "ser", it implies you wrongly think these are 2 directly adjacent amino acid residues (which would only be peptide bonded to each other, not H bonded by R groups).</p><p>The way you drew it out, from the R groups from same 'starting position', is incorrect and misleading. Because the amino acid residues with the R group interactions will be many residues apart, and because the polypeptide chain is non-linear (think of the polypeptide chain as curving and twisting convolutedly all over the place), hence you should have drawn the 2 amino acid residues as originating from different 'starting positions' on paper, either facing each other, or (more realistically) at an angle away from each other. See CS Toh's diagram on the bottom of page 381 (Advanced Study Guide).</p><p>Lastly, don't forget you're attempting to translate a 3D structure onto 2D paper. Each C-C bond is bent in 3D space, not linear. On 2D paper, it may not always be possible to illustrate perfect linearity (for all H bonds in all molecules), just do your best to reflect this. Cambridge will be reasonable.</p>

                      Usually not, due to steric factors. R group interactions are usually, and most importantly, between non-adjacent amino acid residues. If the only R group interactions are between adjacent amino acid residues, then there would be no meaningful tertiary structure, which is what gives proteins its biological function. In which case, proteins would be useless, and you would have died even before you were born.<p>Now you understand why your drawing is misleading and incorrect? And your school teacher didn't point out this error?!? Or worse, your school teacher taught the entire class this wrong way?!?

              <p>Yes Ultima, exactly. Whole class was taught  wrongly. Ultima, that's why i am very very thankful ,of you, helping us type out, and more importantly,  Elaborate out All(small and big, important and the nitty gritty ) the Details, and Most Importantly, teach and correct us  to learn the correct and right education. </p>
              <p>my only regret is i didn't discover BFJC earlier.</p>
              <p>I Feel Very Frustrated and sad that I've discovered so much that I've learnt throughout my life, is wrong. Happy because at least i discover it. </p>
              <p>i am very thankful that i receive education from BFJC, one of the only true educators and education.</p>
              <p> Another important skill I've acquired from BFJC is to learn to suspect and question and double check if something is taught wrong, and i seek clarification via books, online, and forums.</p>
              <p>some people don't even know they're learning the wrong things(like me in the past, receive without critically evaluating and discerning what I've learnt ), and once they discover,they'll be angry and happy.</p>
              <p>for me, I haven't been doubting Chem stuffs I've learnt until this year, it's late, i wished i was more inquisitive and a critical thinker last time ,but better late than never</p>

              <p>he wrongly taught the entire class this way.</p>
              <p>it was i, who sense there was something amiss, not right, wrong, erroneous, misleading, and incorrect, and thus, i seek clarification like a frantic chicken asap writing down typing down and uploading once i have my free period.</p>
