              Whether there'll be a mixture of products, or only 1 product, depends on other conditions and factors (eg. solvent, catalyst, pH, temperature, pressure, etc) beyond the A level syllabus. And it's not always just about bond strength enthalpy change alone which determines the product(s), but other factors are also relevant, eg. ring strain, angle strain, steric strain, torsional strain, induction, resonance, reagent mechanism, entropy, etc.
              <p>All of which you needn't bother with, in the context of this A level question (ie. Cambridge doesn't expect or require you to think about all these factors). If (in the 2016 A level exam), you're not sure which product you'll get, be exam smart and give both products, with qualifications and explanations as to why each alternative product is possible or possibly more favored / stable.</p>

              Keep spamming Prelim papers. Focus more on your weakest topics, skip your strongest topics and easy questions. And track and increase your speed (often, students know how to do the questions, they just don't have the time to do them) until you're fast enough to finish Prelim papers (specifically top JCs) within the time allocated.

              Geometrical isomerism consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis%E2%80%93trans_isomerism">cisâ€“trans isomerism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Z_notation">E-Z isomerism</a>. If there are only 2 R groups (need not be the same as each other), then cisâ€“trans isomerism can be used. If there are 3 or 4 R groups, then E-Z isomerism needs to be used.

              <p>Hi, can I ask two questions? I searched online for the answers but I cant seem to find a consensual answer and also the answers were not available.</p>
              <p>First, why are geminal diols unstable? I know they undergo dehydration but why?</p>
              <p>Second, why does Fehling's not react with aromatic aldehydes? I search online apparently its because of a step in the mechanism, but I cannot find the mechanism for oxidation using Fehling's anywhere online?</p>

                      Because of thermodynamically favorable positive entropy change, which shifts the position of equilibrium (ie. it's an equilibrium, you'll still get some germinal diols).<p>As for why Tollen's can oxidize benzaldehydes while Fehling's can't, there are several reasons for this.</p><p>For A level purposes, the more relevant concept is the more positive reduction potential of Ag+ to Ag, compared to Cu2+ to Cu+.</p><p>At the same time, note that benzaldehyde is more resistant to oxidation compared to aliphatic aldehydes, as illustrated by the greater magnitude of oxidation state difference between the reactant (C atom's OS approximately 0.5 in the resonance hybrid for benzaldehyde, versus C atom's OS of +1 in aliphatic aldehydes) and the product (OS of +3 in the carboxylate ion).</p><p>Oxidizing benzaldehydes are not a problem for stronger oxidizing agents K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 (with more positive reduction potentials), which are (by virtue of higher oxidation states and charge densities of the Mn and Cr atoms) able to utilize a stronger ionic oxidation mechanism, as opposed to a weaker free radical oxidation mechanism for Fehling's and Tollen's, in which the more positive reduction potential for Ag+ to Ag over Cu2+ to Cu+ just sufficiently overcomes the larger thermodynamic barrier for the oxidation of benzaldehyde (as opposed to aliphatic aldehydes) via the weaker free radical mechanism (as opposed to the stronger ionic mechanism).

              Vicinal diols can't dehydrate via the same low Ea mechanism as geminal diols. The dehydration of vicinal diols require the same high Ea mechanism as any other alcohols.<p>No link, sorry. You can explore these matters in more detail after your A levels (assuming you're a Sg A level student, are you?), especially if you continue on to study Chemistry in the Uni levels. Right now (assuming you're a Sg A level student), you should focus more on doing Prelim papers, and worrying less about the details of beyond syllabus concepts.</p><p>Cambridge won't penalize you over minor spelling details such as these, no worries.</p>

              U coconaden. U made at least 5 errors here. Still think u're ready for A grade?<p>OH- ion is *not* present at all, let alone in large excess.</p><p>And the only way u can get 2 OH groups added across a double bond to generate a vicinal diol is using KMnO4.</p><p>Instead of asking "<i>why all the OH- will let the Br- nucleophile attack the carbonation first, before attacking the carbocation itself?</i>", u might as well ask "<i>why all the Br- will let the OH- nucleophile attack the carbonation first, before attacking the carbocation itself?</i>".</p><p>First of all, it's not OH- nucleophile, it's H2O nucleophile. Secondly, nobody's letting anybody do anything. It's whoever is in that place at that time with the means, gets there first.</p><p>And ur last statement "<i>if the YJC Answer given is correct, which is OH attach to tertiary carbon instead of Br, then i don't understand why the remaining of OH- will let the Br nucleophile attack the secondary carbon, without attacking the carbocation itself?</i>" shows u're woefully inadequate when it comes to understanding and drawing mechanisms. The only way u can answer ur qn is by correctly drawing out the full mechanism. That's something (if u google out the mechanism and still dun understand it) u'll need ur school teacher or private tutor to go thru with u step-by-step.</p>
