              Yeah, but it doesn't really matter, does it? Regardless of which case is true (a mere technicality), the only thing that's in your power, is you do the best you can. The rest is out of your hands.<p>Though as an ex-MOE teacher, I can tell you there isn't a separate bell-curve for private candidates. The entire Singapore cohort is graded together. Cambridge sends MOE-SEAB the raw score, and MOE-SEAB assigns the grades based on the bell-curve of the Singapore cohort.</p>

              <p>(ok i do recognise that the above is too great a generalisation, there are other factors that explain why some of the above mentioned functional groups are more reactive than others, due to difference in electron density(like delta minus delta plus) , electronegativity , ? or something ? idk)</p>

              For cell diagram (aka cell notation), anode has to be on the left. For diagram of the cell, it doesn't matter. "Cell Diagram" is not the same as "Diagram of the Cell".<p>You should use single arrow, not double-half arrow.</p>

              Your F is wrong (no chiral C atom), hence your E is also wrong.<p>It's fine to use &gt; or &lt;, as long as it is made clear the characteristic that you're basing your ranking on, eg. specify clearly in words : "from most basic to least basic" or "from least basic to most basic", etc. In fact, after writing this, you can use comma to separate the species, instead of the &lt; or &gt; sign, which may accidentally confuse yourself and screw up your answer accidentally.</p>

              Q8 : Polished = low surface area, not suitable for electrolysis.<br>Platinized = coated with (melted-on) platinum powder to give a high surface area, suitable for electrolysis.<p>Q13 : Yes, limited water. Since excess water can't give you an answer, so be exam-smart and think "limited water". Always choose the best answer, even if all 4 options are not totally correct. With limited water, only AlCl3 gives Al(OH)3 and HCl(g), MgCl2 is too weakly acidic to generate HCl(g) (which only occurs for strongly acidic species like the other 3 options).

              <p>My thinking is that there can't be 8 stereoisomers because there can only be 4 permutations with which the substituents can be arranged around C1 and C2.

                      Hi Gohby,<p>This stereochemistry involved in this question goes beyond the H2 syllabus, so notice that Cambridge doesn't specifically ask the candidate how many stereoisomers exist in total, or ask the candidate to draw all of them out.</p><p>The reason for this, is that for cyclic molecules like this, some of the geometric isomers overlap with the optical isomers (eg. a trans isomer may also be an R isomer, with the exact same stereochemistry), and you cannot double count them.</p><p>As an analogy, if you have an apple, a (red) pen, and a (round) pineapple, and you're asked to count how many objects you have, while it is true that apple is red, and the apple is round, that doesn't mean you have 4 objects (ie. you cannot double count apple as "red apple" and also as "round apple"), because you only have 3 objects in total (ie. there is overlap between the "red" and the "round" properties).</p><p>In conclusion, due to overlap between optical and geometrical isomerism for this molecule (which H2 students needn't worry too much about, as it's beyond the syllabus), there are only 4 stereoisomers in total, not 8.</p><p>No prob, Gohby :)

                  Tis a common trick question.<p>You have to use molar solubility to compare solubilities. You can only directly use solubility products as a shortcut to compare solubilities, provided the stoichiometry of the ions in the ionic compound are the same.</p><p>Since SrCO3 (ie. 1 cation : 1 anion) has a different stoichiometry of ions, compared to SrF2 (ie. 1 cation : 2 anions), you cannot simply use solubility products as a shortcut to compare solubilities, but must instead separately calculate the molar solubilities of each ionic compound, to compare solubilities.

              All metal cations with high cationic charge densities can form coordination complexes, certainly not limited to transition metals.<p>If you're an A grade student who has practiced hundreds of TYS and Prelim papers to expose yourself to a large variety of questions, you would already be familiar with such coordination complexes across the periodic table, even those not mentioned within the basic syllabus requirements.
