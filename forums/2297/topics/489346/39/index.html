                  Yes, obviously. Lys-Ser and Ser-Lys amino acid residues certain do exist. But R group interactions do not usually exist between adjacent amino acid residues, and are far more important and meaningful (in terms of tertiary structure enabling biological function) when they occur between non-adjacent amino acid residues, as is mostly the case.

                  <p>Yes Ultima, exactly. Whole class was taught  wrongly.
                  Ultima, that's why i am very very thankful ,of you, helping us type
                  out, and more importantly,  Elaborate out All(small and big,
                  important and the nitty gritty ) the Details, and Most Importantly,
                  teach and correct us  to learn the correct and right
                  education. </p>
                  <p>my only regret is i didn't discover BFJC earlier.</p>
                  <p>I Feel Very Frustrated and sad that I've discovered so much that
                  I've learnt throughout my life, is wrong. Happy because at least i
                  discover it. </p>
                  <p>i am very thankful that i receive education from BFJC, one of
                  the only true educators and education.</p>
                  <p> Another important skill I've acquired from BFJC is to
                  learn to suspect and question and double check if something is
                  taught wrong, and i seek clarification via books, online, and
                  forums.</p>
                  <p>some people don't even know they're learning the wrong
                  things(like me in the past, receive without critically evaluating
                  and discerning what I've learnt ), and once they discover,they'll
                  be angry and happy.</p>
                  <p>for me, I haven't been doubting Chem stuffs I've learnt until
                  this year, it's late, i wished i was more inquisitive and a
                  critical thinker last time, but better late than never</p>

                  Very good, but at the end of the day, you still need to bring home to bacon. Being physically incarnate, the highest pinnacle of success necessitates success in all aspects of your life.<p>This includes academia. Even if you've now grown to understand Chemistry more deeply than your school mates, but at the end of the day, if you still fail to perform under examination conditions, and still fail to score an A grade (or whatever grade is to your personal satisfaction, for whatever goal), it means you've failed and disappointed yourself (not others), in that you've not lived up to your maximum potential.</p><p>For your own sake, don't disappoint yourself. Get the grade you know you can, for this year's upcoming A levels.</p>

              If the previous H bonding, the NH2 behaved as H bond acceptor, upon protonation, that particular H bond would be broken, and since the new R group interaction (eg. new ionic bond formed another amino acid R group, or new H bond formed with another amino acid R group with NH3+ as H bond donor) differs from the previous R group interaction, the tertiary structure has changed, and we say the protein has been denatured.

              See see see?!? Again, I bet your school didn't teach you properly. This is one of the all too common misconceptions suffered by Singapore JC students.<p>When pressure is changed (by changing the volume of the container), the molarities and partial pressures of the reactants and products change, hence because Kc &amp; Kp doesn't change (since temperature doesn't change), and Qc &amp; Qp now changes, hence position of equilibrium shifts, so as to allow Qc &amp; Qp to equalize with Kc &amp; Kp, to re-establish equilibrium.</p><p>In other words, position of equilibrium shifts BECAUSE Kc &amp; Kp doesn't change. Geddit? U think ur school mates truly understand this concept / topic, when even u urself are confused?

              Write out the FULL names for the 3 types of van der Waals forces. Then if you understand the true nature of chemical bonding, the other type of ion - dipole interaction becomes obvious.

              God exists, it's just that religion (ie. all religions) got the definition of God wrong. Or if you prefer, whether God exists or not, depends on how you define God.
