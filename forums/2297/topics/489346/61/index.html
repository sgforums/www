                                        Due to the restricted rotation of the sigma bonds within the bicyclic ring (if u dunno why the ring must be bicyclic, go ask ur school teacher or private tutor), it's impossible to have 2^2 optical stereoisomers (considering only the 2 chiral carbons); instead the configuration is fixed at either RS or SR or RR or SS (u can work out exactly which urself, using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules). And therefore its mirror image will be SR or RS or SS or RR (respectively). That's why the YJC answer considered both chiral carbons as just one chiral carbon, instead of 2, when working out no. of stereoisomers.<p>I suspect u still won't understand this, so u better go ask ur school teacher or private tutor. Move on.</p>

              It's not that they cannot be separated using distillation, but the process will be less effective compared to when the boiling points are more significantly different, as in options 1 &amp; 2 (ie. H bonds vs van der Waals). But more pertinently, in this qn, the answer already specified it's becoz they need to product to have lower, not higher, boiling point, compared to the reactant.

              If it's a bicyclic ring (such as in this case), then yes. If u don't understand why it has to be a bicyclic ring, go ask ur school teacher or private tutor.

              Both u and YJC teacher made an error here (urs way more coconaden and unforgivable!).<p>U coconaden, anhydrous doesn't mean no solvent! The reactant is solvated (not solid) and thus can exists in a solution, just not with water (ie. not aqueous solution, a non-aqueous solution lah)!</p><p>The solvent has to be inert (ie. no protic OH or NH groups), so that it won't use up the PCl5 or SOCl2 reagent.</p><p>The YJC teacher's error : if it's an aprotic solvent which won't react with PCl5 or SOCl2, then neither will [H+] in solution increase, and hence there'll be no change in pH.</p><p>But for A level purposes, Cambridge may willingly commit the same 'error' as ur YJC teacher (ie. they may set this same qn), coz they don't expect A level H2 students to think deeply enough to recognize this as an error.</p>

                              <p>can i say it's disproportionation redox, acid base reaction?</p>
                              <p>Aldehydes can undergo rxn with NaOH(aq) just like that by itself
                              without heat? do we need to know that aldehydes can ketone can
                              react with strong bases?</p>

                              <p>have five sets of two-adjacent chiral carbons in a ring, total
                              of 7 such carbons in this case</p>
                              <p>which set of two-adjacent chiral carbons can only produce 2

                              <p>how many stereo optical isomers are there in this molecule?</p>

                              U coconaden! That's the Cannizzaro reaction lah! (pronounced machiam hokkien KAN-NI-ZAR-RO). Overall the only acceptable adjective is redox disproportionation (or disproportionation redox, Cambridge accepts either) reaction. It involves a hydride H- transfer, followed by a proton H+ transfer at the end. So to say it's a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base proton transfer, rather than more accurately a redox disproportionation reaction, is misleading and credit unworthy.<p>Due to the bicyclic rings, 4 chiral C atoms are 'merged' into 2 chiral C atoms, as far as calculation of stereoisomers are concerned. </p><p>However, because this is considered beyond A levels, hence in the A level exam, especially if it's MCQ, you may have to consider either possibility as correct (ie. Cambridge may think A level students aren't smart enough to understand or recognize the problematic bicyclic ring circumstance, and so the 'correct' answer may actually be the 'wrong' one; so if both possibilities appear as different options, then u jia lat liao).</p><p>If it's a P2 or P3 qn, the exam-smart BedokFunland JC student will give both possible answers, with qualifications and explanations.</p><p>Besides, this question (and hopefully Cambridge's questions) only asked for how many chiral C atoms, instead of asking how many stereoisomers are possible.</p>

              <p>The YJC teacher's error : if it's an aprotic solvent which won't

              <p>But for A level purposes, Cambridge may willingly commit the

              <p>ok dafuq, means we do tick the option as Correct in the exam, that anhydrous socl2 will result in a decrease in pH of the soln , even though we know that it won't, in a inert soln(e.g. ccl4)? force yourself get confused like this, not healthy</p>
              <p>and is it like Since we know socl2 or pcl5 must react in anhydrous condition, if Cambridge present the question similar to above, do u think they expect us to think that the solvent must be inert?</p>

              <p>wow, i hope they want us to select the correct Chemistry option, if this unfortunate event happens. i will take my chances and gamble or give or take that 1 mark away and shade the correct Chemistry answer </p>
