              <p>Instead of recommend an Private diploma, I would recommend an Part-time Polytechnic Diploma for business studies.Let face it, local poly diploma are just like our Pink IC and it qualification will give definately us the edge in workforce since most of the poly module are industry focus.Also for those people who attend commerical school before should know that most of the lecturer are "freelance" and some are even local poly holder themselves.That why our Diploma in  Business Management from Nanyang Polytechnic is the best choice you can get.I would list down the point in the advantage and the disadvantage and you can weight them yourself :</p>
              <p>Advantage :</p>
              <p>1) Firstly nowaday, except for the final years examaination, most Practical test are "open-booked".In fact there is a saying in Nanyang Polytechnic that "Unless you tried very hard to fail, then you will fail".However if you don't understand a thing in the lesson, even when you bring an encyclopedia it a waste of time.</p>
              <p>2) If you are not the type who can memorized fact and scored in written examination, you can still survived by scoring well for the quiz, assignment and Project to pass your module.</p>
              <p>3) Finally, do you know that it is VERY CHEAP To study in NYP? This year 2009, for 6 months,or 1 semester, it only cost about S$720.This might be due to the WDA subsidy and this is the best budget you can find for your education.</p>
              <p>4) For the benefit of those who are ITE Holder, you can apply as well as they will accept you regardless of GPA Point.</p>
              <p>The disadvantage :</p>
              <p>1) It is long, need 4 years to complete part-time.</p>
              <p>2) Don't expect that if you have any doubt, you can still back after 9:30 p.m to consult your teacher as all the PC in the lab will be closed actually at 9:30 P.M.</p>
              <p>3) If you are "O" level holder, you need 1-7 Grade for English, for Science and Mathematics it is 1-6 Point.If you are not at this category,you can still study for NYP 's Certificate in Business &amp; Commerce before you continue your path to their diploma.(another long path).Otherwise as their website mention Other qualifications which will be considered for equivalency on a case-by-case basis or you can try your luck to write in for appeal.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Register for NS - FAQ - Deferment for Overseas Studies</span></span></strong><br><br><strong>Q1. Can I apply for deferment to pursue an overseas course?</strong></p>
              <p>To be eligible for deferment to pursue an overseas course, you must be able to commence on your full-time overseas course before the age of 17 1/2 years. A bank guarantee of a minimum of S$75,000/- or 50% of the combined annual gross income of both parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher, is needed. No deferment will be granted for degree studies.</p>
              <p><strong>Q2. Is any monetary bond required by MINDEF for Overseas studies?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes. A bank guarantee of a minimum of $75,000/- or 50% of the combined annual gross income of both parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher, is required. You must also be able to commence on your overseas course before you are 17 1/2 years old.</p>
              <p>However, if you are accompanying your parents on overseas employment, you are only required to be bonded by deed instead of providing a monetary bond.</p>
