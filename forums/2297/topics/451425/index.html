              <p>Alwyn, Corriane, Keith and Zavier have a total of 1026 marbles. If Corriane gives away 60 of her marbles, she will have 1/4 of the marbles Alwyn has. If keith buys another 150 marbles, he will have 1/2 the number of marbles Alwyn has. If Zavier doubles what he has,he will have the same number of marbles as Alwyn.  How many marbles does Corriane have at first?</p>

              <p>Hello <a href="/users/97745">a1111967,</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bvFKP.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="178"></p>
              <p>Initially, Corraine, Alwyn, Keith and Zavier have 1026 Marbles in total.</p>
              <p>Since the question involves some transaction of marbles, i shall use the information given.</p>
              <p>If Corraine gave away 60 marbles, she would have <span style="color: #ff6600;">1/4 or what Alwyn has, thus, Corraine - 60 = 1/4 of what Alwyn has</span>, which means <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 Unit for corraine, 4 units for Alwyn.<br><span style="color: #003300;">Note that the "60" in the model denotes what has been given away by corraine</span><br></span></p>
              <p>If keith bought 150 marbles, he would have 1/2 of what Alwyn has, thus, <span style="color: #ff6600;">Keith + 150 = 1/2 of what Alwyn has</span>, which means <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 Units for Keith, 4 units for Alwyn(This is because from the previous step, Alwyn has 4 units, and now keith has half of what alwyn has)</span>. <span style="color: #003300;"><br>Note that the "150" in the model denotes the amount of marbles bought by keith</span></p>
              <p>Now if zavier doubles what he has, he would have the same number of marbles as Alwyn. From this statement, we can say that if he<span style="color: #808000;"> DID NOT</span> double his quantity of marbles, he would have half of what alwyn has. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Therefore, Zavier has 2 Units -- 1/2 of what alwyn has</span></p>
              <p>Given all these information, we can see that:<br><br>1026 - 60 + 150 = Total of 9 Units</p>
              <p>the - 60 is due of corraine giving away 60 marbles, and +150 comes frome keith buying an additional 150 marbles.</p>
              <p>9 units comes from the model drawing (after the giving away and addition of marbles)</p>
              <p>1026 - 60 + 150 = 9 U<br>9U = 1116<br>1U = 124<br><br>From the model, we can see that Corraine originally has 1Unit + 60 Marbles. <br><br>Thus, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No. of marbles Corraine have = 124 + 60 = 184 Marbles</span></span></strong></p>
