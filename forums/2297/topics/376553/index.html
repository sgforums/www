              <p>YJC will be the only JC willing to take you in, though you might have to appeal for it. But unless you are willing to work very hard for your GP, otherwise it is unadvisable that you take the JC route.</p>
              <p>As for poly, perhaps you will like to tell us what field of study you are interested in, or what personal interests you have.</p>

              <p>My strengths is maths. I like things that are related  to maths, programming, network security, data algorithms. Stuffs related to IT also interest me very much. Jobs like IT professional, computer software engineers are interesting too. These need computer science. But there are a lot of choices leh.</p>
              <p>And ya, my english is really cmi one, almost no hope liao, just like my combine humans. Go JC sure cannot survive.</p>

              <p>i think you should improve your english before you wanna work as a IT professional ...and the curriculum in junior colleges helps you to improve on your english. I hate to say this, but in polytechnics, there is a high probability that the standard of your english will stagnate during your 3 years as there are no english lessons </p>
              <p>in the meantime Han chiang, work hard for your english and you will be able to fulfil your career aspirations </p>

              <p>If your aim is just to enter a local uni, then go ahead and aim to enter poly ( except RP ) instead. But do note that the downside is that if you regret later, you will also be unable to make a U-turn into other degree courses from other fields.</p>

              <p>Poly can get you 0/5-1 yr exemptions in local uni so that will offset the cost slightly since local uni cost 6k a year which is the same as 3 yrs in poly.</p>
              <p>With a poly diploma, you can still go out and get a decent job while an A's cert will not. A poly dip gives you the option of going to uni or going to work while the A's cert only gives you the option of going to uni. Thats all providing your results are good enough for uni be in JC or poly.</p>
              <p>All the 5 polys offer IT courses but their area of focus and specialisations might differ slightly. Rather than look at the names, go look into the course modules and see which has the types of modules that interest you and make your selection from there.</p>

              <p>You go poly. Firstly.. because your english not good, so if you managed to get C6 and get into a JC, that does not mean in JC you will be able to do well for GP. You might just be lucky to get C6 for O level and die all the way in GP in JC. You will suffer if you english is really not good and esp if you have no confidence at all.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you go poly is because poly does not care about your english standard for some courses. At least a D7 would get you into most course. Anything worst than a D7 might restrict you to only a handful of courses.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, poly counts L1R4, and not R5. Therefore you can remove your combine humans and DnT, thus your L1R4 is 13, considering your english is D7, and 13 is quite good (better than mine)</p>
              <p>Fourthly, when you graduate from poly, at least you got a diploma and if ya cant enter uni, then at least with a dip you can get a decent job. Imagine you go JC, then cant enter uni, you are stucked with an A level cert. You might even need to go thru poly. Worst scenario is you failed A level and that is wasting 2 years or 3 years (plus retake still fail) of you life.</p>
              <p>Dont care about the money, poly is considered cheap as compared to university.</p>
              <p>Dont worry, I once had the same dilemma as yours. I wanted to go JC on one hand and poly on the other. In the end I chose Poly and I never regretted. Poly studies taught me alot of things and its considered the best years of my education. I graduated and went to local university. It isnt that hard to get from poly to local university. JC route does not guarantee you a direct university route anymore.</p>
              <p>And also, if you wanna buck up on your english, poly have some sort english tests which you need to take. If you fall below a certain level i think you might need to take some english lessons. But then again, the test is very easy.</p>
              <p>My last 3 reasons for you to go to poly instead of JC are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Better food</li>
              <li>No need wear uniforms (unless you got uniform fetish)</li>
              <li>CHIO BUS!!!!!!!!</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>JC girls more guai? LOL</p>
              <p>I can tell you based on proportion there are more JC girls who try to mimick western culture and are extremely open to different sexual ideas. And they are generally more havoc.</p>
              <p>Based on experience, a JC girl is easier to pick up in a club or bar than a poly girl.</p>

              <p>since you think computing is for you, i would suggest you take up private classes for the basic stuff first after your o-levels, do programming languages like C or java...some cc have such courses, cheap and a good way for you to get a feel of things....</p>
              <p>C is the basis of many programming platforms and java is the key to many modern application driven software such as phone apps and other gadgets, this is the future of things....once you have a great handle in programming, create your own creative portfolio, the academic cert that comes along then becomes just a decor on the wall....</p>
              <p>best wishes...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i would suggest you to try and improve your english, and aim for a JC. i am a poly student and is regretting big time, and is planning to move over to JC. firstly, don't keep thinking that it is extremely hard for you to enter uni if u chose the JC route, in fact it is harder to enter uni if u choose the poly route. this is provided you plan to go to a uni. Secondly, choose poly unless you are sure that you are very interested in that field, and would not have any regrets later on. looking at your results, i would suggest you to aim at engineering courses since your maths is strong, and engineering courses do not need much english. good luck</p></div>

              <p>Sell your soul to MOE like I did. You will need not worry about money then.</p>
              <p>Of course, you must like teaching kids, or you will suffer...</p>
              <p>Agenda's reason to go JC is .... -__-''</p>
              <p>JC is for those who either want to keep their choices open or aim to enter medicine, law and other similar faculties. Such faculties are a bit bias, as you can see from the fact that only 2 poly students manage to enter NUS medicine thus far...</p>

              <p>seriously, if you think you will struggle, forget about JC.</p>
              <p>looking at your subject combination of combined sciences, most school will not allow you to take H2 pure science subjects, with the exception of h2 math. thus, you will end up in an arts class.</p>
              <p>as for Arts, most likely you will choose between history, lit, geography or chinese lit, with the first 3 being demanding on your english proficiency.</p>
              <p>It is not guranteed that by going JC, you will get to go uni. less than half the JC corhort get to enter ntu, nus or smu.Yes, with A levels, you have a much higher chance than poly grads to enter local uni, but are you sure you can make the cut to enter uni? cos if you do not, an A level cert is practically worthless outside, unlike a diploma.</p>
              <p>and if you enter Jc as an arts student, you will be restricted to only the arts subject in uni, e.g. econs, law, biz, mass comms etc.</p>
              <p>in poly, if you managed to get into a science-based course like engineering or science, and if you did well, you will still stand a chance to enter the respective courses in uni.</p>
              <p>I just want to point out these for you to make ur own decision.</p>
              <p>Good luck for ur O levels!</p>
