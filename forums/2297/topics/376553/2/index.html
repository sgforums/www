              <p>Depending on the course TS is intending to go into. There are advantages and disadvantages for people from either instituition and alot depends on how much effort they put in to counter their 'weakness'</p>
              <p>Anyway, i can assure you even though JC students have done H2 maths, it does not mean they are surely better in uni maths. I still have seen JC girls who just graduated from JC to go uni and do very badly in their maths.</p>

              <p>If you take engineering, you will still have to study physics and engineering maths :]</p>
              <p>Depends on what kind of engineering you take, some of them include programming. :]</p>
              <p>Don't worry about the school fees, they can be deducted from your parent's CPF, which you will then repay them when you start working. There are plenty of grants , bursaries. If your results are good enough, you can apply to be a scholar. </p>
              <p>Life in poly is, I would say, Fun. You work hard (yes, you do have to study hard) and you play hard. (everything can be found in campus - that includes LAN gaming, Swimming pools, jogging tracks, tennis courts ,K box ect ect.)</p>
              <p>School hours for mine, start at 8.30am in the mornings and end at about 5pm in the evenings with a 1 to 1 1/2 hour of lunch break in between).  There would be days where lectures/ practicals/tutorials start later, and end earlier. This has to depend on the course that you will take.</p>
              <p>For Engineering, there are 3 types of  lessons - Lectures, Practicals and Tutorials.</p>
              <p>Lecturers are normal secondary school teaching.</p>
              <p>Practicals go hand in hand with lectures, which enable you to practice/proof what you have learnt during the lectures. </p>
              <p>Tutorials are periods where you would have free time with your lecturer to ask Questions, do assignments.</p>
              <p>Now, you might wonder what is the main difference from being in Secondary school.</p>
              <p>This would be quite a big transition.</p>
              <p>The main difference is, that you are given the freedom to do whatever you like. (Msn/Facebook/Gaming). However, at the end of the day, slacking all the long, will cause you to struggle, and get bad grades.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCAs are normally in the late afternoons/ evenings or weekends.</p>
              <p>I have never regretted going into poly. :]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>I would think poly is better than JC because you can get a diploma , and if you want to get into the university , you just need to work hard, I've come across many poly students who are in NUS now and they mentioned that its not that difficult to get in. Further more, in poly you will be doing a course that you like, compared to in JC where you will be studying the standard subjects... just my 2 cents worth</p>

              <p>Poly you can play hard as well as study hard. Its exactly the same as uni so if you feel you cannot handle that, go local uni it won't change and i would say local uni often students are more wild.</p>
              <p>Poly lecturers will rarely chase you to do your tutorials, if you don't do thats your problem so you need be discipline to do your own work but the workload is ALOT less than JC.</p>

              <p>I think your English is actually okay, but I believe you have a mental barrier in the language - a lack of confidence. You think you are no good, therefore you become no good.</p>
              <p>Probably, you don't know how to start in your composition/essay, not confident that you can actually write. Just get your pen and start writing. Do a simple intro and off you go! English is also a subject that can be studied and has to be studied and practised Not too late to learn. You can do it!</p>

              <p>TS, your double maths and combined science scored A1, but you failed humanities and english.</p>
              <p>Try as hard as you can for english, because achieving 3 A1s for sciences and maths is rather impressive and it shows you can be the "studying" sort, and that means that JC should be managable and better for you.</p>

              <p>And to add on, Uni can be more pressurising than JC on the Project Work side, as JC has less project work-related stuffs. In JC, I just have to work hard, study, revise, and the results come quite naturally.</p>
              <p>No doubt, for modules of my academic subject(Maths), I am doing very well. But when it comes to other teaching modules such as educational psychology and such, I have to worry about Presentations and such as I don't have that much experience in JC. Oh, and presentation of answers during JC doesn't really counts.</p>

              <p>TS, your double maths and combined science scored A1, but
              you failed humanities and english.</p>
              <p>Try as hard as you can for english, because achieving 3 A1s for
              sciences and maths is rather impressive and it shows you
              can be the "studying" sort, and that means that JC should be
              managable and better for you.</p>
              <p>Practice TYS and read model essays for English.</p>
              <p>I recommend JC and not Poly. Good luck.</p>

              <p>If TS fails GP in JC, he cannot promote at all. Even if he gets As for all other subjects but fail GP, he still fails. Its safer for him to go poly where english is not something that will affect your pass/fail in poly. Even in uni, all you have to do is pass a basic english proficiency test and does not require really good english to get your degree.</p>

              <p>And to add on, Uni can be more pressurising than JC on the
              Project Work side, as JC has less project work-related stuffs. In
              JC, I just have to work hard, study, revise, and the results come
              quite naturally.</p>
              <p>No doubt, for modules of my academic subject(Maths), I am doing
              very well. But when it comes to other teaching modules such as
              educational psychology and such, I have to worry about
              Presentations and such as I don't have that much experience in JC.
              Oh, and presentation of answers during JC doesn't really
              counts.</p>

              <p>Uni project work depends on the modules. Engineering base modules tend to have less project work since there is the lab component. The arts and social science modules without lab are the 1s with alot of project work.</p>

              <p>If your aim is just to enter a local uni, then go ahead and aim

              <p>Another reason could be due to their O's results. RP tends to take in much weaker students compared to the other 4 polys.</p>
              <p>For poly grad to enter uni, 25% of the score for uni admission comes from O's and 75% from poly results. This makes a student's O's very imporant for local uni entry as 25% is a very siginificant contribution.</p>
