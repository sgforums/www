              <p>hey guys, sorry for always posting here about JC stuff.</p>
              <p>I want to transfer from my current school (top JC in Singapore) to a mid-tier JC. I applied to three and only one replied, saying if I am shortlisted I will sit for a test( they haven't contacted me yet). The other two ignored my emails even if I sent to their principal DIRECTLY.</p>
              <p>Now, I'm confused why they won't accept me. I thought if I transfer from top JC, they should be considering me before the O Level students? Not to sound arrogant or anything, but that's what I would do if I'm the principal.</p>
              <p>I have very good reasons for transferring. Being the panaroid person I am , I listed down a few points why they won't accept me:</p>
              <p>1. I repeated sec 4</p>
              <p>2. I got so-so grades in the repeat year</p>
              <p>3. last year when i first heard the news i was gonna repeat sec 4, I went to apply to their schools and probably annoyed the hell out of them by calling everyday and sending 20 emails</p>
              <p>So, what should I do now? Wait till posting?</p>

              <p>so you repeated sec 4, and your grades were so-so, and you managed to go into top JC...?</p>

              <p>1) Principals are super busy during this time period... CNY + JAE. There's seriously no point in looking at your appeal when there are so many other things to handle. </p>
              <p>2) You are already in a JC, and a top JC. JAE is to handle new people coming into the JC system, of course you can wait.</p>
              <p>3) In life, being paranoid and sending multiple emails does not look good. Persistency becomes irritation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my 2 cents</p>
              <p>and lastly, never ever need to be sorry for posting school stuff here. This is a forum for students afterall! :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>lol from dunman high? if you're from IP means you didnt take O levels and so they will look at your sec 4 results, even if you're from the best school but the weakest, no other 'mid-tier' JC will want you because every school wants the best students. You probably cant ride on the brand name of your current school to get into another school because you are failing.</p></div>

              <p>I sympathise with your situation.</p>
              <p>But to <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">expect </span></em>that those JCs you applied to, will help, is a trifle unrealistic.</p>
              <p>In short, you dug the hole for yourself. This is the short brutal fact. If you are gonna try to dig yourself out, you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> expect someone to help you.</p>
              <p>So you thought writing to the principal will help? I think you know the answer to that now.</p>
              <p>I hope of course you won't have to pay any price for that decision of yours years bygone. </p>
              <p>But the reality is that you may now have to consider very drastic options, or grit your teeth and see this through.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
