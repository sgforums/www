              <p>Hi all, I'm new to this forum and would like some help regarding the choice of textbooks for JC (I'm taking H2 Phy/Chem/Math/Hist, and am planning to buy textbooks for Physics and Chemistry only)</p>
              <p>These are some that seemed to have great reviews:</p>
              <p><strong>Physics:</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cambridge Endorsed</span></p>
              <p>Bath Advanced Science: Physics</p>
              <p><em>Hutchings, R</em></p>
              <p>Advanced Physics</p>
              <p><em>Duncan, T</em></p>
              <p>Advanced Physics</p>
              <p><em>Adams, S and Allday, J</em></p>
              <p>International A/AS Level Physics</p>
              <p><em>Mee, C, Crundell, M, Arnold, B, and Brown, W</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non Cambridge Endorsed</span></p>
              <p>Physics (6th Edition)</p>
              <p><em>Giancoli</em></p>
              <p>A-Level Physics </p>
              <p><em>Roger Muncaster</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
              <p>A-Level Chemistry </p>
              <p><em>E.N.Ramsden</em></p>
              <p>Collins Advanced Science - Chemistry (3rd Edition)</p>
              <p><em>Chris Conoley and Phil Hills</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I very much leaning towards A-level Physics by Roger Muncaster and pretty much undecided for Chemistry. The downside of the book is that it seems pretty general, and since it is pretty outdated as well and used mostly in the UK as compared to in Singapore, it <em>might </em>(I haven't actually been able to find a single copy to refer to, so I'm not sure) not fit our syllabus - not that I mind if it does contain more, but I'm more afraid of the reverse.</p>
              <p>Therefore, should I spend my money on the Cambridge certified books instead, which should be a 'safer' bet? </p>
              <p>Anyone used the books mentioned above and are able to provide a review, or provide a better alternative than the textbooks listed above?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your help :)</p>

              <p><br>You're welcome.</p>
              <p>If you've the intention and ambition towards a Uni Science course (eg. Medicine), then while the Uni level books I recommend on my website might be a little costly, but they are more than worth it, provided you're up to the challenge (to best the 'A' levels, you need to go beyond the 'A' levels; commandos and special forces don't do basic training, because basic is not what they're about).</p>
              <p>If you can afford it, buy <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></strong> the Super Highly Recommended materials (which includes the best possible A level materials, plus about 5 or 6 Uni Chem textbooks) mentioned on my website, and select some (your preference) from the Highly Recommended materials as well.</p>
              <p>And feel free to post your H2 Chem questions here. But be warned, if you're not prepared to go beyond the basic 'A' level curriculum (ie. the basic stuff taught in JCs to H2 students), you might have some difficulty understanding my answers (particularly the conceptual ones).</p>

              <p>In truth, I am looking for a textbook that gives more coverage - at least in terms of depth - on the subject, thus the list of textbooks that you gave me should be really helpful to me. However, i do not have the budget to buy all the textbooks on the list, therefore of the list, cpuld you make special recommendations for 1, or at most 2 textbooks (I'm more interested in those with 'advanced', since i will most probably just be using them as a reference for additional knowledge to supplement my teacher's notes :D)</p>

              <p>Chem only</p>
              <p>1. Tutors notes should be enough, if not enough do buy CS Toh guide. That's should be more or less enough for the entire A level. Do read up on mechanisms like Gingrad reagent / acetone/ enol - carbonyl tautomerism / ether formation (2,4 - D)/ and etc </p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p> Ultimaonline's (aka BedokFunland JC) suggestions are very good. Just note that the 2 textbooks he suggested, are very good and are written in a highly academic prose. In terms of design and layout, they are not that attractive to a teenager. (The publisher is highly old school) C S Toh's guide book is written well, but is barely adequate to get someone a high B in the Cambridge exams and is a tad out of date already. Ramsden's textbook is grossly outdated already.</p>
              <p>You may like to visit your future JC's library to check out the textbooks in them.</p>
              <p>You may also like to buy one university organic chemistry textbook as indicated in Ultimaonline's website if you are interested in getting a distinction in your chemistry studies.</p>
              <p>Or you may obtain a top JC and a neighbourhood JC's lecture notes. A neighbourhood JC's chem lecture notes may be more basic and clearer in explaining fundamental concepts. A top JC lecture notes has more coverage beyond A level syllabus.</p>
              <p>Investment in good books is one of the best policies of ensuring relevance in this information age.</p>
