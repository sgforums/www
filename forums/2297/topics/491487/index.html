                  As you say, there are pros and cons, as far as boosting your portfolio. Hence to come to a decision, it's far more important to ask yourself which you would enjoy more. It'll be ultimately counter-productive if you make a decision based on 'boosting your portfolio', but that you may not enjoy, or downright makes you miserable. <p>For instance, if you're taking a H3 subject, exactly which H3 subjects are you considering, and have you checked out their syllabuses for comparison? If you can't find a H3 subject you'll enjoy, then join student council. And are you very clear on the commitments required of a student councilor? The time commitment required is likely to be even more demanding than most CCAs.

              <p>H3 subjects can be used for application of scholarships. H3 science may aid H2 sciences.</p>
              <p>Student councilors can be a fulfiling role as you develop your people skills. I heard from my ex-student that he was more functioning as an events co-ordinator as a student counselor in his JC.</p>
              <p>For those intending to do medicine in UK, students may volunteer at healthcare organisations or do some internship for medical research.</p>
              <p>So it is up to you to choose, depending on your goals and interests.</p>

              Correct. For Chemistry, I recommend H3 Organic Chemistry (more relevant and helpful for your H2 Chemistry) instead of H3 Pharmaceutical Chemistry, *unless* you intend to do Pharmacy or Medicine in the University.

              <p>Well aside from H3 research, H3 essentials of modern physics seems like a good subject to take since I prefer engineering to research.</p>
