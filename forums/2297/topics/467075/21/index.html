              <p>I shared the following on another Singapore forum :</p>
              <blockquote class="postcontent restore">I personally advise against jogging or running as a means to keep fit.<br><br>Jogging is bad for the knees (nobody's knees are spared in middle and old age), and running is bad for the heart (notice that everytime you read about someone suddenly collapsing and dying in the Straits Times, it's always either some NSF or NS man doing the 2.4km, or some young/middle-aged chap doing some public marathon).<br><br>Other than gym, two body-weight routines that train dozens of muscles of the upper body with excellent efficacy, are of course, pull ups (you can buy a pull-up bar cheaply and install it in your room/home; you can even find cheap pull-up bars these days that can be securely installed without any drilling or screws) and dips (a more advanced form of push ups; I've ingeniously come up with a way to do dips right at home, using the bai-ka (hokkien) walker that you can buy from any pharmacy or hospital).<br><br>And no worries about the height. Just bend/fold your knees/thighs in mid-air, such that your feet no longer touch the ground. Doing this additionally serves as a little bonus workout for your legs.<br><br><img src="http://i00.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/711/967/329/329967711_034.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br><img src="http://trishirmarketing.com/veejay-surgicals-trichy/img/folding-walker.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://www.discountramps.com/wcImages/invacare-paddle-walker.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://www.healthandhomecare.com/images/products/INV6281A.jpg" border="0" alt=""> </blockquote>

              <p class="first">The uncle of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un was executed by being eaten alive by 120 starving dogs along with his five closest aides, according to a report.</p>
              <p>A detailed account of the brutal execution - known as "quan jue", or execution by dogs - was revealed by the Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po, which acts as an official mouthpiece for mainland China.</p>
              <p>Unlike previous executions of political prisoners, killed by firing squads with machine guns, Jang Song-thaek was stripped naked and thrown into a cage with his aides.</p>
              <p>Then, 120 dogs which had been starved for three days, were "allowed to prey on them until they were completely eaten up," according to <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/asia-report/china/story/jangs-execution-bodes-ill-china-20131224"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">The Straits Times</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>The execution lasted one hour and was monitored by the dictator and 300 senior officials.</p>

              <p>“Brother, it is ok that we are sent back if we did not do good in our job. But it is not fair that we are sent back because we are unwilling to pay the agent money. Where is the justice?”<br><br>The Online Citizen (TOC) was earlier alerted to a story by one of our readers. She said that she had spoken with a town conservancy worker in her estate and was alarmed to know that he is going to be sent back to his country because he cannot pay the $5,000 agent fees being asked of him.<br><br>TOC met with the worker in Pasir Ris.<br><br>Arriving on site, this writer was greeted by a large group of workers who had stopped work for the day. Their faces were filled with anxiety. They were pretty quiet at first apart from a few who could speak English better. But when I asked more questions, they started to open up and shared their problems with me.<br><br>They have been working in the constituency for three years, and had paid a sum of $10,500 when they first came over to Singapore. Subsequently they paid another sum of $2,500 to extend their stay here for another one year. So according to them, they paid a total sum of $13,000 to work for the period of three years.<br><br>They said they are being paid about S$700 a month, work 7 days a week, with no rest on public holiday and have had no medical leave for three years.<br><br>So have they earned back their agent fees? “No, haven’t,” said the workers in unison. Apart from sending money back to their families, they also have to spend on living expenses in Singapore.<br><br>According to the workers, the main reason for their worries of being sent back is that they were told by their operation manager to pay their agent $5,000 first, or else new workers will be sent to replace them. Already two have been asked to leave and another, Rahman Hafizur, will be sent back on Saturday.<br><br>I asked if they have spoken to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) about this matter, and they said they did approach MOM once. They were shocked to know that the company is only supposed to pay $70 to renew their work permits and that there are no agent fees involved. Apart from that, MOM only advised them that if they were to pay the agent fees, they should get a copy of the receipt.<br><br>All of the workers I spoke to were filled with fear of being deported once the company found out they have spoken up publicly about it.<br><br>The residents whom I talked to were also concerned about this. They asked why these cleaners for being asked to leave despite doing a good job keeping the estate clean.<br><br>I called the operation manager of the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC Town Council </strong></span>and was asked to speak with the cleaning company directly instead. So I paid a visit to the company.<br><br>When asked if it knew that the workers were being asked to pay agent fees in order to remain in Singapore, the company replied firmly that it had no knowledge of the agency fees paid by the workers and that it is not aware that the workers were being asked to pay agent fees by their manager.<br><br>The company said that the worker whom I interviewed have requested to go back himself two weeks prior and that the worker had signed on a letter to indicate this. When asked to reproduce the letter, the company said that it is unable to pass a copy to TOC as it does not have a copy and asked me to refer to the worker for the copy. (I later checked with Rahman and he said that he did not sign any such letter.)<br><br>I then asked if the workers would be sent back like Rahman.<br><br>The company replied by asking me if it is justified for a company to send workers home if they are not performing well or if they do not have a good working attitude, and took many days of medical leave and official leave. Yes of course it is but to me, they did not answer the question at all.<br><br>I had sent them a video recording of an interview with the workers. The company responded, “The last claim that you made that workers are worried of suffering the same fate is not true because around 40% of the current workforce will be retained due to their responsible working attitude and performance.”<br><br>But the question is why did the company not issue the workers with warnings if their job performance or attitude were indeed bad, as the company claimed? When I checked with the workers, none of them had received any warning letters of any kind.<br><br>In fact, audio recordings of conversations between the workers and the company’s managers proved that the mangers were aware of the agent fees and had in fact asked the workers to pay the agent the fees. The first attempt to ask for the payment was in October and the workers were continuously asked to pay the amount till today, both in person and through phone calls.<br><br>The company also said that it conforms to MOM’s rules and that all of the workers work a six-day work week and are being paid overtime for work during public holidays. If they had any disputes with the company, they can go to MOM and ask for help.<br><br>Later, the company added another response to our query on the pay issue.<br><br>“Worker claimed to earn only $700.00 but bank statement proves to be more than $700.00, thus statement made by worker of company not paying PH or overtime is not correct,” the company said.<br><br>It said the workers are given payslips and timesheets to record the hours that they work. TOC asked if it could show us the copies of payslips and timesheets of the workers. It said it does not have a copy and told us to ask from the workers instead. When we did so, the workers, said there have not been any payslips issued to them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">TOC wrote to the Member of Parliament in charge of the ward, Mr Zainal Sapari, on 23rd December about this matter but he has not replied to our email at the time of writing. (</span><a href="http://2x43di7fqtr1359hx1tnjj0te6.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lettertompzainal.png"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">letter sent</span></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br></span></strong><br>The other 14 colleagues of Rahman fear for their jobs in Singapore even as they continue their work keeping the flats and estate spick and span.<br><br>Will they be sent home to Bangladesh, despite having done their job diligently and never gave anyone any problems?</p>

The 32-year-old insurance agent is still mired in the debt he incurred in October 2012.<br><br>He told The New Paper on Sunday: "This is the real regret. We struggle from month to month just to make ends meet."<br><br>The couple borrowed $45,000 from a financial institution with a repayment period of two years. They also borrowed $4,000 from a licensed moneylender and $11,000 from a relative. On top of that, they pumped in their entire savings of $20,000.<br><br>They also charged to their individual credit cards, said his wife, who wants to be known only as Mrs Lee. She estimates the charges were another $30,000.<br><br>The total sum? $110,000.<br><br>Said the housewife: "When we first did our calculations, we were confident that we could afford it.<br><br>"We gave ourselves a year or two, at the maximum, to work things out."<br><br>But what Mrs Lee, 28, did not count on was losing sleep over hounding debt collectors.<br><br>She slipped into depression about six months after her wedding, and finally quit her job as an insurance agent.<br><br>Her whims, she said, included having a bridal arch made with 999 fresh tulips from Holland, completed with a tulip-shaped balloon, for their wedding march-in. The arch cost nearly $12,000.<br><br>The wedding banquet was held at a six-star hotel in the Marina Bay area, with each of the 45 tables costing $1,688++.<br><br><br>Other costs included their bridal photography, make-up, hair-styling and videography.<br><br>They spent so much that Mrs Lee's other dream - a honeymoon in Europe - had to be put off. She said: "We ended up going to Genting Highlands for five days instead.<br><br>Mr Lee felt that they neglected to consider one important factor - that his relatives were not "high-class or rich folk".<br><br>"Our relatives are mostly ordinary people, not highly educated, and I think that is also why the hongbao collected eventually did not cover some of the table costs," he said.<br><br>To break even, the couple had to collect $200 from each guest, added Mrs Lee.<br><br>Trying to clear the debts has put a strain on the marriage and their relationship, Mr Lee said. "I think we have had more fights since we got married than in the six years that we were dating.<br><br>"Most times, it was over money...and we'd end up blaming each other for the situation."<br><br>The couple have made lifestyle changes to ease the strain on the pocket. He said: "We spend most of our time watching television at home, or going to the nearby park for our regular jogs."<br><br>But the lesson is one that both have committed to memory, so much so that they took the trouble to sit a mutual friend's daughter down for a talk.<br><br>Mrs Lee said: "She was planning a lavish wedding in Sentosa, and wanted to include fireworks, among other things. And the couple were intending to get a few loans from their family and friends.<br><br>"I told them: 'Look at me, I went down the path like a fool and I am still paying for the expensive lesson. Why walk down the same road as us?'"<br></span></span></p></div>

              <p>Compare $110K wedding versus $1K wedding. Both couples earn about the same total combined income, but one couple spent 100x more money on their wedding. Which couple do you think is *much* happier now?</p>

                  <p><strong>Confession pages are all the rage. Here is STOMP's choice of confession of the day.</strong></p>
                  <p>Today's confession is from a girl in RJC, whose mother unhappy with everything she does and calls her "bimbotic" for wearing shorts. </p>
                  <p>Here is the confession in full:</p>
                  <p>"I can't stand it anymore. My mother is so unbearably hard to understand.</p>
                  <p>"She says I can't wear bright colours and sleeveless clothing because it's "bimbotic".</p>
                  <p>"She also disapproves of me wearing shorts which are knee-length because apparently they are too short for her!</p>
                  <p>"Also, when I saw a documentary on poor people in India and I burst out crying, she scolded me for being a "bleeding heart" and said that I was annoyingly pathetic for being so emotional.</p>
                  <p>"The worst was when she kept saying I was a "bimbo" and was "PC" (politically correct) for joining PB (prefect buddy) in secondary school and for thinking about joining Council.</p>
                  <p>"I really, really can't stand it anymore, she criticises me in this way every day!</p>
                  <p>"I feel really awful.</p>
                  <p>"Is there anyone out there who can provide some advice? How should I talk to her?</p>
                  <p>"I'm so scared of talking to her cause she'll just call me a bimbo again."</p>

              <p>The <strong>Mpemba effect</strong>, named after Erasto Mpemba, is the assertion that, in some circumstances, hot water can freeze faster than cold water. Although there is anecdotal support for the effect, there is no agreement on exactly what the effect is and under what circumstances it occurs. There have been reports of similar phenomena since ancient times, although with insufficient detail for the claims to be replicated.</p>
              <p>The phenomenon seems contrary to intuition, but a number of possible explanations for the effect have been proposed. Further investigations will need to decide on a precise definition of "freezing" and control a vast number of starting parameters in order to confirm or explain the effect.</p>
              <p>The behaviour seems contrary to natural expectation but many explanations have been proposed to explain the claimed effect.</p>

              <p><em>A Singaporean Indian posted on this FaceBook :</em></p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported today that "a crowd of more than 100 people, mostly foreign workers, refused to leave Rex Cinemas at Mackenzie Road, after the theatre cancelled the premiere of a movie on Thursday night" (link:<a href="http://bit.ly/1d2XMad"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://bit.ly/1d2XMad</span></span></a>). I was there.<br><br>Although most of people who had bought the tickets were foreign workers, it would have been better if they are identified as movie-goers, and as hardcore fans of a Tamil superstar Ajith.<br><br>The moviegoers did not refuse to go for no reason. They wanted to watch the first show of this movie premiered anywhere in the world. They said that they don't mind waiting. They only wanted to know when the first show will screened and wanted the theatre manager to say when the movie will premiere.<br><br>The theatre manager at first said that the movie is embargoed from release in India and that is why they could not screen it. The moviegoers called out his bluff. If it is embargoed in India, what has that got to do with the screening here? Some of these moviegoers said that they had queued up from 8am today till 6pm, when the ticketing booth was opened to get the tickets for this premiere, and that the theatre manager should be truthful to them.<br><br>Even then, the moviegoers did not turn rowdy. This was when the police arrived. The police used words like "dei!, dei! move out! move out!" Which I thought was very disrespectful to the moviegoers.<br><br>This was when I approached the police officer talking loudly to the moviegoers. He tried to talk loudly to me (thinking I was a foreign worker). I told the officer that I am a Singaporean. <br><br>At this juncture, the police officer lowered his voice, but still tried to get his point across without wanting to listen to me. I insisted to the police officer that I am willing to listen to him, but that he should listen to me first to understand the situation there better before shouting instructions to the moviegoers.<br><br>The police officer agreed and I told him what had happened, and why the moviegoers request was reasonable. The police officer agreed and said that he will speak with the theatre manager.<br><br>After speaking with the theatre manager, the police officer came back to address the crowd of moviegoers to say that the theatre manager is very kind and would give the moviegoers a chop on their tickets, which will allow them to watch two movies with that one ticket.<br><br>The crowd of moviegoers did not understand what the police officer was saying, and the police officers did not understand what the moviegoers were saying in broken English. It was at this juncture that I volunteered to interpret. And the police officers agreed. <br><br>I told the moviegoers about the offer of the theatre manager, and the moviegoers said that they did not want to watch two movies, but only wanted to watch the first show of this movie. I explained the wishes of the moviegoers to the police officers. <br><br>At no time were the moviegoers rowdy. They were very reasonable. But I can understand how the problem could have escalated if the wishes of the moviegoers were not properly conveyed to the police officers. Even the police officers said that it was a reasonable request and said that they would speak to the theatre managers again.<br><br>It was at this juncture that a more senior person in charge of the theatre arrived. He spoke to the police officers and explained why he could not accede to their requests.<br><br>When the moviegoers realised that a more senior person had arrived, they gathered around him, but not in a threatening manner. Only to listen to what he has got to say as he spoke in a very soft voice. The police then told the moviegoers not to crowd around, and remember the riot in Little India.<br><br>Taking the cue from the police officers, the senior person appealed to the moviegoers in Tamil that they were all Tamilians, and should not let the shame of Tamilians which happened in Little India in December repeat itself.<br><br>I felt that there was no necessity for the police officers and the senior person in charge of the theatre to bring up the Little India riot in a matter where the contention was if the moviegoers would be able to watch the premiere of their cinema idol. I felt that things were not going anywhere and left.<br><br>Ravi Philemon</p>

Sometimes I even worked till 3 am. <strong>3 months past and a fresh Indonesian grad was hired instead. I remained a contract worker with no benefits while the MNC continue to be filled with expats and cheap workers.</strong> I asked why I was not converted. Their reason: tight on budget. After enduring months of agony with empty promises, I left.<br><br><br><strong>The next company, same thing happened, this time it was 2 fresh grads – a M’sian and a PRC.</strong> Once more, no conversion due to ‘tight’ budget. I was hired on a freelance basis instead even though I worked the same full time hours with OT (no OT pay), so they don’t have to pay my CPF.<br><br><br>The next place,<strong> I was told by the Malaysian boss who is a Singapore PR that no company would want to hire me because I’m a parent, and that my asking salary ($2600 as a senior executive with 6 yrs experience) was way too high. </strong>He replaced me and a fellow senior exec (also a Singaporean with same work experience length as me, but at $3000) with 2 young fresh grads who commanded $1800 each.<br><br>I worked for a subsidiary company owned by a local MNC here for a while before being threatened to be fired, because I was not working ‘fast’ enough (I was doing 2-people job and had to supervise the juniors under me as well since the company was reluctant to hire extra help that I asked for), despite the super long hours. <strong>This lady boss even expected us to keep quiet about the fact she was hiring a fresh Indonesian grad illegally before her S-Pass was approved</strong>, since the head company would not allow this. We were understaffed too and Singaporeans were way too expensive for her to hire. I could not endure the abuse further, especially the lies that the management fed her about me since they didn’t like me giving them honest feedback and opinions. My 2 other ex-colleagues also could not endure the dictatorship-like hierarchy, so we quit.<br><br><br>Desperate for money to come in, I worked for an events company before I left in less than a year, due to its financial and legal issues. <strong>They were so severe that my FT boss was issued multiple letters by CPF and MOM regarding unpaid wages and to appear in court. He never did. One ex-colleague was so frustrated that she interrogated CPF as to why they were not chasing this matter more seriously as we Singaporeans were suffering under the brutality of this FT boss. Surprisingly, the empathetic CPF officer in charge explained to her in hush tones that this was so on purpose that Singapore remains “business friendly”. </strong>I’m not so “jia-lat” like her, since the remaining amount due to me was a much smaller 3-digit amount compared to her 5-digit amount. <strong>The company closed down but the FT boss still walks scott-free till this day.<br></strong><br><br>The savior (or so I thought) came when I landed a job at South East Asia’s largest fashion e-retailer with a better pay. I thought I have arrived at last with a stable job and income with CPF contributions at last! The first few months was exciting to see the start-up MNC grow from a few dozens to hundreds of people in less than a year, thanks to the financial backing of its parent conglomerate company. Despite the fun atmosphere, I saw the messy organisation and was appalled by the uncontrolled and unsupervised mass hiring spree.<br><br>I saw interns interviewing other interns for positions, <strong>FT colleagues getting their FT friends, some FTs even admitted they got the job on the spot via Skype interview and flew to Singapore the following week.</strong> Even more impressive, we have so many managers and directors who are in their 20s. ‘Manager’ – because an individual manage one aspect of the website. Important job titles that would usually take years to earn were thrown out like confetti to inexperienced, questionable workers(a great way to retain them perhaps?). Over time, I noticed more and more older workers leaving the company, until I myself felt out of place even though I’m in my early 30s. I’ve even seen fresh grads becoming the head of certain departments, or young managers becoming directors in less than a year they were hired.<br><br><br>Even though the company operates as a flat hierarchy, job titles were being prostituted over experience. I was put under a fresh grad who became director in less than a year, and it was hell since this fresh grad was inexperienced and inconsistent in decision-making, and blames were put on us instead of her. While I’m not against the great friendships that form in the place, it was survival since top positions were given to those within their circle. Unsurprisingly, I was not given any senior or managerial role despite having intensive experience in those areas.<br><br>Because, as a parent, I could not afford to go out late nights to their drunk parties, or dinners as my priority was to my family. There are so few parents in the company, that the department I worked for had none. <strong>I was blasted as a capital ‘B’ by an insensitive young FT who admitted getting the job without going through an interview.</strong> It even hurts that a Singaporean junior worker angrily commented that I should spend longer hours in the office to be fair to them, even after explaining my situation to them (I have no maid and relatives’ help with my kid from daycare) and the head allowed me to go home early on the condition I finish my leftover work from home which I always delivered on time.<br><br><br>I have suffered discriminating, insensitive abuse, and even micromanaging from the young hirelings that one other nice boss stepped in to warn them about their attitudes towards me. I felt countless guilt trips for being overly harsh to my kid as a result of work pressure.<br><br>Once due to under staffing, we were given last minute notice on Friday that everyone in the department had to help out in the warehouse the next day on Saturday. As I already had plans to spend time with my child, I told the boss I could not, but she said I was not showing team spirit if I did not come.<br><br>The company suffered major financial losses (US$91 million) in that year. Severe cost cutting was taking place. <strong>Lots of Singaporeans lost their jobs while many of the FTs (most on E-pass) were kept.</strong><br><br>The final straw came when the boss told me in private that I was selected to be retrenched. Due to cost cutting measures, they would not hire anyone in the department above $2000. Salary reductions was happening across many departments. I was told that I’m not young anymore and should look for a job that would pay my worth.<br><br><br><strong>While I looked around at the FTs (some slightly older than me) on E-pass in secret anger that they get to stay</strong>, I remembered my family and reluctantly agreed on a huge pay cut similar to a fresh grad pay than to take a retrenchment. I even talked to the <strong>HR boss (an FT too) </strong>about the matter, and whether there was a chance to take back my old salary. Her response was that I should be concerned about the welfare of the company. What about my family and our welfare??<br><br><br>Not my problem that you went on to mismanage the company in the first place and lost US$91 million! They are now mass hiring interns.<br>What hope is there for older PMETs like me, seeing that even fresh grads can become managers and directors less than a year instead of us?? All my years of hard work and long hours on my CV have become such a joke.<br><br><strong>Sad PMET</strong> </blockquote></div>

Italian food, Japanese food or Thai food?” but rarely do we hear people saying “let’s go eat Singaporean food”. Can we develop a cuisine that can be globalized? This was one of the topics that were brought out during the inaugural World Street Food Congress in June this year. Someone suggested systematizing the process. Train the staff well to understand the dishes. Avoid too much fusion that causes confusion. Educate the customers. Export the “culture”, the speaker preached. Many have tried this “exportation” route, after all, “Singapore food” overseas, is legendary. But sadly, they fall short. These “exporters” don’t always have good operational know how and a good understanding of Singapore food culture.<br><br>When I visited Japan recently, I decided to check out Hainan Jeefan, arguably the most talked about Singapore food restaurant in Tokyo. Owned by Shigeki Koshiba and Shiro Nakanishi, the restaurant has been around for about 11 years now. I am curious to know how good it has retained the integrity of Singapore food. Afterall, Shigeki, a London School of Economic and Culinary Institute of California alumni visits Singapore 3 to 4 times a year, to keep in touch with the pulse of local food scene, stay updated and refresh his skills and recipes. He has so much passion for Singapore and Singapore food that he proclaims himself a Singaporean reincarnated Japanese. He even writes a blog about it and other South East Asian food with amazing observation and insights. (<a href="http://singaporecooking.blogspot.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #500080;">http://singaporecooking.blogspot.sg/</span></span></a>)<br><br>Shiro Nakanishi the key man in charge of PR and the front operation of the restaurant and accompanies his partner on most trips. His job greatly focuses on educating his customers the spirit of the food from this part of the world, which is why he makes that many trips a year to keep up with the Lims and Tans here.<br><br><img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/_eHyY3PQgcZHYrnlyCtWDA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/Chicken-rice.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>This Hainanese chicken rice in Japan even comes with chilli that is unmistakably Singapore style.<br><br>Every year, they close the shops and fly the whole team here for a few days so that the cooks and the staff can taste and see for themselves and be inspired. I was told it takes them between ½ to a year to train a cook and up to 3 years of practice before he is allowed to helm the kitchen. The efforts pay off and it is reflected in the healthy response from the 3 outlets they now have.<br><br><img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/V9n7KJesXizFVlKao3ouEw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/bak-chor-mee.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Almost authentic bak chor mee.<br><br>And how’s the food? I tried various dishes and perhaps I was more lenient since I didn’t set very high expectation but I was pleasantly surprised that these dishes turned out good. They took great pain to source for the right ingredients, otherwise find very close enough substitutes. It is not possible to get the right noodle for bak chor mee, so they substitute it with thinner ramen but it tasted almost like the same thing with the ubiquitous ingredients such as minced meat, stewed mushroom, fish cake and dumplings. The sambal kangkong is better than many cze char stalls here with generous amount of hae bee hiam and even the char kway teow is done with superb wok hei though unfortunately missing the see hum (cockles) that we so love. However, it was the chicken rice that made me sit up.<br><br>Somehow I am so proud that chicken rice is our national dish, no one else outside should do it as good us. But theirs gave me goose pimples, they do it exceptionally well. Even the chilli is unmistakably Singapore style. It caresses you with its silkiness before the bite consumes you. The rice is amazingly flavourful with the right gumminess and smokiness – not too oily but with enough sheen. This is as good as our most popular chicken rice stalls. The chicken is served old school Hainanese chicken style, straight forward and with just some seasoning to enhance the flavour.<br><br>However, I find it puzzling that they use only chicken breast. I would think it is natural to use the most tender part of the chicken. Maybe Japanese chicken is a different breed. It is more tender and juicier than I thought. I was told many Japanese prefer white meat when it is poached.<br><br><img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/KBx5LFH.8foHrBWMgG_6ag--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/char-kway-teow.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>The char kway teow had good wok hei but unfortunately does not come with hums (cockles).<br><br>When asked what inspired them, Shigeki told me “I seriously want to promote and elevate Singapore cuisine around the world on a macro level, not only Japan but we need to start somewhere so we start here, Tokyo. On a micro level I want to educate our customers, how good and interesting Singapore food can be through our restaurants”.<br><br><img src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/LpIFiLFXd4XBAYBh1ynMgw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTYzMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_SG/News/Makansutra/sambal-kangkong.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>The sambal kangkong was better than many cze cha stalls here. <br><br>Out of curiosity I asked what he thinks of the exporting and developing a Singapore cuisine culture for the world. “Singapore food is very specialized; a guy who makes chicken rice doesn’t make bak chor mee or bak kut teh etc. This is quite unique. If you train a bunch of cooks who can cook at least top 40 favourite Singapore foods at a very high level and standard, you will be able to export these chefs and hence there will be more Singapore restaurant and people will definitely say “let’s go eat Singaporean”. I am not a Singaporean but I am trying to do that” he said.<br><br>What can we do here? I think if our own hawkers and local food restaurateurs could spend real effort teaching the foreign kitchen workers and cooks they hired at their stalls or restaurants here diligently, then it would already be a good start. Then after, think about the exportation of Singapore cuisine.<br><br>Hainan Jeefan Shokudo 1 (main shop) 6-11-16 Roppongi, Minato-Ku, Tokyo<br><br>Hainan Jeefan Shokudo 2 1-21-14 Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo<br><br>Hainan Jeefan Shokudo M 4-5-8 Roppongi, Minato-Ku, Tokyo Website: <a href="http://www.route9g.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">www.route9g.com</span></span></a><br><br>Japanese Chef Shigeki Koshiba's blog : <a href="http://singaporecooking.blogspot.sg/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #500080;">http://singaporecooking.blogspot.sg/</span></span></a> </blockquote></div>

              <p>4-year-old Casey Burke has launched an appeal to raise £25,000 to help her best friend walk - something she will never do herself. Casey Burke, suffers from cerebral palsy as does her best friend Matilda Duncan, 5.</p>
              <p>Casey will never be able to walk herself, but her friend Matilda could be able to if she undergoes a pioneering procedure.<br><br>Her family are unable to afford the £25,000 treatment but a fundraising appeal has been launched in the hope that 25,000 will pledge £1. <br><br>Casey said: 'Matilda is only 5 and so doesn’t have enough money in her piggy bank. So me and my mummy are helping Matilda and her mummy to raise the money.'<br><br>'We need to ask 25,648 people for £1 each, but I don’t know that many people. I don’t mind that I can’t have the operation - I just want my best friend to be okay. If everyone could give me just a few pennies then Tilly will be able to walk. I don’t want a lot from one person, just a little from many.'<br><br>Her friend Matilda said: 'Casey is my best friend and we both have cerebral palsy. She can’t have an operation but the doctors say that I can. I love her for helping me. I will always help her too.'<br><br>The girls, who became friends at nursery, were both born prematurely and both have perfectly healthy twins.<br>Casey and her twin Carmel live with their older brother Luca, 5, and parents Suzanne and Mike, in Eastcote, west London.<br><br>Matilda uses a walking frame and callipers to get around while Casey uses a wheelchair. Matilda and her twin brother Matthew live with their mother Rachel Knowles, 41, and their project manager father Matthew Duncan, 41, in Hayes, west London. <br><br>Her family discovered she was eligible for the revolutionary procedure, known as Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, just before Christmas. Rachel, a shop assistant, said: 'After loads of tests, Great Ormond Street Hospital send us a letter saying that Matilda was eligible for the operation.'<br><br>'I don’t have a problem with being asked to pay towards our daughter’s care, but we could simply never be able to afford such a great expense.'<br><br>The revolutionary spinal operation will require Matilda to stay in hospital for a week, and undergo weeks of intensive physiotherapy. Casey’s mother Suzanne, 43, said: 'The operation is a very rare and complicated procedure which only a few Cerebral Palsy sufferers can benefit from. Unfortunately, Casey’s condition is too severe for her to be able to have the operation herself. She suffers from hip dysplasia, and has already had two operations that removed her legs and pinned them back in the correct position. Casey never complains - she’s an absolute angel. I’m so proud.'</p>

              <h3>The case of a 10-year-old girl in Pakistan’s Punjab province, whose employers confessed to beating her to death last week, has highlighted concerns about child rights. The BBC’s Saba Eitizaz reports on a case that shocked the nation.</h3>
              <p><a href="http://in2eastafrica.net/the-pakistani-servant-girl-tortured-to-death/">http://in2eastafrica.net/the-pakistani-servant-girl-tortured-to-death/</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://in2eastafrica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Iram.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Human rights organisations argue that Pakistan’s labour laws ignore child abuse in a country where almost half the population is under the age of 18. It is an oversight which often has tragic consequences.</p>
              <p>Evidence of that can be found in a small village in the province of Punjab, where a haunting wailing echoes off the crumbling mud walls of a ramshackle home.</p>
              <p>It sounds like many mothers crying for lost children.</p>
              <p>It is called the “wayne” – the song for the dead and is an integral part of the local funeral ritual.</p>
              <p><strong>Tortured</strong></p>
              <p>The village is called Moza Jindraakha which means “the place where life is protected”.</p>
              <p>But things are different now – a young girl’s death is being mourned.</p>
              <p>Iram Ramzan was sent to Lahore to cook for a middle class family – so her own family could eat. Her two sisters are also employed as domestic helps for different families.</p>
              <p>But Iram came back in a white shroud – apparently tortured to death by her employers.</p>
              <p>Her mother Zubaida Bibi, who has lost her hand in a threshing accident, faced the prospect of bringing up three young daughters without a husband’s financial support.</p>
              <p>Zubaida says that she had little option but to send her daughters out to earn money as domestic servants.</p>
              <p>She thought they would be safer in more affluent homes rather than on the streets. But she was wrong and has had to go through the torture of burying her youngest child – and now she does not know where to bury her guilt.</p>
              <p>“Maybe we should have begged for scraps instead,” the inconsolable mother laments. “How was I to know I was sending my daughter to her tormentors?”</p>
              <p>Last year Iram’s family was telephoned by a distant uncle in Lahore telling them to rush to the hospital.</p>
              <p><strong>‘An accident’</strong></p>
              <p>Doctors said she had died on arrival. There were torture marks on her body and rope burns on her wrists and feet.</p>
              <p>Her employers, the Mahmood family had brought her in. The police immediately took the family into custody.</p>
              <div class="wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin-left: 15px; padding: 0px;"><ins style="position: relative; background-color: transparent; margin: 0px; width: 300px; display: inline-table; height: 250px; visibility: visible; padding: 0px;"><ins id="aswift_1_anchor" style="position: relative; background-color: transparent; margin: 0px; width: 300px; display: block; height: 250px; visibility: visible; padding: 0px;"></ins></ins></div>
              <p>The girl had been beaten to death with an iron pipe, which was later found in the Mahmood’s home, along with the ropes used to tie her up.</p>
              <p>Nasira Mahmood has confessed to repeatedly beating the child with the pipe while her 16-year-old son stood by and watched.</p>
              <p>In jail, Mrs Mahmood is having tea and biscuits. She is almost casual when asked why she did it, saying it was all an accident and that no one expected Iram to die.</p>
              <p>“Three times she stole money from me. I got angry, that’s all,” she says. “She said she was getting sleepy so I tied her up and left to make dinner.”</p>
              <p><strong>‘Indications of beating’</strong></p>
              <p>Police investigators say that Iram died slowly, not accidentally and breathed her last while still tied up.</p>
              <p>“Right away, they admitted to having tortured her,” says Police Superintendent Umar Cheema.</p>
              <p>“There were marks of violence, indications of beating, swelling, indicating that the girl was tortured with a heavy instrument which later turned out to be a domestic gas pipe.”</p>
              <p>Iram’s employers were paying her $23 (£14) a month – a small price to pay for her life.</p>
              <p>In the same week that Iram died, another 15-year-old domestic maid, Azra, was found strangled to death in her employer’s home in Lahore, allegedly the victim of sexual abuse before she was killed.</p>
              <p>The Society For the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc) say they receive about 20 cases like Iram and Azra’s every year. These are just the cases where a child has died. There are many others featuring assault and abuse, many of which go unreported.</p>
              <p>Sparc representative Sajjad Cheema says that whatever legislation for children that does exist is not being implemented because there are no administrative mechanisms in place to regulate child workers.</p>
              <p>“The United Nations has sent a recommendation to the Pakistan government to adopt a child protection policy,” Mr Cheema says. “We need to know whether we are going to let these children work like this, to die, or are we going to protect them, and how will we do it?”</p>
              <p>Human rights groups say more than 12 million children are pushed onto the streets and the homes of strangers to seek an income.</p>
              <p>Without a legal safety net, these children are slipping through the cracks with no one to catch them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, in the village of Moza Jindraakha, a child-sized mound of earth marks Iram’s resting place.</p>
              <p>Right next to the graveyard, is a green and yellow field where she used to play with the other children – before her childhood and her life was cut short by a combination of cruelty, official indifference and poverty.</p>
