              The following is excerpted from an informative 2010 thread from another Singapore forum. It might give you a glimpse into an aspect of Singapore society not many are familiar with.<br><br>Singapore Police Force chiobu video :<a href="http://mothership.sg/2015/10/spore-police-force-kinda-pokes-mr-know-your-rights-with-its-latest-promo-video/">http://mothership.sg/2015/10/spore-police-force-kinda-pokes-mr-know-your-rights-with-its-latest-promo-video/</a><br><br><i>Ex-Singapore Police Force officer "Golden Dragon" posted :</i><p>I used to operate a KTV until sometime last year when I decided enough was enough. As most niteclubbers are fully aware, all niteclubs in S'pore commit offences when they open their doors for business. There are no legal hostesses anymore. Not even in Lido Palace, Dynasty or TianAnMen.</p><p> Long, long time ago, we had locals and M'sians working as hostesses. About 10 years ago, the proliferation of PRC women led to M'sians heading home northwards and S'porean hostesses just vanished to their homes. The Viets, PRCs, Thais and Filipinos took centre stage.</p><p> Surely the Polce is aware of this change 10 years ago. But they are doing absolutely nothing. All they do and do and do and as reported in the press, is the continued raids and raids against niteclubs. Are these raids even needed in the first place? Perhaps. But let's not waste precious manpower and time concentrating on these niteclubs.</p><p> Have they considered issuing work permits to these niteclubs to hire PRC hostesses? For 1000 sq ft, 10 hostesses. For every extra 1000sq ft, 10 more hostesses. It's win-win for all. The government gets money from levies imposed, the niteclubs dont commit offences, less raids and resources needed so the cops can have better things to do like concentrating on other key matters. </p><p> In my past conversations with fellow niteclub owners, some of us felt that the reason behind not issuing work permits to these PRCs could be political. The Chinese authorities and its embassy in S'pore might get offended and we all know S'pore cannot afford to offend China. That's the reality. We are a small island, city-state.</p><p> However, about 2 years ago, PRC women were recruited for work in the brothels in Geylang. Meaning, they are now officially recognised as sex workers. They took over the role once filled by M'sian women.</p><p> If we can have sex workers recognised in Geylang why cant we issue work permits to hostesses from China like we do for Filipina maids, singers from China, construction workers from India, Thailand and Bangladesh?</p><p> Another issue that dominated our discussion was the targets for police raids. They suka suka raid all over but they are not known to be agressive against Lido Palace. Why? Is it because top civil servants, police officers and leading local businessmen patronize Lido? Is that fair? Billionaire Peter LIm is a regular. I rest my case.</p><p> From my source, even Dennis Foo is considered an untouchable! We concluded it was because of his connections or his bosses' connections.<br> Also excluded is Johnny Quek of Dynasty. Why? Ex-mata. Connections again?</p><p> My point is, with better initiatives and policies, the police need not waste time and effort in trying to solve or suppress problems that they themselves created or chose not to confront.</p><p> Either issue the work permits for these hostesses from China or bar all PRC women under the age of 30 from entering S'pore. In the case of the latter, all the niteclub problems can be solved. Coz they will have to close down without the PRCs.</p><p> Scroobal, what say you? Must admit I am very impressed with your knowledge on a wide range of matters. Not only your knowledge but the accuracy of it all. Truly impressive. </p><p> I enjoyed reading your comments on ex-CP Khoo Boon Hui and the current CP, Ng Joo Hee. If I may add, if the ex-CP was that great, Wong Kan Seng would have handed him the 2PS post. Not a Senior DS post which is a slap on Khoo's face and backside. It simply means Khoo at age 56 is not equal to Leo Yip at 42 or 43 yrs old. Or, Khoo is only slightly better than Aubeck Kam when the latter was in his mid or late 30s. </p><p> Ng Joo Hee? Well, he became CP by default. Really shocked everybody. Eric Tan, CPIB director would have been a far better choice. </p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p><i>Another ex-Singapore Police Force officer Scroobal replied :</i></p><p>You are not far off from the mark. It is indeed connections. The high end niteclub business and the horse racing industry are in the same boat. In both cases the patrons who are business leaders are influential and have placed much pressure on the politcians and enforcement side. </p><p> This will carry on until the elections are over. Your best bet is to do what the Japanese chap who ran a group of Japanese niteclubs did. Get the more respectable one from your industry, engage an influential PR (Hill Knowlton ) agency and seek a meeting with Home Affairs. Dont' waste time with the cops. The dutch man and the first owner of Harry's did that - go to the politicians directly and he got what he wanted - alfesco and blaring music. They know the value of the trade and would make more appropriate suggestions. </p><p> Leo Yip and Heng are streets ahead of any of them. </p><p>--------------------------</p><p><i>Golden Dragon continued :</i></p><p>Thank you, Frankiestine and Scroobal.</p><p> Wrt political consideration, we realised it wasnt the case when the authorities facilitated PRCs to work as legal sex workers in Geylang 2 yrs ago. Niteclub owners had speculated on that "theory" only before geylang doors were opened to PRC meimeis. </p><p> Honestly, we didnt expect our government to neglect niteclub owners. Somehow, the OKTs in Geylang hold a more respectable profession than niteclub owners.</p><p> Yes, Scroobal, political connections are important. Unfortunately, no one in high office wants to be associated with us! Unless we happen to be Dennis Fool. We are looked upon or rather, looked down as people involved in laundering money, uneducated, categorised as dubious characters etc. In a nutshell, nuteclub owners arent viewed positively.</p><p> Take a raid last week at Peace Centre for example. They raided 3 or 4 joints at 6pm during happy hours and returned at 11pm for yet another hit. Some joints were hit twice in one nite. The only joint to escape both raids was Dynasty. Lucky Johnny. </p><p> What is inexplicable is that the joints hit has the same ingredients as Dynasty. They have hostesses running around and all without valid work permits. Why the selective enforcement? Only God and the raiding party knows.</p><p> Same goes for Lido and the joints along Havelock Rd. All are doing business without valid work permits for their hostesses but seldom get raided. If the police are really that concerned and wants to act as crusaders, they should investigate Lido. Afterall, they are the number 1 in S'pore.</p><p> Mamasans at Lido take a cut from the hostesses when they are bonked. I think it's 20%. That is an offence under the Women's Charter. Anti-Vice, where are you? Dont just hit us, the small and medium joints lah. Engage Lido and get our respect.</p><p> If the police wants to solve this problem once and for all, it's simple. You dont need a PhD. Just bring in 5 jumbo jets and park along Havelock Road. Raid these joints and send the meimeis back. Or, prohibit the entry of PRC meimeis to S'pore. Only allow in the PRC aunties.</p><p> Why bother to raid and raid and hold press conferences highlighting their good work when they could have come out with better options. If 20 officers are involved in the raid and the operation takes 6 hrs, it's 120 man hrs wasted. When the girls are taken back and statements recorded, more man hrs wasted. Arent there more meaningful matters for the police to do?</p><p> Btw, I was told Heng Swee Keat and Patrick Tay, both ex-cops, will feature in this GE. Patrick was from STAR, the same unit the current CP was previously exposed to. True or not, Scroobal? </p><p>-------------------------------</p><p><i>Scroobal replied :</i></p><p>Swee Keat no. Leo maybe. They are still trying to get Swee Keat. No clue about Patrick. </p><p> Not sure what Dynasty story is, but Lido is off limits. The revenue is mind boggling. </p><p> As for Mamasan, the practice is the same all over. 20% is after the initial investment on the girl is exhausted. Typically, the select new ones are done up in terms of clothes and accessories to the tune of $20K by the Mamasan. <br> I have always stated that all Mamasans are living off the immoral earnings of girls. Home Affairs knows that very well. </p><p> Bro, this is just a suggestion. Don't go into dangerous territory with this. Anti-Vice no.1s and 2s have been removed in the past, one going to jail etc. Look as Fragrance and 81. You get the picture. </p><p> Just wait for GE to finish. This govt works in mysterious ways. CPIB was not allowed to investigate the shipping industry for decades because the port trade was considered vital. When the ban was lifted, they started to have a ball of a time. </p><p>-------------------------</p><p><i>Golden Dragon then replied to several other members' postings in the thread</i></p><p>wikiphile - I fully agree with you that 'this sort of situation is not only unique in S'pore, it happens everywhere'. But arent we a first world country with world class adminstrators? </p><p> We are number 1 in many many areas. This sort of situation should not exist in S'pore. How are we to teach the third world countries when such a simple matter is left dragging for the past decade. </p><p></p><p> exSINgaporean - I didn't face trouble with gangsters coming to my club. Gangsters, drunkards and those high on drugs are easier to deal with! Their friends with them are likely to prevent any escalation by driving sense to their troublemaker friend(s). If out of control, we just dial 999. We also pay taxes, CPF etc just like other businesses.</p><p> Cannot say the same for police officers raiding niteclubs. They appear as if<br> they are on a crusade to rid S'pore of niteclubs. But try asking them to raid Lido Palace and their balls disappear. </p><p> Even if they do, they will not hit Lido hard. Just go through the motion, bring 1 or 2 hostesses back, impose 3 or 6 demerit points then return to raid again a year later. By then, the demerit points would have been cancelled. Lido lives on and on and on.</p><p> exSINgaporean, thanks for your advice. Your suggestion is great but I doubt if I have the time. I also have no intention to offend our world class government coz I am a nobody.</p><p><br> I am sure the government will respond appropriately, but as always, it is always years later. We dont expect them to preempt this problem. It's not life and death for them. Neither do we expect them to deal with this matter swiftly, after it becomes so obvious. And yet we claim to be world class here and there. Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.</p><p> Take the ah long problem as an example. They must have finally admitted defeat by making amendments to the Moneylenders' Act 18 months ago. The traditional ah longs we know of, that operated from the coffeeshops etc have now progressed to air con offices, after getting their license from the Registrar of Moneylenders. And they advertised their services in the newspapers.</p><p> The legal ah longs are now permitted by law to impose any amount of interest for amount above 3k. In the past, legal ah longs could only charge 1.5% monthly interest. Now, 20% is legal. Can also impose admin fees, late payment fees etc. </p><p> The ah long problem is now swiftly swept under the carpet. The police can now claim that any offences resulting from these loans were breaches committed by licensed moneylenders and not ah longs. </p><p> Honestly, what is the difference between the old ah longs and the legal moneylenders today? 20% illegal interest in the past suddenly becomes legal! Legally, there is no offence even if they charge you 100% interest monthly. </p><p> Well, they may insist that at least all loans are now recorded! But the problems of debtors remain. By claiming that with more legal ah longs, debtors can compare who offers more competitive interest rates is laughable at best. If you can borrow and pay below 5% interest, you are damn bloody lucky. 15% monthly interest rate is the norm, some 'chop head' others may not.</p><p> The government collects taxes, solve the ah long problem by nudging them to become legal etc. Problem solved and yet gets to collect revenue. Great move indeed.</p><p> Look at the numerous Off Course Betting Centres in S'pore today. They were introduced to combat illegal bookies. What is the difference? The illegals offer more competitive rates and credit terms. The government? Collect taxes. Gambling problem resolved? I am afraid not. Now we even have 2 world class gambling dens!</p><p> So, this niteclub problem can easily be resolved too. Just like the ah long, illegal bookies and PRC streetwalkers Geylang problems, ISSUE THE WORK PERMTS FOR HOSTESSES AND THE PROBLEM WILL DISAPPEAR. Why create the problem in the first place and then go all out to crush the very problem they created. Must be the greatest of all morons on planet earth. World class still? </p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p><i>Golden Dragon then followed with another post</i></p><p>Wow, the cops must be monitoring this thread. And very efficiently and timely, they raided Dynasty hrs ago. Perhaps the cops felt guilty! Or maybe CPIB initiated the raid. More likely the latter. Most pertinently, how many were arrested? How many demerit points you giving Dynasty. With 4 hostesses arrested, you can close Johnny's joint for 6 months. S'pore Police boleh!</p><p> Mr &amp; Mrs Policemen, just do your duties. Dont fear your bosses. Don't fear Lido Palace and Dennis Fool's establishment like you all did all these years. Raid and close them down! </p><p> Then target the Havelock establishment. Clean up the very problem you created together with ICA and MOM by not moving and changing with the cuurent trend and landscape. Atone for your past sins.</p><p> Raid Lido and charge the who's who present, even those high ranking police officers for abetment in the offences happening there. If bold enough, time your raids when your superiors are entertaining their foreign visitors. The law is to be applied fairly, right? That's what your 2nd minister Mr Shanmugam said, as reported in the newspapers.</p><p> Commissioner of Police, ban all your officers from patronising niteclubs. There should be no double standards, with some of your officers being regulars to niteclubs and your enforcement officers raiding these establishment. It is pure mockery! And this has been taking place for the past 3 decades! </p><p>--------------------------</p><p><i>Golden Dragon then replied the following to ex-SINgaporean's post (which I'm not reproducing here)</i></p><p> The police classified them as only street corner gangs some 15 years ago. I think it was Chua Chin Kiat, when he was Director CID. When he later became Director of Prisons, gang members incarcerated had to take an oath in prison that they were no longer gang members. </p><p> Many chose to take that route not because they have repented but to get early release. HaHaHa. When they left prison, they became church members and NGO volunteers? I am afraid not. They went back to their gangs. </p><p> The truth is that they aren't street corner gangs. Street corner gangs existed only for a short period, period. What we have are traditional triad and <a href="http://xiao_cai7.blogspot.sg/2010/11/so-many-secret-societies-in-singapore.html">Secret Society (SS)</a> members. They are well-entrenched and will be around as long as society exists. And they have links in at least 3 ASEAN countries and at least 4 in the EU. By the way, this is not classified info. The men in the streets are all aware. The police too but they are in a stage of self-denial, as always.</p><p> Traditional SS and triads continue to have their territories just like the past. Similar to vice and gambling. When your great granchild becomes a great grandparent, gambling, prostitution and gangs will still be around.</p><p> President scholars need not face gangsters. The plainclothes officers have to. No worries again. Gangsters and cops are good buddies. They need each other to co-exist. It's a win-win for all.</p><p> No worries over the loan sharks, illegal whores and illegal gambling problem. Just legalised it and quote stats in their favour. Our citizens read the newspapers as if everything written is the gospel truth. Thus far, all the 3 above 'problem' areas all taken care of already. Response wasn't swift but better late than never. Legalised ah longs aka moneylenders, geylang brothels with PRC service staff and MBS and RWS.</p><p> Geylang is one of the safest places to visit in S'pore, believe me. We have extra 'policemen' on 24hr duties there. They won't dare to create trouble. On the contrary, they assist the police by ensuring no law and order problems in their turf for fear of police presence and raids. </p><p> Try creating problems there and someone will come over, faster than the police cars, and ask you not to create trouble coz they need to earn a living either through sale of cough syrup, contraband cigs or illegal gambling dens etc. And we don't need to pay them salaries and pension.</p><p>----------------------------</p><p><i>Golden Dragon then replied to someone called Melzp :</i></p><p>Melzp: Statistics relating to police raids and numbers arrested can be used to an organisation's interest and advantage.</p><p> For example, if your figures for raids and those arrested are lower than the previous year, just credit it to the previous year's relentless raids and raids and measures to combat that problem. Now, just mopping up.</p><p> If your current figures are more, just say the situation is still under control because of enhanced intelligence and raids and that the police are working very hard to ensure public safety and requires the cooperation of the public.</p><p> Not so sure if you are right in stating that ex-CID officers are owners of these massage parlours. I think there is only 1. Used to be at Apollo Centre. Not sure if he is still around after the upgrading. </p><p> If you refer to policemen patronizing these outlets, you are right. They used to go to the one at Leisure Drome and drink and have fun at the old Dynasty Niteclub. </p><p>-------------------------------------------<br><br>
