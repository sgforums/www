I'll give just 1 reason, which absolutely trumps over all 8 of his reasons hands-down : You're 100x more likely to get robbed, burglarized, stabbed, molested, raped, abducted, murdered and go permanently missing in Malaysia compared to in Singapore. Like Alvin, you may put on a false bravado and boast, "Not if you're streetsmart like me and all Malaysians", which is not only self-contradictory (if Malaysians are so streetsmart why are the crime victimization rates still over 100x higher?), but much more importantly, in this game of roulette (where the odds are 100x Malaysia : 1x Singapore) all it takes is just 1 rape, 1 abduction, 1 murder, of one of your own loved ones (girlfriend, wife, child, family, etc), to appreciate Singapore (by then too little too late).</div>

              Edward Mordake was a man born with a second face behind his first face.
              <br><br>
              It could neither eat nor speak out loud but was seen to "smile and sneer while Mordake was weeping."
              <br><br>
              The poor guy begged doctors to have his "Demon face" removed, claiming that it whispered to him at night.
              <br><br>
              However, no doctor would attempt it. He then committed suicide when he was 23 years old.

            <div class='col-md body'>[Bahrain, Middle East] - A 28 yr old Filipino maid has been rescued by the Philippine embassy after she posting a tearful Facebook video crying that she had been repeatedly raped and beaten by her rich employer's son for months (note : this is sadly a far too common but mostly unreported ongoing atrocity in oil-rich Middle East countries against foreign female domestic workers), and he even threatened to murder her and dump her body in the Bahrain desert if she ever told anyone. Thanks to social media (in this case, Facebook), she is now safely in the Philippine embassy, but there is no guarantee the rich man's son will be successfully convicted for his rape.<br><br><img src="http://news.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_left_image-630x411/public/original_images/Apr2015/abbyluna.jpg"><br><br>Facebook Video :<br><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/crime/filipina-maid-rescued-after-facebook-plea-over-alleged-rape-employers-son">http://news.asiaone.com/news/crime/filipina-maid-rescued-after-facebook-plea-over-alleged-rape-employers-son</a></div>

The organisers knew I was a fan so they gave a chance to invite him on stage and teach him how to SMS the code, which would set off the pyrotechnics.<br><br>But I was so awestruck when he came close to me that I forgot the code! I said, "Sorry Mr Lee, my mind is a blank now, " and he said something to the effect of how we had to get our act together or else no one would be speaking Mandarin. He really put me at ease and became this grandfather figure speaking to his silly granddaughter.<br><br>The whole thing took less than five minutes, and I realised that he wasn't as severe a person as what people imagine him to be. It sure didn't help that before our meeting, his security was telling us a thousand things not to do - the most memorable one being to not touch him [for security reasons].But it was my dream to shake his hand!<br><br>So as he was exiting the stage, I said to him, "Mr Lee can I shake your hand?", and he stuck his hand out. As you can see from the picture, he had already turned to walk away but I refused to let go. Or rather, I realised I hadn't let go. I thought to myself that this was the end of my career and that I was going to jail 'cos his security had started to walk towards us.<br><br>You could hear the nervous laughter in the room. The he broke out in a grin when he realised that I was still tugging his hand - it was only then that everyone broke out in laughter too.<br><br>These two photos are very precious to me. When I stopped hosting and went to study in Japan, I even pasted them on my dormitory wall.<br><br><a href="http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/sharon-au-it-was-my-dream-finally-shake-lee-kuan-yews-hand">http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/sharon-au-it-was-my-dream-finally-shake-lee-kuan-yews-hand</a></div>

              My BedokFunland JC Solution to the "Cheryl's Birthday" Logic Riddle (a Singapore Primary 5 Math Exam Qn now gone world-famous viral) :<br><br>
                      Based on Albert's 1st statement :
                      <br><br>
                      If Cheryl told Albert her birthday was either in May or June, then it might be possible that Bernard was told by Cheryl that her birthday was on a 19th or 18th, then Bernard would have known for sure. Since Albert is sure Bernard doesn't know, hence Cheryl could not have told Albert her birthday month was either in May or June.
                      <br><br>
                      Based on Bernard's 1st statement :
                      <br><br>
                      Note that it is crucial for Albert and Bernard to hear each other out, to come to a definitive conclusion on Cheryl's birthday.
                      <br><br>
                      Since Bernard (upon hearing Albert's statement and correctly deducing that Cheryl's birthday must either be in July or August), says he now knows Cheryl's birthday, hence Cheryl's birthday must be on a day that is not repeated (ie. 14th of July or August), and therefore we conclude Cheryl's birthday must be either on July 16, August 15 or August 17. But we still can't be sure exactly which of these 3 dates is Cheryl's birthday yet (since we still do not know the month).
                      <br><br>
                      Based on Albert's 2nd statement :
                      <br><br>
                      Now that Albert has heard Bernard (who had earlier heard Albert), the only way Albert can confidently and correctly state that he now knows Cheryl's birthday, must therefore mean that Cheryl told him her birthday was in July (because if Cheryl told Albert her birthday was in August, then there's no way Albert could rule out either 15th or 17th of August).
                      <br><br>
                      In conclusion, Cheryl's birthday must be on July 16.
                  <br><br>
                  Updated : <br><br>I didn't know there was an official solution already released (it's a Singapore O Level Olympiad Math Question). Waste my time typing out my solution (which is correct, of course). Ah well.<br><br>

              His voice really suits this kind of 1970's Chinese song (it's an original song written for MediaCorp's "Spouse For House", but based on the style of typical 1970's Chinese songs). So 1 reason for it's popularity is the nostalgia factor : brings back memories of the 1970's for you, don't it? (for younger folks born after 1990's, perhaps past life memories, which you won't necessarily recall the details intellectually, but rather emotionally, of loved ones and relationships from those past lives, and for which songs and movies depicting the era of your past life are common triggers... eg. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5HAsNySJMg">Tennessee Waltz by Connie Francis</a>).<br><br>Chen Tianwen's 'un-un-un-un-unbelievable' music video<br><br>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sympathize with both sides. But the sad fact is, the YouTuber unnecessarily escalated the issue as a result of his feeling victimized by the cop. If he just answered, "No Madm", he would almost definitely have been free to go. His feeling victimized and defensive and consequently being rude to the cop in his verbal responses, invoked a similar feeling of victimization and defensiveness in the cop, resulting in the annoyed cop booking him for some frivolous reason. It could all have been avoided if he didn't have a victimization chip on his shoulder (admittedly, his being Hispanic and therefore often negatively profiled racially and prejudged by the police, predisposes him to such a chip on his shoulder, so it's not all his fault).<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwQ7mQObheY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwQ7mQObheY</a></div>
