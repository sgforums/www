              This graduate hawker (see link to article below) and almost all other Singaporean F&amp;B business owners (including Mark Lee who owns the franchisee rights to Old Town White Coffee) got it all wrong.
                                      <br><br>
                                      The problem is not that Singaporeans are unreasonable in demanding higher wages (due to the high cost of living in Singapore for Singaporeans), the problem are the unethically greedy landlords / REITS (of which the Government partially owns every Singapore REITS out there). 
                                      <br><br>
                                      Landlords/REITS do not do any work at all, they just continue to collect obscene amounts of rental income every day and every night (even while they sleep), while the poor overworked and underpaid employees who do all the backbreaking dirty cleaning work and get paid next to nothing, and the unethical landlords / REITS continue to incessantly increase rents every month / 3 months / 6 months / year, with no end in sight. The Singapore market completely favours the landlords.
                                      <br><br>
              
              The rich get richer while the poor get poorer. You can observe many excellent restaurants and businesses, always fully packed with customers, but still close down because they cannot afford the ever-increasing rents. The landlord / REITS would rather earn more rental income by renting it out to richer multi-national corporations owned business which do not offer as much value as the original displaced business, and in the end both the original hardworking business (forced to close down) and the end-consumers (ie. Singaporeans) suffer.
              
                                      <br><br>
                                      The Government should (via formal legislation) control all rent prices to ensure it remains affordable for Singaporeans. Once the rents are reasonable, the bosses can begin to pay Singaporean employees reasonable wages.
                                      <br><br>
                                      In addition, the Government needs to modify Foreign Talent quotas : increase the FT quota for manual-type jobs that Singaporeans do not wish to do, and decrease the FT quota for PMET jobs that Singaporeans wish to do (this is particularly problematic as most HR managers and bosses are FT, and favour hiring their own countrymen over Singaporeans for PMET positions).
                                          <br><br>

              <br><br>

                      ANN ARBOR â€“ WPXD-TV reported an Ohio woman wants to burn a cross in front of Chicago sperm bankâ€™s office after claiming she was inseminated with a vial from what she called a â€œghetto monkeyâ€� (racist slur for African-American) donor despite ordering a vial from a white donor.
                      <br><br>
                       Molly Cram says her now two-year-old daughter, Watermelon, has caused major problems with her beliefs.
                      <br><br>
                      â€œThe neo-Nazi community donâ€™t want me now. My daughterâ€™s a disgusting little half-breed with baboon lips and sheâ€™s going to hell cause she ainâ€™t pure. But part of me still loves that little half-human, cause sheâ€™s mine and all, but this ainâ€™t good.â€�
                      <br><br>
                      Her boyfriend, John Steelhammer, broke it off with the mother. â€œI love Molly even though sheâ€™s now, technically, a n**ger lover, but you know how stupid I look in all this? I didnâ€™t want to tell my white brothers I was shooting blanks, so now they think my girl was cheating around on me with a spear-chucker. My life is really stressful right now.â€�
                      <br><br>
                      In April 2012, Molly was wrongly inseminated with a vial from donor No. 330, an African-American man. The sperm bank did send a letter of apology and refunded her money, but Cram says she thinks the mix-up was intentional.
                      <br><br>
                      â€œI know that bank giving me a black sperm was a secret plot to embarrass the white race. But these milk duds are going to feel the force of white power. Iâ€™m burning a cross and thatâ€™s just the start. Hail Hitler!â€�

We are merely guest-workers here. I hate to say this, but it is - unfortunately - their right to be angry at those of us who misbehave because this is their home, and we are merely their guests. As such, we are supposed to integrate and perhaps even assimilate into their society and not cause any problems.</p><p>If you are angry about the brewing anti-Filipino hate-fest, then please DIRECT YOUR ANGER AT THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT and the buffoons who lead it. They are the ones who refuse to change the laws and the anti-progress restrictions in the 1987 Constitution that have directly and indirectly caused economic opportunities to be extremely scarce back home, thus forcing a huge number of us to desperately seek employment overseas and thus flood into countries like Singapore.</p><p>Instead of retaliating against online attacks against Filipinos, take screenshots of them (blurring the names in order to protect the identity of the guy posting the hate-message: it is their right to hate on us because WE REALLY ARE ALREADY TOO MANY) and present these screenshots of anti-Filipino hate messages as examples of the repercussions of NOT FIXING THE 1987 Constitution's anti-FDI restrictions. Post them as comments on Philippine Government websites, send them to the e-mail addresses and Facebook pages/accounts of Filipino politicians.</p><p>Show these hate-messages as proof that the idiotic "labor-export policy" (and relying on remittances) is not a sustainable way of keeping the Philippine economy afloat and that instead of sending Filipinos to work in foreign countries, how about allowing a huge number of foreign companies to set up shop in the Philippines by removing those anti-FDI restrictions that discourage them from investing in the Philippines?</p><p>Fellow Filipinos in Singapore, it is not the fault of Singaporeans or of Singapore as a whole that there is a brewing hate-fest against us. This is partly OUR FAULT. It is the Philippines' fault. It is the fault of Filipino politicians who set up anti-progress laws and constitutional restrictions that have severely limited our economic opportunities back home, and it was because of us Filipinos (or the generations prior to ours) that these politicians came to power and because of us (or perhaps our parents' generation) that the anti-progress 1987 Constitution got ratified and its faulty provisions became the basic law of the land.</p><p>Do not blame Singaporeans. Instead, blame the Philippine Government. Blame the 1987 Constitution. And let us BLAME OURSELVES because we Filipinos are ultimately responsible for why the Philippines is the jobs-scarce sick man of Asia that has forced much more than 10% of the entire Philippine population to have to seek economic opportunities abroad. As a "democracy" (some would say "DemoCrazy"), we get the government we deserve. After all, we tolerated the election of an incompetent and inexperienced buffoon in 2010 and he has actively resisted reforming the Constitution and the lousy oligarch-centric economic system.</p><p>We must take responsibility for this because the problems of the Philippines are the reason why we have constantly been flooding into Singapore (including insular-minded Filipinos who are unfit to live &amp; work abroad) and as a result have elicited anger among the locals. It is up to us Filipinos in Singapore to right the wrongs that have caused this to happen.</p><p>Once again, do not retaliate against Singaporeans.</p><p>Direct your anger at the Philippine Government, direct your anger at the 1987 Constitution. Inform, Educate, and Enlighten fellow Filipinos about the root causes for why our society has become pathetically dependent on deploying migrant workers abroad.</p><p>And most importantly, please spread the word on the need to CoRRECTâ„¢ the 1987 Constitution!</p><p>Orion Perez D<br>Filipino in Singapore</p><p>Visitor comments :<br><a href="http://therealsingapore.com/content/fellow-pinoys-sg-we-should-blame-our-govt-not-sporeans-or-sg-their-xenophobia">http://therealsingapore.com/content/fellow-pinoys-sg-we-should-blame-our-govt-not-sporeans-or-sg-their-xenophobia</a></p></div>

              Introducing His Royal Highness Pengiran Digadong Sahibul Mal Pengiran Muda Jefri Bolkiah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien, the playboy socialite brother of the Sultan of Brunei (yes, the Sultan who visited Singapore last year and the SAF gave him plenty of live rounds to fire off in Singapore).
                      <br><br>
                      On average, Prince Jefri spends USD $50 million a month partying across the entire world, including having sex with countless celebrities, socialites and prostitutes in sex orgies every other night.
                      <br><br>
                      In the last decade alone, he partied away over USD $14.8 billion or Sg $19,730,000,000.00 (that's 8968 years of Lee Hsien Loong's salary).
                      <br><br>
                      He owns a collection of 2,300 luxury sports cars, 8 private planes and a helicopter, and 5 luxury yachts (each worth hundreds of millions) with names such as Tits, Nipple 1 and Nipple 2.

              The Pierre Png segment is from 24 min 20 sec onwards (duration approx 5 minutes).
              <br><br>
               It's worth watching cause you see him actively flirt, hug and grope the two female contestants ; in contrast he loses his temper with the male contestant and shouts at him angrily. 
              <br><br>
               Meanwhile, observer Tay Ping Hui is looking all serious and disturbed at this, while Bryan Wong is obviously enjoying it with a big smirk on his face.

              This was 5 years ago, back in 2010. Both sides of the "Pierre Png Road Rage" story :<p><img src="https://ashutterbugslife.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screen-shot-2010-12-05-at-pm-01-33-16.png"></p><p>-------------------------------------------</p><p>Celeb road rage: Pierre Png stops on extreme right lane of PIE to confront driver</p><p> A STOMPer was forced to pull over his car on the PIE after he honked and gestured disapprovingly at local celebrity Pierre Png for cutting into his lane.</p><p> In a phone conversation, the STOMPer reiterated that he was surprised that the celebrity would stop abruptly on the extreme right lane and confront him over such a trivial matter.</p><p> The STOMPer wrote:</p><p> "I was driving on the first lane of PIE towards Jurong when this car swerved into my lane without the slightest consideration that I was less than 10 metres behind.</p><p> "Fortunately I reacted quickly by slamming on my brakes and honking at the same time to indicate to the driver that what he just did was dangerous.</p><p> "I gestured to him with my hands and did curse and swear at the reckless driver in the privacy of my car.</p><p> "Now this alone was a trivial matter that happens on the road everyday, so I did not expect it when the car slowed down dramatically to a stop, forcing me to follow suit as I was only a few metres behind.</p><p> "It would have been too dangerous to switch lanes suddenly as we were on the right lane of the PIE and we could have caused a pile-up.</p><p> "While coming to a halt, I wondered if our cars had had any physical contact, which would have been the most legitimate reason for stopping in the middle of PIE.</p><p> "But neither car had a scratch on it.</p><p> "And then, to my biggest surprise, Pierre Png stepped out of the beautiful Mercedes and walked angrily towards me.</p><p> "He seemed really furious and looked ready to throw a punch.</p><p> "I refused to get out of my car or even wind down my window and merely gestured for him to return to his car.</p><p> "All this time, cars were going by honking at us.</p><p> "After putting up with this nonsense, I finally whipped out my iPhone and took a photo of him.</p><p> "He also went to his car and took out his phone to take photos of my license plate, but I didn't mind since it was obviously his fault.</p><p> "We drove off after that.</p><p> "I understand that this was a very small matter which was blown out of proportion by his behaviour.</p><p> "I would like him to learn a valuable lesson that he cannot act rashly and endanger people's lives over a small issue just because he is a celebrity.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------</p><p> By Joanna Goh, 03/12/2010<br> Pierre Png involved in road rage incident</p><p> The MediaCorp artiste shares his side of the story on a road rage incident which took place on Friday afternoon on the Pan Island Expressway</p><p> The local actor was accompanying his wife, Andrea De Cruz, at her routine checkup in the hospital when he received a text message from a reporter, seeking to clarify an incident which took place on the expressway hours ago in the afternoon.</p><p> According to a local website where the photo of the celebrity was posted, the driver claimed that Pierre's car had "swerved into my lane without the slightest consideration that I was less than 10 metres behind"</p><p> The driver also said that he "reacted quickly by slamming on my brakes" and decided to honk at Pierre's vehicle to "indicate to the driver that what he just did was dangerous." He admitted that he did "gestured" to the actor "with my hands" and also "did curse and swear at the reckless driver in the privacy of my car."</p><p> Over a phone interview with xinmsn on Friday night, Pierre Png and his wife shared that they was "shocked" at how things were blown out of proportion by a local driver, who had sent in a photo of the actor and his stationary vehicle to the website.</p><p> According to Pierre who was driving along the PIE (Pan Island Expressway) on Friday afternoon, he indicated his intention to switch lanes and did so when "all of the sudden, I saw a car that was initially two cars from me, speed up to just the back of my car."</p><p> Calling it a "close brush" Pierre added, "He almost rammed into the back of my car. I decided to slow down to see if our vehicle was bumped."</p><p> "Before I got out of the car, I thought the guy had flicked the finger. When I got out and walked to the other car, the guy showed me the middle finger. I asked him 'What's going on? Why flick the finger?' The driver looked away, refused to explain what just happened, and maintained ignorance."</p><p> "I decided to take pictures of his license plate because we originally intended to report the incident to the traffic police," said Pierre.</p><p> Commenting on the incident which lasted for "less than two minutes", Pierre said that he is "disappointed" at the way things have turned out.</p><p> "I initially decided to overlook the whole thing after we drove off. However, now that the matter has been blown out of proportion, I am intending to make a police report."</p><p>

              BBC news article "How do Singapore's poor families get by?"<br><br>
                  Nurhaida Binte Jantan is making dinner. She is roasting otah-otah, a Malay dish of fish paste wrapped in banana leaves, over a portable stove. <p></p>
                          <p>She is a 29-year-old unemployed single mother with six children from five to 13 years old. She lives in a tiny flat, just 30 square metres, with little furnishing. </p>
                          <p>There is no dining table, so the children eat their otah-otah with rice and chillies crouched on the floor. </p>
                          <p>The children share the single bedroom - their only bedding is mattresses and thick blankets. Nurhaida sleeps on the sofa in the living room.</p>
                          <p>She receives weekly groceries from charities, as well as about S$600 ($474, Â£262) a month in government aid and money from a boyfriend. But she admits that it is difficult to make ends meet. She has not been able to afford asthma medicine for her second daughter for months.</p>
                          <p>"No one can afford to get sick in this house because our finances are too tight. It's quite tough and a struggle for me to be raising them up," she said. </p>
                          <p>"I have to look after this house 24/7â€¦ so for me if I were to find a job, it would have to be a night job, so that once they are in bed, I can go out and the older kids can watch the young ones."</p>
                          <p>What is surprising about Nurhaida's story is that she lives in Singapore, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. But it is also one of the most costly. </p>
                          <p>Singapore recently ranked as the world's sixth most expensive city according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, and its property market is among the top 10, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
                          <p>The city-state's efficient infrastructure, relative safety and low taxes have attracted many of the world's wealthy. It now boasts more millionaires per capita than any other country.</p>
