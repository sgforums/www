There was also an incident only a couple of years ago, when a Royal prince from one state in Malaysia pointed a gun at the head of another Royal prince from another state in Malaysia, and the 1st prince also got his bodyguards to whack up the other prince until he almost died. This resulted in one Royal family pressing charges against the other Royal family, but nothing came out of it (the Police naturally hate to investigate into any Royal family, unless it's beyond any cover up, and/or directly ordered to do so by a reluctant Prime Minister).

              When a businessman complained about finding a cockroach in his stir-fried bittergourd dish, the restaurant's waitress insisted it was "perfectly normal" to find a cockroach in a restaurant and ate it in front of him.
              
               The incident was caught on camera by the man's dining companion, reported The Daily Mail.
              
               Businessman Zhang Yen, 43, was dining in a restaurant at Jinsha Era Plaza in Chengdu, China. He and his friend ordered two dishes, including stir-fried bittergourd (å¹²é��è‹¦ç“œ).
              
               "We ate half the dish. At first, I thought it might be dried chilli," Mr Zhang told Zhejiang Television (ZTV-7) reporters in Mandarin. When he looked closely, he realised that it was a cockroach, and called a waitress over.
              
               However, the waitress Jin Kuo told him that he'll find cockroaches in every restaurant, and that it was normal.
              
               Mr Zhang was upset and told her in a fit of anger that she should eat the cockroach to settle the matter. To his shock, Ms Jin picked up the bug from his plate and popped it into her mouth.
              
               When asked by a person off-camera why she did that, Ms Jin replied that Mr Zhang said the matter would be resolved if she ate the cockroach.
              
               Mr Zhang was left speechless and agreed to pay for his meal.
              
               During the commotion, the restaurant manager rushed over and assured Mr Zhang that she will have a meeting with her staff to explain how they should handle such situations, and that she will deduct Ms Jin's pay.
              
               The restaurant manager also explained that the cockroach may have fallen from the ceiling due to the heat when cooking.

               Restaurant manager swallows condom 'found' in dish 
               The Star/ANN
              
               A restaurant manager swallowed a condom after some customers allegedly discovered it in a dish at a restaurant in Hefei, China, China Press reported.
              
               A customer known only as Liang said she found the condom with the baked fish after eating the dish for 30 minutes with two of her friends on May 9, 2014.
              
               One of Liang's friends suffered stomach ache and vomited but Liang claimed the restaurant refused to call for an ambulance.
              
               The manager claimed that the customers asked her to swallow the condom to settle the issue or the restaurant had to compensate them. However, Liang and her friends insisted that they did not ask the manager to swallow the condom.
              
               A worker of the restaurant said in theory, any condom would have melted as the dish was baked at high temperatures, but the customers insisted that the condom was there when the dish was served. Apparently, Liang and her friends asked for 100,000 yuan (about S$20,000) as compensation.

               Restaurant manager swallows cockroach 
               The Daily Chilli
              
               A restaurant manager swallowed a cockroach discovered in a customer's dish to destroy evidence.
              
               The incident occurred when Huang Xiaogang and friends were having a meal at a restaurant in Caidian of Wuhan province, China in May 2010.
              
               Huang spotted a black object in the pot of mushrooms and picked it up with his chopsticks.
              
               He was shocked to find out that it was*a dead cockroach and complained to the restaurant manager, Wuhan Wanbao reported.
              
               The manager joked that the insect had been "sterilised in high temperature" and was not dirty anymore.
              
               He also assured them that the insect would not cause any harm to their health.
              
               Then, he picked up the insect and swallowed it.
              
               The manager later told health officers that he was worried that the customers would demand high compensation and he swallowed the cockroach to destroy evidence.
              
               He waived Huang's bill of 570 yuan (S$116).

              Every year, many thousands of JC students with all straight As, and hundreds of Poly students with perfect GPAs, have to compete tooth and nail for just 200 places in NUS+NTU Medical School. Every year (for last few decades), hundreds of these straight As students are forced to study Medicine abroad (and these are the lucky ones whose family can afford the $1 million fees + expenses to study Medicine overseas), and the fact that recognized Medical schools overseas (including many even better than NUS) accept them, proves they're actually good enough to be medical doctors.
               And yet, every year PAP says "Jialat lah! we not enuff medical doctors in our hospitals leh! must import a lot more FT doctors!" and keep bringing in thousands of FT doctors every year. When our own Singaporean students who are good enough to study Medicine, are deprived of the opportunity to study Medicine locally.

              A poor sentiment, my friend.
              
               You see, if the PAP did not import more doctors, we would have an acute shortage of doctors as the number of patients spiked in the recent years. 
              
               Medicine is an important vocation, too important in fact, to allow local students without the necessary years of housemanship to take on key roles as specialists. 
              
               As you must now realize, the PAP had to make difficult trade offs. Without them we would have let our emotions get in the way of doing what is best for the people. For that, you have to thank the PAP.

              I have 2 nephews who were scored straight As for the A levels and yet were denied admission to our medical school here. Both had to study abroad and their respective university assessed them to so very good after their first and second year that they were both granted scholarships for the remaining years of the course. Now both of them are practicing overseas and really doing very well. Asked them if they ever want to come back to practice in Spore, they both said "tell the PAP government to go fuck itself". They very much prefer to contribute to the overseas country that treated them so much better than Singapore.
              
               My 2 nephews are just tip of the iceberg. I am sure many many more Singapore students who even better than them have been denied entry by PAP to medicine school here. The PAP would instead open their assholes to freely let Pinoys, Ah Nehs and Burmese with fake degrees in. And as a side point, if one ever get attended by a Pinoy doctor, be very very careful as almost 100% he or she is a quack. Of all foreign trash here, the Pinoys are the biggest bull shitter, even worse than Ah Nehs.

              Dear TRS,
                       <br><br>
                      A Local Indian Business owner complained to me the other day that he couldn't find locals to work for him so he wanted to hire foreigners.
                       <br><br>
                      He runs a lorry transportation business and this is the conversation that I had with him:
                       <br><br>
                      Business owner: I cannot find locals to work for me. I want to hire foreigners on SPASS but can't meet quota.
                       <br><br>
                      Me: How much are you paying the locals?
                       <br><br>
                      B: $600 to $800.
                       <br><br>
                      Me: You know right foreigners on SPASS minimum salary is $2.2K?
                       <br><br>
                      B: Ya I know. But what to do. I can't get locals to work for me. I advertise for 2 weeks but no one wants. So that's why I want to hire foreigners on SPASS. But MOM says I don't have the quota. I have enough head count. 6 locals to 1 SPASS.
                       <br><br>
                      Me: You do know that if salary of locals are below 1K, they're considered to be part-time workers?
                       <br><br>
                      B: But they are working full-time what..
                       <br><br>
                      Me: B, you mean you pay locals ONLY $600-$800 for full-time staffs? And you are willing to pay $2.2K to foreigners on SPASS?
                       <br><br>
                      B: What to do.. No locals want to work for me. Very difficult for me to hire locals.
                       <br><br>
                      Me: On $600-$800 per month? For a full-time job? Local Singaporeans? Are you sure?
                       <br><br>
                      B: Yes that's why I need to hire foreigners. No locals want this job.
                       <br><br>
                      Our conversation continued and I found out that he wanted to hire a foreigner because he could just over-declare their salary to MOM so he could still hire them for a fairly low price.
                       <br><br>
                      Currently, he has 8 locals working for him but the MOM rules say that part timers only count for half a person on the quota so he would need at least 12 locals earning less than $1k before he could hire a foreigner.
                      <br><br> 
                      What's worse, he even went on to complain that the locals working for him often take MC and AWOL complaining of body aches and pains.
                       <br><br>
                      But when he's paying Singaporeans only $600 to $800 a month for full-time work, there's really no surprises.
                       <br><br>
                      This whole thing made me wonder, who exactly are the ones complaining to the government about labour shortages?
                       <br><br>
                      Are they all like this business owner who just want an easy, cheap way to exploit workers (both local and foreign)? We really shouldn't be entertaining their demands because it's clearly just promoting bad business practices to let in cheap foreign labour to satisfy such terrible employers.
                       <br><br>
