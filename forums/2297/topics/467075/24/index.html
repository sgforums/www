              Three teenagers arrested for robbing taxi driver of Sg$5.00 at Japanese Gardens Road
                  <br><br>
                  Three teenagers, aged between 16 and 17, were arrested on Sunday for their suspected involvement in a case of robbery from a taxi at Japanese Gardens Road. The police said in a statement that early on Sunday morning, the taxi driver, who was the victim, made a report that he had been assaulted and robbed of Sg$5.00 cash. The identities and whereabouts of the suspects were established with the description provided by the victim. Officers from Clementi Police Division then managed to establish the whereabouts of the suspects and arrested all three within eight hours of the time the report was lodged. Commander of Clementi Police Division, Deputy Assistant Commissioner of Police Melvin Yong advises victims of such crime to be calm and composed when confronted and to take note of the culprits' descriptions

              It's not really a mystery of course. Almost all of these structures can be linked to ExtraTerrestrial involvement in some way or other.

                           As many of you would know, I'm a huge fan of Dempsey. It is home to many lovely establishments and I've never had a truly bad experience. However, that all changed over the weekend when I went to Don Quijote. Having received rather bad service at the door, I sent the management a note. Being in the F&amp;B industry myself, I appreciate it when someone gives me a heads up on bad service.
                          <br><br>
                           However, I wasnâ€™t expecting the reply that owner Ken Lim sent.
                          â€œIn eight words, who the **** do you think you are?â€�
                          <br><br>
                          We are constantly complaining about the lack of service culture in Singapore and attribute it to a general lack of staff in the industry. Sure, the lack of staff is one reason â€“ less staff, lower standards of service. Weâ€™re in an industry wide crunch and everyoneâ€™s trying their best to cope. So Mr Ken, I do understand where youâ€™re coming from. What better way to save time on service recovery then a templated â€œ**** you?â€�
                          <br><br>
                          Of course it does not help when owners themselves validate bad service but Mr Ken, Iâ€™m neither mad nor upset about your reply. Iâ€™d just like a glass of whatever you were drinking.

                           People like to react to sensational tit bits... without actually knowing the facts... You posted what you wanted everyone to see and hear, without the full facts and I wonder how you manage to call yourself a professional of any industry, whether F&amp;B or other..
                          <br><br>
                           Here's the parts you left out.. That my staff in question was at no point rude to you and in fact apologized several times that we were not able to accommodate you, but for whatever reasons you had, maybe showing off to friend, you decided to get abusive instead and even your email was racist, pointing out a Filipino staff with bad service, where because her command of the English language isn't as high as yours, and maybe could have explained things better, but instead you flew the coop and then followed up with a scathing email, signing off with your company credentials..?
                          <br><br>
                           Was your visit in a personal or corporate capacity? Were you emailing us in your "professional" (I would have to use this word very loosely with you) capacity and complaining as a representative of your company?
                          <br><br>
                           I will not engage any further exchange with you, whether be it online and in any other medium so you may continue with your banter about how professional you actually are and what a victim you were when what I have is my now 8th year reputation for having higher-than-most standards of service to stand on.
                          <br><br>
                           Bottom line.. If you had written to us in a personal capacity, I would be bestowed every courtesy that is bestowed on ALL our customers.. But because you chose to do so with your corporate details and titles, to me, seeing that you are "a professional in the F&amp;B industry", to me, you should not go up to someone else's house and kick the gate because if you do, then you should be prepared to get bitten by the dog. In my opinion your deplorable behavior towards both my staff and us all collectively was bully-like and racist-like which just added to things and I responded accordingly.
                          <br><br>
                          Ken Lim,

              'Are you from China?' College student, 20, killed by racist thugs in New Delhi
              <br><br>
              Indians from a part of India near Myanmar and China say they face discrimination in rest of the country for their 'Chinese Asian' features
              <br><br>

              <img src="http://www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486x302/public/2014/02/03/0b148536a27783fc55b685012acb693.jpg">
              <br><br>
              
              The death of Nido Tania on Thursday sparked a swift outcry across social media in India. Taniaâ€™s supporters produced images, including the one above. Photo: SCMP
              <br><br>
              
               He was a slight young man, who sported hipster eyeglasses and a wispy moustache. He had dyed his spiky hair blond, but that was not the only thing that made college student Nido Tania stand out in the Indian capital.<br><br>
              
               Tania was from northeastern India, a narrow strip of territory wedged between China and Myanmar, whose people say they face discrimination in the rest of the country for having "Asian" facial features. When Tania, 20, stopped in a dairy to ask for directions on Tuesday afternoon, the shopkeeper taunted Tania for not knowing his way around, saying, "Are you from China?" and making fun of his hair.<br><br>
              
               The incident escalated into a violent altercation in which several men thrashed him with sticks and steel rods, friends and officials said. He died in his bed the next day, succumbing to severe injuries to the chest and brain, according to preliminary medical results provided to his family.<br><br>
              
               The incident has sparked outrage in New Delhi, which was already reeling from a spate of high-profile rape cases, and has added to a growing sense of insecurity in a capital that is aiming to be a showcase for India's growing economic might.<br><br>
              
              Protesters shout slogans outside a police station in New Delhi on Saturday. Many people have criticised the response of the Delhi police to the young manâ€™s beating and death. <br><br>
              
               Hundreds of protesters rallied on Saturday in Lajpat Nagar, the market where the beating took place, calling it a hate crime and demanding that the assailants be prosecuted.<br><br>
              
               "This was a racist hate crime," said Albina Subba, an advertising writer originally from the northeast Himalayan town of Darjeeling.<br><br>
              
               "Our community is often targeted like this â€¦ We look different, so it's easy for people to see we're not from Delhi."<br><br>
              
               She added: "We have little faith in the Delhi police, but this time we want them to take action. This happens every day in Delhi. Each and every one of us has experienced discrimination because of our Chinese looking physical features," said Sophy Chamroy, a 22-year-old student from the northeastern state of Manipur.<br><br>
              
               India's 1.2 billion people have many languages and customs but, as with the rape cases, racially motivated assaults seem to occur in New Delhi and other major cities with regularity. Many victims from the northeast are young people who have migrated to the capital for school or job opportunities lacking in their poorer home areas.<br><br>
              
               Last year in New Delhi, three students from Manipur were beaten by neighbours. In a separate case, a 21-year-old beautician from Manipur was found dead in her apartment with injuries to her face and toes. Police labeled it a suicide and dropped the case but many suspected she was murdered for looking Chinese.<br><br>
              
               So widespread is the discrimination against people from northeastern India that the federal government in 2012 passed a law that punishes the use of a racial slur with up to five years in prison. Still, activists say, authorities rarely enforce such laws and police are as likely to participate in discrimination as intervene to stop it.<br><br>
              
               "You don't know what is on the minds of people in Delhi, because these incidents keep on recurring," said Geetartha Barua, an official with the state government of Arunachal Pradesh, where Tania lived.<br><br>
              
               Tania was in New Delhi on vacation and going to visit an ailing friend in the area near Lajpat Nagar when he walked into the dairy, friends said.<br><br>
              
               Tania smashed a glass display case in anger after being taunted, prompting the shopkeeper and several other men from the market to set upon him and a friend. The shopkeepers called the police, who got Tania to pay about US$120 for the broken glass. The police did not take any action against the assailants, Barua said.<br><br>
              
               Police officers let Tania go, but when he passed the shop a second time the attackers beat him again, said Jotam Toko Tagam, the former president of a New Delhi organisation for students from Arunachal Pradesh. When he reached his sister's flat, where he was staying, he complained of pain and was bleeding from his wrist. He fell asleep early on Thursday morning after applying balms across his body, Tagam said. Around 1pm the next day, friends tried to wake him but found his body cold and limp. Brought to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead on arrival, Barua said.<br><br>
              
               The case sparked an outcry across Indian media and websites with many criticising the response by the Delhi police. Three men reportedly have been detained for questioning. Barua said police did not open a murder investigation until 24 hours after Tania had died, after the incident had begun to make news.<br><br>
              
               "We are being forced to go exert pressure on different quarters to get the police to investigate this matter properly, at a time when the situation is very sad," Barua said.

As many pointed out, this is a PAP outfit and they were spot on. Some have suggested it should be renamed motherfucker but that's beside the point. 
              <br><br>
               Philip Yeo is also a key player. The perennial underformer with no useful talent outside the PAP establishment and no useful contribution ever to Singapore's economy apart from lap-dogging his political master's wishes has been roped in as well. I suspect Lim Swee Say will also be roped in after he has lost the 2016 GE to WP's East Coast team lead by Gerald Giam. This combination should be potent. 
              <br><br>
               PM Lee Hsien Loong has made it clear losers have no place in his administration, and George Yeo, being a loser, is no exception. I see George Yeo's helming of mothership as an attempt to make a feeble comeback, possibly in preparation for grander things ahead. George Yeo still has his supporters in the PAP camp, a few of whom are still sore over Aljunied 2011. I won't be surprised Georgie is gearing up a younger cohort of ambitious PAP leaders to try to make change from within and break the PAP away from the monopoly of right-wing diehards closely affiliated and still intensely loyal to both Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong.
              <br><br>
               But whatever the case is, expect mothership.sg to soon become a laughing stock of local social media circles. The younger PAP establishment are starting to think that since you can't beat the crowd, you might as well join them, and hopefully present a moderate alternative to the vociferous cacophony of anti-PAP resentment circulating the web of a 24-hr basis. But I expect them to fail miserably. If the mindset has not changed, it is difficult to expect these chaps to change the PAP from within. They will merely be trying to play the same tune with just a few notes different.
              <br><br>
               Potato chips Belmont Lay is in too. If you observe him, he has been hopping all over the place for the past few years trying desperately to make his mark but failing due to lack of substance. And I'm not even talking about being pro or anti estab. This is a chap who couldn't even pen a coherent pro PAP piece if he wanted. It is no surprise that he has officially, like Andrew Loh, joined establishment ranks in order to get accepted and gain more exposure to key members. Nicole was right to leave him. I am willing to bet part of her depression was due to finding out what a shallow guy he truly was.

              An angry cyclist grabbed and twisted the side-view mirror of a 60-year-old housewife's car during a confrontation along Loyang Road.
              <br><br>
              According to a report on Shin Min Daily News and omy.sg, she had left her home to pick up her husband at the airport.
              <br><br>
              When she was about to turn out of her apartment into Loyang Road, she spied a Caucasian cyclist approaching on a bike.
              <br><br>
              Judging that she had ample room to make the turn safely, she did so, only to find the cyclist had ridden up to the side of her car and started banging on her door.
              <br><br>
              During the altercation, the man had apparently twisted her side view mirror, then tried stopping her car.
              <br><br>
              Madam Lim however changed lanes and drove off to avoid him.
              <br><br>
              She later lodged a police report over the matter.

              Dear The Real Singapore,
              <br><br>
              My 17 year old daughter and some school friends went to Siloso Beach on Sentosa over the Chinese New Year Weekend. When they got there, they spread out their towels in anticipation of a relaxing day by the sea. There were other bathers parked on the beach besides them -- all in their swimsuits.
              <br><br>
              Some minutes later, several groups of what appeared to be workers arrived on the beach (refer to picture above). The kids were shocked when, without invitation, the large group of men surrounded them just feet away and began to take out their hand phones to snap pictures of them in their bikini. One of the girls angrily told them to stop taking pictures, but she was ignored. Some even moved closer. An alert lifeguard -- to his credit -- noticed what was happening. He approached the girls and asked if they were uncomfortable with the situation. When they voiced their upset, he hoisted a megaphone and told the men to move away and to cease taking pictures. He was ignored. He warned them he'd call the police. Eventually that's exactly what he did. 
              <br><br>
              Four uniformed police soon arrived and ordered the groups to keep their distance from the kids and to stop taking pictures. I understand that the cops even took the hand phones off some of the men and deleted shots they had already taken. As a mother, I am deeply shocked at this incident. It's a free country but the harassment scares me. And acting as a pack to bully vulnerable teenagers - disgraceful. But it also brings to my mind the issue of creating/increasing or improving the places of rest where workers can go on their day off. They are entitled to it. 
              <br><br>
              But NOT at the expense of embarrassing 16 and 17 year old girls clad vulnerably in their swimsuits who felt threatened. The girls were traumatized by the blatant gawking. Bouquets to the lifeguard and our Singapore boys in blue for doing their job. We don't always notice or appreciate the situations they face every day, and the challenges they must deal with to keep the peace. They deserve our highest praise.
                <br><br>

              We were there in the same beach on Sunday, Coates cafe on siloso, starting from noon, lots of foreigners worker in their day off were walking up and down the beach taking pic of children and gals in bikinis. I went up to a few of them whom I caught them taking pix, told then to show me their pix, one of them told me no and told me 'no', I shouted at them that I will call the police and they will show the pix to the police instead, I snatch the phone anyway and to my surprise, there are pix of gals on the beach zoom in capture pix and kids! I was furious as my kids are on the beach too, told them to delete it and all the others pix of others! It's really shocking! Can't imagine what are they gonna do with those pix!

They were gawking at any girls, girlfriends, wives walking at the beach with some loitering around tents behaving suspiciously both day and night. My brother-in-law almost send one to either mortuary or the ICU if one of us had not intervened.

              Lawrence Khong, FCBC :
                  <a href="http://mypaper.sg/opinion/hpbs-sexuality-faqs-undermine-family-20140206">http://mypaper.sg/opinion/hpbs-sexuality-faqs-undermine-family-20140206</a>
                  <br><br>
                  The FAQs On Sexuality page on the Health Promotion Board (HPB) website is shocking and deeply upsetting. 
                  <br><br>
                  The tone of the entire article gives the impression that HPB condones same-sex relationships and promotes homosexual practice as something normal. 
                  <br><br>
                  The author appears to have taken sides on a highly contentious and politicised subject. Here, I address five issues covered in the FAQs.
                  <br><br>
                  ISSUE 1
                  <br><br>
                  The FAQs draw a false equation between heterosexual and homosexual relationships in a manner that smacks of liberationist propaganda intended to mainstream homosexuality.
                  <br><br>
                  We disagree that "a same-sex relationship is not too different from a heterosexual relationship". There is a vast and fundamental difference between heterosexual and homosexual relationships.
                  <br><br>
                  A heterosexual relationship is natural and normal, with the capacity to procreate. This is based on the fact that male and female bodies are sexually complementary.
                  <br><br>
                  In contrast, such sexual complementarity does not exist between two people of the same sex. A homosexual relationship is, therefore, unnatural, abnormal, and procreation is impossible.
                  <br><br>
                  Such a false equation is very worrisome on several counts: 
                  <br><br>
                  It blatantly promotes and encourages an alternative lifestyle that violates the moral standard set out by the law of the land, which regards heterosexual relationships as the norm. This is reflected in the distinction between heterosexual and homosexual relationships under laws such as Section 377A of the Penal Code.
                  <br><br>
                  It desensitises Singapore's young on issues of decency and morality. 
                  <br><br>
                  It goes against the majority view that the homosexual lifestyle is wrong and undesirable for our nation.
                  <br><br>
                  It contradicts declared government policy.
                  <br><br>
                  It undermines our pro-family Government's efforts to encourage heterosexual marriage to boost our national birth rate, perpetuate the family unit (the basic building block of society), bring up the next generation and ensure the continuity of this nation.
                  <br><br>
                  ISSUE 2
                  <br><br>
                  HPB adopted a biased and selective approach by naming only a pro-LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) group to help those who are looking for support.
                  <br><br>
                  We are disappointed that HPB's original article referenced only one option for help, namely Oogachaga. Its hotline is run by specially trained LGBTs or LGBT-affirming counsellors.
                  <br><br>
                  To exclude other available avenues of care, such as Liberty League and Focus on the Family, is to discriminate in favour of LGBT-affirming organisations. This is both unjust and harmful.
                  <br><br>
                  ISSUE 3
                  <br><br>
                  The FAQs use politically charged language and one-sided terms like "homophobia", which are misleading and highly offensive to us. 
                  <br><br>
                  We disagree with the claim that moral objection to homosexual behaviour is based on "irrational fear, disgust, or hatred" of homosexuals or bisexuals because they "do not conform to traditional sexual roles and stereotypes". Far from it. Moral objection is based on the intrinsic physiological nature of the male and female bodies. 
                  <br><br>
                  We do not despise homosexuals or hold them in contempt. We esteem them as fellow human beings of intrinsic worth. Each one is precious, deserving respect and love, just like anyone else.

                  <br><br>
                  The FAQs fail to give an accurate picture and clear warnings of the health risks posed by alternative sex. 
                  <br><br>
                  According to medical research and mental-health studies, the threat is real and severe. Homosexuals have a shorter lifespan, more sexually transmitted infections and more health problems than the general population.
                  <br><br>
                  ISSUE 5
                  <br><br>
                  The FAQs make an unproven assertion that homosexuals can have long-lasting relationships and, in this way, the FAQs clearly promote a "mainstreaming homosexuality as normal" bias.
                  <br><br>
                  We disagree because this claim is only theoretical. Some research findings show a different trend. Homosexuals register a higher incidence of short-lived relationships and sexual violence.
                  <br><br>
                  In closing, this is a national concern. It is about the kind of Singapore we want in 20, 30, 50 years from now. Our actions today will affect the future for generations to come. 
                  <br><br>
                  The right actions will help the family unit to thrive and the nation to flourish. Misguided actions will yield bad outcomes and destructive repercussions. As the family unit goes, so goes society, so goes the nation.
                  <br><br>
                  This year is the International Year of the Family, and next year is our nation's 50th birthday. I love this nation. This little red dot we call home is precious. We must not fail her on our watch. 
                  <br><br>
                  May the Health Ministry and HPB lead the way, and do the right thing to build a healthier Singapore. I look forward to new FAQs that reflect the views of Singapore's conservative majority, reinforce our Government's position and serve our national interests.

                  <br><br>
                  Jolene Tan, AWARE :
                  <a href="http://mypaper.sg/opinion/inclusive-society-must-promote-health-all-20140206">http://mypaper.sg/opinion/inclusive-society-must-promote-health-all-20140206</a>
                  <br><br>
                  The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has a simple mandate: "to build a nation of healthy people". As a government agency, its responsibility is to promote the physical and mental health of all members of society equally, regardless of sexual orientation. 
                  <br><br>
                  The publication of factual, non-judgmental information about homosexuality and bisexuality falls squarely within this mission. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights identify access to health-related information, including sexual health, as a crucial part of access to health care.
                  <br><br>
                  Unless the information available reflects the reality of human diversity, many will be excluded from a better understanding of themselves and those close to them, and consequently from the opportunity to make informed decisions about their own health.
                  <br><br>
                  The recent statements on sexuality that have attracted so much attention are unambiguously supported by longstanding medical and scientific consensus. The WHO explicitly names "recognising and respecting sexual diversity" as one of a few "key principles" for policymakers seeking to promote sexual health.
                  <br><br>
                  Experts with an evidence-based approach widely agree that homosexuality and bisexuality are not mental illnesses. 
                  <br><br>
                  Over 20 years ago, the WHO, after reviewing the evidence, removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases. This position is shared by numerous medical and scientific bodies, including the American Psychological Association, Britain's Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) and the Chinese Psychiatric Association. 
                  <br><br>
                  The HPB has not only the right, but also the duty to dispel any myths to the contrary. In fact, a commitment to improving public health necessitates battling the stigma surrounding same-sex relations. 
                  <br><br>
                  A fear of prejudiced health professionals can hold gay, lesbian and bisexual people back from seeking necessary medical help, or discourage them from sharing with their medical advisers potentially relevant information, such as the nature of their sexual activities.
                  <br><br>
                  The HPB is also sensible to focus on educating the parents of young gay, lesbian and bisexual people. The RCP notes that societal discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, including rejection from family members, often has a strong negative impact on the mental health of gay, lesbian and bisexual people.
                  <br><br>
                  Researchers in San Francisco found a strong association between negative parental reactions to sexual orientation and young people's experiences of depression, suicide and unprotected sex.
                  <br><br>
                  Addressing parental misconceptions about sexuality can prevent needless anguish on the part of children and parents alike, helping to preserve family relationships by improving mutual understanding.
                  <br><br>
                  Of course, one set of frequently asked questions cannot single-handedly vanquish all discrimination that lesbian, gay and bisexual people may face. 
                  <br><br>
                  Referrals to appropriate support services are therefore crucial to assist them and their loved ones in navigating an often hostile or uncomprehending social environment.
                  <br><br>
                  Importantly, such services should not treat homosexuality or bisexuality as a wrong to be "cured" - an approach which the WHO has described as "unscientific, potentially harmful" and a contributor to "stigmatisation". 
                  <br><br>
                  It was disappointing to see the HPB remove information previously found on the webpage about reliably supportive services offered by Action for Aids, Oogachaga and Safe Singapore.
                  <br><br>
                  No doubt, some in Singapore regard same-sex sexual relations with distaste or disapproval. But the HPB's primary concern is health; and, in an inclusive society, health is for everyone, not only those judged by the self-styled guardians of sexual normality to be suitably pure. 
                  <br><br>
                  The state must not deny access to vital information about sexual health out of deference to unevidenced ideological prescriptions. 
                  <br><br>
                  And, as individuals, we can all come to our own moral judgments - including on those who push for their discriminatory ideals to come before the physical and mental well-being of real people.
