            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b169/gwzc_mk2/an.jpg"><br><br>Angelia He Xue Li (above) killed by Regan Lee Da Wen (below)<br><br><img src="http://images.allsingaporestuff.com/styles/big_within_article/s3/field/image/regan-lee-da-wen_0.jpg"><br><br>Angelia He Xue Li, whose life was tragically cut short at the tender age of 22 as a result of the reckless driving of Regan Lee Da Wen.<br><br>In October 2005, Lee had walked into the showroom where Ms. He worked, saying that he wanted to test drive a Mazda MX-5 sports car. Ms. He agreed to attend to him even though she was already off duty and planning to meet up with friends after work. Despite his unfamiliarity with the Paya Lebar area and extensive road works there, Lee still drove at speeds in excess of 90km/hr. He lost control of the car, causing it to cross a road divider and crash into a BMW approaching from the opposite direction. The impact then caused the car to flip over and crash onto the roof of an oncoming van. Ms. He died of her injuries an hour later in hospital, while both the occupants of the BMW were seriously injured.<br><br>Despite killing a young woman who was â€œa very nice helpful girlâ€� according to everyone who knew her and seriously injuring two others, Lee remained free while the police â€œinvestigatedâ€� the case. That would have been the end of the matter, except that Lee showed absolutely no remorse over causing the death of Ms. He and the injuries to the occupants of the BMW. Instead, he went on an online forum for car owners and buyers and bragged about how he may end up having to but two different sports cars if he couldnâ€™t decide how to choose between them. On of the forum members who went by the handle of â€œLegendkillerâ€� recognized Lee as the driver whose reckless stupidity killed his friend, Ms. He.<br><br> Angered by the fact that Lee was still free and driving, and showing absolutely no remorse for killing Ms. He, as seen by his shopping for sports cars, Legendkiller paid $1,000/- of his own money to hire a private investigator to obtain evidence that Lee was the driver of the MX-5. The PI found the evidence, and Legendkiller presented it to the Traffic Police. Incredibly, the TP said that they donâ€™t have sufficient evidence to prosecute Lee. They even said that as the road where the accident had occurred had been resurface, they might not be able to obtain evidence that Lee had been speeding.<br><br>Outraged by the attitude of the police, Legendkiller publicly unmasked Lee as the man who caused Angelia Heâ€™s death. It didnâ€™t take long for mounting public anger to result in Lee receiving threats of physical violence and even death. At this point, 18 months after killing Ms. He, the police finally charged Lee. Incredibly, he was allowed to plea bargain from a reckless act, which would have earned him several years in prison, to a rash act, which earned him only a fine and seven months in prison and a 10 year ban from driving.<br><br>Following sentencing, Ms. Heâ€™s father, and odd-job laborer, lamented that he wondered who would now look after him and his homemaker wife since their only child had died.<br><br></div>

Why the need to close school canteens during Ramadhan? Why must non-Malay pupils be asked to drink behind closed doors and even in the toilet? Just because our kids are learning how to fast?

            <div class='col-md body'>(Malaysian Malay Muslim) <b>Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani</b> writes the truth in the following excellent hit-the-nail-on-the-head article :<p>Recent religious controversies in Malaysia point towards an increasing influence of Islam that affects the rights of minorities and non-Muslims, a trend that appears to be in line with the governmentâ€™s agenda as it seeks to retain the popular vote.</p><p>During the recent SEA Games in Singapore, Malaysian gymnast Farah Ann Abdul Hadi was berated online for wearing a leotard, despite winning gold medals for the country. On Monday, two women were denied entry into the Selangor state secretariat building for wearing skirts that were deemed inappropriate. It comes less than a month after the Road Transport Department told another woman to wear a sarong to cover up her legs if she wanted to be served and another report yesterday of a similar incident at a hospital in Petaling Jaya last week.<br> </p><p><br>These incidents over dressing â€” or lack of it â€” have created an uproar among Malaysians, with some defending the gymnast and the women. There are also many other instances that suggest the authorities are stepping up efforts to enforce the practices of Sunni Islam as part of the governmentâ€™s long-running Islamisation policy.</p><p>For instance, the Kedah Islamic Religious Department announced that, beginning this month, Muslims who fail to perform Friday prayers three times in a row can be fined not exceeding RM1,000 (S$360) or jailed for up to six months, or both.</p><p>This comes after a report in Bernama last month that the Home Ministry has banned four books authored by novelist Faisal Tehrani, as they were found to have contained Shia elements and contravened the teachings of Sunni Islam.</p><p>The larger aim of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in institutionalising Sunni Islam in the country is to counter the opposition Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) in winning the hearts and minds of the Malay Muslims.</p><p>The policy has led not only to the expansion of the Islamic bureaucracy, but has also undermined the Constitutionâ€™s secular foundation. What are the origins of such a policy and what does it mean for Malaysians at large?</p><p>Islamisation policy unofficially started when Malaya (Malaysia) became independent in 1957. The Malaysian government expanded its Islamisation efforts in the early â€™70s by instituting a number of Cabinet-level offices and national Islamisation policies. The worldwide Islam revivalism in the â€™70s also contributed to the general Islamisation process in Malaysia. </p><p>Since the â€™80s, the government has aggressively championed Islamisation policies under three Prime Ministers, namely â€œPenerapan Nilai-Nilai Islamâ€� (Inculcation of Islamic Values) under Dr Mahathir Mohamad; â€œIslam Hadhariâ€� (Civilisation Islam) under Mr Abdullah Badawi; and Islam â€œWasatiyyahâ€� (moderation in Islam) under Mr Najib Razak. </p><p>These policies helped spread Islamic education in local universities to produce talent with the required knowledge and skills in Islam. At the same time, graduates of these programmes have been systemically recruited into the public bureaucracy to protect, strengthen and spread Islam. This has pushed the rapid expansion of Islamic bureaucracy and institutionalised Islamic law to an extent that was unimaginable in the pre-colonial era.</p><p>Since the â€™90s, the Islamic bureaucracy, supported by the BN government led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), has been enforcing Islam on Muslims through moral policing based on an adherence to the Sunni doctrine of Islam.</p><p>UMNOâ€™s push for Islamisation is politically motivated, based on its belief that the party must act as a bastion of the Islamic faith to boost political support among Malay Muslims, who make up the majority of the population. </p><p>The latest initiative coming out of the close collaboration between UMNO and the Islamic bureaucracy is the proposed implementation of the Syariah (compliance) Index. Launched in February by Mr Najib, the index complements Islamic governance through a more comprehensive Syariah yardstick in eight major areas, namely legal, politics, economy, education, culture, infrastructure, environment and social. This will further strengthen UMNO as the defender of Islam in Malaysia.</p><p>UMNO has also showed tacit support for PASâ€™ move to introduce hudud law (Islamic criminal law) in the state of Kelantan. Again, the move is politically motivated, aimed at putting pressure on fault lines within the opposition Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition. UMNOâ€™s strategy appears to have paid off, with PR now in tatters over disagreement on the hudud issue. </p><p>This will definitely give an advantage to the ruling BN at the next general election. And if the move to implement hudud law is passed by Parliament, Malaysia will enter a new phase of Islamisation policy and political Islam.</p><p>The Islamisation policy in Malaysia has several aims. </p><p>The first is to make Islam a special religion, unlike in secular countries, with a special state-sponsored Islamisation policy. This allows for the federal and state governments to establish departments, agencies, education institutions and courts to manage the policyâ€™s affairs and fund its activities. </p><p>This expansion of Islamic bureaucracy goes hand in hand with the agenda to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.</p><p>Second, it enforces the Sunni Islamic teaching to all Muslims in Malaysia through the Syariah Index and the fight against any other type of Islamic teaching such as Shiism and Liberal Islam. This adversely affects the practice of pluralism and intra-religious freedom in Malaysia.</p><p>Third, it provides more power to the Islamic bureaucracy in monopolising the interpretation of Islam through the Administration of the Islamic Law Act. Thus, Islamisation has also had significant ramifications on non-Muslims in practising their religion, as demonstrated by the â€œAllahâ€� issue, where the Catholic Church has lost a legal battle to use the word.</p><p>Finally, it essentially gives legitimacy to the BN government, which works closely with the Islamic bureaucracy, for championing the issue of Islam against other Islamisation agendas by opposing political parties, particularly PAS, and civil society movements. UMNO believes that as long as the party is championing Islam, it will always have Malay-Muslim support. </p><p>Clearly, Islam will continue to play an important role in determining the future of politics and ethnic relations in Malaysia. Unfortunately, the religion will be exploited to benefit those in pursuit of power and dominance, with adverse consequences for the secular foundation of the Malaysian Constitution, leading to the marginalisation of the non-Muslim communities.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Dr Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani is an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Universiti Utara Malaysia.
