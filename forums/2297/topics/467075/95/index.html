Separately, in India, Bhargava will begin in March to manufacture and distribute an electricity-generating bicycle for poor households that he plans to sell for as little as $200.<br><br>His decision to move most inventions from his laboratory in suburban Detroit to Singapore reflects the city-stateâ€™s all-out efforts to attract global technology firms and build its own version of Silicon Valley. The 62-year-old began discussing the move with officials about three years ago and ultimately agreed because of their ability to get things done quickly.<br><br>â€œThey had this facility built, up and running in eight weeks,â€� Bhargava said, referring to the Singapore plant. â€œIn India, it could take a year. In the U.S., we would be waiting for the fire marshal.â€�<br><br>The billionaireâ€™s decision follows investments by other entrepreneurs into Singapore. Roger Egan, a former investment banker who hails from New Jersey, co-founded online grocer Redmart in Singapore. American entrepreneur Razmig Hovaghimian and his two Korean partners in Viki Inc., the global TV streaming service with fan-translated subtitles, chose Singapore as its base in part for the proximity to key markets. Japanâ€™s e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. acquired Viki in 2013.<br><br>â€œThe entrepreneurship ecosystem in Singapore is slowly and steadily growing towards a scenario which appears to be attracting entrepreneurs from outside,â€� said Arcot Desai Narasimhalu, the director of Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Singapore Management University. â€œSuch success stories will help position Singapore as an attractive eco-center for entrepreneurs around the world.â€�</div>

That we would remove all our forces?â€� he continued. â€œRussia is not a country that withdraws or shies away from the challenge. On the contrary, we increased our military presence, we increased the number of our aircraft, we increased our anti-aircraft missiles, etc. Before that, the Turkish Air Force was flying over Syria. Well, I invite them to try flying over Syria now, because they will get a very serious response.â€�<br><br>Turkey appears to have already been avoiding Syrian airspace since the incident. Turkish media have reported that the countryâ€™s warplanes have stopped taking part in a U.S.-led campaign of air strikes against IS out of concern that Russian or Syrian forces would try to shoot down a Turkish jet in retaliation for the downing of the Su-24. (Russian jets, unlike planes from the U.S.-led coalition, are flying over Syria at the invitation of the government.)<br><br>Mr. Putin made plain that he was personally offended by the way the Turkish government handled the Su-24 incident. He said that if it had been an accident, he would have expected a phone call from Turkish leadership explaining what had happened. Instead, he noted, Ankara called immediately for an emergency meeting of the NATO military alliance.<br><br>The Russian presidentâ€™s fury was such that he descended toward the obscene while discussing relations with Turkey. At one point, he speculated that Turkey may have shot down the Russian jet at the behest of the United States, perhaps in exchange for the United States turning a blind eye to a recent Turkish military deployment in northern Iraq. â€œMaybe someone in the Turkish leadership decided to lick the Americans in a particular place,â€� Mr. Putin said to applause.<br><br><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/putin-dares-turkey-to-test-russias-air-defences-in-syria/article27799731/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/putin-dares-turkey-to-test-russias-air-defences-in-syria/article27799731/</a></div>

              [Egypt] - Grandfather rapes 2 yr old granddaughter, then mother kills 2 yr old granddaughter for disgracing the family honour by allowing herself to be raped<br><br>(Source : see updated links below)<br><br>Update : a Singaporean Muslim (and ex-MOE teacher) wrote in response to the above post in another forum, "<i>Arab culture, nothing to do with Islam. This is what happens when people mix race and religion. No one knows where Arab stops and Islam starts.</i>"<br><br>True, that. Humans, regardless of race or religion, are capable of every evil possible. A quote from the TV drama Criminal Minds :<br><br>Joseph Conrad said, â€œ<b>The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary. Men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.â€� </b><br><br>
                              Another Singaporean Muslim then wrote, "<i>Beware from where you read it from. It come from a forum that spread the hatred towards Islam. It's forum like this that manipulate news and poison people mind and thus spread hatred among mankind.</i>"
                                          <br><br>True, but I'd expect Singaporeans to have the common sense to know this isn't about Islam (and Singaporean Muslims), but about the atrocious nature of the crime. It just so happens that the source webpage (quoted in a post from another Singapore forum) that reported this criminal act happens to be a hate website.<br><br>I just googled this, here are some other sites that made mention of this factual criminal case :<br><br><a href="http://www.emirates247.com/crime/world/man-rapes-grand-daughter-mom-kills-her-2015-12-10-1.613537">http://www.emirates247.com/crime/world/man-rapes-grand-daughter-mom-kills-her-2015-12-10-1.613537</a>
