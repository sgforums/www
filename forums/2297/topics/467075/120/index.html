But if you must have a vacation away from home, staycations are a curious compromise, with significant pros &amp; cons to be considered.<p>"The whole idea of a staycation is to check into accommodation thatâ€™s more luxurious than your own home. No Singaporean in their right mind would book into a backpackersâ€™ hostel unless they were living with their parents and had a big fall-out.

Moreover her inheritance is about 20 billion USD less than the inheritances that her two brothers got from Old Fart. She blames "Buy High Sell Low" for it. Chief Natural Aristocrat is Old Fart's favorite son. As the former is the sitting prime minister and very busy with running the affairs of Sinkieland, Old Fart entrusted his daughter-in-law with his vast wealth and appointed her executor of his multi-billion US dollar estate.<p>Thick Face Black Heart posted : I don't think that money was even a key reason. LWL has always been fiercely independent and takes after her father in many ways. I suspect her brother's lack of sincerity in honouring Old Man's wishes and his selfish use of the LKY name for his own gain is the more impt factor here. For elite kids like them, their political privilege is so enormous that money actually becomes secondary. Once you have been brought up in that cocoon of privilege, a hundred million dollars here or there doesn't really matter to you.</p><p>GoldenDragon posted : Agree. $ means nothing to LWL. She has no family. May be different if she has a lover boy! Too bad I am 60 now. If younger, I will tackle her. </p></div>

              Among the ethical dilemmas involved in using torture, is that among those tortured, some are actually innocent, but will inevitably break under torture to give a fake confession of guilt, in a desperate bid to stop the suffering from torture.<p>Mexican Authorities Torture Suspected Female Cartel Member :<br><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/04/14/woman-brutally-interrogated-as-she-gasps-for-air/">http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/04/14/woman-brutally-interrogated-as-she-gasps-for-air/</a></p><p>Mark (who lived in Mexico for many years) posted : "<i>I wouldn't be surprised if the woman is innocent and they're forcing a confession to cover up their bosses' involvement.

              <p>Hi I would like to ask something about Senior Chem Olympiad (for JC1) and whether I should take it</p>
              <p>So recently, i somehow got selected by my school for SChO training, altho im like not very good, just a decent chem student and the ppl who got selected are all quite beast in their studies, like half of them are china scholars.</p>
              <p>So i went for my first session and apparently for the olympiad, the whole syllabus for A level chem needs to be covered as well as some other university chem modules, which is pretty scary given that the trainer only has now until end of Nov to finish it. And my school also not very good at chem olympiads, for last years olympiad 3 silver, 3 bronze, 1 merit</p>
              <p>So right now im not very sure if i should continue as i need to dedicate 2h per week for training and perhaps even more to complete the homework/readings that the external trainer gives. And im not very sure if it helps with my A levels Chem or is it too far fetched. Im afraid it would affect my time for studies and other stuff as in JC i find myself always havng v little time.</p>
              <p>So any advice on whether to go for it would be appreciated!</p>
