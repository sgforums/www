              <p>In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore in Class Wuhua2 (Class 2 majored in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Physical Chemistry" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Physical_Chemistry"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Physical Chemistry</span></span></a>) at <a title="Tsinghua University" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Tsinghua_University"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Tsinghua University</span></span></a> in Beijing. Classmates described her as attractive, intelligent, and talented, with an interest in music. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain, along with extensive hair loss. Following her hospitalization at TongRen Hospital, her condition gradually improved and she was allowed to return to school. The following March, however, her old symptoms returned worse than before, this time accompanied by pain in her legs, loss of muscular eye control, and partial facial paralysis. Unable to breathe on her own, she was placed on a respirator.</p>
              <p>One physician at <a title="Peking Union Medical College Hospital" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Peking_Union_Medical_College_Hospital"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Peking Union Medical College Hospital</span></span></a> (PUMCH), Dr. Li Shun-wei, reported having diagnosed a similar poisoning case in the 1960s and strongly suspected that Zhu Ling's symptoms were caused by thallium poisoning. However, Zhu Ling denied that she had had any contact with thallium in class, a claim which was confirmed by her university's chemistry department. As a result, her doctors ruled out thallium poisoning as a potential cause. Instead, she was diagnosed with and treated for <a title="Guillain–Barré syndrome" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Guillain–Barré syndrome</span></span></a>. Her condition deteriorated rapidly.</p>
              <h2><span id="Diagnosis_via_Internet" class="mw-headline">Diagnosis via Internet</span></h2>
              <p>Frustrated with local physicians' inability to help Zhu Ling, her friends Cai Quanqing and Bei Zhicheng, undergraduate students in Peking University, posted an "SOS" letter on a number of Internet usenet groups on April 10, 1995, describing their friend's symptoms and asking for help with a diagnosis.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> It was remarkable that by 1995 only a few research institutes in China had Internet connections, including Cai's advisor. Responses began pouring in within a matter of hours, and news reports hailed the event as a milestone in remote diagnosis by Internet, especially in China. Of the more than 1,500 responses which Zhu Ling's friends received, roughly one-third proposed that she was suffering from <a title="Thallium poisoning" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Thallium_poisoning"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">thallium poisoning</span></span></a>, the common antidote for which is known as <a title="Prussian blue" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Prussian_blue"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Prussian blue</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Subsequent tests confirmed that Zhu Ling had extraordinarily high levels of <a title="Thallium" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Thallium"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">thallium</span></span></a> in her body, about 10,000 times more than normal people.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> Doctors were able to administer the antidote, <a title="Prussian blue" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Prussian_blue"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Prussian blue</span></span></a> in time to save her life, but she sustained serious permanent neurological damage.

              <h2><span id="Police_investigation" class="mw-headline">Police investigation</span></h2>
              <p>The police began investigating the case in May 1995. It was not until January 2006 that police finally revealed to the media that their initial investigations had yielded a possible suspect. No explanation was given for the delay in releasing this information, and no one has yet been formally charged in connection with the case. The primary investigator, Li Shusen, told a correspondent from <em><a class="new" title="Southern People Weekly (page does not exist)" href="http://sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Southern_People_Weekly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Southern People Weekly</span></span></a></em> in a January 2006 phone interview that investigators have in fact reached some important conclusions regarding the case, but that the information is too sensitive to be released to the public at this time.</p>
              <h2><span id="Suspect" class="mw-headline">Suspect</span></h2>
              <p>The main suspect after police investigation is Sun Wei (å­™ç»´) (born <span style="display: none;">(<span class="bday">1973-08-20</span>)</span>August 20, 1973), who was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said Sun Wei was the only student who would have had official access to thallium compound among the students with close relationship to Zhu Ling, according to Zhu Ling's lawyer, Zhang Jie.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> The investigation result of the case was refused by authorities to be released to Zhu Ling's parents after their appealing.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-5"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> However, Tsinghua University denied to issue Sun Wei's <a title="Bachelor of Science" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">B.S.</span></span></a> certificate and refused to provide her document needed to get a passport or visa in 1997. It is believed Sun Wei has changed her name to Sun Shiyan (å­™é‡Šé¢œ).</p>
              <p>The case began to draw extensive public attention near the end of 2005, after an ID named "skyoneline" posted on one of the largest Chinese online bulletin boards, <a title="Tianya Club" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Tianya_Club"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Tianya Club</span></span></a>, again questioning the innocence of the suspect and her family's role in blocking investigation and prosecution of the case.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup> In response, after over ten years of silence, on December 30, 2005, the main suspect Sun Wei released a statement proclaiming her innocence, which was confirmed by a weekly newspaper, Qingnian Zhoumo after interviewing Sun Wei's father in 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-8"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>According to the statement, the suspect was identified as the only student with official access to thallium in her experiment for undergraduate research. She was detained by the police department on April 2, 1997, and signed a paper acknowledging she was a suspect. Sun Wei's family retrieved her from the police after eight hours of interrogation. In her statement, she also claimed that, according to the law, she was cleared as a suspect in August 1998. However, in a <em><a class="new" title="Morning News Post (page does not exist)" href="http://sgforums.com/w/index.php?title=Morning_News_Post&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Morning News Post</span></span></a></em> report dated March 2006, Zhu Ling’s lawyer, Zhang Jie said of the suspect, "She was only exempted from the compulsory measure that she was subjected to as a suspect at that time, but not excluded from suspicion."</p>
              <p>Internet discussion of the crime continues since then and became hot topic on major online Chinese communities frequently as a high-profile unsolved case.

              <p>Widespread awareness by the Chinese public and cynicism regarding the matter and the alleged whitewashing of it pose public relations problems for the government of China. Information regarding the matter is too widespread to suppress, but, at the same time, evidence adequate to establish the guilt or innocence of the primary suspect is probably unavailable. Thus the matter serves as a vehicle for expression of public dissatisfaction with corruption and abuse of power by the political elite associated with the regime.<sup id="cite_ref-NYT51013_15-0" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/#cite_note-NYT51013-15"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>STOMPer Mother of 2 says this man spewed insults at her after she sounded her horn to warn him that he was reversing into her.</p>
              <p>She also says that he was spewing insults at her during the exchange.</p>
              <p>She relates the incident:</p>
              <p><strong>"Yesterday morning (May 17) at 10.45am whilst dropping off my kids at Tanglin Post Office, this driver quickly reversed his car out of the parking lot in the direction of my car.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"As a natural reaction I sounded the horn briefly to avert an accident.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"The driver continued to reverse his car and then stopped and wound down his window to shout curses at me.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"There were too many to mention but suffice to say, I was taken aback.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"I then wound down my window and told the man, 'I sounded my horn because I was afraid you would hit me' and in return I was once again greeted with a litany of curses from the man.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"He then put his car purposely into reverse gear again to intimidate me.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"He then got down from his car to confront me. I was by then deeply afraid for my life and used my phone to snap photos of this big burly man.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"The man then whipped out his own phone while still spewing obscenities at me and took photos of my car and walked up to my window and pointed the camera at my face and snapped a photo in retaliation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"Throughout this time, he threw insults at me and behaved in a highly aggressive manner which left me scared and shaken.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>"I was literally shaking in fear thorough out this incident."</strong></p>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p><em>Apparently (although it might possibly be a trolling impersonator), the 'bully' got wind of the posting of his photo, and gave his side of the story :</em></p>
              <p>KangaRude posted :</p>
              <p><strong>Sadly the story isn't quite as interesting as portrayed. As the ang mo in the pics, some facts to add balance:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>* I engaged with the driver of the vehicle after they sounded the horn as a premature warning (I could see them clearly while reversing)and gesticulated to me, whereupon I opened my window to hear what was being said</strong></p>
              <p><strong>* The angry tone from the driver gave me the impression they believed I had hit their car. I was unable to hear them clearly, so exited my vehicle to take a photo of their front bumper as evidence that there was no collision</strong></p>
              <p><strong>* after returning to my vehicle I was required to reverse my car a few feet to allow a truck that was parked across the exit (you can see it at the front left of my vehicle in the photos)to move to allow me to go forward. I waved to the driver to indicate I'd be reversing and did so leaving adequate distance between the vehicles.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>* at this stage the driver of the vehicle behind again expressed their "concerns" verbally and I, unfortunately, advised in clear terms that they were out of line and I'd appreciate their silence from this point on. I believe the abbreviation STFU is clear enough.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What was a simple misunderstanding was escalated due to what I said and for that I'm sorry. Be aware that I'll be much more calm and forgiving in any future traffic discussions.</strong></p>

              <p>Hi Gilbert,<br><br>I found your website earlier on. I know you are not able <br>to help, but anyway I’ll just write to you, hoping it will release some of my <br>tensions.<br><br>Probably, I can start with what’s worrying me these few <br>years. <br><br>I feel that my life is very miserable since I got married in 2004 – we always <br>had issues with money. When we just got married, my husband and I have a low <br>combined income – about $2.3k thereabout and we really struggled with our <br>expenses.<br><br>Now, he has a better job with doubled income compared to the time when we <br>just got married. I also have a new fulltime job but I couldn’t bring home my <br>full pay because I have many unpaid and medical leave due to my medical <br>condition.<br><br>Things are not going well even though our combined income is now more than <br>what we used to earn. The money we earned is never enough to pay for all our <br>bills and the accured debts just keep on piling up.<br><br>In 2006, my job was <br>at stake. I was very stressed with both my personal life and job. Soon after, I <br>started to be absent from work regularly – more from failing to deal with my <br>depression than anything else.<br><br>I have regular attacks of headaches, migraines, sleepless nights, became hot <br>tempered and very sensitive.<br><br>I have once overdosed myself with sleeping pills. My husband was quick to <br>realise that I have taken an abnormal dosage of my sleeping pills and brought <br>me to the hospital.<br><br>The police came to my ward and questioned me. I keep denying that I have <br>suicidal thoughts.<br><br>I told them that I had a bad headache and I just couldn’t sleep.<br><br>The officers then took my statements and warned me not to repeat my <br>intentions again (I knew they wont be taken in).<br><br>My parents soon came to know about the suicidal incident and they offered <br>to help me and my husband after I explained to them out financial problem.<br><br>They then used their savings to lend us $10k to settle our debts and any <br>outstanding bills.<br><br>However, things are still not good right now.<br><br><strong>I feel that we have more debts than ever – like history is repeating <br>itself</strong>.<br><br>It’s even worst now – I have to pay my parents monthly for the loan they <br>lend us, plus the loan they lent us when we got married and that is about $16k <br>for our house renovation.<br><br>Since my husband’s income has met the eligible requirement for bank loan and <br>credit card, we apply for those credit facilities - in the hope to clear our <br>outstanding bills and debts.<br><br><strong>I feel that my life is all wasted on this money issue. I’m feeling so tired <br>with my life right now…is there no light at the end of the tunnel for me?</strong><br><br>Though I have a job. I seldom take back the full pay of about $1.3k monthly <br>because I have many unpaid and medical leaves.<br><br>My regular unpaid leave also make my employer and colleagues have negative <br>impression of me. <br><br>I have frequent headaches and fall ill too often.<br><br>I still have sleepless nights even if I take medication to help my insomia <br>- that is part of the reason why I am always absent from work.<br><br>I am <br>still not blessed with a child - this is also part of my worry. <br><br>Since 2010, my husband and I have went to KKH to seek for fertility <br>treatment. <br><br>After all the tests, we were both declared medically normal. <br><br>I was on some hormone medicine to help me conceive, but still no baby – not <br>being able to conceive is an added stress for me. I feel so abnormal.<br><br>I <br>really dont know how to lead my life now.<br><br>I’m really feeling lost, even with my hubby around. I just dont know where to <br>begin with and how.<br><br><strong>The truth is, I harboured thoughts of suicide whenever I’m lonely.</strong><br><br>I know that my husband is very stressed with our current situation and he is <br>a lot stronger than i am.<br><br>I<strong> rather disappear from the lives of my loves ones, especially my <br>parents.</strong><br><br><strong>As of today, our bills are really piling up again – the power supply company <br>has given us termination letter, intending to cut off our supply in a week’s <br>time if we still don’t pay up our outstanding bills.</strong><br><br>I called them to ask if I can extend the payment and whether we can just <br>pay partially.<br><br>They say that they can only extend 5 more days and we will need to at least <br>settle half of the outstanding bill.<br><br>The banks have also given their final reminders, telling us to pay all the <br>outstanding amount or they will terminate our account which will result in <br>having to settle the full amount.<br><br>Every month is hell for me. I can never find a way to settle these <br>issues.<br><br>Thank you for listening.<br><br>This is the first time I share my problems and worries with a stranger.<br><br>I’m not sure if there will be anyone who will be reading this but thanks <br>anyway.<br><br>Regds,<br><br>Polly<br></p>

              <p>As soon as Aliki Chrysochou, a Greek Cypriot soprano in London, stepped onto the stage at the auditions for this season’s Britain’s Got Talent, a popular TV talent show in the United Kingdom, the judges (especially the well-known music mogul Simon Cowell) were impressed.</p>
              <p>The sexy soprano music teacher was welcomed with wolf-whistles and cheers as she walked on stage and sent temperatures soaring, reports The Sun. She impressed everyone with a rendition of Evanescence’s Bring Me To Life.</p>
              <p>Cowell told Aliki she had “natural talent”, adding: “I don’t want you to go.”</p>
              <p>Already impressed by her talent, Aliki stunned the audience when she told them how singing became her lifeline after battling back from the deadly brain bug encephalitis.</p>
              <p>“I am blessed that I’m here today,” she said. “A few years ago I was diagnosed with encephalitis. Everything I learnt when I was a baby was all gone - all co-ordination and my speech. I couldn’t speak, read, write or walk. My mother had to do everything - feed me and bathe me. She was my voice when I couldn’t speak.</p>
              <p>“When I was at the hospital one night she started singing to me. It was the first time I responded - by humming - after a very long time,” she added. “Singing was the only thing I could do after I recovered. I can’t believe I’m here.”</p>
              <p>“There’s something very moving,” said Cowell. “Having heard your story, everyone wanted you to do well... This is the easiest ‘yes’ I’ve given.”</p>
              <p>Amanda Holden, also a judge, said: “I can’t imagine what your mom must be thinking. The words were so poignant - the song was for your mom.”</p>
              <p>Born in the town of Limassol, Cyprus, Aliki was dubbed a child prodigy. A significant turning point in her life was marked when she was signed on two consecutive commercial releases with one of the most important classical composers in Cyprus, Achilleas Lympourides, and Kostas Montis.</p>
              <p>In 2005, she graduated from Sheffield University in the United Kingdom with a Bachelor of Music, majoring in both piano and voice. She also holds a Pianoforte Certificate in Advanced Performance from London College of Music &amp; Media at Thames Valley University.</p>
              <p>In 2008, she moved to New York to study drama and opera. She’s now back in London pursuing a music career.</p>

              <div id="page0" style="display: block;">
              <div>
              <p><span>Home-grown director Anthony Chen’s first feature film, Ilo Ilo, starring veteran actor Chen Tianwen, premiered to a 15-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival on Sunday night (May 19).</span><br><br><span>Ilo Ilo, which also stars actress Yeo Yann Yann, is about a Singapore family and its newly-arrived Filipino maid, played by Angeli Bayani, in the midst of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</span><br><br>According to a My Paper article, the 29-year-old film-maker, who is in Cannes, <span>said the standing ovation was surreal.</span><br><br>T<span>he 800-strong audience stayed on despite some technical glitches, which caused the film to stop screening thrice. They even joined in to sing a birthday song when the film stopped midway in a birthday-celebration scene.</span><br><br><span>“I was still recovering from the trauma of the technical glitches, but it soon became clear to us that the audience really loved the film. There were tears in their eyes, it spoke to them," he said.</span><br><br><span>“Despite being set in a country foreign to them, they felt that (the film) was universal and could relate to it."</span><br><br><span>Chen said the film, which was conceptualised three years ago, had its difficulties.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br><span>One of the obstacles was casting its lead child actor. Chen spent 10 months casting and auditioned 2,000 children from 21 schools. He finally settled on 12-year-old Koh Jia Ler.</span><br><br><span>As the story is set in the 1990s, another difficulty was looking for filming locations in Singapore.</span><br><br><span>“A big part of the design of the film (such as the colours, the costumes, the hair, the props) was from my memory, my memory of growing up in the 1990s, so I wanted very much to recreate something that felt honest and authentic. I pushed the team very hard,” said Chen.</span><br><br><span>Ilo Ilo is in the running for the Camera d’Or prize, or best first feature film, which will be announced next Sunday.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br><span>Chen is no stranger to Cannes. He is the first home-grown director to win the Special Mention award in 2007 for his short film Ah Ma, which was also nominated for the Palme d’Or for Short Film.</span><br><br><span>The local release date for Ilo Ilo has not been confirmed.</span></p>

              <p>The most closely watched criminal court case in Singapore. Even if (all or some) of the 6 accused are sentenced to imprisonment, the length of the imprisonment terms meted out will be a big headache for the Singapore judiciary and government.</p>
              <p>To be blunt, it's a case of <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/static/multimedia/gallery/120701_firstservice/images/pic10.jpg">willing buyer - willing seller</a>. If the real issue is that of 'charitable status' and its taxation ramifications, the most helpful course of action would be to revoke said status from the church.</p>
              <p>Evolved consciousnesses have no need for religion (which is routinely abused as an excuse for crusades, wars, and religious motivated violence around the world continuing to this very day). But for those humans who still require it as a scaffolding crutch, and particularly where is clearly a case of <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/static/multimedia/gallery/120701_firstservice/images/pic10.jpg">willing buyer - willing seller</a>, governmental legalistic intervention (possibly motivated, at least in part, by socio-political reasons; not excluding inter-church rivalries and fragmentation within the disunited Christian community) may inadvertently result in more unforseen socio-political difficulties than it purports to resolve.</p>
