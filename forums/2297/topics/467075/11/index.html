Rasyid, the education office head in South Sumatra’s Prabumulih district, said the district budget for 2014 was set to implement the proposal because ‘‘every woman has the right to virginity’’, and that ‘‘we expect students not to commit negative acts’’.<br><br>The test — to be conducted on female students who are typically 15 or 16 and entering the post-compulsory phase of education — would involve examining their hymen to see if they are intact. Boys will neither be physically tested nor asked if they are virgins.<br><br>The proposal is like others that periodically arise from officials in Muslim-majority Indonesia, which is modernising fast, to the discomfort of some. They are usually quickly shouted down by civil society and rarely come to fruition.<br><br>In March 2012, the religious affairs minister proposed a ban on mini-skirts, saying it was an anti-pornography move; in December, Islamic parties proposed a nationwide ban on alcohol. Neither has been implemented. However, in the district of Lhokseumawe in Aceh, where Islamic law prevails, women have been banned from riding side-saddle on motorcycles because it made ‘‘curves of a woman’s body’’ more visible.<br><br>Female virginity at marriage is prized in socially conservative Indonesia, and a member of the Islamic Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), Hasrul Azwar, supported the virginity test in Prabumulih, saying it was ‘‘a disgrace for a student to lose her virginity before getting married’’.<br><br>However, the education minister in Jakarta, the members of the local school district, local politicians, the Women’s Crisis Centre and the Islamic advisory council in the area have all opposed the plan.<br>Masruchah, the deputy head of government organisation the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) said virginity was ‘‘a personal issue’’ and the education office had no right to try to control it.<br><br>‘‘Morality cannot be determined by genitals,’’ she said.<br><br>Indonesian Education Minister Mohammad Nuh said the idea was ‘‘neither wise nor judicious’’, and would not prevent teen sex.<br><br>‘‘If there was proof [that it could prevent it] of course we would issue a circular to that effect. But they must find another way, a wiser way, to address the issue of teen sex,’’ he said.<br><br>‘‘Whatever policy they implement, it should not hamper a student’s access to education,’’ said ministry spokesman Ibnu Hamad.<br><br>However, in Indonesia, which has radically decentralised power, leaving great influence in the hands of local officials, the central department has limited influence over district education offices.<br><span style="font-family: inherit;">with agencies</span></span></span></blockquote></div>

              <div>A full-time national serviceman who knifed four women in a span of nine months in the northern part of Singapore in 2010, killing one of them, was convicted in the High Court on Tuesday.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Soh Wee Kian, 23, pleaded guilty to one count of culpable homicide for killing mother of two Hoe Hong Lin, 32, in Woodlands, as well as one count of causing grievous hurt with a weapon for stabbing Ms How Poh Ling, 28, in Sembawang.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The court heard that Soh would wander around HDB blocks, with a glove and a knife in his pockets, looking for women with long hair and wearing short skirts.
              <p>He would follow them and fantasise about stabbing them in the back and touching their breasts and kissing them, reports The Straits Times/</p>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Soh originally faced a murder charge for Madam Hoe's killing but escaped the gallows after his lawyers made written representations to the prosecution to reduce the charge to culpable homicide.
              <p>He is expected to be sentenced on Thursday and faces either life imprisonment and caning, or up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning.</p>
              <p>Two other charges, for slashing Ms Ooi Li Li and Ms Lam Hui Lin, will be taken into consideration during sentencing</p>

Or do I go on and tell them how the festival actually stopped when the American women started dancing, so that we looked around to see a circle of men filming our every move?</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>"Do I tell them about bargaining at the bazaar for beautiful saris costing a few dollars a piece, and not mention the men who stood watching us, who would push by us, clawing at our breasts and groins?</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>"When people compliment me on my Indian sandals, do I talk about the man who stalked me for 45 minutes after I purchased them, until I yelled in his face in a busy crowd?"</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Later, she writes: "For three months I lived this way, in a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell. I was stalked, groped, masturbated at; and yet I had adventures beyond my imagination. I hoped that my nightmare would end at the tarmac, but that was just the beginning."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>A university spokesman confirmed Cross is a student at the school and would not comment on her mental leave. He said the school is committed to students' safety at home and abroad.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Cross said she didn't say anything to the professors on the trip until things reached "a boiling point" -- what she called two rape attempts in 48 hours.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://travel.cnn.com/female-solo-travel-india-218191"><br></a></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Dipesh Chakrabarty, a University of Chicago professor who was in India for the first three weeks of the session, told CNN that he was unaware of Cross' situation. He noted, though, that the university tries to prepare students for what they might encounter while abroad. The Civilizations Abroad in India program was based in the city of Pune, but the students traveled to other areas during the semester.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>"Both faculty and staff in Chicago and our local Indian staff counsel students before and during the trip about precautions they need to take in a place like India," Chakrabarty said in an e-mail. "Ensuring student safety and well-being is the top priority of both the College and staff and faculty associated with the program."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>The university provided this statement to CNN:</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nothing is more important to us at the University of Chicago than caring for the safety and well-being of our students, here in Chicago and wherever they go around the world in the course of their studies. The University offers extensive support and advice to students before, during and after their trips abroad, and we are constantly assessing and updating that preparation in light of events and our students' experiences. We also place extremely high value on the knowledge our students seek by traveling and studying other civilizations and cultures, and we are committed to ensuring they can do so in safety while enriching their intellectual lives."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her story sparked a wave of reaction online, with scores of Indians responding, many with sympathy to her plight and pointing out that Indian women also experience high levels of harassment and abuse.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Arvind Rao, a media professional in Mumbai, was moved to post this comment on her story: "It thoroughly disgusts me to be known as an Indian male ... An apology is extremely meager for all the trauma you've gone through." He expressed hope that politicians would "wake up and implement stricter laws against crime and sexual harassment on women."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br></span></span><span style="color: #0000cd;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Every time my girlfriend goes out alone, I pray that she comes back home safely," wrote a commenter using the name Jajabar. "Being an Indian male, I apologize."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Others, however, observed that sexual harassment was by no means confined to India, and Indian commenter Sam1967 warned against condemning his home country when so many others failed to protect the women living within their borders.<br></span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I accept what happened was definitely an embarrassment and a cause of trauma for her that might haunt her for the rest of her life. But this has happened in many other countries or places and therefore it may not be the right thing to single out India."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/04/world/asia/irpt-new-delhi-gang-rape-ireport-reaction"><br></a></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Another woman who said she was on the same University of Chicago sponsored trip to India, <a href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1023426"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">posted a response</span></a> on CNN iReport calling on people to resist stereotyping Indian men and recognize that sexual assault happens all over the world.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>The student, Katherine Stewart, said she dealt with her own share of harassment on the trip, but "in my experiences in India, I have met a solid handful of warm and honest Indian men -- men who are also college students, men who also love the thrill of riding on a motorcycle in the busy streets, men who defended me at necessary times, and men who took the time to get to know me and my culture. And that should not at all be surprising."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Stewart said she believed Cross "had every right to tell her story" and in no way wanted to lessen the significance of her experience. But Stewart, who is black, cautioned that "when we do not make the distinction that only some men of a population commit a crime, we develop a stereotype for an entire population. And when we develop a negative stereotype for a population, what arises? Racism."</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>One thing is certain: Cross sparked a huge discussion with a story that she thought no one wanted to hear. She said she is thankful for her experiences in India, and wants to see more international exposure about what women travelers and residents endure.</span></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>"Truth is a gift, a burden, and a responsibility. And I mean to share it," she writes. "This is the story you don't want to hear when you ask me about India. But this is the story you need."</span></span><br><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br><br>CNN's Sarah Brown contributed to this story.</span></span> </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Dear The Real Singapore,<br><br>My husband recently downloaded a new iPhone app called WeChat. It allows you to chat with strangers and I suspect him of using it to talk to strangers. I read from a forum that WeChat is a popular place for China students studying in Singapore to sell their body for money. Whenever I tried to take a look at his phone he will act very aggressively and snatch it back from me. Once, I caught him talking to a girl called Anna who types in mandarin, I suspect she is a PRC girl student working illegally in Singapore. Now, he even set a new password on his iPhone and I am unable to access his phone anymore. When i ask him what is the reason for setting a new password he will shout back at me saying "Why you so busybody!". Am I too paranoid?<br><br>We are a newly wed couple in our late 20s and he goes clubbing with his work and army friends all the time. I am afraid of him picking up random China girls on WeChat for sex. Sometimes he come home drunk and one day I even found a pack of condoms in his briefcase. We never had sex using condoms since he doesn't like it. I am not a very smart person and I graduated only from ITE and he is a university graduate from SIM. Sometimes I feel that the only reason we got married is because I got pregnant and gave birth to our baby. I hope to remain anonymous and I hope to read some of the advices given by your readers.<br><br><img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/2wdmypw.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br><img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/zlurkn.png" border="0" alt=""></p></div>

              <p>It appears the policemen were themselves afraid of getting hurt by the knife wielding perpetrator, and only watched from a safe distance as the teenage girl (who was working in the store) was stabbed to death.</p>
              <p>In fact, the 2 policemen took action to apprehend the perpetrator, only *after* the perpetrator (somehow) accidentally stabbed himself twice and fell to the ground.</p>

What this means is that the <br>person insured pays a higher premium when he is young and healthy. This sounds <br>good on the surface. But due to the fact that the Medishield Life is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forced scheme</span>, the question of ethics <br>and fair play, or rather should I say non-ethics and non-fair play, come into <br>the picture.<br><br><strong>What this article is about</strong> -<br><br>This article argues why it is highly not ethical to front load policies in <br>the Medishield Life. The main reason being that first and foremost, it is a <br>forced scheme. This being the case, any term that is imposed on the policyholder <br>if he finds unfavourable, cannot be rejected. Secondly, front loading means you <br>pay for the company’s cost upfront, and that too may be a loaded policy that may <br>not be favourable to you, which you can’t reject.<br><br><strong>The whys of front loading according to Dr Lam Pin Min</strong> -<br><br><a href="http://www.singapolitics.sg/supperclub/dr-lam-pin-min-%E2%80%9Cfront-load-healthcare-premiums-but%E2%80%9D"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Dr <br>Lam Pin Min: “Front-load healthcare premiums, but…”</span></span></a><br><br><br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br><em><strong>Q:</strong> There’s going to be public consultation for <br>MediShield Life. What are the challenges?</em><br><br>One is that of the affordability of the premium. How much increase is fair <br>and manageable for the majority of Singaporeans?<br><br>Secondly, how much coverage is necessary and sufficient? You can strengthen <br>MediShield to cover very expensive bills, but that will result in significantly <br>higher premiums. Like what PM mentioned in the Rally, Ministry of Health has <br>combed through all the cases, and those cases where patients incurred really big <br>bills and are unable to afford them, are far and few between.<br><br>If the increase is too excessive, low-income and elderly Singaporeans will <br>definitely find it difficult to manage.<br>One way is to seriously consider Dr <br>Amy Khor’s (Minister of State for Health &amp; Manpower) proposal to front-load <br>the premium.<br><br>However, we need to explain to Singaporeans the concept and rationale of <br>front-loading. Younger working Singaporeans can pay higher premiums so that when <br>they grow old and are retired, the premium quantum can be lowered to a more <br>manageable level. It’s like front-loading for your own policy in the future.<br><br>…snip<br><br><strong>Q:</strong> Risk pooling and front-loading only works if MediShield <br>Life has enough young and healthy people. With an ageing society and declining <br>fertility, fewer young people will support a fast growing number of elderly. <br>Will premiums have to go up by a lot later? Will the scheme be sustainable?<br><br>I see front-loading as a way of funding one’s healthcare needs for the <br>future. By paying higher premium when we are young, it allows the premium to be <br>lowered when we reach retirement age.<br>The challenge lies in the current <br>pioneer generation whose Medisave savings may be inadequate to pay for their <br>current MediShield premium. The Pioneer Generation Package comes in <br>handy.</div>
              <strong>Let us take a look at why front loading is unethical</strong> -<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>IMO, front loading is highly unethical. What it does is that it transfers the <br>risk of the company back to the policyholder. Hey, isn’t the purpose of <br>insurance for the company to take the risk from the policyholder in the first <br>place? Why then transfer the risk back to the policyholder right after agreeing <br>to take the policyholder’s risk?</strong></span><br><br>Below are my arguments to support my case:<br><br><strong>1. Insurer’s costs are highest at the start of the policy</strong> <br>-<br><br>For almost every insurance policy the company issues, the cost at the initial <br>stages is at its highest. That’s because besides all the admin and underwriting <br>procedures, the company also has to pay commissions to its agents. As time goes <br>by, when the premiums get paid over the years, the company will start to make <br>profits. The biggest risk is when the policyholder makes a claim after just a <br>few premium payments. Hence, it is an accepted fact and an industrial norm for <br>insurance companies to bear the high risk of any insurance policy at the initial <br>stages.<br><br>With the above in mind, front loading actually transfers the risk of the <br>insurer to the policyholder. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By <br>charging a higher premium earlier, the company reduces its own risk in the <br>inital stages substantially, and transfers that risk to the insured <br>instead</span>. This is the gist of front loading. All the crap talk that “it <br>would make it more affordable” as you grow old, is just talk to appease the <br>public. By hiding the whole truth on front loading, isn’t this unethical?</span><br><br><strong>2. No option to reject unfavourable terms</strong> -<br><br>On top of front loading, a person with pre-existing illnesses will be further <br>loaded with either a higher premium than an unloaded case, or have terms of <br>exclusion, or both. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>But what if the terms are unfavourable? The person has no <br>option to reject. Hence he is now double penalised through no fault of his own. <br>First, the loading on his premium due to his pre-existing illness, and secondly, <br>the front loading.</strong></span><br><br>It must be remembered that a person with a pre-existing illness runs a higher <br>risk of hospitalisation. That is why insurance companies load him in the first <br>place. Hence, high initial cost of the company is already taken into account <br>when his premium is loaded. With a further front loading, the company now <br>transfers even more risk from itself back to the customer.<br><br>As cited in #1 above, doesn’t this expose the non-ethics of front <br>loading?<br><br><strong>3. It is against the principle of risk transfer</strong> -<br><br>The purpose of any insurance policy is one of risk transfer. It transfers the <br>risk of the policyholder to the insurer. It doesn’t matter what insurance plan. <br>It could be life insurance, health, education, hospitalisation insurance. Even <br>motor or fire insurance. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The purpose is always to transfer the risk from <br>policyholder to insurer. This is the core essential practice of insurance.</strong></span><br><br>We have also seen that the highest risk and cost to the insurer is at the <br>initial stages after the policy is issued. To the company, the highest cost and <br>risk is when a claim is made just after one premium payment. In terms of <br>figures, the policyholder pays just one premium payment which is $x, while the <br>company is expected to make a payout of perhaps $1,000x or even $100,000x <br>dollars.<br><br>The above risk is part and parcel of the insurance industry. By front <br>loading, the company takes a shorter time to recover its costs, which means that <br>it is transferring part of its risk back to the insured. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>And because this is a <br>compulsory plan, you cannot reject this unfavourable term. So why must the <br>insured take part of the insurer’s risk when an insurance policy is supposed to <br>mean the insurer is the one who should taking the risk? Are you not <br>shortchanged?</strong></span><br><br>This is like paying for a 10-day travel insurance when you decide to fly to <br>another country. Then one of the terms of the policy is that this 10-day <br>insurance will not cover claims for flight related incidents on the first and <br>last two days of 10-day insurance plan. But they will double your claim for <br>flight related incidents on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th days. What <br>nonsense! Isn’t the risk of flight accidents highest during the first and last <br>two days of your holiday, when you need to make that flight? And the company now <br>wants to skirt that risk and place it in the lower risk time period?<br><br>The above is no different from the front loading plan where the high risk and <br>cost to the company (which is at the beginning of the Medishield Life policy), <br>is transferred to its low risk and cost period when you are already above 60, <br>after you have made so many premium payments. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So it transfers its high risk period back to <br>you and will make it up for you during its own low risk period</span>. Just like <br>the unethical insurance travel policy I cited.</strong></span><br><br>The diff between my hypothetical travel insurance and Medishield Life is that <br>the latter is for real and forced upon you.<br><br><strong>4. What if after front loading, you still can’t pay when you are in <br>your 60s and beyond?</strong><br><br>I am surprised to note that the PAPpy guys can’t see the front load scheme is <br>a harbinger for a potential future disaster. W<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>hat if after making front load <br>payments for many years, you turn 60 and your funds are now dry? Will you be <br>penalised and your hospital bills be left unpaid? In the insurance industry, <br>that is standard practice.</strong></span><br><br>So after you have paid all these years and after you have taken the high risk <br>for the company at the early stages, you are left in this difficult position. <br>What now? In other words, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>while you have been bearing the risk at the early <br>stages and relieved the company of their high costs, you are now further at risk <br>of missing the payouts when you need it most.</strong></span><br><br>Have the PAP guys who have been promoting the front load scheme thought about <br>this?<br><br><strong>Wrapping up and conclusion</strong> -<br><br>The front loading is nothing but transferring part of the risk back to the <br>insured. This is unethical because the principle of any insurance policy is <br>first and foremost, the transfer of risk from the insured to the insurer. By <br>front loading, the insured is shortchanged. This is made worse since the <br>Medishield Life is compulsory and there is no way anyone can reject the <br>unfavourable terms.<br><br>Many insurance policies even out the risk by “smoothening” the payments, <br>hence, you get to pay the same amount in premiums from the start to the end of <br>the insurance term. Front loading works against this principle too.<br><br>In the end, I feel that Dr Amy Khor and Dr Lim Pin Min are only whitewashing <br>the unethical practice of front loading. They are selling to the masses so that <br>hopefully, Singaporeans will find it easier to accept this scheme. In reality, <br>you are cheated front, back, right, left and centre.<br><br>The insurance companies now are truly laughing all the way to the bank. And <br>they’re laughing at Sinkies too, now that they are able to transfer their high <br>risk and costs back to the people!<br><br>The front loading scheme is schemed to skim your money while you are still <br>young and have the ability to pay. The PAP and the insurance companies know that <br>when you are old, you may not be able to pay anymore. But that doesn’t matter. <br>They would have already skimmed and milked you dry by then.<br><br>Wasn’t it said that the front loading scheme is to benefit the companies and <br>not the people?<br><br><br><br><strong>Barrie<br></strong><br><br><em>* The writer blogs at </em><a href="http://wherebearsroamfree.blogspot.com/"><em></em> </a><a href="http://wherebearsroamfree.blogspot.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://wherebearsroamfree.blogspot.com</span></span></a></blockquote></div>
