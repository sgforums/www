That's true, one defining and respectable characteristic of being an Ah Being is having balls (ie. courage), and (unlike almost everyone else in society) refusing to self-defeatedly accept societal dogma and standards to be imposed on yourself.<br><br>For instance, when an Ang Moh foreigner bullies a local, cuts queue, etc, almost all Singaporean males (even after NS) dare not stand up to the Ang Moh bully, it's invariably the Ah Beng who eventually does so, with hokkien vulgarities and threats of violence, and only then the Ang Moh bully backs off. The Shenton Way and Marina Bay suits and ties, aren't half the men the Ah Bengs are.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DC Comics really needs all of their recent TV productions to succeed just to stay within sight of Marvel (who not only dominate the comics movie industry, but TV as well). The industry leader will always enjoy a near insurmountable advantage, just as the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer. But between DC's The Flash, The Arrow and SuperGirl, it's clear who gets my vote. It'll be nice if Top Cow could join Marvel and DC in movies and TV as well.<br><br><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/cbe7Fzze4uvcwzKnDfE6AibuyMR.jpg"><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1cMcKqrNTus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1cMcKqrNTus</a></div>
