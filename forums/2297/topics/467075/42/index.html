              See how damaging religion is to the soul? God (in the first place all religions wrongly define God, but keeping this label, it's safe to say that God) very much prefers that you (ie. everyone) be a self-responsible, free thinking and genuine individual, instead of blindly handing over your free will to the foolish (and often downright harmful, unethical and anticosmoethical) dogma and doctrine of (any!) religion, which corrupts the soul and severely limits the personal evolution of the soul (which is the very reason for physical incarnation and reincarnation). Remember that after this life is over, you'll realize from the two main questions that will be asked of you (ie. everyone, during the so-called Life Review that takes place after death) along the lines of "In this life just over, what have you learnt? and whom have you helped?", and therefore that it totally didn't matter what religion you had (actually it does matter insofar as you would have been a lot better off without any religion), the only thing that matters is how you've lived your life, and what was within your heart.<br><br>

              Don't have sex with beautiful young women, Ministry of Defence (UK) warns senior officials before postings to Russia and China.
              <br><br>
              Top military officials have been warned not to have sex with attractive women in Russia or China in case they are spies, it has been reported.
              <br><br>
              A leaked document says agents of the FSB, Russia's intelligence service and successor to the Soviet-era KGB, could attempt to lure British officials into bed and then blackmail them.
              <br><br>
              The document, the Ministry of Defence Manual of Security, warns senior officers that the FSB, could gain valuable intelligence by exploiting 'knowledge of marital infidelity or sexual activity the target may wish to hide'.
              <br><br>
              The KGB used 'honey traps' like this extensively during the Cold War, using both men and women to target those they believed to have valuable information.

              With this controversy going on with AC Unity, I thought "What if Aveline appeared in Unity?" It makes sense because not only is she part French with a French accent, but also, Ubisoft said they can't wait to show off some of the strong female leads (yes, leads, as in plural form (possibly including Charlotte Corday)) in the game.
              <br><br>
              According to the AC Wiki, it says Aveline was born in 1747 and the French Revolution was from 1789 to 1799, which means she could appear between age 42-52 and still be able to fight with and/or lead the French Assassin branch.
              <br><br>
              Now Arno was born in 1768, which would make him 21-31 during the whole French Revolution.
              <br><br>
              So now you're thinking "What do Aveline and Arno have in common?" They both have a French father. I know, lots of people had French fathers, but bear with me.
              <br><br>
              Aveline's father is Philippe Olivier de Grandpre. Philippe traveled to Louisiana at a young age to establish a trading enterprise between the old world to the new world and eventually became a wealthy and successful French merchant. 
              <br><br>
              As for Arno, we don't know who his biological father is and what kind of relationship they had or how often they saw each other, but we do know that his father died when Arno was 8. We also know that he had an adoptive father who also died mysteriously. 
              <br><br>
              Now, it wasn't mentioned as far as I know, but it can be assumed that Philippe would have to travel to France every once in a while for business. While he was in France (specifically in 1767 or 1768), he could have fooled around with a woman and had an oopsie-baby with her. He didn't want anyone to know what he was up to and most likely paid her loads of money to stay quiet. He would then return to Louisiana as if nothing happened. 
              <br><br>
              Now as a refresher, Arno was born in 1768 and his biological father died when he was 8. That would mean that he died in 1776. And do you know who also happened to die in 1776? Philippe Olivier de Grandpre, Aveline's father, at the hands of Madeleine de L'Isle. Word would have gone back all the way to France that a successful businessman conducting business in the area had passed away. At that time, Arno's mother tells him about his real biological father Philippe and that his other father is really an adoptive father, who's last name could be Dorian (since it's a Greek last name and Arno's real father is French).
              <br><br>
              With all of that said, I can conclude that Aveline and Arno are possibly half siblings sharing the same biological father. And if that's the case, then that means that Arno is an ancestor of Subject 1 (like Aveline) and not Desmond, which is probably why AC Unity isn't a numbered title.

              To be released in January 2015. I particularly appreciate the night-mode (in which gameplay alters dramatically from day-mode, in contrast to almost all other games where night is merely cosmetic).

              It may look entertaining, but the risk of getting an eye poked out by the spear, ain't worth it, making such performances frankly unethical. I much prefer they perform unarmed (which is more realistic; how often does one walk around in public with a spear in hand?)
