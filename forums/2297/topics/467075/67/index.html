            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting exchange between Alfian Saat and a couple of others (both pro and anti-LGBT Muslims) :<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/alfiansaat/posts/10152821942262371">https://www.facebook.com/alfiansaat/posts/10152821942262371</a><br><br>Ahmad Anis : Wow...so much effort given for someone who doesn't really care about #wearwhite or WAAPD. Do as you please Alfian. But don't expect the other camp to stay on e bench when e pinkdot camp is pushing their agenda aggressively.<br><br>Alfian Sa'at : I don't care about the coloring campaign that wear white does. But I do care when they or WAAPD get out of line and start engaging in harassment. But what is this 'agenda' that you're referring to, actually? I've mentioned that different people have different reasons for being there--to feel a sense of belonging and community, to provide visibility and voice for LGBT's, to give support to one another. I'd really like to know...? Do you think the people there are insisting on rewriting the Bible and the Quran? Do you think they're advocating for gay marriage? Do you think they're trying to interfere with your religious freedom?<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Alfian - u asked "what is this agenda that you are referring to actually?" U have already answered your own qn. Look at what u posted a while back. Nobody could care less abt the people busking in the sun enjoying the company of like minded hippies. But we care abt the GAY POLITICAL EXTREMIST within your ranks who are beating their drums. They set the pace, they set the direction and they set the tune. Realize it or not but those uninformed/misinformed bunch present at the PD event are dancing to the tunes these political extremist are playing on their flute. I have done my research and i know what games u gays are playing. "Freedom to love" is the first propaganda for the next phase.. U know it. But u wouldnt admit it... Yet.<br><br>Alfian Sa'at : Yes, I mentioned 'politics' but in that whole post I only talk about 'visibility politics' (where LGBT's secure the means to represent themselves without any distortion from other media--or from sites like WAAPD) and also 'respectability politics' (where LGBT's show that who they are is not so different from the rest of society). I don't see what is so 'extremist' about this. The problem is many of those in WAAPD believe that there is some scary agenda at work that will somehow disenfranchise straight people in the future--I see dire warnings that children will be taught about the mechanics of gay sex in schools, or that religious teachings will have to be reformed. There's a nightmare scenario apparently which, as you mention, is supposed to happen in phases--as if giving LGBT's more rights will take away the rights of those who are not. But equal rights is not a zero sum game. Decriminalising LGBT's doesn't mean that suddenly non-LGBT's will be criminalised, for example. And honestly speaking, I really don't know what the 'next phase' is supposed to be. Gay marriage? But I know that people are divided over this--I'm not a supporter of gay marriage myself. Adoption by gay couples? There are gays who don't want to have children. Definitely there are political battles being fought in many other countries but I don't think it's fair to assume that there are proxy versions of those battles happening in Singapore, ignoring very specific local circumstances.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Its good that u r against gay marriage. But u see thats not up to u. Its up to those Political few who wanna arm wrestle the Government to appeal to their desires. The Phases is real. U of all people who claimed to be "learned" must have come across articles on this. It cant be ignored. When they have support from the general masses, then its time to petition and to vote. And im sure u will join in the petition somehow. Perhaps due to pressure or due to sympathy? US embassy showed their support to Pinkdot. Why? Why didnt Russian Embassy or China Embassy or whatnots congratulate pinkdot? It is clear they have a hand to play in it n hence the interest to congratulate. They aspire to fly the LGBT flag on our Parliament building.. Just like how they fly the same flag proudly on Israel Parliament building. (A major contradiction since Torah forbids homosexuality). Just like Human rights, Women Rights, and soon Gay Rights.. Its run by the Zionist Proxy. Tun Dr Mahathir Mohd mentioned it once b4 during his famous speech. All these "rights" are in place to subdue the majority and to make them bow to their wills.. And persecuting them will make us look in the wrong. But Lo n Behold.. Its actually a diaguise to spread their filth.<br><br>Alfian Sa'at : Alamak. Once Zionist Conspiracies start coming in then sorry lah brother it's not something I believe in. All I know is that Pink Dot was started in 2009 by Singaporeans without any foreign funding or intervention. You should know by now that the government is extremely wary of any civil society events that have foreign backing because it's considered 'interfering in domestic affairs'. Only in recent years have they managed to get some support from MNC's which have LGBT-friendly policies. But I know many of these MNC's do it for personal gain rather than to agitate for societal reform--it's their way of advertising to prospective employees that they have LGBT-friendly workplaces and that their HR departments do not discriminate against LGBT's.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Of course its a zionist conspiracy. Who owns Goldman Sach? Its one of your Main FOREIGN sponsor. U cant hide this fact. Btw how much did they give? Im just curious. If your main sponsor is Poh Heng, or kedai Emas Golden Chance or POSB.. Then ur claim is substantial. But seems like these corporate giants have links with a Jewish entity. Im sorry but u have to be smarter than this to realise u r just the pawn in their big chess game.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Speaking abt discrimination: again another false claim. No one in Singapore had been denied jobs/education or even Military service because of their sexual orientation. No one got hurt physically, no one got abused, no one got denied of food or service because of homosexuality. Its a baseless claim that these LGBT keep trumpetting as though its real. But keep repeating the lies and soon u will believe ur own lies. Delusional at its best. Even LHL admit that the LGBT community here had been given ample space and enjoy the freedom n security here. Gays should not ask for more than what they can eat on their plate.<br><br>Dmitri Slovenski : Conspiracy theorists calling other people delusional. Sorry lah your argument langgar pagar after you brought up zionist conspiracy theorists. Men's rights = Islam/Christian values. Minority rights = Zionism. You are trying to frame it in an A vs B perspective so we need to choose a side and of course Malays will never choose zionism. Well, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna continue to fight for minority rights and not support zionism. I think most of us here are not a fan of Israel but nah we're not gonna start supporting Israel just because they support Pink Dot. They may have their agendas, we have ours. Ours is not zionism.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : <a href="http://davidduke.com/jewish-supremacists-homosexuality-and-divide-and-conquer/">http://davidduke.com/jewish-supremacists-homosexuality-and-divide-and-conquer/</a><br><br>Dmitri Slovenski : Err no conspiracy theories have no basis in rational arguments. I didn't read. I saw the site and immediately saw bias. Anyway, I woke up from just now already. Night shift lah because my company wants me to miss my prayers because of their Zionist conspiracy.<br><br>Alfian Sa'at : Ummm do you know who David Duke is? He's a former Klu Klux Klan member and a convicted felon and known for far right antisemitic conspiracy theories. Here's something for you and also the members of WAAPD: please check the credibility of your sources before getting all worked up. If you have a deep suspicion of CNN or BBC even Al Jazeera will do. Seriously please for the sake of rational discourse make it a habit to get information from reputable news sources or academic peer-reviewed journals. Seriously bro, David Duke???<br><br>Dmitri Slovenski : Later they say the peer review journals are controlled by the Zionist conspiracy jugak. Every logical argument is a Zionist conspiracy.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Yawnz.. Is that ur best response? By NOT reading what he presented just because it is David Duke? Oh u got to do better than that. I see u cannot refute what he brought forth. Character assasination does make ur job look easier doesnt it? So u dont have to do the dirty work of countering every point he brought across.. Typical~<br><br>Dmitri Slovenski : Yes it does make our job easier! I mean we have to filter out the lunatics and the Illuminati nut jobs.<br><br><i>Editor's comment : At this point, Abdul Rahman and Dmitri Slovenski engage each other in several posts in Malay, which I didn't reproduce here.</i><br><br>Abdul Rahman : Hahaha! Screenshot!<br><br>Dmitri Slovenski : Yesss screenshot and bring it to WAAPD because no one here will applaud for you.<br><br>Abdul Rahman : Done~ n thanks for ur approval. U will be famous soon.<br><br></div>
