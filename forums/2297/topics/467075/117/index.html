                              All great men are polymaths. To be precise, everyone can be a polymath (ie. great in the sense you maximize your potential) as long as you/he/she allows this. Being a polymath doesn't mean you know everything (that would be Wikipedia). Being a polymath means you allow yourself to explore, and give it your best efforts, in as many subjects, fields and domains as would interest you. <p>Of course, modern society (in which the average poor man, not the rich elite, spend most of his time slaving at work to pay bills) doesn't naturally encourage self-exploration in multiple fields, so it's up to yourself to want to do so.
                              </p><p>On a related note, if anyone reading this ever feels deeply conflicted by personal or religious issues, and would like advice or counseling from a spiritual (including supernatural*) but non-religious, non-dogmatic, non-judgmental, point of view or perspective, you may PM me.
                              </p><p>*Actually everything is natural (including matters that most people would deem supernatural), it's only a matter of whether humanity and science on this planet has sufficiently evolved to be able to understand it or not.</p>

              Caitlin is a beautiful, strong, highly evolved soul who volunteered for this short physical incarnation for the benefit of her parents and everyone else who was/is touched by her life. Rest assured she left her body fully aware and conscious (ie. not a traumatic death, where the consciousness can become psychotic post-mortem temporarily), and she's readjusting well and healing well in the afterlife or spirit world or intermissive period now. She'll continue to watch over and guide her parents, and it is likely she'll incarnate into their lives again in the future, either in this lifetime or a future one.

            <div class='col-md body'>On another forum, PAPsmear-er posted :<p>When i was in the SAF, I was arrowed to attend a SOF (Special Operations Force) recruitment session. I don't know why, I never showed any interest in it and I was not in the Commandoes. My problem with the SOF at that time, was the dual role they had. One role was as a SAF pathfinder advance force, ala SEAL unit. i.e. to scout enemy beaches, prep them for amphibious assault and what not. This was their military role. Then they had a second role which was hostage rescue, eg plane hijacking, etc. This was a civilian role. My personal belief is that its already a full time job just to train for one role, I cannot believe that SOF are so talented they can train for both roles. eg The FBI Hostage Rescue Team does not go to Iraq for operations, and the SEAL team does not assault planes, trains or buildings to rescue hostages. Each role is dedicated to a different unit except in the case of the SOF. That tells me they cannot be trained to the extend they should be. But we will never know until some serious incidents happen and see how they perform. What really lost it for me was the talk about money. They were bragging about how much a corporal makes in the SOF and how some of them drove fancy cars. I was not interested in joining this sort of a unit where the personnel are motivated by money. Terrorists don't do it for money. Neither should anti terror teams. In the end, at the last minute, your comrade in arms might decide no amount of money is worth being shot by terrorists, or might betray you for money, and the last thing you want is a team member with a lack of conviction and loyalty. Anyway all this was long time ago, the unit for sure has changed since then.  </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let this be clear to everyone : Singaporean Muslims are Singaporean Muslims, they are not Saudi Arabian Wahabi Sunni Muslims, they are not Iranian Shiite Muslims, and they are not ISIS "kill-all-other-Muslims" Muslims. All the killing going on in the Islamic world (vast majority of which are Muslims killing other Muslims) is really more about Middle-Eastern geopolitics than about Religion, with every Islamic country and militant group claiming to be, or to represent, the one true correct interpretation of Islam. It's actually not about Religion, don't be fooled.<p>Even Palestine vs Israel, isn't really about Religion anymore (it just so happens both sides of a conflict happen to be from different religions, and so some people try to exploit this and say it's about religion, when it's actually not), it's about how millions of people from both sides (Palestine vs Israel) each feel unjustly victimized by the "terrorists" from the other side (including the Israeli Jews), due to acts of violence and oppression perpetrated by an angry minority on each side, consequently entire populations from each side strongly feel their side to be the unjust victims and that the other side is the "bad guy" (but life is never black and white), and because the conflict and violence having gone on for countless generations, so it becomes a tremendously difficult situation to resolve.</p><p>Singaporean Muslims are not, and do not wish to be, involved in any of this. Some in Malaysia, such as Mahathir and the Sultan of Johor, have spoken out against the corrupting influence of Arabic Islamic culture eroding away Malaysian Islamic culture, and the dangers of wrongly bringing the Middle-Eastern conflict into Malaysia. The same holds true for Singapore. Singaporean Muslims coexist harmoniously with, and without discrimination from, all other Singaporeans, May the rest of the world one day be like Singapore.</p><p><a href="http://redwiretimes.com/singapore-in-brief/madrasah-schoolgirls-attacked-other-madrasah-students-labelled-as-terrorists/">http://redwiretimes.com/singapore-in-brief/madrasah-schoolgirls-attacked-other-madrasah-students-labelled-as-terrorists/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/law-minister-asks-police/2658118.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/law-minister-asks-police/2658118.html</a></p></div>

              Yet another reason that Singaporeans are so fortunate (but often under-appreciated by Singaporeans), is that Singaporeans really do have the best food in the world (by virtue of sheer variety, being a prosperous nexus of Asia and the entire world), at extremely affordable prices for almost all Singaporeans (ie. all the best food are at affordable hawker centers &amp; kopitiams, not the atas restaurants themselves struggling to pay rent to greedy landlords &amp; REITS).<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yMAzDutWD8611.irjE6hTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/homerun/sethlui/fc96957b37ab70610282defd8a3de690"></p><p><a href="https://sg.style.yahoo.com/post/142042274758/16-food-stalls-at-dover-ghim-moh-to-eat-at">https://sg.style.yahoo.com/post/142042274758/16-food-stalls-at-dover-ghim-moh-to-eat-at</a></p><p>Mark Wiens : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology/videos</a>
