              <br><br>
              
              Last night, and even today morning at around 11am, reportors gathered at my doorstep, wanting some exclusive interviews and some photos.
              <br><br>
              I told them to fuck off.
              <br><br>
              But then after awhile, I started to contemplate, is this reallyâ€¦. The right approach in dealing with the mass media? And then I realizedâ€¦ noâ€¦ it isnâ€™t. It really isnâ€™t.
              <br><br>
              
              And I have to admit, though you all might be tabloid creating cuntsâ€¦.. you are diligent, and I have to sayâ€¦ I admire that. <br><br>
               So you know whatâ€¦ Fine.. Fuck it! I concede to your requests, fuck what Roy Ngerng says, you are the mainstream media, you have the responsibility towards the general public to provide news, you deserve information, and regardless of the risk that you guys will misquote me, you deserve the truth.
              <br><br>
              Therefore, today I have arranged a little meeting with a fellow visual artist I managed to converse with on Facebook, a humble fellow by the name of Dick Ow. And am to meet him at his residence in Pasir Panjang, at 7pm. I am heading to his house to collaborate with him on a few videos, would possibly have a sleepover.
              <br><br>
              I currently just finished my lunch at Brownice and am heading to Red Hill to run a few video game errands, so Iâ€™ll reach Pasir Panjang Mrt at around sayâ€¦ 3-4pm?
              <br><br>
              And if all you catch me as I go out of the Pasir Panjang MRT station, weâ€™ll collaborate and find a little miscellaneous area, where we can all gather together, and Iâ€™ll clear the air and answer everyone of your queries: What happened in Prison, what my future plans are to fuck with the Government, Iâ€™ll even reveal that little tidbit of information on how my ex-bailor, Vincent Law, molested me.
              <br><br>
              I am reeling in excitement for our meeting, my fellow mass-media friends, I hope to see you there.

                  <br><br>
                  Vincent Law should note that this latest post by Amos Yee, as much as it infuriates Vincent (as deliberately intended by Amos), nonetheless does indeed explicitly clarify and confirm that Vincent Law did *not* physically sexually molest Amos Yee. Be that as it may, because Vincent isn't and won't be getting the formal and public apology he's demanding from Amos, he may likely proceed with further legal action against Amos Yee.</i><br><br>
                  
                  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amos-Yee/286808914699053">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Amos-Yee/286808914699053</a><br>
                      <br>
                      Yeah I lied, againÂ… I wasnÂ’t really going to tender an apology to Vincent. SeriouslyÂ… Â‘praise JesusÂ’? Â‘Our holy christÂ’? Haha, got you guys again, we arenÂ’t getting smarter as a species arenÂ’t we?<br>
                      <br>
                      So now you see why I needed about 3 days? The context of this post works better if he hasnÂ’t started suing me yet, and you do need some time to write more than 6000 words about Vincent, an allegation of molest is pretty challenging to validate. Though I did finish a little faster than expected. <br>
                      <br>
                      So here you go my friends, the wonderful tale, of the molestation of Vincent Law. Enjoy!<br>

                      <a href="https://amosyee.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/the-molestation-of-vincent-law/">https://amosyee.wordpress.com/2015/0...f-vincent-law/</a><br>
                      <br>
                      <b>The Molestation Of Vincent Law</b><br>
                      <br>
                      I should issue a sincere apology to Vincent Law? Hahahahaha.<br>
                      <br>
                      It once again is alarmingly indicative of the inherent stupidity of our species to immediately formulate a stance, with a complete lack of evidence, and say it with such conviction. That is of course the mindset inherent in that of religion. IÂ’m still really skeptical of my Christian fans by the way, youÂ’re supposed to damn me (Mark 3:29) yet you hold me a vigil.<br>
                      <br>
                      Now the preconceived notion portrayed on the media towards Vincent is simply that he put himself in the line of fire, he assisted me by putting up $20000, and allowed a rebellious 17-year-old boy to be able to come out of prison, and attain his freedom. He is a generous, kind-hearted Christian, caring and with lots of love.<br>
                       So now, when I made allegations that he molested me, people would then start blaming me. This person helped you Amos, he risked his reputation and his own money for you, and yet you accuse him of molestation.<br>
                       So now, let me reveal the inherent fallacy in even attempting to make a definitive claim towards my allegation, the fact that nobody but me(At least until you finish reading this blog post), knows what Vincent did, during the one-and-a-half weeks that he was my bailer.<br>
                      <br>
                      The media that my fans so boldly criticized when I was maligned, and now you fall prey to it, just because itÂ’s not TheStraitsTimes thatÂ’s doing it anymore, but TheOnlineCitizen. This is what happens when you decide to make your decisions based on biasness and sticking to your side, instead of actual logic, even Roy Ngerng seems to be guilty of that, saying Â‘oh my gosh, itÂ’s going to be so hard for us to advocate for you, now that youÂ’ve humiliated VincentÂ’.<br>
                      <br>
                      So let me tell you, if my fanbase consists of hypocrites, then despite your support I wouldnÂ’t want it. When things looks bad, and you threaten to remove the support you once had for me. Then fine, good riddance. If thatÂ’s the kind of support I receive, one thatÂ’s so easily withdrawn, then believe me, I do not wish to acquire your quote unquote Â‘supportÂ’.<br>
                      <br>
                      Anyways, IÂ’m sure all of you are reeling in excitement, so letÂ’s get to Vincent.<br>
                      <br>
                      As you guys know, IÂ’ve experienced a lot over the past couple of months, I got charged, I was sent to jail, I got assaulted in the face. However, I would make the claim, that having Vincent Law as a bailer, is personally, to me, the most unnerving aspect of this whole experience.<br>
                      <br>
                      And although Vincent didnÂ’t sodomize me physically, he did violate me emotionally, and I am going to reveal how he did that, right now.<br>
                      <br>
                      Part 1: The incidents that lead to the series of unfortunate events<br>
                      <br>
                      First, I shall answer the question: Who the fuck is Vincent Law? And how the fuck did he manage to become my bailer?<br>
                      <br>
                      Well more than 3 days after I was sent to Changi Prison, nobody came up to my parents to offer to be my bailers or assist in finding bailers. I do not blame any of you because the only way you can contact my parents is via their phone number, which obviously majority of the people donÂ’t have, and as of now, they still do not have active Facebook accounts.<br>
                      <br>
                      However, about 2 days before the court date, a lad by the name of Jonovan, whom my mom and I had met in a little activist get-together, came along and said that there were 3 people who were willing to be my bailers, and he would pick the best one to do so.<br>
                      <br>
                      A day before the court, my mother was then introduced to Vincent, and Jonovan said that this was the person who was going to be my bailer, and my mother accepted it. My mother completely trusted Jonovan and did not bother to meet up the other people who offered to be bailers or question the criteria of JonovanÂ’s choice.<br>
                       In view of the bail officer, my mother, stupidly trusting JonovanÂ’s choice, consented. And my father, without even meeting Vincent at all until that moment, being the blur dumb fuck that he is, simply consented, not at all fearful that the bailer that he got for his son might be a raving lunatic. This is of course representative of him being the negligent parent, which is why he has offered close to no assistance to my mother in terms of parenting for the past 10 years, and is languishing alone in the house we have at Jurong.<br>
                       So my parents, and the bailing officer, whom did not attain my consent at all, allowed Vincent to be my bailer.<br>
                       Afterwards, I found out that there were an additional 4 people during the court day, some of whom I had known, and all of whom I would have definitely preferred to be my bailers, whom were willing to bail me. However, for a reason completely unknown to me, 2 of them didnÂ’t say anything, and the other 2 revealed their willingness to be my bailer only during the time when the bail was already being processed.<br>
                      <br>
                      After I was released at the bail center, I immediately had dinner with Jonovan and he shared with me the reason why he chose this stranger to be my bailer. He gave several reasons like the fact that he was mostly unknown, comparatively to other people, his reputation least likely to be stained if he were to be associated with me, he wasnÂ’t political, so people would not accuse me of collaborating political party to further their political goals (Which really isnÂ’t necessarily a bad thing).<br>
                      <br>
                      Basically, unlike me who would have played a little more creatively with the concept of the bailer-bailee relationship, Jonovan made thethe most boring choice,because he thought it was the most Â‘strategic.<br>
                       However, I think that the variable that Jonovan probably did not consider, which was the most important one, at least to me, was whether or not the bailer would be an asshole.<br>
                      <br>
                      Though maybe Jonovan did, and like so many others, maybe Vincent manipulated Jonovan into thinking that he would be the nicest bailer out of those 3 people, but seeing what Vincent did to me, I am extremely skeptical of that.<br>
                      <br>
                      Maybe in the near future, Jonovan might wish to clarify further the aspects he considered when he his decision. But currently, as of now, I feel compelled to say, fuck you Jonovan.<br>
                      <br>
                      ItÂ’s a rare circumstance where there are several people who are willing to be bailers, and unfortunately there was no distinct avenue for bailer auditions.<br>
                      <br>
                      So in a moment of miscommunication, ignorance and confusion, what I ended up with as a bailer, was Vincent Law.<br>
                      <br>
                      Part 2: The Molestation<br>
                      <br>
                      Once I went out of the bail center, I saw my family, Vincent and some other friends, and the first thing that Vincent said to me was:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘Hello, I am Vincent your bailer. I think the first thing you should know about me is that IÂ’m a ChristianÂ’<br>
                      And I responded with a resounding Â‘Oh fuck..Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      And he replied: Â‘Yes, so deal with it!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      He then said that he had something on in the evening, and would meet me tomorrow before I went to see the lawyers, which I agreed on.<br>
                      <br>
                      The initial gut feeling was that Vincent was an absolute fucking asshole, but I was never a person to judge someone based on first impressions, theyÂ’re never fully accurate (Though in this case it was). And yeah he was a Christian, but I could work around that, why not? Not all religious people are vicious cunts, all my good friends from Secondary School are Buddhist, so regardless of absolutely abhorring their religious views, I can still like and interact with them.<br>
                      <br>
                      The next day, we met up at a coffee shop and instituted the appropriate introductions and our first conversation. He asked about my background, my interests and my intentions in lieu of my charges which I readily provided to him.<br>
                      <br>
                      The first few minutes that I talked to him, he seemed like a relatively harmless person, serviceable, but bland, nothing particularly special about him, no truly interesting or provocative views or delivery, been there done that.<br>
                      <br>
                      But as we went along, Vincent then decided to discuss with about religion. And from there the meat-headed conservatism commonly upheld by fundamentalist Christians, soon emerged.<br>
                      <br>
                      He tried to explain why he practiced the fate, the supposed tenants of Christianity, what the advocates of Jesus are. And his points, like every theist who tries to validate their religion, was absolutely baseless and horrible.<br>
                      <br>
                      So I responded with the usual Atheist arguments of thereÂ’s absolutely no evidence at all that Jesus existed, the false sense of hope created by religion impedes one to more effectively solve personal problems and thus impedes the betterment of oneself, Christianity is responsible for several generations of violence and still is responsible for causing turmoil and fear to adherents alike, you know the common, simple basic refutations of religion.<br>
                      <br>
                      Then he just sat there, face stern, chest upwards, with the air of a hot-headed bull, and then said to me:<br>
                      <br>
                      Oh well since IÂ’m a Christian,and you donÂ’t like religion, then I guess you donÂ’t like me, so maybe I should just discharge myself as your bailer!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      WowÂ…Â… What the fuck? That seemed a little uncalled for.. WhatÂ’s up with the threat?<br>
                      <br>
                      So I calmed him down and said itÂ’s all cool, just because someone disagrees with a personÂ’s views, doesnÂ’t mean that they think the person is bad, nor does it mean you have to hate him for it.<br>
                      <br>
                      So he became calm and cool and we continued a peaceful conversation, we met the lawyers, had lunch and then I left for home.<br>
                      <br>
                      But needless to say, I already did not like him.<br>
                      <br>
                      The next day, he did not contact me. However the following day, during the evening, he called my number and told me that the directors of Public Enemy invited me to their play, and Vincent wanted me to accept the invitation, he also requested a meet-up with me tomorrow after I had seen IO Jason chua. However, I wasnÂ’t in the mood, and declined the invitation.<br>
                      <br>
                      You know, because IÂ’m an introverted teenager and I wanted some time alone for myself, I wanted to write the 10 posts that I was going to use to breach the terms of the bail, I wanted to complete the 5th dungeon of BowserÂ’s Inside Story, and I wanted to catch up on season 5 of Game Of Thrones.<br>
                      <br>
                      So because of those reasons and also the fact that IÂ’d already started to dislike talking to him I expressed displeasure with wanting to meet with him the following day or attend the play, admittedly a little vehemently, and urged him to perhaps provide me a little space and postpone our meeting to a date where I was more enthusiastic in indulging in a social get-together.<br>
                      <br>
                      And ever since then, the shit fucking happened.<br>
                      <br>
                      He then shouted on the phone, Â‘How dare you refuse a meeting with your bailer! This is unacceptable! I have a responsibility as a bailer! I am going to discharge myself!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      Wow, wow what?! DonÂ’t discharge yourself. What the fuck?! Hi wow, itÂ’s not fucking funny, a person might have to go back to prison because of that!<br>
                      <br>
                      Â’24 hours! I gave you more than 24 hours! You should be thankful! I have responsibilities as a bailer!Â’<br>
                      So I offered some conciliatory words and said Â‘ok ok fineÂ’ IÂ’ll meet you, and to further placate him and ensure he didnÂ’t discharge himself, I also said I would attend the play (Yeah, I never wanted to go to the play, it was in a state of fear which is why I ended up going, sorry Alfian)<br>
                      <br>
                      And just from that simple refusal of one request, that I eventually acceded to, he said:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘Initially I had intended to give you your space and only meet up once a week. But now, seeing how you refused a simple meet-up with your bailer. I now want to meet you, every dayÂ’<br>
                      <br>
                      And ever since then, he demanded, without fail, for me to meet up with him, every day.<br>
                      <br>
                      For 9 days, I had to go from Bishan, , all the way to City Hall, Orchard or his house at Clementi, to meet up with him for 2-3 hours. There was no important issue to discuss about, any information I needed to provide to him in lieu of the lawyers or my court case, he just demanded to meet up with him every day with absolutely no good reason whatsoever.<br>
                      <br>
                      A daily meeting with meeting with Vincent would go like this: We would sit and he would ask a question, and I would issue a really short response.Then there will be these really long pauses in between sentences as Vincent desperately tries to find another topic to ease the awkwardness, it was simply unbearable.<br>
                      <br>
                      And every day I would constantly say to him Â‘I do not like these meetings,can we please stop having so many meetings and just have them once a week? You know I donÂ’t like these meet-ups, so why do you keep on doing this?Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      And one day he replied, and believe me, I am not lieing, he said:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘I know that you do not like these meetings Amos. And I am doing this, because I like to piss you off.Â’<br>
                      ItÂ’s amazing how a sadist can manipulate others into thinking heÂ’s a kind and generous person, maybe thatÂ’s what he meant when he said when he was a follower of Jesus.<br>
                      <br>
                      I also asked:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘DonÂ’t you think it would be better if a relationship is 2-sided? DonÂ’t you feel like our conversation would be more productive and fulfilling it if I donÂ’t go in reluctantly.Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      And he replied:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘No no itÂ’s fine Amos, looking at your behavior now, I already like to see and talk to you Amos. You are exciting and fascinating to meÂ’<br>
                      <br>
                      WowÂ… I can see how he manages to turn his wife on in bed.<br>
                      <br>
                      On several occasions, he would initiate another theological debate and then when his argument was being torn down, he would threaten to discharge himself as my bailer.<br>
                      <br>
                      And whenever I expressed further displeasure and reluctance on meeting him every day, he would then, once again, threaten to discharge himself as my bailer.<br>
                      <br>
                      One time, my mother accompanied me to meet with Dodwell (My lawyer), to write my affidavit. After meeting the lawyer, Vincent with his continued insistence of his daily meetings, told me to see him in City Hall at 5:30pm. However, the meet-up with Dodwell stretched on for much longer than we initially expected, and I definitely couldnÂ’t make it to City Hall on time.<br>
                      <br>
                      So my mother decided that since I couldnÂ’t make it on time, and since Dodwell wanted to me to further assist him on the preparation of the bail review, she would urge Vincent to cancel the meet-ups for a few days.<br>
                       She texted Vincent:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘Alfred needs Amos to do quite a lot of stuffs today n tmr. Can the meetings be cancelled till Thursday?Â’<br>
                      And he replied word for word, and I quote:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘HeÂ’s hiding behind your back. If you back hi nowÂ… IÂ’d defer to u. U decide.Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      How the hell am I hiding behind my motherÂ’s back? IÂ’m right beside her in the lawyerÂ’s office.<br>
                       And since then, my mother too was introduced to Vincent LawÂ’s insanity.<br>
                      <br>
                      One time because I accidentally forgot to charge my phone for the night, I went out with a power-less phone.<br>
                       My mother had followed me to meet with IO Jason Chua that morning, and apparently Vincent, who called me more than 7 times prior, contacted my mother expressing that heÂ’ll discharge himself, who then passed me her phone. And once again I was inflicted with VincentÂ’s incessant shouting:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘It is your responsibility Amos to charge your phone at night! It is your responsibility to be contactable at all times! I am your bailer and I need to be able to contact you!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      I said sorry, sorry, IÂ’ll immediately charge my phone once it gets back as he continued belching his lecture on responsibility.<br>
                      <br>
                      And from that one accident, he demanded that I had to call him every morning at 8am, I expressed displeasure and reluctance in doing so however he said that if I didnÂ’t, he would discharge himself as my bailer(Yeah it was really that repetitive).<br>
                      <br>
                      Another instance, Vincent even started whining to me in a shrieking voice and said, Â‘You know how many hate messages I have gotten once I became your bailer! You know how many people have criticized me on Facebook? You better appreciate what IÂ’m doing for you!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      Buddy, youÂ’re the one who went up and said you wanted to be my bailer, now that itÂ’s not going favorably for you ,thatÂ’s your fucking problem not mine, IÂ’m not going to be sympathetic to any of your whining. And I do not appreciate a fucking thing that you did, no matter how much you want it. Appreciation is earned, not demanded.<br>
                      <br>
                      And another day at his house, he told me:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘Hi I just watched the video you made last time. The Â‘My lost loveÂ’ one. I think it would be really great if you and I could get together with that girl you had a crush on, and then perhaps I can interview her.Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      And by this point I was just rendered speechless.<br>
                      <br>
                      Keep in mind, this is a youth counsellor, this is a person is that is said to have an understanding of youths. People who possess this quality of understanding, is allowed to attain a certification in Singapore, to become counsellors and psychiatrists. So now you see the reason why I did not continue my sessions at IMH.<br>
                      <br>
                      Furthermore, Vincent imposed the rule, that I am never allowed to take pictures with anyone while he was my bailer<br>
                      <br>
                      Now seeing the wide gamut of said bail condition (Not to post, upload, or otherwise distribute any comment or content, whether directly or indirectly, to any social media or online service or website, while the current case is ongoing) , if someone took photos with me, I technically would have breached the bail condition. But I never got caught for that, just like I never got caught when I liked Facebook posts.<br>
                      <br>
                      If anyone ever requested to take a picture with me, I had always obliged, they get to post it on Instagram, it possibly makes their day, and I feel happy.<br>
                      <br>
                      If something was against the rules but it was harmless, and I enjoyed it and I never got caught, I and everyone else would continue doing it. ItÂ’s kind of like the law against piracy. ItÂ’s there, but we all still use torrent.<br>
                      <br>
                      So whenever Vincent wasnÂ’t around, I still took pictures with fans when they wanted it. But whenever he was, my goshÂ…<br>
                      <br>
                      Some fellow background actors after their performance in Public Enemy (Which was by the way absolutely horrible) wanted to take a couple of pictures with me. Then I said yeah sure, itÂ’s all good fun.<br>
                      <br>
                      However Vincent disagreed, and then started to make this huge scene just outside the entrance, and there were several witnesses, Roy Ngerng was there. Vincent stood at the center, incessantly pointing his index finger at my face and proclaiming Â‘ItÂ’s your responsibility Amos! ItÂ’s your responsibility if you take pictures with other people! I donÂ’t want you to break the terms of the bail! I have responsibilities as a bailer!Â’<br>
                      And I just stood there flabbergasted and embarrassed, trying to placate him, just wishing that he would stop.<br>
                       And because those background actors were non-questioning, conformist amateurs, the type who blindly follows everything that they are told (Which probably explains the quality of their performance), they nodded subserviently to Vincent and were like:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘ Oh yeah yeah yeah.. we donÂ’t want to give trouble to all of you, we donÂ’t want to give trouble to anyoneÂ’<br>
                      Seeing how angry and riled up Vincent gets whenever somebody wishes to take a picture of me, I kind of have this really weird vibe, and I hope it doesnÂ’t seem overt to say this, but it seems as though heÂ’s jealous that I am getting attention. Well I am the guy who went to prison for an internet video, so I think some people would be interested.<br>
                      <br>
                      Come on Vincent, you no gotta be jealous, the one that has fame isnÂ’t necessarily better, if you want fame and attention so much then go make your own viral video dude, donÂ’t vent all your frustrations on me.<br>
                      <br>
                      The turmoil of meeting Vincent Law daily, was excruciating, it felt as though IÂ’m stuck with this mentally unsound person, obligated to act as one of those central aspects of his life to make him feel less lonely.<br>
                       However, as the days went by, I became more accustomed to the scenario, and thought of a way, to perhaps use the circumstance to my advantage.<br>
                      <br>
                      I knew that I was obligated to meet him every day, and I couldnÂ’t escape it. So instead of being all namby-pamby pussy, acting all vulnerable and weak, why not I turn the tables around, and let me be the bad guy, and instead of him fucking me, I fuck him.<br>
                      <br>
                      What frightens a mental psychotic, is another mental psychotic. I had to become more insane than Vincent. He knew that I did not like meeting him. So I turned it around, and made his meetings with me as painful for him as possible.<br>
                      <br>
                      He wanted to talk to me, so I did. I constantly criticized him, insulted his career choice, and continued to engage in theological debates with him, and blatantly revealed the falsehood and bullshit of every one of his supposedly Christian tenants.<br>
                      <br>
                      The aspect of the bible that we argued the most about was the infamous bear story, where God chose to summon a bear to maul a group of boys after they made fun of a bald priest.<br>
                      <br>
                      The verse was from 2 Kings 2:23: Â‘some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. Â“Get out of here, baldy!Â” they said. Â“Get out of here, baldy!Â” 24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boysÂ’<br>
                      I of course said that this was quite evident that God was a mass murderer. And he refuted that claim, and IÂ’m not even joking, it really is that stupid, and it really provided me further insight to the extent of just how delusional a religious person can be, and he said:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘the verse says that some boys came out of the town. But then in the end they said that 42 boys were mauled by a bear. Since before they only said some boys, there could have been more than 42 boys initially. There could have been 100, there could have been 200, therefore once some of the boys saw the bear, they might have ran away, they might have took. Therefore since it is so vague, this verse is open to interpretation, therefore it can be argued that God did not actually summon those bears and killed those children for making fun of that bald priest, therefore he is not a mass-murderer!Â’<br>
                      <br>
                      WowÂ….WowÂ…Â…. JustÂ…. WowÂ…Â…..<br>
                      <br>
                      I had to push my limits and frequently curb my anger at witnessing how someone can be inane to such an extent, not revealing at all that I felt vulnerable, and continued to remain measured and refute him with logic. Every time I would leave the meetings with a sore throat. I continued to talk to him, and talk to him good because I knew I had turned the tables around, he was the vulnerable one, not me, and now I am the one that is fucking with him.<br>
                      <br>
                      And whenever he threatened to discharge himself again (I counted 9 times), I would disingenuously pacify him and be all like:<br>
                      <br>
                      Â‘Dude, itÂ’s all cool man, chill man, peace dudeÂ’ (I started to talk like a hippy)<br>
                      <br>
                      I would manipulate him into thinking that we are experiencing hostility between us, but this is the process that will lead us into forging an everlasting friendship. And being the sociopathic dumbass that he was, he actually bought it.<br>
                      <br>
                      He was convinced to such an extent, that just for a short moment, Vincent might even have thought that he was forging a genuine relationship, that I had reciprocated (Hah!). He felt so comfortable with me, that he even revealed a little vulnerable side of him, about the neglect that he had with his father when he was a child.<br>
                       However, that still did not at all curb the absolute anger and turmoil that I had to face while engaging in 9 days of conversation with him, and also doesnÂ’t discount the fact that while he was sharing his little melancholic story about how he would always look out the window at night to see if his father had reached home, I really did not give a fuck.<br>
                      <br>
                      And by that time, just one day before the court, I had finished writing, I was going to breach the terms of the bail.<br>
                      <br>
                      Part 3: Beyond the valley of VincentÂ’s sodomy<br>
                      <br>
                      In the morning at around 4:30am, I breached the terms of the bail, posted 10 posts online, and from that, I was free. I did not have to follow any of VincentÂ’s rules anymore, I did not have to meet up with, I did not have to speak to him ever again, I was free.<br>
                      <br>
                      Why I didnÂ’t do it earlier and reduced the torment that I had to endure from Vincent? It was simply the fact that I wasnÂ’t finished yet. IO Jason Chua and molester Vincent really took up a lot of time during those days.<br>
                       Fucking enraged that I had broken the terms of the bail, and that he had been ineffectual bailer, when I was going to meet up with the lawyers just before court, Vincent would constantly call me, which I ignored, and spam messages on my phone like Â‘traitorÂ’, Â‘liarÂ’, Â‘you canÂ’t be trustedÂ’.<br>
                      <br>
                      Such biting words, I feel the guilt coursing through my veins.<br>
                      <br>
                      And during the PTC when I was outside of court, discussing with Dodwell whether or not to compromise to the demands of the prosecutor concerning the terms of my bail. Vincent, who laughably with the impression that I had still wanted to continue having him as a bailer, told me Â‘If I am to continue being your bailer, I am going to impose a new set of rules, and you have to follow themÂ’<br>
                      <br>
                      And since I had already broken the terms of the bail and did not have to suck up to him so that he would continue being my bailer, I obviously replied with a resounding Â‘fuck noÂ’.<br>
                      <br>
                      And after that, seeing how in front of the judge, he discharged himself with such immediacy, was just so revealing.<br>
                      <br>
                      Before I entered Changi Prison I told my mother and several of my activist buddies, that I absolutely hated Vincent and hope to not ever associate with him ever again in the future. And when I came out of Changi Prison, I found out that they did convey that message to him.<br>
                      <br>
                      However, he, not respecting my decisions at all, insisted on adamantly jutting himself into other peopleÂ’s personal life when nobody wanted him.<br>
                      <br>
                      He went to most of my court hearings when I was shackled, he was the first few people I saw the instance I went out of prison and came out of the bail center (Oh the horror).<br>
                      <br>
                      He even signed all the forms to visit me in Prison , though he couldnÂ’t visit me because it takes 2 weeks to process those forms and before that I was already out(Otherwise I would probably be the only person in Changi Prison history to refuse a face-to-face visit).<br>
                      <br>
                      And if any of you out there who had the opportunity to see me during the few times I was at court, handcuffed and chained, particularly during the bail review, you might have noticed that whenever I was unfortunate enough to slip into the horrid realms of VincentÂ’s eye contact, I would respond by flipping him the sanctimonious finger.<br>
                      <br>
                      So when I was in Changi Prison, I had already intended to publicly humiliate Vincent. The initial idea was to have a really large party celebrating my release, inviting as many activists, politicians and people as possible, and also invite Vincent too. And then afterwards I will give a speech which turns out to be a vicious admonishment and reveal of the torture that Vincent had inflicted on me. Vincent would then stand there mouth agape, if he in a moment of fury, leaped onto me and started punching me on the ground, that would have been ever better. Roy Ngerng will film that live footage, give the files to me and IÂ’ll post it on Youtube.<br>
                      <br>
                      However,when those reporters came to my doorstep and a little morning walk catalyzed the idea of issuing a spectacular troll to the mass media, I felt like I needed that extra spice that would be able to disrupt all the reporters in their work, and have them flooding to Pasir Panjang.<br>
                      <br>
                      And then it hit me, Vincent Law, youth counsellor molesting Amos Yee. I could achieve 2 goals at once. The amalgamation of those 2 aspects , humiliating Vincent law and trolling the media, was impeccable.<br>
                      <br>
                      Part 4: A discourse in lieu of child pedophilia<br>
                       In the presence of other people, as we met up with Roy Ngerng, VincentÂ’s friends and the creators of Public Enemy (Who were exceptionally nice people. They are horrible as artists, but pretty great as people) they would be fooled by Vincent and deem him as a kind-hearted bailer. He helped children and migrant workers, he treated everyone to food, and because I had to continue sucking up to him because otherwise he would threaten to discharge himself, I had to make him seem like he was the best bailer in the world, in front of everyone.<br>
                       And whenever Vincent wasnÂ’t around and I tried to express the turmoil I had to endure from meeting Vincent every day, people would all just be like Â‘Oh.. This is VincentÂ’s just doing his job as a bailer, Vincent is just fulfilling his responsibilities as a bailerÂ’<br>
                      <br>
                      Even my good activist buddy, Shelley, when I told her about the intimidations that Vincent made on me, tried to speak up for her dear friend Vincent and say Â‘This might just be one of the counselling techniques that Vincent wanted to use on youÂ’<br>
                      <br>
                      Wow, his mistreatment and intimidation towards me, is deemed as a Â‘counselling techniqueÂ’, if this is truly one of VincentÂ’s techniques he uses as a Youth counsellor, then you can see why I would feel absolutely no remorse if he loses his job.<br>
                      <br>
                      Also concerning his job, I know people are especially angry that I accused him of molestation because he is a youth counsellor, and since he has been accused, parents would not ever want to send their children over to be counselled by him, because I had already sowed doubt.<br>
                      <br>
                      But even though he didnÂ’t molest me, seeing what he said and the Â‘counselling techniquesÂ’ he used on me, I think it would be wise for parents to not hire Vincent for their children. Unless you feel that emotional torment is helpful to your child emotional state, though the view of which is unsurprising since that would be the mentality that you hold when you decide to put your children in schools.<br>
                      <br>
                      The time I had to endure Vincent, I felt like his puppet, a little toy that he could play with. He did not treat me like a person, he treated me like an object, a slave.<br>
                      <br>
                      First the Government, then my father, and then Vincent, IÂ’m really always getting incessantly victimized arenÂ’t I?<br>
                      <br>
                      Now you might be asking, why the hell did I accede to his demands? CouldnÂ’t I just change the bailer to someone who wasnÂ’t a dick?<br>
                      <br>
                      Surprisingly while I was in prison conceptualizing how I was going to breach the terms of the bail again, I never considered the implications of who my bailer was when I eventually breached my bail, but during the time that I was outside, I soon did. I realized that my initial ignorance and JonovanÂ’s piss-poor decision actually lead to a great person to be the victim when I broke the terms of the bail.<br>
                      <br>
                      Because initially I had the impression that the bailerÂ’s reputation would be stained if their fellow bailee broke the terms of the bail. If I had a bailer that I liked, I wouldnÂ’t want to do that to them. However if it was an asshole that was my bailer, like Vincent Law, then I would.<br>
                      <br>
                      He might have to forfeit $20000 (Though if that happened, I would reimburse him), but more importantly, since he often acted as a bailer to other people such as migrant workers, and since I had breached the terms of the bail, his reputation could potentially be stained as a bailer, and he wouldnÂ’t have any opportunities to ever carry out his job.<br>
                      <br>
                      However because the judge decided to not fully revoke my bail and wanted to Â‘give me a 2nd chanceÂ’ because I was Â‘youngÂ’ and Â‘immatureÂ’, Vincent did not have to forfeit anything and in lieu of his reputation as a person and a bailer, I donÂ’t think it left the adverse effect on him that I had intended, though hopefully the previous accusation of molest and this post does.<br>
                      <br>
                      And really Vincent being angry about an allegation of molest is just being pissed off by the response created by stupid people. If unlike the mass media one possesses an IQ that was more than 2 digits, one would probably have already guessed right from the start that it was all a troll.(Dick Ow.? HonestlyÂ… Dick Ow?)<br>
                      <br>
                      IÂ’m never affected by the response of stupid people because you should never be intimidated and stop doing what you love, just because many people are against you, especially when those people are fucking idiots. Which is why though I received a voluminous amount of hate mail, a hit in the face, and 18 days of jail, IÂ’m still chugging along, day by day, continuing to produce the iconoclastic content on my Facebook and blog that you guys oh-so-love. And if those asshole policemen return my fucking camera, I can also continue making my videos too <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Big Grin" class="inlineimg"><br>
                      <br>
                      So right now Vincent is hogging my mother , demanding that I issue a public apology to him and his family, otherwise he would get a lawyer to sue me.<br>
                      <br>
                      And I think thatÂ’s pretty clear enough evidence that Vincent Law, is a charlatan, Vincent Law is huckster, he is a hypocrite and he is a fraud.<br>
                      <br>
                      HeÂ’s standing up for me, heÂ’s fighting for freedom of speech, heÂ’s fighting against the laws that claims that even if somebody lies, mocks or offends a person or large amounts of people, it should not be deemed as a criminal offence.<br>
                      <br>
                      But now, when the cause that he so boldly advocated, is used unfavorably towards him, he is now threatening to use those exact same laws that he went against, to sue me, and yet you all claim that his intentions were genuine.<br>
                      <br>
                      But let me tell you Vincent, if you do indeed sue me for defamation,then IÂ’ll sue you for emotional abuse of a child. And seeing how IÂ’m already baselessly deemed as a mentally disturbed teenager, I think the judge will look very favorably to my case.<br>
                      <br>
                      So there you go. Ah hah! How about that bitch!<br>
                      <br>
                      Oh and also, unbeknownst to me initially, my mother revealed that there is in fact a 2nd definition of the word Â‘molestÂ’. With reference to thefreedictionary.com<br>
                      <br>
                      moÂ·lest<br>
                       (mə-lĕst′)<br>
                       tr.v. moÂ·lestÂ·ed, moÂ·lestÂ·ing, moÂ·lests<br>
                       1. To disturb, interfere with, or annoy<br>
                      <br>
                      And after youÂ’ve read this tale you would know that Vincent did in fact disturb and annoy me.<br>
                       So technically, Vincent didnÂ’t molest me, but yet he did. The beauty of contrarieties in life.<br>
                      <br>
                      Part 5 : Alas! Me fellow munchkins, we are about to conclude. At yonder Vincent trembles, relish me friends, haha!<br>
                      <br>
                      My fellow friends, this is what happens when you get a Christian as a bailer.<br>
                      <br>
                      But regardless of all those horrible things that he did to me, did that warrant a temporary accusation of molestation for 12 hours, that could potentially have ruined his relationship with his family, made him lose his job and his entire livelihood? WellÂ… I thought it did.<br>
                      <br>
                      Revenge is indeed a dish best served cold. And after my little accusation of molest, all is well and good. It was an ingredient to effectively troll the media, I managed to publicly humiliate Vincent, and after this incident he has decided to wash his hands off me and that means, I will never see or talk to him again (At least I hope).<br>
                      <br>
                      If anybody was unfortunate enough to have to be obligated to associate with a person such as Vincent, then my gosh, I express my greatest sympathies. The experience was thoroughly traumatic for me I assure you. But like any tumultuous experience in my life, I got over it, and possibly became cooler in the process.<br>
                      <br>
                      So there you go, I am done WasnÂ’t that an exciting story? I hope you enjoyed it. And now that I have finished telling the tale, your humble narrator shall depart and engage in another potentially new and exciting endeavor. Now that it has been written, we will go around, brother-in-arms, village to village, laughing, sharing and spreading the tale Â– of the molestation of Vincent Law. Have fun!

               This is the police report I made on 30 June 2014.<br>
               Addresses and name are blanked out until help is rendered:<br>
              <br>
               =======================================<br>
               I wish to make a police report dating back to 1997 when I started to be harassed by a neighbour. <br>
              <br>
               I bought a resale 3-room flat under the singles scheme and moved in on Nov 30 1996 at Blk 161 Tampines St 12 #​--​-​---​ (521161). <br>
              <br>
               Two weeks after I moved in, my next door neighbour (#​--​-​---), (I believe his surname is Mr.​ -----​ ) started watching TV in his masterbedroom which was next to my masterbedroom with very loud volume till the wee hours, up to 2am every night. That affected my sleep which was disturbing and I was working then. Mr ​-----​, I understand, was a retiree. <br>
              <br>
               I waited for 2 months before very politely going over to his flat and explained that his loud TV volume was affecting my sleep. He toned down the TV volume for only 2 weeks. I again very courteously went over and explained that our masterbedrooms were just next to each other and his loud TV volume really affected my sleep. He didn't tone down at all.<br>
              <br>
               I had to call the HDB to ask them to help me with the situation. Perhaps 2 weeks after the HDB officer spoke to Mr ​-----​, I started to get harassed. Shit was placed at my corridor window ledge, my weekend car was scratched, the front bumper was dislodged, the paintwork splashed with acid and people started staring at me when I return home from work near the lift. <br>
              <br>
               I filed a Magistrates' Complaint, but he didn't turn up on the appointed day. <br>
              <br>
               The harassment went on even after he moved to another estate. I did still see him occasionally at the Tampines MRT though. <br>
              <br>
               I finally decided to sell my flat in Tampines because of the harassment and moved in with my girlfriend at Blk 116 Hougang Ave 1 #​--​-​----​ (530116) on 19 July 2008. <br>
              <br>
               Mr. ​-----​ and his friends or hired help followed me and used two flats above me (#​--​-​----​ and #​--​-​----​) to continue to harass me. They got bolder. Besides lots of knocking on their floors and dragging furniture, they sprayed urine, shit, all kinds of chemicals through my main door, windows and even through the pipes that lead to my kitchen sink and bathroom basin. <br>
              <br>
               I moved again to my girlfriend's sister and brother-in-law's terrace house at ​--​ Jalan Sembilang, Thomson Park (​------​) on 26 Sept 2011. Again they followed and continued to harass me using the two adjacent terrace houses at ​--​ and ​--​ Jalan Sembilang. Not so much noise as we're now on ground floor, but still the same ways spraying all the things mentioned and through windows and pipes. <br>
              <br>
               I applied for a Balance of Sales HDB Studio Apartment in Nov 2013 as I turned 55 yrs old and finally moved in on 18 June 2014 at Blk 211B Punggol Walk #​--​-​---​ (822211). This is where I am residing now. <br>
              <br>
               My harassers are now using the flat above me #​--​-​---​ and I believe the flat below me #​--​---- to continue to harass me. They are now spraying the same things mentioned through my main door, hall and bathroom windows and through the pipes connecting to my kitchen sink and bathroom basin and possibly have drilled small tiny holes through my bathroom ceiling to spray things. When I brush teeth or take a shower, I can feel different kinds of sprays, sweet, sour, salty and can be hot like pepper or mild acid. I can even hear a hissing sound (spraying). <br>
              <br>
               One way to nail them is by checking on their finances, eg bank accounts, big purchases like cars, holidays, etc especially the family who stays at ​--​ Jalan Sembilang. Another way is to thoroughly scrutinize and continue to monitor vigorously the people who stay or are using #​--​-​---​ and #​--​-​---​, ie above and below me until they are caught. <br>
              <br>
               I respect that you have your own ways of investigation of course and the above are just my own amateurish thoughts. <br>
              <br>
               What I am saying is that, if you investigate hard enough, you will find evidence and ways to finally find them guilty of harassing or abetting to harass me. <br>
              <br>
               I am not moving again. If you cannot eventually nab them, I am resigned to their harassment all my life. <br>
              <br>
               Please help me. <br>
              <br>
               Thank you.<br>

               ​I have sought help from:<br>
              <br>
               ​The Singapore Police Force<br>
               Dr. Janil Puthucheary (meet-the-people session)<br>
               Mr. Teo Chee Hean (Minister of Home Affairs)<br>
               Mr. Khaw Boom Wan (Minister of National Development)<br>
               Lee Hsien Loong (Prime Minister) ​​<br>
              <br>
               Despite my frequent emails via Gmail and Facebook seeking help and updates on their investigations, all of the above-mentioned top leaders and SPF have been unable to stop the harassment.<br>
              <br>
               I am hoping that someone or a group of people will be able to do so.​ <br>
              <br>
               I really hope that the kampong spirit in Singapore exists.​<br>
              <br>
               Please help the top leaders and SPF to fight crime.<br>
              <br>
               Please email me at *****@gmail.com<br>
              <br>
               Please leave me your contact number or email address if you can help. ​<br>
              <br>
               Thank you very much. I am forever grateful to you.<br>

               It is very strange that harassment can go to such an extent. Your former neighbor must be so powerful and and so influential that he/she can mobilise so many people at so many locations to harass you. Your opponent is too powerful to handle. <br>
              <br>
               You may try to seek help from a Doctor. Repeat what you mentioned here, maybe the Doctor can come up with some solution.<br>

               Thank you Yong Wu for writing.<br>
              <br>
               When I was in Hougang, I tried to gather evidence of the chemicals that were sprayed by placing a clear plastic sheet on the area that my harassers would try to hurt me. Not only were the plastic sheet sprayed on, I got the chemicals on my head, face and neck.<br>
              <br>
               I had to seek medical help at Hougang Polyclinic as all the areas of my body that were affected turned super hot and red, like burned by acid. The doctor prescribed some medication to soothe the burned skin.<br>
              <br>
               I called the police and they took the sheet away to have Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to analyse what the chemicals were. <br>
              <br>
               About a month later, the police came and asked me for some sample that were new and not sprayed on and said that HSA needed that for comparison.<br>
              <br>
               I kept enquiring about the results quite a few times from the police.<br>
              <br>
               It was 10 mths later that the police wrote to tell me that the results didn't show anything toxic.<br>
              <br>
               I wrote to HSA and found out that they normally would only take 3 mths to analyse whatever the police bring to them and that they are unable to furnish any other details.<br>
              <br>
               I wrote to the police and asked why it took so long for the results to come to me, which plastic sheet was given to HSA to analyse, the new or the one that was sprayed on, when did they send the sheets to HSA for analysis. I also questioned that if they sheets were sent very late to HSA, all the chemicals on the sprayed sheet would have evaporated and that was why nothing toxic was found. <br>
              <br>
               None of the questions above was answered.<br>
              <br>
               I was hoping that with the evidence that I had, the police would nab my harassers. <br>
              <br>
               Now in Punggol Walk, after I made this police report, they have come to take photos of the places inside and outside of my Studio Apartment that my harassers continue to spray on me and my face, neck and even my back, all of which have been burned by all sorts of chemicals.<br>
              <br>
               I am still seeking help from all the top leaders in Singapore and SPF regarding this case.<br>
              <br>
               Yong Wu, I really don't need a shrink. What I need is someone or a group of people more powerful than my harassers, with a sense of justice and kampong spirit.<br>
              <br>
               Once again, Yong Wu, thanks for writing.<br>

              <br>
               How can you be "sprayed" with chemicals on your face, neck, and back, without you capturing even a shred of evidence? If you do not have a single shred of evidence, how can you even be sure, and even name an accuser?<br>
              <br>
               As I said this is mind-bogging?<br>
              <br>
               Are you legitimately being harassed or everything is plain fiction?<br>
              <br>
               You need to come clean and with your story.<br>
              <br>
               And you say by stating your case in Reach you expect stronger protection and help from the SPF? How?<br>
              <br>
               Are you the harassed or harasser?<br>

               In this world there are some people with supernatural powers. These people can hear what other people can't. Some can see what average people can't. Some can tele control. These super power can sometimes give rise to some problems and affect the quality of life.<br>
              <br>
               Your ex neighbor may have 1 of these superpower. So no matter where you live, he still can disturb/harass you. If you stay in AMK, he may send some monkeys to harass you. If you stay in Ubin, he may send some snakes to your house. If you stay on the top floor, he may make your ceiling crack and rain water leaking into your house.<br>
              <br>
               To ward off this, you may need to seek people with superpower. You can go to church, temple or chant everyday, once you accumulate enough "invisible strength" the harassment would disappear.<br>
              <br>
               On the otherhand, you may have the superpower which you yourself not aware. To solve this problem is to get rid of your superpower so that you can live a harass-free life. The people who can help people to get rid of their superpower is in *** (Admin pls don't delete this address and tel number).<br>
              <br>
               Good luck and hope you enjoy your harass-free life.<br>

               Thank you Yong Wu and Dalek for writing.<br>
              <br>
               I am not the only one who experience all kinds of sprays here in Punggol Walk. My harassers spray all kinds of chemicals and things that smell and taste like sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper.<br>
              <br>
               My girlfriend lives with me. Very often, I would ask her whether she smells and tastes what is sprayed. She says rust (mixture of all sorts of things). Last night, I asked her again. She said something sweet and that it is better than rust. (Meaning more tolerable)<br>
              <br>
               Fortunately, my girlfriend does feel all the sprays as well. Otherwise, I would really be crazy.<br>
              <br>
               I really don't know if it would help by going through REACH SINGAPORE to Law Society of Singapore's Pro Bono Services to see if they can help. That's why I asked.<br>
              <br>
               Anyway, I'm not sure if lawyers do investigation work. If they don't, how are they going to present to court anything at all. As a last resort, I would approach them.<br>
              <br>
               I am still waiting for help. People with extensive investigation work experience, eg active/retired Senior Police Officers with a sense of justice and kampong spirit would be most welcomed if they would like to take up the challenge.<br>
              <br>
               Please help me and my girlfriend who has to suffer along with me.<br>

               It appears that you experience it in your home only. Could you try to close your windows, perhaps use air cleaners in your home,<br>
              <br>
               Perhaps you may be hyper sensitive or have allergy of sorts? How about you put on masks and check if it helps.<br>
              <br>
               Lets explore this hypothetically. If someone is spraying chemicals, then wont they be affected as well? They cant be spraying it out their windows because their acts are visible.<br>

               Hi Dalek<br>
              <br>
               My harassers spray from both outside and inside of my flat, especially in the bathroom. Obviously, my harassers are very confident that they will never be caught. That explains why they have been harassing me all these years. With nobody who is smarter than them, this group of people have been bullying me with no qualms at all. They are totally blatant and have no respect for anybody, the police, the authorities and the laws of Singapore. <br>
              <br>
               I can't be closing all the windows all the time right? Need to air the place. Can't be wearing mask all the time too.<br>
              <br>
               I am not allergic to anything at all. I have no medical condition that needs attention at the moment. Not sure when I will end up in hospital due to the all the chemicals and sprays. I actually did tell my girlfriend that if I get hurt bad enough, to send me to the nearest hospital. I think the nearest from Punggol Walk is Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun Central. <br>
              <br>
               Thanks Dalek.<br>

               I think you need to speak with a Lawyer, and seek their advise.<br>
              <br>
               Only they would know what are your legal rights. <br>
              <br>
               Eventually, you have to decide the course of action, or live with it, or whatever.<br>
              <br>
               I only wished I could give more ideas but I cant.<br>
              <br>
               Perhaps there are some kind of detection kits, that you can place in your home or toilet, and when you suspect chemicals are sprayed, those kits collect the samples and can be sent for lab analysis. <br>
              <br>
               It sound like CSI (TV programme) kind of Detective and forensics investigation.<br>
              <br>
               It is going to be uphill for you and we have not even counted the costs. <br>
              <br>
               Never give up! <br>
              <br>
               Good wishes, Good luck, and All the Best!<br>

               I have tried to gather evidence on my own in Hougang. Eventually, as explained earlier, it took 10 mths for the police to write and tell me that nothing toxic was found. They did not even bother to answer any of my questions.<br>
              <br>
               I have no idea what to do anymore as far as gathering evidence is concerned. That is why I welcome any active/retired Senior Police Officer or people who have extensive investigation work experience, with a sense of justice and kampong spirit to help.<br>
              <br>
               I live in a HDB Studio Apartment in Punggol Walk. Both units above and below me are also Studio Apartments. HDB Studio Apartments are meant to be occupied solely by the owners, not to be rented out or used by any other persons in any way.<br>
              <br>
               I hope that SPF and HDB officers are aware of that and can look into using CCTV surveillance cameras to check who goes in and out of the 2 apartments. I believe that the 2 agencies would not have enough manpower to keep watch 24 hrs a day on those 2 units.<br>
              <br>
               That way, people who are renting or using those 2 units to harass me can be found out. If they can't find anyone renting or using those 2 units, then the owners of the 2 units are hired to harass me. The owners of those 2 units will be in big trouble if they abet to harass me.<br>
              <br>
               It's a really tough case. Someone or a group of powerful Samaritans who is smarter than my harassers would be required to solve this case.<br>
              <br>
               It's a very long, winding and stony road for me and my girlfriend.<br>
              <br>
               Please help.<br>

               Mind bogging...this case.<br>
              <br>
               Did you rope in the neighbours around you, who also are valid witnesses to all the harassments?<br>
              <br>
               They are very important as 3rd party independent witnesses. <br>
              <br>
               Perhaps your only way out is private suit...for every penny he got...of course including your Queens Council costs.<br>

               Thank you Dalek for your suggestions and concern. <br>
              <br>
               It's difficult and almost impossible to find kampong spirit in Singapore.<br>
               To get witnesses, forget it.<br>
              <br>
               I'm just a poor old man living in a HDB Studio Apartment in Punggol Walk. How could I possibly hire a lawyer, much less a QC.<br>

               You really need to stop being targetted.<br>
              <br>
               The only way is to fight back!<br>
              <br>
               You have to get a lawyer, you have to do your homework (dates, photographs, etc, witnesses).<br>
              <br>
               Believe me I think a lawyer is the only way to go. <br>
              <br>
               When you win the case, he pays! Lawyer costs, newspaper apology, etc...<br>
              <br>
               You can't keep running! Fight back!<br>

               I really cannot afford a lawyer. I am wondering if any lawyer or rich persons are kind enough to fight this case pro bono.<br>
              <br>
               Like I said, it's difficult and almost impossible to find kampong spirit in Singapore.<br>
              <br>
               Alternatively, the relevant agencies can take up the task. I feel that it's their responsibilities and job to do what is right.<br>

               Dear Harassed Harassed,<br>
              <br>
               You could try contacting the Law Society of Singapore; I understand it has a Pro Bono Services Office which helps bring free legal assistance to those in need in our community.<br>
              <br>
               More information can be found at this link:<br>

              <br>
               Have a good weekend ahead. <br>
              <br>
               Cheers!<br>

               Dear Alan,<br>
              <br>
               Thank you very much for bringing Law Society of Singapore's Pro Bono Services into the picture.<br>
              <br>
               Would it make a stronger case to go through REACH SINGAPORE to see if they are able to help me? Would you be kind enough to highlight my case to them? <br>
              <br>
               Failing which, as a last resort, I will approach them myself.<br>
              <br>
               I am still hoping that the top leaders, SPF and the relevant agencies, with a combined effort would stop this harassment.<br>
              <br>
               Thank you very much, Alan.<br>

               All that needs to be done is for the Prime Minister to give an order to stop the harassment and the relevant agencies will act.<br>
              <br>
               Unfortunately, despite many emails to the Prime Minister via Facebook, Gmail and now here, there is absolutely not a single reply from him.<br>
              <br>
               What's the point of having so many channels to communicate with the top leaders when none works.<br>
              <br>
               I hope that the kampong spirit exists in Singapore. <br>
              <br>
               If anyone or a group of people would like to help and do not want to post here, please search for Harassed Harassed and message me in Facebook. <br>

               If anyone who has been harassed in any way or is still being harassed, and would like to share experiences, please search and message me, Harassed Harassed in Facebook.<br>
              <br>
               Perhaps we could start a Harassed support group, or is there one already.<br>

               Dear Harassed Harassed,<br>
              <br>
               I had posted address and tel for you to seek help, but unfortunately they are being deleted by the admin.<br>
              <br>
               Frankly speaking, I am a harasser myself. I harassed people who offended me. but I know when to stop.<br>
              <br>
               I think your case is hopeless as I am inclined to believe that the harassments are imaginary and to solve your problem, it is best for you to seek help from IMH or just live with it and try to accept and adapt.<br>
              <br>
               Sorry for being blunt.<br>

               Dear Yong Wu,<br>
              <br>
               I have said that I am not the only one who feel the sprays. My girlfriend lives with me and she smells and tastes the sprays as well.<br>
              <br>
               There is nothing I can do if you still think that I need a shrink. Better if you can try to think of something that might help to stop this harassment, right?<br>
              <br>
               Anyway, thanks for writing.

              My mother, upon reading what Vincent had done to me, was absolutely horrified and disturbed, contacted Terry Xu of TheOnlineCitizen, to confirm that the moments I had mentioned concerning her in lieu of the Vincent story, was true, and to perhaps express it to the general public.
              <br><br>
              However, as of now, Terry has yet to reply to my mother, even though he had been prompt in replying to her before, and voluntarily offering to write an article, explaining and showing the true nature of my motherâ€™s police report.
              <br><br>
              
              And Roy Ngerng who initially condemned me for my actions towards making molest allegations to Vincent. Now chooses to remain absolutely silent about the affair, after I had revealed the emotional abuse Vincent had inflicted on me.
              <br><br>
              I asked him if he could assist in helping me confirm that the altercation he witnessed between Vincent and I, when we went to Public Enemy was true. But he refused to do so, still claiming that itâ€™s to protect Vincent from any further harm.
              <br><br>
              So Roy Ngerng thinks that hiding the truth, is advantageous for Vincent. Ahhâ€¦ I see now why they are very good friends.
              <br><br>
              But I think really, the true reason why Terry and Roy have refrained from talking about all of this, is simply because people just donâ€™t like to admit that they have changed their opinions once further evidence have surfaced, because that might indicate that when they made their initial hasty judgement, they were wrong.
              <br><br>
              And this is the reason, why PAP is able to rule the country for so long.
              <br><br>
              The Government in Singapore really fucking sucks, but then again, the Opposition are fucking manipulative too.
