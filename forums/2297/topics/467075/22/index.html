              <p class="first">The 17-year hunt for her kidnapped son cost Ye Jinxiu her marriage, home and family. And when she found her boy, now a grown man and stranger, he wanted nothing to do with her.</p>
              <p>Now 59, homeless and alone again, Ye roams the streets of Fuzhou on China's east coast helping other parents search for their children, devoting her failing health to what she knows is largely a lost cause.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands of children, most of them boys, are believed to be stolen each year in China. Most are sold within the country to meet demand fuelled by a one-child limit, traditional preference for sons, virtual immunity for families who buy them and, as parents like Ye complain, apathetic police.</p>
              <p>“Having a child kidnapped is worse than having your heart torn out,” she said, gazing at a huge canvas she had laid out by a bus stop, printed with "missing" adverts and chubby-cheeked faces.</p>
              <p>"If someone rips your heart out it takes one second, you die and you're not aware anymore," she said.</p>
              <p>"If your child is kidnapped and not found, then every day as soon as you wake up, your heart hurts from thinking."</p>
              <p>China does not publish figures on how many children are seized per year but said it rescued 24,000 in the first 10 months of 2013, probably a fraction of total cases.</p>
              <p>Many are stolen in the poorer interior and sold to families on the wealthier eastern seaboard, particularly provinces such as Fujian where Ye lives, said Deng Fei, a Beijing-based journalist who helps locate children.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands might be kidnapped every year and sold for tens of thousands of yuan each, he said, cautioning that estimates were rough. On a popular website dedicated to the cause 14,000 families have posted notices looking for lost ones.</p>
              <p>Children in rural areas are especially vulnerable, as two in five live apart from their parents, who have migrated elsewhere for work and often left feeble grandparents in charge.</p>
              <p>Police have sometimes refused to open cases because the low chance of cracking them might hurt their performance record, and they have resisted pursuing families who buy, Deng said.</p>
              <p>Also feeding the trade is the sale of children -- sometimes by those most entrusted to protect them.</p>
              <p>In December a doctor in northern Shaanxi went on trial for selling seven infants after convincing parents to give them up because of supposed serious illnesses, state media said.</p>
              <p>Reports two months earlier said a couple in Shanghai sold their daughter to buy an iPhone. They claimed they wanted to give her a better life, with a wealthier family.</p>
              <p>Yang Jing, a 35-year-old mother from southwestern Sichuan, told AFP she has spent 13 years trying to retrieve her son after he was sold to a richer couple in Jiangsu -- by her husband.</p>
              <p>“They told me it didn't count as kidnapping... because the father gave him away," she said.</p>
              <p>Ye, in Fuzhou, said she criss-crossed more than 10 provinces after her then six-year-old boy disappeared in 1993, collecting rubbish, washing dishes and borrowing to pay her way, and sleeping in parks. She nearly died, she said, before her husband begged her to stop and finally left.</p>
              <p>She claims she found the trafficker's home by 1995 but authorities only acted after years of pressure. In 2000 three men were sentenced to at most three years' jail and a decade later police found the son, Lu Jianning, she said.</p>
              <p>The night before their reunion Ye could hardly sleep.</p>
              <p>But her son did not even hug her. He stayed for a year while she took on more debt to pay for his schooling.</p>
              <p>Then he disappeared, and he has not contacted her in two years.</p>
              <p>"I don't regret looking for him. How he lives his life is up to him,” Ye said. "When your child goes missing you can't stop looking.”</p>
              <p>She lays out her canvas in quiet places where police do not bother her and hands out fliers filled with youthful faces.</p>
              <p>Two were brothers, “Dou Dou” and “Yuan Yuan”, kidnapped as infants on the same day in 1991. A short-haired girl abducted on her way home from kindergarten in 2010 was described as “wearing a black-and-white cotton jacket when last seen".</p>
              <p>Some passers-by paused to scan the descriptions. One, surnamed Zhen, blamed the government for failing to help the rural poor. "If they didn't have to move to the city, they could take care of their kids and there would be less kidnapping," he said.</p>
              <p>Ye's struggle has cost her her health -- she coughs blood and can hardly see -- and she owes relatives "so much money that I'm afraid to go home", she says.</p>
              <p>But, she said: "Just thinking about these cute kids breaks your heart.</p>
              <p>"I found my kid but other parents haven't found theirs, and I can't stop looking."</p>

              <p>Sex Slavery Smuggling Ring in Malaysia :</p>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 14 — Police have stumbled onto an alleged sex trafficking ring following investigations into the recent death of a Mongolian student.</p>
              <p>Enkhtuya Bayar Magnai, 26, was found hanged near a wet market in Behrang, near here, on November 12 with fresh cut wounds on her hands and thighs. However, Tanjung Malim police chief Supt Othman Nayan (pic) said there was no foul play.</p>
              <p>He said the element of human trafficking emerged after Mongolian police alerted Interpol to the possibility of Enkhtuya being held by a human trafficking gang.</p>
              <p>In an email to Tanjung Malim police on December 30, Interpol referred distressing messages from Enkhtuya to her brother in Mongolia days before she was found dead.</p>
              <p>The brother then sent the messages — in one of which Enkhtuya said she was “being sold” — to the National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ulan Bator. </p>
              <p>“We discovered that she was working in a massage parlour in Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, and never attended a single class at her college,” Othman told <em>The Malay Mail</em> yesterday.</p>
              <p>He said the matter was handed over to Bukit Aman following allegations of human trafficking.</p>
              <p>Othman said the Mongolian police revealed Enkhtuya had first sent a Facebook message to her brother on November 5, claiming two other female Mongolian students had tricked her into believing they could obtain documents for her to stay in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>She related she was then “sold” but did not identify to whom.</p>
              <p>Two days before she died, she sent a text message to her brother that read: “I am dead ... I am at Sentral Pudu, someone trying to sell me.”</p>
              <p>Othman said that according to the National Central Bureau, the family strongly believes Enkhtuya was a victim of human trafficking.</p>
              <p>Police are tracing her phone records to ascertain who she had been in contact with during her stay here.</p>

                  <p class="first">When Resorts World Sentosa (RWS)’s Marine Life Park (MLP) in Singapore announced a new partnership it is undertaking with non-profit environmental organisation Conservation International (CI), the news raised a few eyebrows among conservationists in Singapore.<br><br>According to an announcement by the two parties, the partnership will “allow collaboration on important marine issues in Singapore”, and will last for five years.<br><br>It will focus on conservation, marine mammal veterinary medicine, public education and the support of regional projects through joint conservation events and fundraising efforts, according to the statement released on Friday. <br><br>“Beyond being a world-class tourist attraction, the park has also demonstrated a strong commitment to marine conservation and has a team with a wealth of expertise,” said CI’s senior vice-president of its Asia-Pacific field division David Emmett. “I believe that this partnership will further our mission to ensure that vital natural resources are preserved and used sustainably for the long term benefit of people and all life on Earth.”<br><br>The MLP previously received significant criticism for its treatment of 27 bottlenose dolphins purchased from the Solomon Islands. Three of them died while in training in the Philippines and Langkawi before being transferred to Singapore.<br><br>The remaining 24 are housed in its Dolphin Island, where a series of interactive programmes, with admission ticket prices ranging from $58 for child or elderly observers to $498 for its “Trainer for a Day” programme for adults. Some of them are also on display at its SEA Aquarium.<br><br><strong>‘Hypocritical'</strong><br><br>Speaking on behalf of wildlife activist group Acres, its founder and executive director Louis Ng said he was very “disappointed” to learn of the tie-up. In 2011, Acres had spearheaded a campaign against MLP's purchase and housing of the bottlenose dolphins. It says the effort garnered more than 630,000 supporters.<br><br>In a post on his Facebook page, he said he was “really disappointed that Conservation International, a group I really respected as a student, has chosen to not only partner with Resorts World but to publicly say that the Marine Life Park has ‘demonstrated a strong commitment to marine conservation’”.<br><br>“Does the strong commitment to marine conservation include the purchase of wild-caught dolphins and pushing the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins one step closer towards extinction in the Solomon Islands? Not forgetting that 3 of the wild-caught dolphins have already died,” he wrote. “I wonder if Conservation International will be able to clarify this further.”<br><br>Echoing Ng's view was veteran local naturalist Tony O’Dempsey, who has been involved in various conservation projects in Singapore the past two decades.<br><br>“I am curious as to why a conservation organisation [CI] would offer such high praise for an organisation that enslaves wild-caught dolphins,” said the 52-year-old. “As long as RWS continues to enslave dolphins, they will have no credibility with me no matter what other research they may be involved in.”<br><br>Independent wildlife consultant Subaraj Rajathurai noted that CI may have good intentions in its partnership, as RWS’s large numbers of visitors do stand to benefit in learning about marine conservation issues such as shark finning.<br><br>The group, however, should not simply ignore the dolphin issue, he added. “This avoidance of the fact [that MLP is dealing with wild caught dolphins] does not portray CI in a positive light as it is simply too large a black cloud over MLP," he said.<br><br>“The main fact is that these dolphins have been removed from the wild, risking wild populations, for RWS’s entertainment plans,” he continued. “CI should realise and understand this and do something positive about it."</p>
                  <p>Ng also asked if CI can clarify if it is receiving funding from RWS as part of the partnership, and if so, how much it is getting. <br><br>“We hope that CI can clarify if it is aware of the way the dolphins were acquired by RWS and the scientific literature about the effects of the capture of the dolphins,” he said.<br><br><strong>Partnership ‘does not cover dolphins’: CI</strong><br><span id="yui_3_0_0-2-1389694723282" class="yui-editorial-embed"><span id="schemaorg"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-left" style="WIDTH: 630px"><img class="editorial " title="Baby bottlenose dolphin Doerte and her mother Delphi swim through their basin on October 18, 2011 at the zoo in Duisburg, western Germany.

                  <p>CI has previously been <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/13/news/companies/corporate_green.fortune/index.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">criticised</span></span></a> by international conservationists and <a href="http://www.redd-monitor.org/2010/03/05/the-nature-conservancy-and-conservation-international-putting-profits-before-planet/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">environmental news agencies</span></span></a> for its controversial partnerships with large corporations, all of which involve the companies donating significant, but undisclosed, sums to CI. When asked about this, a spokesperson for RWS did not respond directly to queries, but the company previously noted that opinion, on the whole, about dolphins under human care remains divided.</p>
                  <p>However, in a statement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/conservation.intl/posts/10152169369287112?stream_ref=10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">posted on its Facebook page</span></span></a> in response to concerns aired by Facebook users, CI said it did not receive any funds from RWS when setting up the partnership.</p>
                  <p>When contacted by <em>Yahoo Singapore</em>, CI confirmed this, noting that RWS will only fund projects that are undertaken by both CI and RWS in the process of the partnership.<br><br>Experts in the study of animal welfare and environmental conservation have <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201008/compassionate-conservation-finally-comes-age-killing-in-the-name-conserv"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">highlighted</span></span></a> the difference between the two, explaining that while animal welfare does not accept the suffering of any species, conservation tends to take a broader perspective, frequently <a href="http://www.raincoast.org/wp-content/uploads/Paquet-and-Darimont-2010-Wildlife-Conservation-Animal-Welfare.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">accepting trade-offs</span></span></a> in the course of its aims.</p>
                  <p>Said Prof Chou Loke Ming, director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme at the National University of Singapore, "There is so much to do in marine conservation, and partnerships are most rational in optimising synergy amid limited funding and increasing challenges."</p>
                  <p>He pointed out that the fact that dolphins are being held in captivity should not be taken as a point to censure RWS's overall marine conservation programme.</p>
                  <p>"If it is an animal welfare argument, then there is no difference between keeping dolphins and forcing horses to race, or caging singing birds, or keeping fish in aquarium tanks, small or large," he said. "If it is a conservation argument, the big picture is that other human activities such as fishing and habitat quality decline do greater damage and kill much more dolphins, and they should be addressed through more effective conservation efforts."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><strong>My 14 year old daughter got molested by LHL's Foreign Talent in the bus</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://therealsingapore.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/sgGirls.com_-_00440821.jpg?itok=nn7DdNwy" border="0" alt=""><br><br></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">I am writing this letter to create awareness and inform fellow parents not to be complacent like me on regards to our children's safety. I learned the saddest and hardest way.<br><br>It is a bad and unfortunate new year to start off with.<br><br>Last Sunday, 10 January 2014, my 14 year old daughter was molested in the bus at the upper deck. It is such a traumatised experience for a young one to go through.<br><br>When I received her frantic WhatsApp message telling me that she was molested, I quickly gave her a call back. She was crying and I couldn't hear that trembling voice of hers as she was trying to explain what had happened. That's why she had to message me first as she had difficulty talking properly. But because I couldn't hear and understand her properly, she pass her phone to a female police officer. The police officer told me the place of incident but I still cannot hear properly because my mind was in a whirlwind and I couldn't focus. In the end, my daughter told me the bus stop number and I did a quick search on the map to find the exact location. I booked a cab and quickly rush down at the place of incident. The place of incident was just opposite her school.<br><br>When I came down, I rush out of the cab, leaving the door open while my husband pays the cab fare and I run straight into the bus. I saw police officers crowding around, whom I believe is the perpetrator. I asked the police officers if that's him. At that time, in my mind, I REALLY wanted to dash through the police officers and slap that perpetrator. But, the police officers quickly usher me out of the bus and into the ambulance where my daughter was waiting for me. I could see how much in distress my daughter was. I hugged her real tight. She was trembling and looking shocked. But she was also eating a sardine curry puff. I was thinking they probably allow her to eat in the ambulance maybe because they want her to calm down while waiting for me to arrive. I too was actually trembling because I was feeling so angry! And also feeling very disappointed as well because I was thinking, how can "this" happened to my daughter? Why MY DAUGHTER? And on top of that Singapore is suppose to be safe. I was still thinking about Singapore being the most safest country in the world. But I WAS ANGRY AT MYSELF MORE because I felt it was all my fault. I HAD FAILED to protect my innocent young daughter. I had been complacent.<br><br>My daughter briefly told me (because I didn't want to stress her more by asking too much) that she got molested, she shouted, the bus driver quickly reacted by stopping the bus and lock the door and activate the police to come as soon as possible.<br><br>Because I was busy consoling my daughter, my husband was outside the ambulance, talking with the police officers and Duty Officer, asking what's the next course of action. My husband get bits and pieces of the actual story and the Duty Officer cannot reveal much because it is considered as still under investigation. So my husband told me bits and pieces of the incident that while waiting for the police to arrive, the perpetrator actually beg for leniency while he was locked inside the bus. The Duty Officer also says the perpetrator ADMITTED TO THE CRIME.<br><br>The perpetrator is a big grown man. Dark-skinned and possibly not a local. I don't know much of the details yet because I was not given a copy of the full statement report.<br><br>Taking about the report, I actually wanted to quickly bring my daughter home as soon as possible and let my daughter calm herself down and come back another day to give her full statement report. But my husband insist on doing it now because he's afraid my daughter will not remember anything if she decided to forget this painful and traumatizing incident quickly. So, my husband spoke to my daughter and assure her to be brave and strong so that she could give her full statement report.<br><br>While waiting for my daughter to finish giving her statement, I was crying my heart out for my daughter at the bus stop. My daughter school mates whom rushed down for my daughter because my daughter called them, came consoling me and calling their other friends to quickly bring me water so that I could drink to calm myself down. One by one gave me tissue to wipe my tears. They are really a bunch of thoughtful students.<br><br>I want to thank the bus driver for his swift action. He technically had helped us in one way or another. Since, I can't comment much about the incident because I don't have the full report, the only thing that's crucial is that the perpetrator whom is responsible for the crime has he's identity established (confirmed) according to the police reference letter I received today, 15 Jan 2014.<br><br>After my daughter had given her statement, she came crying to me again and told me she is so afraid. Her body was still trembling and shivering so hard. As a mother, my heart was so heartbroken. I couldn't do anything except to console her and hope that perpetrator brought to justice quickly! She's only 14!<br><br>I did ask my daughter why didn't she move away from her seat when a stranger come sitting beside her when there are plenty of other seats? She says, she didn't thought much about it because she assume the perpetrator was just a normal civilian. My daughter wasn't even dressed provocatively. How could that perpetrator do this to my daughter??? How could he??? She's so innocent and did not think much that "this" would happen. I'm beyond words, so upset about this incident. Again I am in denial thinking why this had happened to my daughter.<br><br><strong>I didn't teach her well to be wary of others. I realized that. But I did teach her to be nice to people and not be a people hater if the other person is of a different race, language, religion or from another country. But unfortunately, this teaching DID NOT save her from being molested. I know this statement will be a controversy. But that was what I was thinking at that time.</strong><br><br>Till today, I am still feeling so angry, helpless, devastated, sad, upset and guilty for not able to protect my daughter. It's just NOT SAFE anymore in Singapore. Because of this incident, my husband and I decided to make sure our daughter goes to school by taxi and also when she comes home from school.<br><br>The reason I wrote this to you is because I hope this frightening experience, be an example that even in public places like a public bus, is no longer safe. How can we as parents do more about it? I can't, 24 hours be around my daughter, chaperone her to and fro her school. So, that's why we decided it's OK to sacrifice some money on taxi till my daughter is confident enough to take the public bus and train again.<br><br>As of today, I know my daughter is still in shock. But she has been putting a brave front. As for me, I will make sure I make her life be normal and happy again. That's is my priority.<br><br>I hope this letter do not received any negative comments. I am already heartbroken so I plea with everyone to just focus on my intention which is about our creating awareness on regards to our children's safety on public transport and public places.<br><br>Thank you so much.<br><br><br>Yours Sincerely,<br><strong>Mrs Tay</strong><br></span></span></p>

              <p><em>A Singaporean woman writes :</em></p>
              <p>I refer to the article: THE LATEST NONSENSE TO COME FROM PAP MP JOSEPHINE TEO<br><br>In an interview, Josephine Teo said that under the PAP, S'pore has done well and she simply can't understand why some Singaporeans are “so angry”. (Photo: ST)<br><br>I can tell you why my family and I are angry:<br><br>1. High qualifications and upgrades in qualification are no longer a path to good and secure jobs. For many years, the government has been pushing us to upgrade our qualifications and skills saying that is the best way to ensure our survival since Singapore has no other resources except human resource. They said we should be pushing for an intelligent workforce. Look what happens now? <strong>We are told to forget about getting degrees and there aren’t enough jobs in Singapore for graduates.<br></strong><br>So our “lack 20/20″ foresight government tells us one thing one day and then something else another day. Do they even know what they are doing?<br><br>2. My children, who are average in studies but have a strong command of the English language, are being bypassed for higher education in Singapore! We are an average income family and cannot afford extra tuition or overseas education for our three children. <strong>Foreigners with very poor command of English are given scholarships and free extra tuition to help them cope with the free education here. What about our own Singaporean children?</strong> If free extra tuition was given to me children in Chinese language, they would score sufficiently well, I’m sure.<br><br>3. My retired father is diabetic, vitamin B deficient and has high blood pressure. He spends long hours at the polyclinic once a month to see the doctor. Three quarters of the day is taken up at the clinic waiting to register, then see doctor, then take number, then wait at pharmacy, then queue at payments counter. It leaves him completely exhausted but what to do, <strong>there are MANY foreign workers hogging those queues too.<br></strong><br>Worse, his medical fees and medication cost almost $200 a month after the so-called government subsidy. As a retiree, it is money he barely has despite being CPF-rich. Being in the sandwiched class, I feel the strain. It’s worse during months when any of my children become sick and needs hospitalisation or A&amp;E service or start of the school year when we have to buy new uniforms, books etc. Already my children miss out on school overseas trips because we cannot afford. I feel bad for <strong>my children being excluded in our education system in this way just because we are not rich.<br></strong><br>4. Both my husband and I are under-employed. <strong>He was retrenched from his job at the bank 8 years ago and put on contract work for the next 5 years before completely losing that as well. Today, in his late 40s, he does odd jobs for a contractor neighbour. Our income is unstable despite both of us being graduates (degrees attained during the time government was calling for us to upgrade).<br></strong><br><strong>I worry my own job could go anytime too and have agreed to pay cuts over the years so as not to lose the job.</strong> <strong>In other first world countries, labour laws protect employees from unreasonable pay cuts. Our labour laws here are made for employers and the big guns.</strong> Isn’t it the little people who need the protection?<br><br>5. <strong>Our pay has been decreasing but essential services like electricity/water bill, transport keep increasing.</strong><br><br>We work hard, are not uneducated or fussy but still find ourselves in such stressful circumstances. That’s what I am angry!</p>
