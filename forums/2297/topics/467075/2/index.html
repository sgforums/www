                  <div>I was in a boy's school during secondary school and the legacy of that is still apparent today among my friends. Some are still single. A disproportional number is effeminate and some are homosexual. Now I want to emphasize that I'm not making a judgement of these 3 status. I have good friends from all 3 groups. But I want to make that point that not coming into contact and learning how to interact with the other half of the world during your teenage, formative years can be detrimental. I have seen how because there is no female peers for modeling feminine behaviour, some guys lapse into more girly behaviour without realising it. Some are single because they never did learn how to talk/deal/properly interact with the female counterparts way into adulthoold while a few became convinced they are homosexual because of their 'poor luck' with women despite their eligibility. So I personally believe boys and girls should mix for healthy mental growth and social development.</div><br><br>

              <p>In 2009 Susannah Cahalan was a healthy 24-year-old reporter at the New York Post, one of the country's oldest newspapers, when she suddenly developed a range of worrying symptoms. Her left hand went numb, paranoid thoughts obsessed her mind, and migraines and stomachaches beset her body. Initially diagnosed with mononucleosis, Cahalan continued to grow worse, eventually suffering a series of near-fatal seizures, psychosis, and a gradual loss of brain function. She ended up at New York University's Langone Medical Center, where a team of doctors, led by neurologist Souhel Najjar, diagnosed her with a disease that had been discovered only two years earlier: NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. In this excerpt Cahalan tells the story of how University of Pennsylvania neuro-oncologist Josep Dalmau first identified the disorder.</p>

              <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin laughed off a protest against him by topless women in Germany on Monday, joking that he liked what he had seen while sharply rebuffing German criticism of his human rights record.</p>
              <p>Three members of the women's rights group Femen, which has staged protests against Russia's detention of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot around Europe, disrupted his visit to a trade fair in the German city of Hanover focusing on Russian business.</p>
              <p>They stripped to the waist and shouted slogans calling the Russian leader a "dictator" before being covered up and bundled away by security men.</p>
              <p>"Regarding this performance, I liked it," grinned Putin at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding that it had helped to promote the trade fair though he suggested that the security men could have been "gentler" with the girls.</p>
              <p>"I did not catch what they were shouting, I did not even see if they were blondes, brunettes or chestnut-haired ... I don't see anything terrible, though I think ... it is better to be dressed if one wants to discuss political matters."</p>

              <p>Some cases of homosexuality / lesbianism / transexualism, arises because the individual soul had incarnated in so many lifetimes as that paricular sex / gender, that the soul energy becomes predominantly either masculine or feminine (and there's nothing wrong or 'sinful' about that, it's a matter of personal free will and choice), that it could present various difficulties adjusting when incarnating into a physical body of the opposite sex / gender.</p>
              <p>Other cases, however, could be a result of the soul needing / intending, for various karmic reasons and learning purposes, to incarnate into a physical body whose genetics and/or probable early life experiences, would predispose that incarnation towards homosexuality / lesbianism / transexualism. This could well be related to, for instance, if a soul needed / intended the experience of being discriminated against by society (eg. a severely imbalanced racist might choose to incarnate in the next lifetime as a member of the race he discriminated against, to experience and understand both sides; karma is not about punishment, it's about learning), or for the purpose of developing personal strength (eg. to accept oneself even if society doesn't accept you), etc.</p>
              <p>In any case, homosexuality / lesbianism / transexualism, is not regarded by the guides &amp; helpers as anything 'sinful' (morality is a human illlusion in any case), but rather as a karmic experience, opportunity and choice (either for accepting it, or for declining it; either is fine, there is no right or wrong, it is the personal choice that matters).</p>
              <p>While some are hardcore cases due to the overwhelming influence of biological genetics, soul energy or soul karma; there are also many cases (it's a spectrum really) in which the incarnated individual does have the free will (and in many cases, still does to this very moment) during incarnation to choose between heterosexuality / heterosexualism, or to choose homosexuality / lesbianism, or to choose transexualism / transvestitism.</p>
              <p>Again we reiterate : there is no right or wrong, no such thing as 'sin', either choice you choose is fine, because it's your choice. It matters more than you can accept, respect and love yourself, for whatever you choose for yourself.</p>

              <p><strong>Angry Man sold flat to fund daughter Meds Study Overseas but PAP welcomes FT Doctors?<br><br></strong>
              </p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">If NUS reject local talents with good results for their Medical Course then why welcome FT Doctors from ulu Universities and possess questionable capabilities? <br><br>No wonder we are loosing our best talents. After spending all their savings to go attend overseas Universities even when their grades are good enough for local U, would they want to come back to suffer discrimination at the workplace because they are not FTs? This is not unlike the NEP discrimination that led to M'sia loosing their best non bumiputra talents.<br><br>Angry man sells house to finance daughter’s medical studies overseas<br><br>Let me share with you my situation.<br><br>My daughter did fairly well in her ‘A’ level. She got 3As and 1B – B for Physics but scored As for the 2 most important subjects for medicine – Biology and Chemistry.<br><br>She applied to NUS and was rejected. Not even an interview. She has always wanted to be a doctor her whole life. Her studies in Biology and Chemistry were top-notched. She is very self-discipline and we never have problems telling her to do her homework or reminding her to study since young. When NUS rejected her, she cried day and night.<br><br>As parents, how can we see her cry like that? It really breaks our hearts. We then made a family decision and sold our 5-room flat to support her medicine study overseas. We moved back to my parents – imagine, both of us are now in the 50s and we have to live with my parents who are now close to 80s!<br><br>My daughter applied to the overseas universities and guess what, she was accepted by a few: Monash University, University of Western Australia, Imperial College. In the end, we chose University of Western Australia because it’s closer to Singapore and it’s also cheaper to study in Australia than in UK. Still, the tuition fee itself cost me at least A$200K+, not counting room and board. All in, it will be A$300K+. I’m glad to see her happily studying medicine in Australia now.<br><br>Reading this article (‘Doctor-to-population ratio improved through massive FT recruitment‘) even angers me further. Why are we taking in foreign doctors when we do not even want to give our own Singaporeans a chance? And to think that I’ve served NS, for what? Why is the government not taking care of our own people first??? The fact that my daughter was accepted by some of these good universities shows that she is absolutely qualified to study medicine. Furthermore, she is really passionate about it. Why is the government depriving her, our very own people, that opportunity? To add further insults, I’ve read here that these foreign doctors actually graduated from some of these dubious third world universities?<br><br>This is really a big screw up by our government. Instead of investing to train more Singaporeans to become doctors, we are recruiting more foreign doctors. This is totally unacceptable and I might add, a treacherous act by the government!<br><br>I’m actually quite apolitical but this incident of NUS rejecting my daughter to study medicine when other good universities are accepting her, has given me a new perspective. The fact that I have to sell away my house and move back with my parents who are close to 80s really hurts me a lot. At their age, I should be taking care of them and yet, they have to shelter my family! I have one more son, because of his sister’s influence, is more inclined to study biology and medicine. I really don’t know what to do if he decides to also study medicine and NUS rejects him too. I have no more houses to sell. The only left would be by then, I can take out my CPF and use it to finance his overseas study.<br><br>I really curse this government!<br><br>Angry father</div>

              <blockquote class="postcontent restore">When I went to NUS, my friends who didn't get at least B3 in GP had to take an English bridging module, and have to keep retaking it until they have passed it in order to graduate.<br><br>A girl friend had 2As 2Bs but failed GP wasn't even allowed to apply for local uni. <br>So my question is this, why are we giving free scholarship plus living expenses allowance to students particularly from china, despite their brilliant results, when they can't speak a smattering of English? <br><br>I welcome competition yes, but let's compete on fair ground. <br><br>I don't expect government to give us priority but here they are obviously shortchanging its own people. <br><br>Other universities take in foreign students not only because of grades but may also be due to higher school fees. In SG, foreigners come study free and go home. <br><br>I was on a long flight home from USA one day, stop over in HK, a china auntie got on next to me. She couldn't fill up her immigration form. So I helped her. <br><br>I asked her what's address at destination (SG) she said NTU. Her daughter was given a scholarship to study here. She told me bluntly, "your country so small, not even the size of a China city, what if my daughter cannot find job? I wanted her go USA study, but Singapore offer free scholarship, plus easier for me to travel and visit her. I think after she graduate I will tell her go USA to work."<br><br>I almost tore up the immigration sheet. <br><br>I wish our government will grow a heart, two ears and two eyes.<br><br>What I said are all true stories, and I am not xenophobic, I welcome competition and foreigners, I just don't want to be given a wooden stick to fight when others are given swords and shields and I still kena called incompetent for not winning! </blockquote>

              <p>[India] - Toddler girl suffers from enlarged head</p>
              <p>She comes from a poorer rural area, which does not offer healthcare facilities to treat the condition (which has not yet been precisely identified). Thanks to social media and the internet, an expensive private Indian hospital has now offered to examine (and presumably and hopefully, treat for free) this poor toddler girl.</p>

              <p>Excellent movie. Tom Cruise may be scientologically infected, but his heart is in the right place. His recent movies have been getting better and better.</p>
              <p>Oblivion may be, in many ways, his best movie ever. And it includes a non too far fetched alien invasion scenario involving genetic cloning as well.</p>
              <p>Best part of the movie, the emotionally touching, philosophical exploration of the human heart, the soul, sacrifice, love and the choice for the highest destiny for each of our individual existences.</p>
              <p>Go watch it in the cinemas now. Then go get the DVD when its released.</p>

              <p>It's always interesting when spy movies or drama series depict the FBI vs the CIA. And it's been known to have some truth in it (actually, anyone with the minimum understanding of how the intelligence world works, would realize this would be inevitable).</p>

She’s been tracked down by Special Agent Donnelly of the FBI. That’s right, we now have ANOTHER organization trying to close in on Reese! The FBI thinks Reese is a dangerous sociopath who worked for the CIA doing covert operations that the FBI didn’t touch. They think he’s now up in NYC offering his services to the highest bidder – they even have him linked to Elias because Reese saved his bacon back when he thought the guy was just a regular schoolteacher! So now our main event is becoming the FBI vs. the CIA vs. Elias (featuring “HR”) vs. The Five Families vs. Reese &amp; Finch (featuring “The Machine”). Oh, and Root is still out there somewhere.</em></p>
