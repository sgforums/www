              <br><br>
              I am perplexed by some readers' calls for more balanced information on sexuality on the Health Promotion Board's (HPB) website.
              <br><br>
              Our Penal Code criminalises sex between men; positive portrayals of gay relationships are forbidden in mass media; and there is no prohibition on various religions espousing their disapproval of gay relationships. So where is the "imbalance"?
              <br><br>
              In fact, the imbalance lies in the lack of objective, scientific and compassionate information on helping those in need of psychological self-acceptance, without any religious bias.
              <br><br>
              How can anyone possibly fault the HPB if it follows longstanding World Health Organisation guidelines that most of the developed world have adopted when dispensing sexual health advisories?
              <br><br>
              Singapore is not a theocracy and I would like to keep religion and the State separate. If every religion were to have the final say on public policy, what kind of information would non-religiously inclined citizens get on contraception and family planning, for instance?
              <br><br>
              The public space is big enough for everyone to accommodate one other. We should all learn to be tolerant of those who may seem to veer away from our notion of personal morality, and not withhold valuable, life-saving information for "moral" reasons (<i>ironically, religious folks are the ones who are immoral here, in that they are attempting to withhold life-saving information and help from the ones who need such information and help the most</i>).

              Ahn Myong-Chol witnessed many horrors as a North Korean prison camp guard, but few haunt him like the image of guard dogs attacking school children and tearing them to pieces.
              <br><br>
              Ahn, who worked as a prison camp guard for eight years until he fled the country in 1994, recalls the day he saw three dogs get away from their handler and attack children coming back from the camp school.
              <br><br>
              "There were three dogs and they killed five children," the 45-year-old told AFP through a translator.
              <br><br>
              "They killed three of the children right away. The two other children were barely breathing and the guards buried them alive," he said, speaking on the sidelines of a Geneva conference for human rights activists.
              <br><br>
              The next day, instead of putting down the murderous dogs, the guards pet them and fed them special food "as some kind of award," he added with disgust. 
              <br><br>
              "People in the camps are not treated as human beings... They are like flies that can be crushed," said Ahn, his sad eyes framed by steel-rimmed glasses.
              <br><br>
              The former guard is one of many defectors who provided harrowing testimony to a UN-mandated enquiry that last week issued a searing, 400-page indictment of gross human rights abuses in North Korea.
              <br><br>
              After fleeing the country two decades ago, Ahn worked for years at a bank in South Korea but gradually got involved in work denouncing the expansive prison camp system in the isolated nation.
              <br><br>
              Three years ago, he quit his bank job to dedicate all his time to his non-governmental organisation, Free NK Gulag.
              <br><br>
              "It's my life's mission to spread awareness about what is happening in the camps," he said.
              <br><br>
              There are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in North Korea, a nation of 24 million people.
              <br><br>
              Ahn, who today is married with two daughters, knows all too well the brutal mentality of the camp guards.
              <br><br>
              When he, as the son of a high-ranking official, was ushered onto the prestigious path of becoming a guard in 1987, he says he was heavily brainwashed to see all prisoners as "evil".
              <br><br>
              - 'Horrors still happening' --
              <br><br>
              At his first posting at camp 14, north of Pyongyang, he was encouraged to practice his Tae Kwon Do skills on prisoners.
              <br><br>
              And he recalls how guards were urged to shoot any prisoner who might try to escape. 
              <br><br>
              "We were allowed to kill them, and if we brought back their body, they would award us by letting us go study at college," he said.
              <br><br>
              Some guards would send prisoners outside the camp and kill them as escapees to gain access to a college education, he added.
              <br><br>
              Ahn said he had beaten many prisoners but said that, to his knowledge, he had never killed any of them.
              <br><br>
              Although he witnessed numerous executions, starving children, and the effects of extreme torture, it was not until he was promoted to be a driver, transporting soldiers back and forth between camps, that he began to question the system.
              <br><br>
              During his travels he sometimes struck up conversations with prisoners and was astonished to find that "more than 90 percent" of them said they had no idea why they were in the camp.
              <br><br>
              Ahn had stumbled across North Korea's system of throwing generations of the same family into prison camps under guilt-by-association rules.
              <br><br>
              He got a taste of that rule himself. On leave in 1994, he returned home to find that his father had committed suicide after making some drunken, negative remarks about the country's leadership.
              <br><br>
              Ahn's mother, sister and brother were detained and likely sent into camps, although he is not sure what became of them.
              <br><br>
              Though Ahn returned to work, he feared he too would be dragged off. So he drove his truck to the shores of the Du Man River and swam across to China, having to dump the heavy weapons he was carrying to avoid drowning.
              <br><br>
              Once he got involved in the NGO work in South Korea, he was uneasy about meeting former prisoners who had also managed to defect, like Chol Hwan Kang.
              <br><br>
              Kang was sent to Camp 15 -- where Ahn once served -- with his whole family when he was nine and spent 10 years there to repent for the suspected disloyalties of his grandfather. Ahn remembered him from his time as a guard there.
              <br><br>
              But Kang, like most survivors, understood he had not chosen his job and had accepted his plea for forgiveness.
              <br><br>
              "He met me with a gentle handshake," Ahn said.
              <br><br>
              Last week's UN report was vital to spreading awareness about the reality of the camps, Ahn said, comparing what is happening there to the Soviet-era Gulags.
              <br><br>
              "The difference is that in North Korea we are still talking in the present tense. These horrors are still happening," he said.

              Problem with such a law, is the potential for abuse leading to permanent damage (as opposed to non-Sharia/Syariah laws that call for incarceration). For instance, a jealous ex-girlfriend with connections sets up the ex-boyfriend's current girlfriend accusing her of theft, and the (innocent) current girlfriend gets her hands chopped off. Etc.

              <br><br>
              Investik8 - Investigative Journalist - Eden: a sex slaveâ€™s story
              <br><br>
              Wearing just their underwear, the girls line up with their backs to the wall, arms by their side, heads down, frozen to the spot. They dare not move.
              <br><br>
              Their captors walk up and down the line â€“ picking them seemingly at random and tapping them on the shoulder â€“ â€˜You, you, you and youâ€¦ come with meâ€™.
              <br><br>
              In the back of a warehouse truck, they are driven for miles across the scorching Nevada desert until they reach a hotel. There, they are forced to have sex with up to 25 men one after the other.
              <br><br>
              This was life for Korean-born American Chong Kim who, at 19 years old, was sold as a domestic sex slave in 1994 to Russian gangsters and held captive for more than two years.
              <br><br>
              â€œThe clients never came to the warehouse,â€� she recalled â€œThat was just where we slept. There was nothing there but bed mats on the floor and we would just lay there.
              <br><br>
              â€œThey would give us colouring books with fat crayons and we would colour. But then we would hear the knock outside the storage unit doors and have to all line up.
              <br><br>
              â€œIf you were chosen, we would get in the truck and there would be a gallon of water between us. You could tell it was hot outside because it was made out of metal aluminium and it was too hot to touch.
              <br><br>
              â€œWe were sweating when we got to the room and weâ€™d get a make up bag and toiletries and theyâ€™d say â€˜you have ten minutes to take a showerâ€™. They would have lingerie laying on the bed.
              <br><br>
              â€œI remember sitting in the shower because it felt so good to be in water that I just cried. When I was done I had to basically lay in bed naked waiting for the customer to come in.â€�
              <br><br>
              About half of her clients were American and others were Russian but some had accents she wasnâ€™t familiar with â€“ they could have been British, Australian or European, she couldnâ€™t tell.
              <br><br>
              â€œThey all had one hour to spend time with us but most of the time they didnâ€™t spend the whole hour, they just came in, raped us and then they would leave. And then we had to shower for the next client. That was pretty much our day.â€�
              <br><br>
              The traffickers would take up to 15 girls to â€˜serviceâ€™ hundreds of men in one day.
              <br><br>
              â€œOne time, I could hear the screaming on the other side of the hotel room and I could tell another girl was being raped and she was screaming and it was really, really hard for me to concentrate.
              <br><br>
              â€œAnd when we got done throughout the day we would get so sore that I remember asking for a bag of ice and had to put it between my legs because it hurt so much.â€�
              <br><br>
              Sometimes the girls were returned to the warehouse, sometimes they didnâ€™t. Any attempts at fighting back or escaping were met with brutal beatings and torture.
              <br><br>
              â€œI tried to escape numerous times,â€� says Chong, now 38. â€œI remember one time the warehouse truck stopped somewhere and we had to get out to get changed and use the bathroom and thatâ€™s when I started running.
              <br><br>
              â€œWe were in the middle of the desert and I didnâ€™t know where I was. The next thing I knew, I had what I think was a crowbar hit me in the back of the head. When I woke up, I was tortured. I was on a meat hook and beaten like a piÃ±ata. Other times they would bust both my knee caps or they would put me in a tub of ice naked.â€�
              <br><br>
              As time went on, she would witness as much cruelty as she was subjected to and she would regularly be transported with up to 50 other girls from warehouse to warehouse, state to state.
              <br><br>
              The girls were all ages and ethnicities, some having being trafficked through Europe or Russia before ending up in the USA.
              <br><br>
              â€œI witnessed murders, tortures, sodomy, rape,â€� she says quietly. â€œThe youngest girl I saw there was just seven years old. They tied me down and made me watch her get raped by 12 adult men. It made me so sick to my stomach. I still see her face in my dreams.â€�
              <br><br>
              Forcefully injected with heroin, meth and cocaine and held in a dark, windowless warehouse, time ceased to exist.
              <br><br>
              â€œI never knew what time it was because we never had a window to look out. There were times when it would feel like forever,â€� she said.
              <br><br>
              â€œI turned into a puppet, I got tired of fighting back. There were moments where I asked for help and nobody helped me. The traffickers would say, â€˜see you are nothing, that is why nobody is helping youâ€™.
              <br><br>
              â€œWe had no military guys or swat teams to come in and break down the doors and rescue us, that was a dream.â€�
              <br><br>
              Her only option was to gain the trust of her traffickers and rise up the ranks to find a way to escape.
              <br><br>
              Jamie Chung in the movie â€˜Edenâ€™
              <br><br>
              â€œI felt that I would never get out and the other part of me was getting angry,â€� she says. â€œI kept looking at my situation, all the times I tried to escape I was unsuccessful. And so I wanted to know where were these people coming from, where were the parents? Why wasnâ€™t anyone looking for them? And so the only way I thought at that time was to act like I was going to be a part of them so I could find out all of their secrets.
              <br><br>
              â€œI approached the head trafficker and I said â€˜I could be the Madam, I am a woman, I can use my feminine charms and to manipulate and to get more girls. And I can help you make more moneyâ€™.â€�
              <br><br>
              After gaining their trust, she soon found herself in the terrible position of recruiting young girls into sex slavery, just two years after the very same thing happened to her.
              <br><br>
              She was recruited into sex slavery in 1994 by the person she believed to be her boyfriend.
              <br><br>
              While studying Law at a technical college in Dallas, Chong met a man claiming to be a soldier in a bar who she knew as Keith, only later discovering that was not his real name.
              <br><br>
              She described him as chivalrous, adding: â€œHe would say to me â€˜you should smile more often you knowâ€™, he was very, very sleek. Thatâ€™s what makes him poisonous.â€�
              <br><br>
              Estranged from her family, Chong was vulnerable and looking for her â€˜Prince Charmingâ€™ and he manipulated this to recruit her, she says.
              <br><br>
              â€œItâ€™s like a hunting game, they know how to hunt, they look for them, they watch, they observe. Theyâ€™ll do a round of tests,: says Chong. â€œA man will go to the bar and he will say â€˜who wants to get me a drink?â€™ and the first woman who says â€˜I willâ€™ without knowing him gives him the signal that she will do anything for him.â€�
              <br><br>
              After just two months of dating, he drove her to an abandoned house in Oklahoma telling her that he needed to help a homeless friend.
              <br><br>
              â€œI said Iâ€™d wait in the car and thatâ€™s when he grabbed me by the neck and said â€˜youâ€™re going to do as I sayâ€™. And my first thought was â€˜what did I do wrong?â€™â€�
              <br><br>
              He chained her up in the basement and burned her passport and documents. There, she was raped and tortured before she was transported to the warehouse somewhere in an Indian reservation in Nevada.
              <br><br>
              â€œWhen I was taken to the storage unit and I saw the other girls, I was just shocked.â€� She says. â€œIt was like a giant factory of children. And I literally thought I was in a different country because I was so Americanised that I thought it canâ€™t be here.â€�
              <br><br>
              But when she became a Madam she learned about the scale of the operation and the so-called respectable people who were her customers.
              <br><br>
              â€œI learned about the corruption â€“ there were politicians, judges, police officers that would buy a girl and pay the agency to keep quiet,â€� she says. â€œIt scared me so much that I decided I need to run away.â€�
              <br><br>
              Her opportunity to escape came in 1997 when she was staying in a wealthy clientâ€™s hotel in a casino in Vegas.
              <br><br>
              â€œI remembered watching a James Bond movie with my father and heâ€™d crawled out through the vent to escape,â€� she says. â€œI remember the vent being big enough and I thought â€˜you know, itâ€™s worth a try!â€™â€�
              <br><br>
              Making her way outside the building, a man pulled up in his car and spotted her escaping still wearing her lingerie.
              <br><br>
              â€œMy heart was beating so fast,â€� she says, â€œI got in the car and took off my Stiletto shoes and beat him over the head. He was unconscious, I didnâ€™t kill him. And I moved his body out and I stole his vehicle.â€�
              <br><br>
              For many years after her escape, she â€œlived like a hoboâ€� fearful that her kidnappers would trace her if she used her social security number. After seeking help from a womenâ€™s shelter and with intense therapy, she slowly started to rebuild her life.

              Her incredible story is now the subject of an independent film to be released this Friday (July 19) in selected UK cinemas, starring Hollywood star Jamie Chung.
              <br><br>
              And today, mum-of-one Chong shares her story to educate law enforcement personnel and attorneys all over the USA.
              <br><br>
              Her advocacy work for victims has been commended by campaigners including Academy Award winning actress Emma Thompson.
              <br><br>
              But despite helping scores of victims, Chong feels emotionally conflicted about her time as a Madam working for the very people that abused, raped and tortured her.
              <br><br>
              â€œI worry about being judged,â€� she says. â€œEven when I was a Madam I was still being held as a slave. I never kept any money, I was being monitored all the time.
              <br><br>
              â€œThereâ€™s not a moment I donâ€™t think about the girls, their faces, their tears I only hope that they were able to be rescued or escaped.â€�
              <br><br>
              Chong is working with private investigators and members of the FBI to give as much information as possible to help bring her traffickers to justice.
              <br><br>
              But the organised criminals, who were also involved in drugs, arms and money laundering, were clever enough to use false names and move the girls from site to site to avoid being traced.
              <br><br>
              But by telling her story, Chong is speaking up for all survivors of sex trafficking, she says.
              <br><br>
              â€œI have people who say â€˜Iâ€™m sorry this happened to youâ€™ and I say donâ€™t tell me youâ€™re sorry, tell me that youâ€™re angry and you want to do something.
              <br><br>
              â€œThere are so many of these men who come to different countries whether it is in the UK, South East Asia or America and their intention is for paid rape. And the womanâ€™s voices will always remain silent as long as the law enables these predators. So we need to find a way to say â€˜No more.â€™â€�

              So last night after my gig in Sentosa while waiting for my band mates to pick me up at the taxi stand, I witnessed an very obnoxious guy and friends (one girl, one guy) hi jack a limo cab and shout in the most demeaning way to the cab driver and limo service personnel. Complaining about the $43 per trip fee of the limo. And telling the limo service staff, " you are MY bitch!" repeatedly. 
               So as I was leaving to jump into friend's car, I told him what he's doing is not cool and he didn't have the right to talk to people like that. Angry guy started verbally abusing me with vulgarities and chasing after me as I made my way to the car. His female friend soon got out of the limo they were holding hostage and tried to get violent with me using a beer bottle she had in her hand. Which landed on my best friend, Munir Alsagoff's nose while he was trying to retrain her. My other band mate and friend jumped out to stop her. While my friends were trying to restrain her, angry guy came up to the car (which I was already in) and punched me in my face and gave me a bloody nose. Which his response to was, " why did you punch yourself?" After an entire episode of verbally abusing me with names like bitch, cunt, mother fucker, racist, slut, when he saw that he had made me bleed he showed no remorse. Even as I announced I was gonna call 999 right away. I gave my details to the police and went to hospital for x ray etc in an ambulance. The massive bleeding from my nose only stopped late this morning. And half my face is tender and swollen. 
               So boys and girls, he's still out there. And to get some justice done, I have since filed a police report hoping the police will take action against him, or I'll have to engage a lawyer to file a civil suit against him which will take time. Watch out for this angry guy, AARON JEREMIEJCZYK.
