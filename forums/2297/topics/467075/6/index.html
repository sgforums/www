              <div>
              <p><strong>Confession pages on facebook are now the rage. Here's STOMP's choice of the confession of the day.</strong><br><br>Today's confession is written by a graduating member of SMU's class of 2013 who was thrust unexpectedly into fatherhood at 19. <br><br>Here is the confession in full:<br><br>"Today is my daughter's birthday. Yes you heard me. I'm not kidding you. I am a Singapore citizen, 25 years of age, an SMU graduate from the class of 2013... and I made a baby. Exactly 6 years ago, Little J came into the world. Boy, it has been the craziest six years of my life.<br><br>"Back in my school days, I made a costly mistake. Without intending to, I made a senior girl pregnant. At that time, Big J had already graduated and was waiting for university while I was still in school. Big J and I were both hot-blooded teenagers, fascinated with each other's bodies and without a care for the world. <br><br>"When the news came, our worlds turned upside down. Our relationship even turned sour, and there was a lot of blaming each other and hard feelings.<br><br>"I started out being unable to accept the truth, being angry with the whole world and blaming every one for my misery. However, I still had to do something about the baby. So, the arrangement was that Big J's family, being extremely wealthy and generous, would hire caretakers to take care of Little J until after my NS. <br><br>Then, I would officially take over and be responsible to bring her up and provide for her. Unwilling as I was, I did not wish to let a child be denied of care from a biological parents. I know that kind of pain because my father left my family.<br><br>"The kid was a constant reminder of my mistake, each time I set my eyes upon her. During my university days, taking care of her was crazy. Caring for a child is extremely effortful meticulous work that requires a hell lot of time and attention. I had to learn all the nitty gritty things parents identify with, often getting my hands busy and dirty. <br><br>"I was often impatient with her for "learning too slowly" or "causing trouble for nothing", but it was not her fault. I had spells of bad temper and was always irritable. It was difficult. I studied at SMU while I worked part time in town because I received little support from a family that is financially tight. <br><br>"Having a babysitter helps a lot but it's far from enough for a child's needs, and not to mention it's expensive. The rest of my time and space was pretty much devoted to Little J. You just can't go away from a child for too long, a parent's absence severely affects her growth and well-being. I had to give up a lot of the stuff you guys do - freshmen camps, CCAs, OCSPs, hanging out with friends, partying etcetera. <br><br>"It felt painful to be punished as an adult for one dumb mistake you made when you were a teenager... and live with that punishment forever.<br><br>"However, there came some turning points and defining moments. Thank God for these things, otherwise I would be the worst person on Earth. Those were times I realized the joy of being a father, discovered my soft side with her help, and grew to love her more and more:<br><br>1) When she learnt her first words after blabbering baby talk for so long.<br>2) When she called me "papa"<br>3) When she could finally finish a conversation with me<br>4) When she learnt how to stand up and walk on her own<br>5) When she injured herself and ran into my arms for comfort<br>6) When she was awarded the most outstanding student in pre-school<br>7) When she showed great character and stuck by her little friend who was being laughed at and bullied<br>8) When she wrote me an essay about her family and I was the "hero" in the story<br>9) When she caught a rare breed of flu and spent a week in hospital, making me the most anxious person I've ever been<br>10) When she folded a paper heart for me, as a Fathers' Day gift.<br>11) When she was happy, bouncing around and just being herself<br>12) When she waited at the door, waiting for me to come home to tell me something<br><br>"And with that, Little J helped me change to become more patient, tender-loving, thoughtful, down to earth and responsible.<br><br>"Time flies. I can't believe Little J will enrol in primary school real soon. Today, I am a proud father of a lovely girl who loves to help others and go to church. I also very unbelievably secured a well-paying job (too good for someone with sub 3 GPA) that could give me a lot of financial assurance and allow me to do what I love. <br><br>"Even better, Little J will have both her biological parents because Big J and I are now engaged. I don't know exactly how it happened, but somehow we only fell in love after the birth of Little J. Oh by the way, she graduated from SMU too. Hey man, I honestly feel like the luckiest man on Earth.<br><br>"What I have got to say to you who are reading this? If you screw up, no doubt you have to bear the consequences. But it is not the end of the world. Be responsible and learn from mistakes. You never know where it brings you, or who you become. To those who are sad with low GPAs, or feel that life is really tough on you, or face the situation with a child made by accident, I hope my story encourages you. Fight on, rock on, you guys can do it if I can do it. God bless you."</p>

              <p>In my previous commentary, I neglected to mention perhaps one of the most relevant group in the CHC case : disgruntled (and often, extremely upset) ex-CHC members. This group is far more vocal and dangerous (to CHC) than any rival church group.</p>
              <p>Eg#1</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I attended CHC for 8 years from 2000 when the church was still at the old Hollywood theatre. Along the way, I was "promoted" to Ministry Member level, and was also a cell group helper (kind of like an asst CGL) at one point in time. The spiritual atmosphere and culture was very strong back then, and people's passion and heart for God was really palpable. Everyone called Sun "Pastor Sun", and even on the church bulletin, she was known as Reverend Ho Yeow Sun.<br><br>Things started to change when Sun Ho launched her music career in 2003. From the start, it sounded like a good idea to use secular music as a means to reach the unsaved. I mean, who doesn't listen to pop music. All the members were "encouraged" to buy her CDs and I know of members who bought 10, 20 CDs to give away to their friends and family. She also started holding concerts in Taiwan, where she would give her testimony and Kong Hee would preach for 10 minutes followed by a salvation call. The church started labelling her concerts as mission trips, and members would sign up in droves to go overseas as volunteers for her concerts. Just so you know, the traveling and expenses were borne by the members, not by the church. What a way to get free labour, huh?<br><br>The church back peddled, and insisted Sun was never a pastor, but rather a counselor. The church justified this by saying that if non-Christians knew that she was a pastor (like, duh?), they would not be receptive to her/music. This was the beginning of CHC's obsession about the so called marketplace theology, and Kong Hee started to develop the his Cultural Mandate which does not have a biblical basis, and was never the focus of Jesus's work. In doing so, he erroneously twisting scripture to suit his means. One example in point: he based the so called Crossover Project on a single verse taken out of context: "... And He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." - Luke 8:22<br><br>The description of a physical crossing from one side of the lake to the other became a justification for the church and Sun to "cross over" into secular music. The church starting to ask its members not to call its pastors and leaders Brother or Sister so-and-so (a practice prevalent during the church's early days) in public. I found that to be hypocritical - here you have church leaders basically saying "It's okay to be two-faced.".<br><br>The more CHC focused on the Crossover project and Cultural Mandate, the less it focused on Jesus and the gospel. From the beginning, the pressure to conform was very strong and herd mentality kicked in. The church used peer pressure very successfully to get people to give to the building fund... from getting people to pledge and using testimonies. If you know a little about psychology, you'll know what I mean. I remembered people giving their hearts out for the Jurong West building. Never once, were members informed that monies from the Building Fund were used to fund Sun Ho's career, and certainly not about monies being invested in Xtron or Firna.<br><br>I felt very strongly that the church was headed in a very wrong direction and left in Jan 2008 before the scandal broke. I never regretted my decision to leave, and there are a lot more stories that I don't have the space nor time to go in to detail here. But suffice to say, CHC and its pastors have lost it. They have twisted and traded the gospel for another, and the astounding thing is that, they still believe they are doing the right thing. That, I think, is probably the saddest thing.  </p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>How many of us EMs remember this Straw Poll meeting held in March 2010 after COC began investigations?<br><br>Let me quote Pastor Kong word for word:<br><br>"So I mean Sun is not just a a a new girl that’s starting out. I mean she’s a co-founder. You know… she’s my wife. She co-founded the church. So during the AGM of 27 April 2003, together with our auditor, we informed the members very clearly, very clearly, that Sun’s Crossover project was sponsored by the Hanafi family and other various individuals, not by City Harvest. If you remember we even showed a video. That was made very clear back then."<br><br>Well now we know he lied when he said "not by City Harvest". Remember he said this on 28 March 2010. He lied to us with a straight face.</p>

              <p>This is one of the saddest stories in recent times and despite my best attempts not to politicise things that have no basis to do so, I went berserk when I saw the photos of the 4 clowns in grassroots attire at the front door of their house and realised that these arseholes were trying to make political capital of someone's misfortune. <br><br>Now which arsehole told the nation that "no gets left behind". Tell that to Rebecca and Gabriel Loh. No help, no hope and reliant on $1,000 every month which the grandmother earned to support 3 mouths, pay medical bills and a young mother who could not work as she had to take care of her son who had frail legs and a failed liver. And the it only a few days ago we found a Sg government civil servant forking out Sg$10 milion to buy an apartment. No, it was not the CEO of a major business but a fucking civil servant of a tiny island that was supposed to be doomed it did not bring 6.9m people real quick. <br><br>Where were the 4 fucking grassroots clowns in uniform before the Gabriel left the world. And which idiot suggested sending the 4 clowns to the house. And why in uniform. The decent thing was to send an empathic individual to make discrete inquiries about any help need. Were the uniforms and the numbers to show the world that the PAP cares and to play to the public gallery. <br><br>What were the 4 clowns uniform going to do. One hold the tissue box, the second pull out the tissue, the third wipe the tears and the fourth one disposes of the tissue. You can't make this up. Reminds me of 2004 when then defeated Potong Pasir Clown Sitoh for political capital began the hunt for the missing 9 year old Filipino girl and made the papers.</p>

              <p>May years ago, I was fated to meet a young mum who could not cope with her young baby and killed the child. The father a useless prick at that time was partying at a nightspot. It was a sad story. I subsequently learnt there were some others like her. The strain, the pressure and they snap. Nothing about greed, envy or any of the known vices and sins. Something frayed and it gave way. <br><br>This is young lady who at the age of 22 ended up with a child with such disability and for 9 years looked after him. Eye witnesses tell the story of the mum who would use a pram to bring him out and that she could not say no to him. She did not hide him, neither did she dump him with her mum and went galavanting. I also read that she climbed to the ledge first and then retreated and brought her son out. I can only speculate she wanted to end it all for her and her son. <br><br>Unlike the lady that had the retarded child, this poor girl had no other child or children to give her a sliver of hope. A struggle with a possible good outcome. <br><br>To me both are victims. <br><br>You know the west. There are social as well as volunteer help when someone turns up once a week to look after a child like that so that a mum like her gets 12 hours of respite each week. I wonder if a wealthy country where a civil servant can buy a $10million home can afford to do the same for the less fortunate. <br><br>ps. I take away nothing from the Teluk Kurau lady who raised the family in such a condition. These are the heroes and heroines that makes life worthwhile.</p>

Madam Lim was a victim of abuse. Her ex-husband routinely forced her to have sex.<br><br>It was years before she finally left him. Not least because many were incredulous when she said that he raped her. They simply didn't understand that a married woman can refuse to have sex.<br><br>"Friends, even my own mother, told me that there was no such thing as a husband raping his wife. Some even asked me why I bothered to get married if I hated to have sex," she tells The New Paper on Sunday.<br><br>"But even though living with a monster who raped me was a life of hell, for a while, I thought it was better than living without any financial stability.<br><br>"I was lucky that I had a few good friends and counsellors who supported me. Had it not been for them, I don't think I could have walked out of this low point in my life."<br><br>Madam Lim, 36, and her son, who turns six next month, now live with her mother.<br><br>"It took me so long before I could accept my little baby and start to love him," she says of the child, who is sitting quietly in a corner of the four-room HDB flat, playing with his handheld game.<br><br>She looks in his direction, then says: "I struggled for so long, trying to decide if I wanted to keep a child, who was conceived in rape, with me."<br><br>During her first interview with this newspaper in 2007, Madam Lim did not behave like the typical mum. The chilly distance she set up between her and the then five-month-old baby was apparent.<br><br>She hardly looked at him and did not pick him up, not even when he cried.<br><br>The baby was the result of one of those forced trysts, where her then-husband of six years would force himself on her.<br><br>They had courted for two years before marrying.<br><br>Madam Lim had confessed that she felt hatred and shame over the marital rape - and that the baby was a constant reminder of that.<br><br>She had been raped even though she had a personal protection order from a court to stop her ex-husband's sexual assaults.<br><br>She recalls those days when she continued to live with him and share the same bed: "I really loved my husband despite the rapes. I just didn't enjoy the sex".<br><br>As a clerk, she didn't earn much. "I was frightened of living life alone. Really terrified by the thought of it. I didn't want to walk out of my comfort zone."<br><br>It got worse when she lost her job - she had been taking medical leave constantly and not turning up at work on occasions because she suffered from depression.<br><br>"After I lost my job, I became even more unwilling to leave him.<br><br>"He also threatened to cut off all allowances."<br><br>Her ex-husband, who is 10 years older than her, runs a provision store. Madam Lim remains grateful to her former counsellor.<br><br>"If not for her, I would not have taken the steps to rebuild my life. Even when she left and passed my case on to another counsellor, she'd still keep in touch with me to see how I was faring."<br><br>She filed for divorce in 2010.<br><br>"I just didn't enjoy sex. If I had a choice, I'd avoid it completely. It was very difficult for me. I'd feel so tense before it and depressed after," she recalls.<br><br>Madam Lim's aversion to sex took a toll on her relationship with her ex-husband, whom she says was otherwise "not a bad person". "It's just that after a while, he got mad whenever I refused to have sex."<br><br>She shares that during their marriage, he had a fling with one of his workers.<br><br>"In some ways, I couldn't really blame him. I was the one who pushed him away."<br><br>It was during one such confrontation that things got out of hand and Madam Lim's ex-husband turned violent.<br><br>She recalls: "We were shouting and calling each other all kinds of ugly names, and then I called him a sex pervert.<br><br>"I could see the fury in his eyes and for a moment, I thought he'd kill me."<br><br>"I tried to run away, but he grabbed my hair and the next thing I knew, his fist was in my mouth."<br><br>He broke two of her teeth with one punch.<br><br>"I think he was stunned when he realised what he had done, and he kept saying he was sorry."<br><br>Two months later, he came home one night and told her that he'd let her go.<br><br>Madam Lim says: "Happy and relieved as I was, it took me another month before I actually did anything.<br><br>"I wasn't confident I could survive financially without him."<br><br>It didn't help that her mother back then had insisted it was her fault for "failing to do my duty as a wife".<br><br>"My mother is the traditional type who believed that a woman's place was at home, taking care of her husband and children," says Madam Lim.<br><br>She now works as an accounts clerk and has recently started on a new relationship, but declines to give more details. "I want to take it one step at a time."<br><br>She knows that her ex-husband also has another woman in his life.<br><br>"We don't talk to each other unless it's necessary, like when he comes to pick up our son for weekly visits.<br><br>"But I can see a hint of the man I fell in love with and I know it means he's happy."<br><br>She adds: "And because of this, I can finally let go of my guilty feelings."</p>

The chaos ended only after the police arrived 10 minutes later.<br><br>Says Mr Mohamed (we're not using his full name to protect the identity of his child), 40, who works in the hospitality industry: "Luckily, the four slash wounds - one on my left arm and three on my back - were superficial ones. They left no scars."<br><br>The baby was unhurt.<br><br>While the victims in most abuse cases are women, Mr Mohamed suffered beatings and verbal attacks from his wife for the 13 years they were together.<br><br>Theirs was a tumultuous relationship.<br><br>He thrice married and divorced the same woman - but that knife attack was the last straw.<br><br>He took out a personal protection order against her. He calls it a "drastic but necessary" move to protect his child and maintain his sanity.<br><br>Years after the incident, Mr Mohamed says it's still difficult for him to tell anyone that he had been physically and verbally abused.<br><br>"There are some things I'd rather not recall."<br><br>For instance, she often punched and hit him. Once, she even broke his nose. And it's not as though he is incapable of defending himself.<br><br>At 1.7m tall, the broad-shouldered man has the physique of a soldier.<br><br>His petite ex-wife stands a full head shorter. A few weeks before the knife incident, Mr Mohamed was "ambushed" by his ex-wife at the airport carpark after he returned from a business trip.<br><br>He was with a female friend.<br><br>His ex-wife began hurling vulgarities at them. And without any warning, she threw a punch that broke his nose.<br><br>He adds: "I bled all over my shirt. I could have done some serious damage to her, but I didn't retaliate.<br><br>"At that time, she had no place to stay and we just had our child."<br><br>He also lost count of the number of times he was called "womaniser" or "unfaithful".<br><br>Mr Mohamed, who first married her in 1998, says: "She made me feel guilty for the slightest infractions like looking at my maid or meeting my friends.<br><br>"I was once accused of cheating when I slipped out of my home to go for a short jog."<br><br>She would also scold him incessantly and belittle his ability to provide for the family.<br><br>As a result, he became withdrawn, avoiding friends and family.<br><br>"I distanced myself from friends because I was too tired of explaining to her where I was going each time. I turned into a loner.<br><br>"I was ashamed. I couldn't tell anyone what was going on."<br><br>In addition, he was trying to save his marriage. Mr Mohamed says he never laid a hand on her, though they did get into arguments on occasion.<br><br>Why did he tolerate the unhealthy relationship for so long?<br><br>He says: "There's something about her that I find lacking in other women. Maybe I truly loved her. That's why I always went back to her."<br><br>(<em>Editor's note : Such inexplicable attraction, is really karma : a subconscious recognition of the familiarity with a pre-existing relationship between souls that has continued across multiple lifetimes; the majority of all serious relationships in one's current lifetime, will have had pre-existing histories in previous lifetimes and intermissive periods</em>).<br><br>Even today, his ex-wife - who leads a separate life but shares custody of their three-yearold son - continues to send him hurtful SMSes.<br><br>On Wednesday, Mr Mohamed showed this reporter recent SMSes allegedly from his exwife, whom he last spoke to about a year ago.<br><br>She labels him an "unpredictable lunatic" and a "pervert".<br><br>Another text message reads: "I'm sorry he (their son) has a father like you".<br><br>He says: "I took her abuse.

              <p>Repeating karmic patterns across multiple lifetimes is a common theme (analogy : if you have not yet achieved a satisfactory grade in a particular exam / module / course / issue, you would want to repeat it for the sake of personal growth and gain, even if you're in a different lifetime / school / company / organization in different time periods).</p>
              <p>It would not be surprising if, in a past life in the medieval or renaissance or the roaring twenties (or any other time period in any country) era, he was similarly the son of a fairly wealthy upper middle class baron or  businessman, while she was a princess of sorts, possibly royalty or at least much richer and more powerful than his family was.</p>
              <p>He may have, similarly to today, pined for her superior-class hand in marriage with futility. Such strong emotions, generated over many years of anguish and psychological torment, leaves a strong psychic and karmic footprint, an unresolved issue the soul must continue to work with and balance, in future lifetimes.</p>

              <p>Today's confession features an NUS undergrad who is in love with a girl from a rich family, and he feels inferior trying to woo her although he himself is also quite well-to-do. <br><br>Here is the confession in full:<br><br>"<span>I feel that my life mirrors that of Jay Gatsby.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>The 'Daisy' I love is from Medicine faculty and she comes from a family of bankers who have amassed their fortune for at least 3 to 4 generations. Living at her Nassim Road bungalow, she probably has everything she wants - smart, pretty, rich, with a sophisticated lifestyle. Sometimes I catch her getting chauffeured to school in a Bentley during the mornings I have my breakfast at Starbucks. What a great start to my day!</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>While I on the other hand live in a commonplace semi-detached off Braddell Road. My father is a businessman, and our family earned the money through my parents' hard work and are the noveau riche. While I am aware that I am fortunate that I can drive to school and live relatively comfortably, compared to my "Daisy," it is still not enough for her.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>Before all of you label me as spoilt and insensitive, let me just say that I know that I am very lucky to be in this financial position. But I cannot help but feel inferior when the girl I am trying to woo is living in her palatial home with everything she can ever want.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>Bear in mind that I am just a simple arts student, and the reason why she has not reciprocated my overtures is partly because she is hesitant that I am not up to her standard. I have done everything I can to prove my sincerity, and some of my friends say that I should just find someone else.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>But I cannot help myself. "Daisy" is the world to me and I even saved up my allowance to buy her a Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag because I know she likes collecting them.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>I feel like I am not good enough for her. She is across the bay and I find that even though I stretch out my hands further, she is still being non-committal about our relationship.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>It is as though I have exhausted all my options.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>"<span>What should I do?"</span></p>

              <p>Today's confession comes from an SMU student who admits to being attracted to her current boyfriend because of his bad attitude and arrogance. In fact, the very first time they met, he threw a drink in her face.<br><br>Here is the confession in full:<br><br>"I met my boyfriend in one of the most awkward ways possible.<br><br>"I first saw him in a club. I noticed him because he was really good-looking.<br><br>"He seemed to be drinking alone, and he was chatting with the bartender. I decided to go up to him and get him to buy me a drink.<br><br>"In all honesty, I'm one of those tall (1.72 with no heels), slim and pretty girls. Guys in the club literally queue up to buy me a drink.<br><br>"And if I see a guy whom I really like, I have no problems approaching them and chatting them up.<br><br>"Anyway, I went up to this guy and I talked to him for about five minutes. To my disgust, he still did not offer to buy me a drink.<br><br>"I was wondering if he was gay. I've never met a guy who hasn't offered to buy me a drink in a club when I talk to them.<br><br>I couldn't control myself and I blurted out "Aren't you going to buy me a drink?"<br><br>"He told me "The only person I'm going to spend my money on is myself. If you're going to dream about getting a drink from me, you can just sit there and continue dreaming."<br><br>"I thought he was such an asshole. I ordered my drink and just threw it on his arrogant face.<br><br>"To my horror, he grabbed me by the arm and threw his drink back into my face. I've never been treated like this by any guy before.<br><br>"I wanted to slap him, but then I realised he was standing up. Even with my heels on, he was a lot taller than me.<br><br>"I was pretty afraid that he'd retaliate, which was highly possible, given how ungentlemanly he had demonstrated that he can be.<br><br>"I just rolled my eyes at him and walked away.<br><br>"About two weeks later, while I was clubbing with my girlfriends, I saw him sitting at the exact same spot in the club, talking to the bartender again.<br><br>"I asked one of my girlfriends to go and try to get him to buy her a drink.<br><br>"She prides herself on being able to get a drink from any guy. I wanted to see if it was true, so she went, and she failed.<br><br>"She came back saying "That guy must be gay! He asked me to get lost."<br><br>"I thought it was pretty funny. That guy really looks cute even when he acts like a total jerk.<br><br>"From then on, I started taking special notice of him, not just because he was good looking, but his bad attitude and his arrogance kind of piqued my curiosity.<br><br>"I was wondering to myself, "It must be nice to have a boyfriend like that, because he'd treat me well and he'd treat all the other girls like real nasty", and, "I can totally not worry about other girls throwing themselves at him".<br><br>"And it'd be real cool to show my girlfriends how he treats me really well but treat the rest of them like crap.<br><br>"We met each other at some event, and we eventually got together with each other. But the whole story is too long, maybe I'll post a separate confession on another day."</p>
