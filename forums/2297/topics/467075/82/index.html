              [Malaysia] - A Malaysian Indian speaks out on Malaysian Malays being racist against Malaysian Chinese.<p><i>Fortunately (thanks to LKY) here in Singapore, the Chinese, Malays and Indians have mutual respect and get along just fine, unlike in Malaysia where they each feel victimized by the others for all eternity (there's no way Malaysia's flawed racist policies can ever be undone; ergo, Malaysia will always be screwed).</i></p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>Since the Chinese in Malaysia have no testicles to decisively reprimand a certain Malay minister for his racist rants, let me, an Indian Malaysian, remind them what being a Chinese is about.<br> <br>At the outset, I got help for this article from one originally written by Dr Chan Lui Lee of Melbourne so 90 percent of the wisdom is his but 100 percent of the sarcasm is mine.<br> <br>This is also meant to be a wake-up call for those who threaten everyone else (by using state machinery) and think that the country owes them a living and everyone else is a threat.<br> <br>Just to get the readers into the mood, here's a famous song as a teaser.<br> <br>Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.<br>He wasn't holding nothing back - he let 'em have it all.<br>When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.<br>He said, "This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall.<br>(And I heard him say,)<br>I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done<br>I walk away from trouble when I can<br>Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,<br>And papa, I should hope you understand<br>Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man.<br> <br>- Kenny Rogers<br> <br>Chinese people don't go about bombing, terrorising others and creating religious hatred. They don't enter into a country on the pretext of humanitarian reasons and then, try to take over the country by applying warped ideologies.<br> <br>They don't impose "no go zones" for their hosts and don't demand separate laws for themselves. They don't hatch plots to kill non-believers nor do they harbour or finance such attempts.<br> <br>They live peacefully with everyone on Earth and if you sent them to Mars, they will make it very liveable too. Take along the Indians too, then it would be a thriving technology-spurred economy.</p><p>Why do Chinese succeed in life?<br> <br>Here is why the Chinese are welcomed almost anywhere:<br> <br>1. There are over 1.4 billion Chinese on this earth. They are like (after all, all look the same) carbon copies of each other. You get rid of one, five magically appears (like ballot boxes in some countries).<br> <br>They acknowledge that they are replaceable, they are not particularly 'special'. If you think they are smart, there are a few thousand more people smarter than them. If you think they are strong, there are a few thousand people stronger than them.<br> <br>2. They have been crawling all over this earth for far more centuries that most (except for the other hardy people, the Indians) civilisations. Their DNA is designed for survival. They are like cockroaches. Put them anywhere on earth and they will make a colony and thrive.<br> <br>They survive on anything around and make the best of it. In Klang, they threw pig parts into a broth to feed their coolie lot a 100 years ago and today it's a delicacy. Some keep migrating but others will stay and multiply.<br> <br>3. Nobody cares if they succeed as individuals or not. But their families take pride in knowing they have succeeded. Yes, some will fail. They take nothing for granted. They don't expect privileges to fall on their laps. No one owes them anything.<br> <br>4. They know they have nothing to lose if they try to succeed. They have no fear in trying. That is why Chinese are attracted to gambling. They thrive on taking risks. Winner takes all.<br> <br>5. From young they are taught to count every cent. What they take for granted like money management, is not something other cultures practice at home with their children. (It didn't surprise me as I was like them too - some say I'm more Chinese than most Chinese).<br> <br>But the truth is not all societies or cultures teach their young this set of survival skills because it is considered rude.<br> <br>Yes, most of them can count wonderfully because they are forced to and the logic of money is pounded into them from the beginning of time (when mama tells them how much she has spent on milk and diapers). Nobody lowers the benchmark to allow them to "pass" Mathematics.<br> <br>6. They acknowledge life cycles. They accept that wealth in a family stays for three generations. That, every fourth generation will have to work from scratch. That is, the first generation earns the money from scratch, second generation spends the money on education, third generation gets spoiled and wastes all the inheritance. Then they are back to square one.<br> <br>Some families hang on to their wealth a little longer than most. I'm not sure where Yap Ah Loy's wealth is now but I sure hope his descendants are benefitting from it.<br> <br>7. It is their culture to pressure the next generation to do better than the last. Be smarter. Be stronger. Be faster. Be more righteous. Be more pious. Be more innovative. Be more creative. Be richer. Be everything that you can be in this lifetime. And if you have some money, take it to the next life when you go.<br> <br>8. Their society judges them by their achievements... and they have no choice but to do something worthwhile because Chinese New Year comes around every year and Chinese relatives have no qualms about asking them straight in their face - how much are you making? When was your last promotion? How big is your office? What car do you drive? Where do you stay?</p><p>You have boyfriend? You have girlfriend? When are you getting married? When are you having children? When is the next child? When you getting a boy? Got maid yet? Does your company send you overseas?<br> <br>It never ends... so, they can't stop chasing the illusive train - they are damned to a materialistic society. If you are not Chinese, consider yourself unlucky.<br> <br>9. They have been taught from young that if you have two hands, two feet, two eyes, and a mouth, what are you really doing with them? "People with no hands can do better than you!"<br> <br>Chinese people never beg, they earn their living. They don't expect government contracts, they get it... well, with their hard-earned money. They sometimes buy it but that's economics.<br> <br>10. Ironically, the Chinese also believe in giving back to save their rather materialistic souls. Balance is needed. The more their children succeed in life, the more their parents will give back to society as gratitude for the good fortune bestowed on their children.<br> <br>Yes, that is true. See the Vincent Tans in Malaysia. And that is why Chinese society progresses in all environments.<br> <br>Nobody pities them and they accept that. No one owes them anything and they know that. There are too many of them for charity to reach all of them and they acknowledge that. But that does not stop them from making a better life. Opportunity is as we make of it.<br> <br>So, pardon them if they feel obliged to make a better place for themselves in this country we call home. They are not â€˜puak pendatangâ€™ and it is the same home as you and me. It is in their DNA to seek a more comfortable life. In whichever country they reside in.<br> <br>But if history were to be our teacher, look around this globe. Almost every country has a Chinatown but how many government/countries are 'taken' over by the Chinese people.<br> <br>Don't be afraid of them overwhelming your majority, they are not looking to conquer. China is probably the only major power (besides India) that didn't go on a crusade to further its boundaries and religion.<br> <br>I think their real religion is money and there's no harm in that. The more money they make, the more to go around. Win-win for all.<br> <br>If they have moved away from China and Chinese-governed countries, they are not looking for another country to administer. They are more interested in making money than to run a country, seriously.<br> <br>Their representatives are only there to look after their collective welfare. I don't think a Chinese wants to be prime minister in Malaysia. He'll be better off being a business tycoon for sure.<br> <br>They prefer to blend in and enjoy the fruits of their labour. They enjoy the company of like-minded people of all races. After all, just like you and me, they are only passing through a small period in the history of time... so, use their skills and we can all progress forward together.<br> <br>Calling for a boycott of Chinese-owned business is not only foolish but in the end, self-destructive.<br> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><br>RAMESH RAJARATNAM is more offended than the Chinese by a recent racist rant by a minister and hopes to educate the masses for a win-win situation.<br></p><p>

              That's only Sg$600+. Many cases of ang moh tourists come to Singapore kena seafood restaurant bills of over $1000, and the seafood restaurants blame the unfairly high rentals. REITS is blood money, forcing employers to underpay their employees (and bosses still complain Singaporeans refuse to accept underpaid jobs in F&amp;B and thus ask to employ more foreigners*), and driving consumer prices up where the poor and the middle class suffer.
              <br><br>
              *The thing with foreign talent is (understandably double-standard) Singaporeans have no problems with PAP importing more lowly paid low-skilled foreign workers to take up cleaning and construction jobs, but cry bloody murder when almost all the CEOs of all the Singapore branches of MNCs are foreigners, earning Sg$10 million in annual income (eg. DBS CEO Piyush Gupta, an Indian national, earns over $10 million from Singaporeans every year, while Lee Hsien Loong, who arguably did a lot more for Singaporeans than Piyush Gupta, earns only $1.7 million per year).
              <br><br>
              So PAP says to Singaporeans, "You Singaporeans complain foreigners are taking your jobs, ok fine, we'll reduce intake of foreigners to clear your rubbish, build your condos, and bring you your food, but we can't reduce intake of foreign CEOs and PMETS, or else foreigners will invest their money elsewhere!"

He was incredible; possibly the most driven, most inspired kid Iâ€™d had up to that point. He never missed class, never missed an assignment, never did anything except try to be better than he was when he walked in. But he had a severe learning disability, one that wouldnâ€™t let him process any problem that was designed for anyone more advanced than a first grader. At the end of his eighth-grade year, after Iâ€™d passed out the final report cards and the papers that said whether the students had passed or failed, he stayed around for a moment after Iâ€™d dismissed the class. He waited for everyone to leave. Then he walked up to me. Heâ€™d failed again. He looked me right in my face, blinked his gigantic eyes a few times, then said, â€œMr. Serrano, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair that I failed. I try harder than everyone else. Kids who donâ€™t work as hard as me passed. What do I do?â€� I didnâ€™t have an answer. It felt like Iâ€™d been shoved out of a plane. I didnâ€™t know what to do. All I could think about was not crying, which I wasnâ€™t doing a very good job of. I will remember Vincente forever."</i> - Shea Serrano<br><br><a href="http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/polishing-the-apple-what-dangerous-minds-and-other-movies-get-right-and-wrong-about-teachers/">http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/polishing-the-apple-what-dangerous-minds-and-other-movies-get-right-and-wrong-about-teachers/</a></div>
