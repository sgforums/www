              <p><strong>Unable to afford hospital bills, Hebei man saws off own infected leg<br><br></strong><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><img src="http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/original_images/Oct2013/20131017_hebeiman_internet.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br></strong><br>A man from Hebei, China, took matters into his own hands when the searing pain from a leg ailment became too much to bear.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to a report on China Daily, Zheng Yanliang was diagnosed with arterial thrombosis of the lower limbs in early 2012.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The 47-year-old farmer from Qingyuan county had started to experience bouts of intolerable pain in his abdomen which would travel down to both of his legs, Chinese media reported.<br><br>He soon became no longer able to stand because of the pain, and tests finally showed that all of the arteries in his right leg were completely gone.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Arterial thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot inside an artery, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. It can lead to oxygen deprivation and metabolic products such as lactic acid can accumulate. A larger thrombus causing a much greater obstruction to the blood flow may result in anoxia, the complete deprivation of oxygen and tissue death.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Zheng's condition quickly deteriorated with his legs beginning to fester and maggots were crawling out.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The pain was so intense that he found it hard to concentrate and neighbours could sometimes hear him screaming so loud that they could not sleep, Shanghaiist reported.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The family was too poor too afford the exorbitant fees asked for by local hospitals. "Ideally I needed it to be operated on, but I could not afford it. They just gave me medication. They sent me home to die," Huffington Post quoted him as saying.<br></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444;">
              </span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Finally, at his wit's end, he took a knife and hacksaw and cut off his almost necrotic right leg. Fortunately, because of the thrombosis, there was not much blood during the amputation and he did not suffer from severe blood loss.<br><br></span></p>

              <p>COLUMBIA, SC -- A drunken sheriff's deputy was recorded during a strange and inappropriate altercation when he tried to arrest a female soldier at a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant in Columbia.<br><br>On October 7th, 23-year-old Brittany Ball, a USMC member out of Fort Jackson, was allegedly upset at the restaurant when approached by Richland County Deputy Paul Allen Derrick. She apparently turned down his advances and the two began to argue. <br><br>Derrick, a 17 year veteran, left the restaurant to go retrieve handcuffs and his gun from his vehicle, then returning to try and arrest Ball. He was recorded screaming at her and barking orders as he twisted her arms behind her back. <br><br>Columbia police arrived and saw the video and ordered Derrick release Ball, then took Derrick into custody and charged him with assault and battery<br><br>Sheriff Leon Lott initially backed Derrick, saying that he had authority to make an arrest, suggesting that Ball was "resisting".</p>

              <p>The lady in blue was queuing up waiting for 950 to go back home. This singaporean suddenly cuts her queue, she asked him to queue up behind. He claims that he was in the queue just now. But he went off to buy a drink at the shop nearby and came back. He claims that he is in the queue, nobody saw him. <br><br>Bus came. All in the queue went up the bus, this guy went up too, everyone complaints. He pushed the blue lady down the bus and spitted saliva on her face multiple times.. (estimated +- 10x) , she went to call the control room personnels to scene. This guys hogs the bus refusing to alight, blaming the driver for not moving becos he is waiting for him to alight or police to come. (Meanwhile control room sends for a second bus). He still insist its the drivers fault. Alot of ppl screamed and scolded him for being inconsiderate. He fought back with the whole bus of passengers to 25% of the bus, squeezed his way roughly out again. (Second bus came, back door opens, ppl alights, he rushed to the back door stopping ppl from coming down but failed becos alot of guys pushed him aside. This green lady was unlucky, got stopped by him. He said she scolded him in the bus just now and there is none of her business why she KPO.<br><br>He then spit saliva multiple times on her face. Pushed her from the front. She shouted molest. Molest. Molest. He denied. He spitted saliva at her face multiple times (10+++) again. (My video started recording).<br><br>I stopped recording when my bus came. <br><br><br>He is such a disgrace to be called a singaporean. So uncivilized. Keep spitting at the 2 poor ladies. (In blue and green.) The poor green lady even got molested by him for helping the blue lady out. <br><br>I hope those around that have taken video of the front part and the part after I stopped will post and expose this guy and shame him. Hopefully police will see and use it as prove against him. <br><br>Shame shame.. <br><br>Written by: Sia JianHe (Facebook)</p>

              <p>A man spat in a woman's face twice and hurled verbal abuse at her at Woodlands Interchange after he was told off for cutting the bus queue.</p>
              <p>A video of the incident was posted on facebook by user Sia Jianhe.</p>
              <p>A spokesperson for the Police has responded with regards to the incident, saying:</p>
              <p>“Police attended to the incident which occurred at about 9.40pm on 22 October 2013.</p>
              <p>"Police have interviewed the parties involved and investigations are ongoing.”</p>
              <p>Several STOMPers, <strong>fedup</strong>, <strong>misueki</strong> and <strong>ZOX</strong> alerted STOMP to the video of the incident. </p>
              <p>In the description accompanying the video, it is said that the man also allegedly spat on another woman when he was boarding the bus.</p>
              <p>The man in question had apparently cut the queue of a woman passenger who was waiting for bus service number 950.</p>
              <p>When she asked him to join the queue behind her, he told her that he was initially in the queue earlier but had left to buy a drink at a shop nearby.</p>
              <p>The description read:</p>
              <p>"(The man) claimed that he was in the queue, but nobody saw him.</p>
              <p>"The bus came and everyone in the queue boarded the bus, but this guy spat on the woman multiple times (at least ten times) before he boarded the bus.</p>
              <p>"The lady then called the staff at the control station to the scene.</p>
              <p>"The guy, however, hogs the bus and refuses to alight and blamed the bus driver for not moving.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people at the scene scolded him for being inconsiderate.</p>
              <p>"An old man almost got punched for scolding him, and many other shouted at him for delaying the departure of the bus.</p>
              <p>"He fought back verbally with the bus passengers and squeezed his way out."</p>
              <p>Apparently, when the man got out of the bus, he stopped another woman passenger, a woman who was wearing a green dress.</p>
              <p>He said she scolded him on the bus even though it was none of her business and proceeded to spit at her face multiple times while shouting at her.</p>
              <p>When the man tried boarding a second bus, facebook user Sia Jianhe said he was pushed out of the bus by the passengers inside.</p>
              <p>According to the description, it was a "lucky thing" he did not escape as the police would not have apprehended him then if he did.</p>
              <p>STOMPer fedup commented: "I came across this video clip on my facebook.</p>
              <p>"A man was seen spitting at two ladies at Woodlands Interchange.</p>
              <p>"I pity one of the ladies. He kept spitting in her face and she had to use her hand to wipe all his saliva off while she was on her handphone.</p>
              <p>"This guy really needs to go for an anger management course."</p>

              <p>This boss might still seem stingy in terms of offering (at the end of the episode) to some of his employees a mere "25 cents per hour raise" and "free sports drinks for (only) the 2 hottest months of the year", but nonetheless in terms of his personal gifts to the 4 individual employees featured, still makes him one of the most generous bosses featured in the series.</p>
              <p>Overall a very good episode, with the OTC boss displaying rather touching personal generosity to the 4 individual employees, revealed at the end of the episode.</p>
