              Once Singapore goes down the path of being racist, Singapore will degenerate into another Malaysia. The reason for Singapore's success (thanks to LKY's foresight) is that Singapore is meritocratic, not racist like Malaysia.<p>"Bukit Batok by-election is not about Indian vs Chinese", says Chee Soon Juan</p><p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/bukit-batok-by-election-is-not-about-indian-vs-144845666.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/bukit-batok-by-election-is-not-about-indian-vs-144845666.html</a>

              One of the most common criticisms of atheism has been to the contraryâ€”that denying the existence of a god leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism">moral relativism</a>, leaving one with no moral or ethical foundation, or renders life meaningless and miserable - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Atheism_within_religions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism#Atheism_within_religions</a><p>Au contraire. With moral relativism and free thought, one's mind, heart and soul finally becomes free from religious dogmatic judgments (which are illusions that falsely claim to be the absolute truth ruling over you), and then your life becomes infinitely richer, more beautiful, more loving, more spiritual and more meaningful, as all possibilities then become possible.

There is also something else about listening to the radio with earphones which I will come back to you later. Best gig I got since I was retrenched as an engineer with an MNC. Well it could be worst as I could be guarding an ex-classmate's house from NUS. Anyway back to the radio and earphones. For some reason, it seems to pick up conversations from this man's house. I am not sure if the service technicians fixed it to the wrong frequency but what the hell, its entertainment. And the fun begins late at night at about 9.30pm.</p><p> Him: Babe, can we talk. This is important</p><p> Her: I know what you going to say, remove Desmond right? </p><p> Him: I think its deeper than that. The whole Temasek seems to be a bad idea. You know the Cabinet goes silent when anything with Temasek comes up. Its either fear or resentment. I can't work it out. In the end I will be the one having a monologue. </p><p> Her: Huh. You do realise that nearly everything in Singapore is connected to Temasek. Practically every cabinet minister has some aspect of Temasek that falls within their ambit, from Planes to Trains. From Banks to phones and god knows what else. How can they keep quiet. </p><p> Him: Thats the problem. I got this sense that they think I am not in charge. When Daddy-O was alive and when we had the preliminary cabinet meetings and it was practically no holds barred when it came to Temasek. Even the usual PLPs like Swee Say are silent now. </p><p> Her: You think they know something we don't. </p><p> Him: Cannot be. We got the whole country wired and the Civil Service upper echelon cannot get the same pay outside. </p><p> Her: Why don't you test the waters by suggesting that I will be stepping down. </p><p> Him: Won't work. Remember Chip. They already suspected it was a wayang.

I don't know why I did not think of it before. </p><p> Her: Don't go chomp chomp, standard a bit shaky. Go to Simpang Bedok, I hear it is a happening place. Get the Soup Tulang, heaven, real heaven. </p><p> Him: No go. No need to queue and they come to you while you are seated and they are quick. Exposure time limited. Also mainly Malay food, we need to bringing more of the Chinese in. </p><p> Her: Why don't you go Chomp Chomp, get the food, throw it in the bin and then go to Simpang Bedok. </p><p> Him: You see even food I got no control. </p><p> So Singaporean brother and sisters, this is the sort of things that I pick up the from the Radio. Exciting or not. My wife told me that since I started in this job, my outlook has been positive.

              Following Indonesia's confrontation with China over fishing ships off Indonesia's coast, now Malaysia (because Malaysia owns Sarawak too, not just peninsula Malaysia) is also getting pissed off at China for over 100+ fishing ships off Sarawak's coast. Does China really think it can take on all of South East Asia combined? Hubris! Well, it probably can (militarily), but that'll give USA &amp; allies the excuse to join in to whack China in the name of world peace and stability. China really should watch itself. It's making too many enemies too fast, and China can't count on Russia or North Korea for support (no honor amongst ruffians).<p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/100-chinese-boats-ships/2635994.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/100-chinese-boats-ships/2635994.html</a>

              Check out the photos on the Straits Times webpage. Just this 1-day false bravado "show of force" by North Korea (childishly threatening to bomb the residential house of South Korean female president) already costs millions of dollars in military ammunition. Bear in mind the majority of North Koreans are starving to death from poverty. This is the country in which if you offend Kim Jong Un or his elites, your entire extended family (including your wives, daughters and nieces) will either be executed (if they're lucky) or tortured in hard labor prisons for the rest of their lives.<p>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair to both of them, they both have valid points. While LKY would not have encouraged LKY-sentimentalism, he would also have understood such LKY-sentimentalism is a necessary part of nation building and a cohesive society (across race and religion). So LWL is right in reminding Singaporeans of LKY's unsentimental pragmatism, just as CHK is right in pointing out LWL's post may come across as 'scolding', and hence unappreciative of Singaporeans' sentiments (including respect for LKY), and that she should indeed lighten up.<p><br>Lee Wei Ling :</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/weiling.lee.980/posts/214054645616853">https://www.facebook.com/weiling.lee.980/posts/214054645616853</a></p><p><br>Chia Han Keong :</p><p><img src="http://www.sammyboy.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=26018&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1458979845"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xxb8T88l.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KYxLpjK.png"></p></div>
