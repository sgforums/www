              [Singapore] - Mr Md Ridzwan Azmi, 18, wants to break out of three generations of struggle. His parents are in jail for drug offences. Since birth, he has been raised by his 74-year-old grandmother, Madam Pon Md Nor, and his 85-year-old grandfather, Mr Ahmad Taman. Until this month, Mr Ahmad was the sole breadwinner, earning around $1,500 a month as a security guard. But he has just been diagnosed with lung cancer, and can no longer work.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/teen-hopes-to-break-long-cycle-of-struggle">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/teen-hopes-to-break-long-cycle-of-struggle</a><br><br><br>
              [Singapore] - Mr Leck Wee Nee and his wife Geraldine Chen and their seven children live in a two-room HDB rental flat in Clementi about the size of four parking spaces. Mr Leck is unable to work because of a heart problem and high blood pressure, and his wife stays home to look after the children full-time. Their only income is $1,200 a month from ComCare.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/from-own-5-room-flat-to-2-room-rental">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/from-own-5-room-flat-to-2-room-rental</a><br><br><br>
              [Singapore] - Family of 7 live on $1,300 a month. Some people call sole breadwinners like Mr Ong Leong Hock the "sandwiched class" because they have young children to take care of and elderly parents to support. But Mr Ong, 49, is literally sandwiched between his wife and three daughters (aged 4, 12 and 13) on two beds joined together in a room every night. His family of five would squeeze in a room because the other room in their three-room flat is occupied by his parents. To make ends meet, Mr Ong puts in long hours as a cooked food stall assistant. He starts work at the economical rice stall at the nearby Kovan Hougang market and food centre at 7am and knocks off at 9pm on weekdays. Yet he brings in only $1,300 a month, barely enough to provide for all seven family members. So his 73-year-old mother, until recently, has been working as a cleaner to supplement the household income. Last week, she quit her $1,000 a month cleaning job to help care for her husband, 80, who has lung and heart problems, diabetes and other chronic medical conditions.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-7-live-on-1300-a-month">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/family-of-7-live-on-1300-a-month</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kizilhan shuddered as he recalled the case of one young girl he had met in a refugee camp last August, who suffered burns to over 80 percent of her body. "She had no nose, no ears left," he said, adding that he was even more shocked when he learned what had happened to her. ISIS fighters had held the girl and her sisters for weeks, raping and torturing them, before they escaped. Then one night sleeping in her tent in the refugee camp, the girl dreamt ISIS fighters were outside. In a panic she poured gasoline over herself, lit a match and burnt herself almost to death, hoping it would make her so ugly they would not rape her again. Kizilhan had that girl chartered out immediately for fear she might not survive. She remains in hospital in Germany after more than a dozen operations, and will still need 30 more types of skin and bone surgery.<br><br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/yazidi-women-girls-seek-healing-germany-hell-062440191.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/yazidi-women-girls-seek-healing-germany-hell-062440191.html</a></div>
