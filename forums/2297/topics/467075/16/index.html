              <p>74% of pple earning above 12k are foreigners...</p>
              <div class="content">
              <div id="post_message_1687575"><blockquote class="postcontent restore">Singaporeans made up about 1.3M of the total 2.5M work population. According to the news on Fair Consideration Framework, 95% of Singaporean made below $12K/month, and so, 5% of the Singaporean (65K locals) made $12K/month and above* (“Above-12K-Category”).<br><br>Approximately, top 10% of the total work force (250K people) are in the Above-12K-Category. What that means is 185K foreigners (250K minus 65K) are in the Above-12K-Category (74% of the category)!<br><br>Issues:<br><br>1) The members of Above-12K-Category are typically the hiring managers and bosses of hiring managers of any organisations. Hence, this category is the key direct cause of the hiring malpractice in Singapore. With almost three-quarter of the management and decision category occupied by foreigners, the hiring culture is set to discriminate the locals – a colonial culture.<br><br>Case in point, a direct admission by a foreigner CEO that he would hire many Indian nationals (in the Above-12K-Category) before getting a local. Such practices of course would perpetuate downwards with the direct reports not preferring locals. Many locals PMETs have observed in work places their management’s preferences for non-locals in the higher management category.<br><br>2) The statistics indicates that the local professional managers have either experienced “glass ceiling” and hence not able to break into the Above-12K-Category, or their pays been suppressed for doing the same jobs as the foreigners.<br><br>3) Less the protected elites in the Civil Services, Military, Political offices, GLCs and family’s businesses as well as the property and insurance sales agents, how many Singaporean in the Above-12K-Category are professional managers? It is important to a nation that practices meritocracy to witness their local PMEs progress to their deserving leadership positions as without which the nation of mere workers would be reduced to a colony with wealth and power highly concentrated in the hands of foreigners. Given such minority presence, the local PMEs in this category are vulnerable.<br><br>4) Our NS Men protect the country and these 185K high-income and powerful foreigners, but in return, many are being discriminated and denied fair chance to progress in position and salary in their own country.<br><br>Please do not repeat the myth of “the foreigners doing what the local don’t want to do or can’t do”. There is a gross under-representation in the top 10% – management and decision making – category by local PMEs due to malpractices. No nation not wanting to become colony could possibly permit it.<br><br>Given the effect size the Above-12K-Category has on the overall employment, economics and social well-being of the country, I would postulate that unless the colonial culture and local representation in the Above-12K-Category are fixed, the Fair Consideration Framework is destined to fail.<br><br>So, bro Chuan-Jin, what is the wisdom for missing the one with the smoking guns?<br><br>Local PMET<br><br>* income above $12K/month is uncapped; it could be $12.01K/month, $100K/month like the ministers’, or approx. $1M/month for some CEOs of big public listed companies. The top 10 percentile has wider income disparity then the 90 percentile below it (i.e. $12K difference). 74% of PMETs earning above $12K salary are foreigners</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Dear The Real Singapore,<br><br>This is a complaint over the ridiculous treatment me and my boyfriend Walter endured during our visit to Singapore. I am an American tourist who holiday-ed in Singapore last month together with my boyfriend of 5 years. We planned for this holiday for ages and finally booked our tickets to this world renown Garden City. After arrival, we took in the beautiful sights and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, diverse cultures and food until something happened. <br><br>All that initial positivity went out of the window when me and my boyfriend were taking a leisurely stroll at the botanic gardens. Out of the blue, a young local boy accompanied by his mother pointed at us and shouted, "mummy... why are the two boys holding hands?" What came next shocked us beyond words. The lady knelt beside her son, hurriedly covered his eyes and exclaimed at the top of her voice "don't look at them, they are abnormal". After which she dragged the puzzled boy away as though we had the plague!<br><br>We were both dumbfounded at this shockingly bigoted behavior. Apart from the Christian belt in the South, we would never be subject to such blatant discrimination in the USA. Even President Obama , the most influential man in the world has repeatedly called for universal love and equality. It is thus disappointing that despite being a democracy, Singaporeans are still backward in their mindsets and deny minorities the freedom to love. <br><br>I write in now because our brush with Singaporean's narrow mindedness happened not only once but twice. Shortly after that episode, while Walter and I were cuddling by the riverside at Clarke Quay enjoying the river breeze, a group of rowdy brown skinned goons ran up to us and screamed "fucking faggots" and ran off laughing like hyenas. <br><br>What's with this trashy behavior Singapore? Why are we being bullied and insulted for our sexuality? We are paying tourists in your country and this is how you treat your guests? For all your beautiful buildings and wonderful infrastructure, the people of Singapore are sorely lacking in common decency and woefully antagonistic towards us. Where is the love Singapore? How can you proclaim yourself a first world nation when such blatant discrimination against sexual minorities still exists? <br><br>Bill B.</p></div>

              <p>[Piracy on High Seas] - Britney Spears is secret anti-piracy war weapon that strikes fear in the heart of pirates</p>
              <p>From <img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/styles/sgseen_featured_image/public/article/images/featured/2013/11/britmain3.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="280"> to <img src="http://media.meltybuzz.fr/article-1280213-ajust_930/britney-spears.jpg" alt="" width="930" height="1240"></p>
              <p>British navy officers have discovered a new use for Britney Spears' chart-topping hits: As wards against Somali pirates. </p>
              <p>According to a report in The Straits Times Communities, Spears' famous Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did It Again have been tried and proven effective against kidnapping attempts by the 'western culture-hating' pirates. </p>
              <p>"Her songs were chosen by the security team because they thought the pirates would hate them most. These guys can't stand Western culture or music, making Britney's hits perfect," says Second Officer Owens, who works on supertankers off the east coast of Africa.</p>
              <p>Ms Owens say that pointing the speakers to the pirates have discouraged them from coming onboard and that they rarely need to fire the guns anymore.</p>

The men said Mr Lim owed them RM65,000 and recognised him through his vehicle's licence plate number.<br><br>Said Mr Lim, 35, who runs a car dealership: "I have never borrowed money from anyone in Malaysia."<br><br>The couple have travelled to Johor Baru more than 40 times in the past two years and have never encountered anyone making such a claim.<br><br>As his wife called the police, Mr Lim tried to stall for time by arguing with the two men. The Johor police headquarters was less than 100m away.<br><br>"I kept telling (the men) it's a case of mistaken identity, but they became aggressive, pushing me and clenching their fists in my face," he said.<br><br>"At that time, there were a lot of people at the petrol station who saw what happened, but none of them helped us."<br><br>Mrs Lim, 32, claimed she spoke to a Johor police officer over the phone and was assured that help would come soon.<br><br>Johor Baru deputy police chief Ismail Yatim confirmed that they got a call for help from Mrs Lim.<br><br>A patrol vehicle was promptly sent to investigate, but the couple were gone by the time they arrived. Police also tried to call them but the number was not in use, said Mr Ismail.<br><br>Meanwhile, fearing for their safety, Mr Lim sped off towards the immigration checkpoint.<br><br>2. Threatened with knife<br><br>That was when he realised the men were chasing him in a white lorry, which he believed was modified. it soon overtook the couple and weaved dangerously in front of their car.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "We were speeding towards the checkpoint, trying to escape. But I couldn't outrun him at all. Many people were honking their horns at us."<br><br>The lorry suddenly braked in front of them, forcing them to stop near a Shell petrol station just half a kilometre away from the checkpoint.<br><br>The man who carried the knife alighted and walked over to Mrs Lim's side of the car, threatening to smash the window.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "I was afraid of what he would do to my wife if he got in, so I wound down my side of the window. I didn't expect him to come over and snatch the car keys from the ignition."<br><br>The man allegedly forced Mrs Lim to go to the back seat.<br><br>He then entered the car, sitting beside Mr Lim.<br><br>"He didn't pull out his knife and he kept telling us that it wasn't a robbery and he just wanted us to return him the money that we owed," said Mr Lim.<br><br>3. Don't insult me<br><br>The man ordered Mr lim to drive to a car wash, where someone would bring them documents proving Mr lim's debt.<br><br>But those documents never arrived. Mr Lim claimed the man seemed to get more desperate, hurling Hokkien vulgarities at them.<br><br>They were then told to drive a short distance to a 7-Eleven store, followed closely by the white lorry.<br><br>There, the man gave them an ultimatum: Leave the car, or pay the man "compensation" to make it worth his time.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "I lied that I only carried RM400 with me, but my wife blurted out that she had RM3,000."<br><br>Said Mrs Lim, who works in a bank: "I was so terrified of the man, I didn't dare to try anything different."<br><br>But the man wasn't satisfied and allegedly told the couple "don't insult me". He then ordered them to drive to an ATM to withdraw more cash.<br><br>4. No cash<br><br>It was 2.30am when they arrived at a standard chartered aTM, which was situated opposite the Johor police headquarters.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "I saw no police around, but I made sure the ATM's closed-circuit television cameras captured the man's face."<br><br>But the ATM could not dispense any cash.<br><br>5. Call your bank<br><br>They went to another aTM operated by ciMB Bank near Plaza Pelangi at about 3am. Even then, he still could not withdraw any cash as his UoB aTM card was not approved for overseas withdrawal.<br><br>"He made me call the bank over speakerphone to activate the card," said Mr Lim. "The bank staff told me to wait until 3.30am for the card to be activated."<br><br>Mr Lim claimed the man also began to call several people for advice on how to proceed, and Mr Lim heard male and female voices on the other end.<br><br>He could not understand what was said as the man spoke in Malay, but he thought the man suspected he was being tricked.<br><br>Then, instead of waiting until 3.30am, the man told the driver in the white lorry to return home and forced the couple to drive to another ATM near City Square Mall.<br><br>6. Ordeal ends at 4am<br><br>At a hong leong Bank ATM, Mr Lim managed to withdraw RM3,000 when his earlier request to authorise overseas withdrawals took effect.<br><br>"At that point, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to give him the money and go, but he told me to drop him off elsewhere first," he said.<br><br>They drove to a hawker centre, where the ordeal finally ended at about 4am, after the man took the cash and their mobile phones and escaped.<br><br>Before he left, however, the man gave him two numbers to call and told them to collect their mobile phones at Woodlands Centre later that morning.<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "I didn't even think of giving chase. I drove off to the checkpoint straightaway. I didn't even call any of the numbers or go to Woodlands Centre either." The couple made a report at the police station at the Customs and immigration checkpoint in Johor Baru and were told to make a detailed report at their police headquarters. Mr Lim flatly refused.<br><br>"There's no way they will make me go near where we first met the men that night," he said.<br><br>They went straight home.<br><br>The couple had to return to the same police headquarters on Tuesday to speak to police investigators. Said Mrs Lim about her return trip: "I was trembling the whole time. What if it happens again?"<br><br>Said Mr Lim: "It was such a scary experience for me and my wife. No way am I going back to Johor Baru again."<br><br>Tips from Singapore and Johor police<br><br>1. never take shortcuts through dark, deserted places. keep to well-lit areas with people and traffic.<br><br>2. pack your belongings in inconspicuous bags. Expensive bags can draw unnecessary attention.<br><br>3. clean out your wallet or purse before you go. take only essential credit cards. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash.<br><br>4. don't display expensive jewellery, cameras and other items that might draw attention.<br><br>5. don't be distracted by strangers creating a commotion or accidentally spilling something onto you.<br><br>6. carry your purse close to your body. carry your wallet in your front pocket.<br><br>7. park your vehicle in well-lit areas and in parking spaces where there is security.<br><br>8. use additional security equipment such as steering wheel locks, clutch and brake locks, disc locks, gear locks and audible alarm systems to secure your vehicle.<br><br>Johor police hotline: 07-221-2999<br><br>OTHER S'POREANS ROBBED IN JB THIS YEAR<br><br>WHEN<br><br>SEPT 3<br><br>WHAT<br><br>Ms Fie, 41, and her family were driving along Jalan tebrau when two men on a motorcycle smashed the front passenger side window of her car and snatched a gold kate spade handbag. the handbag contained ms fie's ic, driver's licence, three bank cards, work security pass, house keys, car key and $297 in singapore and malaysian currency.<br><br>WHEN<br><br>JULY 30<br><br>WHAT<br><br>Madam Rajeswary Kartigeyan was abducted by at least three people, one of whom was just a boy of about 15 years old, outside sultanah Aminah hospital at Jalan persiaran Abu bakar sultan. she was bundled into the back seat of a car, bound, blindfolded, gagged with tape and told she would be murdered if she did not comply with the abductors' demands.<br><br>she was robbed of $360 in singapore and malaysian currency, jewellery worth $4,000 and her mobile phone.<br><br>WHEN<br><br>MARCH 19<br><br>WHAT<br><br>Mr Effande Mohamad Yashin and a couple, Mr Shah and Madam Emma, were preparing to leave their friend's home at taman nusa perintis, gelang patah, when a white honda with four men stopped in front of them.

              <p>Confession: I shouted at a guy for being ungentlemanly, only to find out he was my big boss</p>
              <p><img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/styles/sgseen_featured_image/public/article/images/featured/2013/11/confmain.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Today's confession is from an SMU student who told a guy off for not helping her, then found out he was the regional head of operations at the company she was interning at.</p>
              <p>Here is the confession in full:</p>
              <p>"Wow I had a totally sh!tty day. I’m currently taking a break to do a 6 month internship at a global commercial bank. I’m currently assigned to learn from one of the directors - follow him around in meetings and experience what top management in a bank is like. There’s quite a few of us from SMU, NTU and NUS. We’re basically all assigned to different mentors, but located on the same floor.</p>
              <p>"Today, I met this middle aged man at the pantry while I was trying to get myself a glass of water. We have this cool looking 2-in-1 water purifier and dispenser in our pantry which is manually replenished by the cleaner every few hours. I think the cleaner was late today so she hadn’t replenished the water yet.</p>
              <p>"Since I saw that middle aged man at the pantry, I just told him to replenish it. It’s pretty brainless stuff, just takes a bit of physical strength. He took one look at me and just walked away. I think guys who act like this are just embarrassing. So I shouted “And you call yourself a man?” He ignored me and kept walking. As I headed back to my office, I was going to tell my mentor about this guy, but we had to go for a meeting because the regional head of operations was giving everyone a briefing.</p>
              <p>"When we entered the conference room, I got the nastiest shock of my life. That ungentlemanly guy was actually the regional head of operations. And so the first thing I asked my mentor was “is his appointment higher than yours?” And he just replied me “You know the CEO for our bank in Singapore? This guy is one level higher – he’s the regional head for our banks located all over Asia.” Crap. I can’t use my mentor as a shield now.</p>
              <p>"After the meeting that guy decided to be a total a**hole. He pointed me out as the girl who asked him to refill the water dispenser. The conference room went dead silent immediately. In front of everyone, he told my mentor to 'QC your employee. If you can’t make her change her attitude, make her change her job.' What really surprised me was how NOBODY DARED TO SAY ANYTHING! Even the female directors all kept quiet and just scowled at me after the meeting was over. What a joke. Hello that guy acted like a jerk to me at the pantry everyone. Highest rank so what?</p>
              <p>"Then when we returned to the office, I was expecting the director to agree with me on how that guy is a douchebag or at least offer me some consolation. Guess what? He gave me another scolding when we got back. Wow thanks. I totally felt like crying after that."</p>

              <p>[Medicine] - A vaccine researcher speaks out against vaccine </p>
              <p>Dr. Diane Harper was the lead researcher in the development of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil™ and Cervarix™. She is now the latest in a long string of experts who are pressing the red alert button on the devastating consequences and irrelevancy of these vaccines. Dr. Harper made her surprising confession at the 4th International Converence on Vaccination which took place in Reston, Virginia. Her speech, which was originally intended to promote the benefits of the vaccines, took a 180-degree turn when she chose instead to clean her conscience about the deadly vaccines so she “could sleep at night”. The following is an excerpt from a story by Sarah Cain:</p>
              <p>“Dr. Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the U.S. is already extremely low, and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States. In fact, 70% of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year, and the number rises to well over 90% in two years. Harper also mentioned the safety angle. All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds. So far, 15,037 girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil™ alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions. At the time of writing, 44 girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines. The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome (paralysis lasting for years, or permanently — sometimes eventually causing suffocation), lupus, seizures, blood clots, and brain inflammation. Parents are usually not made aware of these risks. Dr. Harper, the vaccine developer, claimed that she was speaking out, so that she might finally be able to sleep at night. ’About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have HPV at some stage of their life,’ Harper says. ’Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself. But in those cases where it doesn’t, and isn’t treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer.’”</p>
              <p><br>Although these two vaccines are marketed as protection against cervical cancer, this claim is purely hypothetical. Studies have proven “there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless. In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer. From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite.”</p>
