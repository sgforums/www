              Four Chinese women were detained for being involved in a hair-pulling fight aboard a domestic flight Â– the latest in a series of cases of badly behaving mainland travellers.<br>
              <br>
              The women began arguing mid-flight over the adjustment of seats on a Shenzhen-bound plane from Dalian city in Liaoning province, witnesses told Shanghai news website Thepaper.cn.<br>
              <br>
              Then the heated dispute escalated into a full-blown physical confrontation, with the women getting up from their seats and tearing at each otherÂ’s hair.<br>
              <br>
              The fighting passengers, aged between 30 to 50 and all from Liaoning, were detained by police when the plane landed for a stopover in Nantong city, Jiangsu province.<br>
              <br>
              They will be held in custody for five days for endangering the safety of an aircraft, Nantong police confirmed.<br>
              <br>
              Thepaper.cn reported that police were notified about the altercation by the aircraftÂ’s crew before the plane landed.<br>
              <br>
              Shenzhen Airlines Flight ZH9724 landed safely at its destination.<br>
              <br>
              Incidents like these involving Chinese passengers Â– both on domestic and international flights Â– have made headlines in recent months for either breaches to airline rules or misbehaviour.<br>
              <br>
              In December, state media branded a group of mainland airline passengers Â“barbariansÂ” after they scalded a Thai stewardess with hot water and noodles, and threatened to blow up the plane during a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing.<br>
              <br>
              Days later that same month, a brawl between four women from mainland China on a Hong Kong-bound flight over a noisy baby almost forced the plane to return to Chongqing.<br>
              <br>
              Last month, a mainland Chinese couple were kicked off a Dragonair flight to Beijing after the wife cleaned excrement from her one-year-old son over a sink inside a cabin toilet without closing the door, prompting other passengers to complain.<br>
              <br>
              On February 24, a mainland couple and their three-year-old son were ejected from a Hong Kong-bound Cathay Pacific flight from Bangkok after the toddlerÂ’s refusal to put on his seatbelt sparked off a heated argument on the plane.<br>
              <br>
              A day before that, on February 23, there was a similar incident on another flight returning to Hong Kong from Bali, Indonesia, after a mainland Chinese boy, aged three, refused to remain in his seat. His grandparent insisted on carrying him.<br>

In February, the waitress had an injury on her left ear that required stitches.</p><p>Ms Annie Ee Yu Lian, 27, was found dead in a flat on the third storey of Block 878, Woodlands Avenue 9, on Monday morning.</p><p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force said that its paramedics had found her body, with no visible fatal injuries, on a mattress in a bedroom.</p><p>A married couple who lived with Ms Ee in the flat were arrested in connection with the case.</p><p>The police confirmed that it was murder yesterday evening. The man, 36, and his wife, 31, are understood to be the owners of the flat.</p><p>Two neighbours, who declined to be named, told The New Paper yesterday that the couple moved in about five years ago.</p><p>But they were not sure when Ms Ee started living there. They said that while Ms Ee was not related to the couple, the two women addressed each other as â€œsistersâ€�.</p><p>One of them said that she worked as a waitress in Hot Tomato restaurant at the nearby Causeway Point shopping mall.</p><p>She said: â€œI think she was a tenant in the flat and the owners often kept to themselves. The few times I saw them, they seemed to be in a bad mood.</p><p>â€œI had seen the waitress in the restaurant a few times when I walked past it. We never spoke, but she seemed fine.â€�</p><p>But a manager in Hot Tomato, who was interviewed by the two Chinese evening dailies, told a different story.</p><p>Lianhe Wanbao quoted the unnamed manager as saying that Ms Ee often turned up for work with bruises on her arms and face.</p><p>Shin Min Daily News said that she would try to cover up the bruises with concealer, with her fringe or by wearing a cap.</p><p>The manager said: â€œWhen we asked her about her injuries, she would evade the question or said she had hurt herself accidentally or had fallen.â€�</p><p>Ms Ee began working at the restaurant in November 2013, earning about $1,500 a month. Her former colleagues described her as a gentle person who sometimes joked with them.</p><p>The manager said she started showing up with bruises last October. And she would freeze and appear frightened at the mention of her â€œ big sisterâ€�. He said the â€œsisterâ€� would call the restaurant often to check on her.</p><p>â€œShe had to knock off at 10pm sharp every day. Once, I kept her back because I was teaching her something. Her â€˜sisterâ€™ called the restaurant and scolded me,â€� he said.</p><p>The manager told Shin Min that the â€œsisterâ€� was upset with the amount Ms Ee got for Chinese New Year from the restaurant in February. She called the restaurant to demand, unsuccessfully, that she get at least a monthâ€™s salary as bonus. She then told Ms Ee to quit.</p><p>Ms Eeâ€™s bruises became worse. She took medical leave to treat an ear injury that had worsened and needed surgery, the manager said.</p><p>He said that a colleague was so shocked by her bruises in February that she took photos of them with her mobile phone. Ms Ee then confessed that her â€œsisterâ€� had beaten her.</p><p>She left Hot Tomato and got another job as a waitress in a Japanese restaurant in Causeway Point, earning about $1,400 a month.</p><p>The manager who interviewed her for the job told Shin Min that he found it odd that her â€œsisterâ€� was doing all the talking while Ms Ee kept silent. Workers there said that she turned up for work last Wednesday with a red, swollen face and had difficulty walking.</p><p>They told her to go home and she left at about 7pm that day. A neighbour told Shin Min that she had seen Ms Ee and the â€œsisterâ€� having a heated argument with the husband on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Two other neighbours said they had heard two loud sounds coming from the flat that night.<br></p><p>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Symposium" and "Conference" are 2 words that have confused (and continue to confuse) many people due to their mutual interchangeability. I may be Science person, but I'm a Science person who has an understanding and appreciation for many other fields, including Language. The meaning and purpose of many words (in all languages, including English) evolve over time, based on their usage by society at any given point in time. As such, I would say "Symposium" is now best understood to be a subset of "Conference". The latter can be of any type (eg. business), while the former refers specifically to academic. If you're not sure which to use in a particular context, use the more generic term. This (playing it safe by using a more generic term) is generally recommended, including for instance, within H2 Chemistry (eg. if you're not sure if it's nucleophilic aliphatic substitution or nucleophilic acyl substitution or nucleophilic aromatic substitution, just say nucleophilic substitution).</div>
