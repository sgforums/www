            <div class='col-md body'>[13 Nov 2015] - The head of an Islamic Mosque in France, Dr. Tawfik Hamid, had something to say to both muslims and non-muslims in the world.<br><a href="http://paolohor.blogspot.sg/2015/11/an-honest-man-making-powerful-statement.html">http://paolohor.blogspot.sg/2015/11/an-honest-man-making-powerful-statement.html</a><br><br>Perhaps here in Singapore where there's religious harmony (such a rarity in the world today, Singapore might be the only country in the world that has this luxury, at least in part due to LKY), local muslims might not fully agree with Dr Hamid's speech. But in a global context, every year, far far far more muslims (numbering in the millions) are violently killed by fellow muslims (but of a conflicting Islamic denomination, eg. Shia vs Sunni) every year than by non-muslims (including Israel) in violent terrorist attacks, so you begin to understand the problem is the inseparability of religion and politics on a global scale. Singapore is the exception, not the norm. But that should not blind you from seeing the problems out there in the rest of the world, of which politicized religion is causing a lot of tragic deaths and suffering (unto muslims themselves first and foremost, whether Sunni or Shia).<br><br>To understand Dr Hamid's viewpoint in a global and historical context, also read the following insightful articles on Islam.<br><br>Thomas Friedman's article "<i>1979 : The day the Islamic World changed forever</i>"<br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/opinion/thomas-friedman-for-the-mideast-its-still-1979.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/opinion/thomas-friedman-for-the-mideast-its-still-1979.html</a><br><br>Adrian Humphreys' "<i>The Sunni-Shia split at the heart of regional conflict in the middle east explained</i>"<br><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/israel-middle-east/the-sunni-shia-split-at-the-heart-of-regional-conflict-in-the-middle-east-explained">http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/israel-middle-east/the-sunni-shia-split-at-the-heart-of-regional-conflict-in-the-middle-east-explained</a></div>

              How familiar are you with different genres of music?<p><a href="https://sg.answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=MKBPTT5SJOV34QUFLQAYMFCSP4&amp;t=g">CitizenErased</a> explains the different subgenres of "Metal" music <a href="https://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080731151419AAv7HwN">here</a></p><p>Heavy Metal: The first form of metal. Known for loud distorted guitar riffs and long solos. </p><p> Thrash Metal: High speed riffs combined with loud percussive drums. Includes such bands as Metallic, Nevermore, etc. </p><p> Death Metal: Again, uses distorted guitar riffs. It also uses either high pitched screams or growls, and morbid lyrics. Drums contain blast beats. Examples are Death, Morbid Angel etc. </p><p> Power Metal: Similar to speed metal, often characterized by video-game-ish guitar sounds. Bands include Firewind, Kamelot </p><p> Speed Metal: Draws much influence from early metal bands, but basically just faster. Motorhead is a classic example. </p><p> Prog Metal: If you know what progressive rock is (which I'm sure you do) it's basically progressive rock combined with a metal sound. Harder riffs, etc. Opeth is a classic example. </p><p> Metalcore: Not technically metal, but draws influence from post-hardcore and heavy metal. Examples are Bullet for My Valentine which is not considered metal, and Lamb of God which is considered metal. </p><p> Deathcore: Combination of Metalcore and Death metal. Generally known for extreme vocals such as pig squealing, etc. Job for a Cowboy is Deathcore. </p><p> Sludge Metal: Combines Doom Metal and hardcore punk. Isis is a good example. Or The Ocean. </p><p> Doom Metal: Slow tempos combined with low-tuned guitars. Black Sabbath is often considered Doom. </p><p> Stoner Metal: Again fairly slow tempos with low tuned guitars that is very bass heavy. Kyuss is the first stoner metal band. Stoner, Doom, and Sludge are very closely related. </p><p> Mathcore: Two types of mathcore- Techincal metalcore, or progressive metalcore. Basically just really frekin hard technical metal. Bands include Protest the Hero and Embrace the End. </p><p> Technical Death Metal: Death Metal that is very technical. Often is extremely fast, and guitarists are always wicked talented. Bands include Origin and Decapitated. </p><p> Melodic Death Metal: Death Metal that features melodies that are very clear. Combines the melodies of heavy metal with the vocals of death metal. Bands include In Flames and Norther. </p><p> Black Metal: Uses high tuned guitars and shrieking vocals. Often has anti-christian lyrics. Examples are Cradle of Filth and Enslaved. </p><p> Symphonic Metal: Metal that uses classical elements, similar to what a symphony would use. Bands include Nightwish and Epica. </p><p> Goth Metal: Combines the aggression and sometimes speed of heavy metal with the darkness of gothic rock. Evanescense is often considered goth metal. </p><p> Industrial Metal: Uses repetitive guitar riffs with synthesizer often. Bands include Fear Factory.</p><p>---------------------------------------------</p><p>For a complete list of all music genres (isn't it wonderful how Wikipedia is the compendium of all knowledge known to mankind, and is accessible for free by anyone and everyone with an internet access?), including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dubstep">Dubstep music</a>, see :<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_music_styles">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_music_styles</a></p><p>

              See, this here, pisses me off.
                      <br><br>
                      Every year, due to the ill-conceived and unjustly small number of places available in local Medical schools, many hundreds of Singapore students (who perform better academically and thus are better qualified than many foreigners who get to study Medicine in their own countries with much larger Med school intakes), many with straight As, are forced to spend a million dollars (with some parents going into serious debt or selling their homes to support their son/daughter's aspirations) to study Medicine overseas.
                      <br><br>
                      
                      And most of these Singaporeans do succeed in completing their medical degrees from Universities and medical schools recognized by Singapore Medical Council (SMC). Some of these overseas Med schools and Universities are even more reputable and internationally recognized than local Med schools.
                      <br><br>
                      
                      So this proves it's not truly a matter of prudently restricting local Med school student intake for the sake of quality control, but more actually a matter of ill-conceived and maladjusted education policies resulting in overly small local Med school intakes, resulting in a critical shortage of medical doctors in Singapore, in turn resulting in thousands of foreigners (some with dubious academic performance, medical training and professional qualifications) being imported in to meet Singapore's needs.
                      <br><br>
                      
                      How would you feel if you were one of many such hundreds of Singaporeans every year, perform better (eg. straight As) than many of the foreigners imported in to meet the shortage, and thus feel you're more deserving but are nonetheless turned away from local Med schools, only because of the overly small intake of students for local Med schools.
                      <br><br>
                      
                      Which leaves you with 2 choices : either struggle to  borrow a million dollars to receive a Medical school education overseas recognized by SMC, or give up on your lifelong aspirations to serve society as a doctor. While every year, you see/hear the local media announce, "Shortage of medical doctors in Singapore, foreign doctors imported in to meet Singapore's needs".
                      <br><br>
                      
                      
                      <b>S'pore sees a rise in foreign doctors</b>
                      <br><br>
                      
                      More than a quarter of the doctors in the public healthcare sector are foreigners.
                      <br><br>
                      
                      At the end of last year, public hospitals and polyclinics had more than 2,100 foreign doctors in their employ and the number continues to grow as Singapore faces a shortage of trained medical staff.

              SOUTHERN TURKEY â€” Dua had only been working for two months with the Khansaa Brigade, the all-female morality police of the Islamic State, when her friends were brought to the station to be whipped.<p>The police had hauled in two women she had known since childhood, a mother and her teenage daughter, both distraught. Their abayas, flowing black robes covering the entire body, had been deemed too form-fitting and thus too 'sexy'.</p><p>When the mother saw Dua, she rushed over and begged her to intercede. The room felt stuffy as Dua weighed what to do.</p><p>â€œTheir abayas really were very tight. I told her it was their own fault; they had come out wearing the wrong thing,â€� she said. â€œThey were unhappy with that.â€�</p><p>Dua sat back down and watched as the other officers took the women into a back room to be whipped. When they removed their face-concealing niqabs, her friends were also found to be wearing makeup. It was 20 lashes for the abaya offense, five for the makeup, and another five for not being meek enough when detained.</p><p>Their cries and screams began ringing out, and Dua stared hard at the ceiling, a lump building in her throat.</p><p>Article :<br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/world/middleeast/isis-wives-and-enforcers-in-syria-recount-collaboration-anguish-and-escape.html?_r=0</a></p><p>
