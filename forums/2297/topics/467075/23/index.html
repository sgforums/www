              <p>Sabah - We were tricked into converting to Islam, claim Christian villagers</p>
              <div class="content">
              <div id="post_message_1765371"><blockquote class="postcontent restore"><img src="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/assets/uploads/resizer/The_Protestant_Church_of_Sabah_church_in_Kpg_Layung_Maliau._540_323_100.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>“They think they had converted us (to Islam). They are wrong. We are still Christians and our faith in God has not changed,” housewife Lenney Masangal said, explaining the presence of “Muslims” at the church.<br><br>The 41-year-old mother of three was one of 33 people from the village who claimed that they were tricked into converting into Islam for a mere RM100 on New Year's day.<br><br>They were part of a group of about 64 people, including children, from three villages in Pitas – Kampung Layung Maliau, Dowokon and Sosop – who had allegedly been converted.<br><br>Their trouble had apparently started on New Year's Eve.<br><br>A fellow villager, on returning from Pitas town, called everyone to his house to announce the “good news” that “some people from Kuala Lumpur” are giving them financial assistance.<br><br>“We all went to his house to hear how we could receive the financial assistance,” farmer Maison Bilu said.<br><br>When told that the amount would be RM800 per person, Maison was beyond excited.<br><br>The 44-year-old lost all sense of reasoning as he – there are seven of them in his family – was only thinking of how much he would be getting.<br><br>“Nobody asked who were these people giving us the financial assistance. We were only told 'people from Kuala Lumpur'. We didn't even ask the reason they are giving us this money,” Maison said.<br><br>“Everyone just wanted the money. That's all.”<br><br>Getting RM800 was like winning the lottery for the villagers who depended on subsistence farming to survive.<br><br>It is so remote that every one of their elected representatives in the last 50 years had never set foot in the village.<br><br>Neither had Muslim missionaries.<br><br><br>“We have no income of any kind. That RM800 is a lot more than BR1M (Bantuan Rakyat 1Malaysia). Everybody was understandably excited,” Maison said.<br><br>“To get it was also easy. We just have to give our name and MyKad number to that neighbour of ours. No questions asked.<br><br>“However, we were told we have to go to Pitas town hall the next day (New Year's day) to receive the cash.”<br><br>So early the next day, the 33 villagers excitedly trudged down the dirt road for the 3km New Year walk to the river.<br><br>Once they crossed the river via a suspension bridge, three cars were waiting to take them to the town hall.<br><br>“When we reached the hall, we were told to go to the 'masjid' (mosque) instead,” Maison said.<br><br>“At the mosque, we were all treated to refreshments and then they asked for our MyKad. We were then asked to sign a form. I don't know what the form was as I could not read or write. No one explained to us what the form was.<br><br>“All of us were illiterates. I never went to school and neither did my wife,” he said of his wife Nafsiah Momin.<br><br>“So I put my finger print on the form.” <br><br>“At the end of it, the man told us that we have converted to Islam and we are now all Muslims.<br><br>“I was shocked. I quickly dragged my wife and children out of the mosque to ask ourselves what was going on,” Maison said.<br><br>He said when he later opened the smaller envelopes, he found RM100 in the yellow envelopes and RM50 in the green envelopes.<br><br>It was only later that he found out that the RM100 were for adults and the RM50 for children. <br><br>“Yes, RM800 is a very large sum of money to me. I felt very happy to think that I was going to get such financial assistance.<br><br>“But only to find out later that I had been deceived for RM100 and covertly converted, I really felt cheated."<br><br>Jusman's wife Lenny said the so-called conversion meant nothing to all of them.<br><br>“We are still Christians. We still go to church every Sunday and the church has been packed since this incident.”<br><br>After more than two weeks of mental agony, Lenny said she felt “happier” now as Christian non-governmental organisations in the state had engaged a lawyer to seek legal redress and see how the villagers could get out of their religious predicament.<br><br>“I had never thought of being a Muslim and never want to be one.”<br><br>The villagers, led by the neighbour who told them of the assistance, Makadan Masabu, 54, had lodged a police report over the alleged covert conversion.<br><br>They urged police to investigate their claim of covert conversion so that they not only retain their faith as Christians but to warn others who might be similarly tricked. – January 20, 2014. </blockquote></div>

              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers">Jim Rogers</a> (the famous billionaire) told New Paper that when he's in Singapore he always takes the MRT (which Anton Casey says is for inferior people) which he reckons is pretty good by international standards. And he says his daughter prefer to use it too. It seems the police were at Gilstead Road (where Anton Casey and Jim Rogers are neighbours) today, interviewing neighbours and maids along that stretch of road.</p>

              <p>One male expatriate who got to know Casey and his family over the past several months told <em>Yahoo Singapore</em> that the wealth manager had a very British sense of humour, which can be very scathing, "<em>but it can cross lines and it did cross lines. I had to defriend him on Facebook because I couldn't stand the rubbish he was writing about all sorts of people</em>," the expat said, adding that Casey's wife and son though were "sweet".</p>

              <p>EXPERIENCES WITH COCKY BRITISH EXPATS<br>Published by farhan on Thu, 23 Jan 2014 11:10:10 AM<br><br>He pulled my sleeve and told me to boldly cross the busy street when we were Hong Kong, telling me that he is "Kwai Lo" (Hong Kong term for expat) and nobody will dare run him down. And he was right. The van screeched to a halt and we made it across the street safely. I turned to apologize to the driver but he just waddled off. I was shocked that he was so confident that he would get the same treatment in any Asian country, since he has worked in Hong Kong, Manila and Singapore. For the first time, I regretted employing him as our CFO.<br><br>That evening, we had dinner and I apologized that he waited for five minutes and mentioned it was bad manners. <strong>He told me he expected no manners or etiquette from Chinese</strong>, since we spit into the bowls we eat out of. <strong>Though I was angry, I just smiled politely. And that is the problem. Because we choose to be polite, people like him think we are stupid. Because we are not confrontational, we are weak.</strong> That was the last C-level Brit I have ever employed when I was running my companies.<br><br>At our annual meeting a few years back, our outgoing President made a remark that set everyone in the room laughing. His remark was, "Singaporeans can't write." I wasn't sure if that was a joke or a criticism. And when he said that, I looked around the room to search for some kind of reaction, since it was a room full of academics who depended on their writing to make a living. But they just laughed, as politely as I did when I was told I had no table etiquette even before I started sat at the table.<br><br>I think SOME (not all) people who are not familiar with our culture have clearly misunderstood us. <strong>Singaporeans and Asians in general are polite and non-confrontational people, even in the face of insults. While MOST westerners are polite and know their limits, SOME think that we agree with them simply because we do not violently disagree. I see this at the work place, in the university, and in my own companies.<br></strong><br>I believe if one wants to work or live in a foreign land, he needs to learn to respect the people of the land, and not categorize people or things according to his standards. So what if our food requires us to take bones out in the middle of a meal? So what if we use our cutlery differently? So what if we dress in our smartest office wear and eat humbly with anyone in a hawker center? So what if our kids do not get to play outside? So what if our accent sounds wrong? So what if we like our coffee in a plastic bag? So what if our secretaries in the office are obliging and willing to make your coffee? So what if we write differently? So what if we have less opportunities in our education because our country was poor when we were young? So what if we like to dress simply and take our public transport?<br><br>If you are a foreigner in Singapore, here's a little tip: you have no right to mindlessly throw insults just because we are too polite to tell you off. <strong>You shouldn't think that you can fool us with lies, excuses and half-truths, since we can see through these, and just don't want to make you to look bad. You shouldn't measure us with your yardsticks because if we measure them against ours, you will fail badly as well.</strong><br><br><strong>If any foreigner can make an attempt to blend in, we will receive him with open arms. But if he cannot respect our people, our culture and our habits, please go home. We bear no grudges. Hopefully a better place with better opportunities awaits him.<br></strong></p>

              <p>“Poor people stink because they run ten times as fast to earn in a lifetime what you earn in a month… Poor people smell.

              <p>The 27-year-old Fly Entertainment artiste's letter has been shared over 400 times and garnered over 200 Likes as of Sunday. It has also received a string of praises from other Facebook users.</p>

              <p>Here is her open letter in full:</p>
              <p>"So he got fired, and he's left the country. But I still felt like I wanted to say this to him.</p>
              <p>Dear Mr Anton Casey,</p>
              <p>Im sure you are having a hard time right now. I cant tell if it is actually affecting you. I doubt it. I think you are sorry... That people found out... maybe.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i just wanted to tell you... That you are right. A lot of poor people -do- smell. And you know why they smell? Some people actually cannot afford soap. Some people haven't been taught hygeine. Some people cant afford deodorants or fancy perfumes. Some people work in the sun the whole day but get paid so little that ten cent fare hikes make a difference. Some people work behind fast food counters for such long hours until the smell of french fries stick to them and the smell refuses to leave, refuses to be scrubbed off, to feed other poor people who saved enough to bring their families for a little treat of meat that isnt even real meat, of food that claims to be cheap, fast and good when -we know- that of this holy trinity, u can only buy two, and maybe, the illusion of the third. This fast food, is their good food. because the "good food" has been priced out of their reach.</p>
              <p>Poor people stink because they run ten times as fast to earn in a lifetime what you earn in a month.</p>
              <p>So yes. Poor people smell. And its the smell of a fight. You. You. Have a different kind of stink.</p>
              <p>The stink of entitlement. The stink of a rich person who thinks his money should buy him respect. Who thinks that his money is a result of his hardwork. And only his hardwork. Nothing to do with his race, with his birthplace, what he was born with, with his parents, with his education, with people that believed in him. None of those things. His hardwork, and only his hardwork, brought him his money, and therefore, he has earned it.<br>You stink, like the rich people who think of ways not to change the system that allows people to be paid less than minimum wage, that allows contracts that terminate you for bogus reasons because its cheaper to get someone else. Thank you for your years of service. But we will be letting you go. You stink like the rich people who only want to game the system. Which is fine, to each his own. But then they turn around and piss on the people who make their world run.</p>
              <p>Mr Casey, Id rather be on the train."</p>

              <p><em>BAYER CEO Marijn Dekkers CREDIT: BAYER</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In 2005, the FDA granted approval for a promising new cancer-fighting drug called Nexavar. Bayer took it to market shortly thereafter, and it is currently an approved treatment for late-stage kidney and liver cancer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">That is, so long as you live in the developed world. In a <a style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-01-21/merck-to-bristol-myers-face-more-threats-on-india-drug-patents"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">recently published interview</span></a> in Bloomberg Businessweek, Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers said that his company’s drug isn’t for poor people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">“We did not develop this medicine for Indians…we developed it for western patients who can afford it,” he said back in December. The quote is quickly making its way across Indian news outlets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The comment was in response to a decision by an Indian patent court that granted a compulsory license to a local company to reproduce Bayer’s drug. Under Indian patent laws, if a product is not available locally at a reasonable cost, other companies may apply for licenses to reproduce those products at a more affordable price. Nexavar costs an <a style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/03/19/how-to-charge-1-6-million-for-a-new-drug-and-get-away-with-it/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">estimated $69,000</span></a> for a full year of treatment in India, 41 times the country’s annual per capita income.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">In 2012, Indian pharmaceutical company Natco Pharma Ltd. applied for just such a license, and it was granted. The company began reproducing the drug at a 97 percent discount, offering it for just $177. Bayer has been appealing the ruling ever since, and in December Dekkers told Businessweek that he viewed the compulsory license as “essentially theft” before dismissing poor Indian cancer patients.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Pharmaceutical companies have long been accused of ignoring the plight of those who cannot afford their astronomical prices. In the United States, where insurance companies often pick up most of the tab, consumers are often shielded from the true cost of drugs they are prescribed (Nexavar, for example, costs as much as $96,000 in the United States, but <a style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/03/19/how-to-charge-1-6-million-for-a-new-drug-and-get-away-with-it/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bayer ensures</span></a> that eligible US patients only see a $100 copay).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Dekkers’ quote brings into sharp relief the industry’s general ambivalence towards the developing world. A 2012 report from Doctors Without Borders <a style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px; padding: 0px;" href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/12/15/1336081/how-big-pharma-prevents-the-poor-from-accessing-life-saving-medicines/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">found</span></a> that most pharmaceutical companies devote only a small fraction of their operating budgets to fighting diseases that disproportionally affect — and kill — millions of the world’s poorest people.</span></p>
