                  More turning to 'Cupid concierges'
                  <br><br>
                  DEBBIE YONG The Business Times
                  <br><br>
                  
                  SO YOU went all out with that multiple-carat diamond ring or the all-expenses-paid holiday for your other half last Valentine's Day, but there's only one problem: Just how will you top that this year?
                  <br><br>
                  Don't despair, hapless Romeo (or equally time-strapped Juliet). There are people who can handle this professionally - and help is just a phone call away.
                  <br><br>
                  "Cupid concierges" are a growing business in countries such as the United States, and concierge-service operators in Singapore say they, too, are seeing more couples turn to them for some extra romancing on Valentine's Day.
              <br><br>    
                  The demand is expected to surge further this year with Valentine's Day falling on the 15th day of the Chinese New Year, or yuan xiao jie, signifying double happiness for many.
                  <br><br>
                  Mr James Eyton, the Asia-Pacific CEO of LesConcierges, which partners with credit card company Visa to offer concierge services to its top cardholders, has seen a 60 per cent increase in requests for romantic activities from the Singapore market on an annual basis, with most requests coming in the week before Feb 14.
                  <br><br>
                  Likewise, leading luxury concierge-service provider Quintessentially Lifestyles has seen a 30 per cent jump in demand during Valentine's Day over the past four years.
                  <br><br>
                  While most hotels offer ready-made Valentine's Day dining and staycation packages, top luxury names such as the St Regis Singapore, Pan Pacific and The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia hotels all have in-house concierge services that up the pizzazz by pairing them with tailor-made full-day itineraries including spa experiences, sunset cruises and other outings around town.
                  <br><br>
                  Flowers, restaurant meals, wedding proposals and trips to popular romantic destinations such as Bali are also common requests, say independent concierge-service operators, though, with growing affluence, customers are increasingly seeking private experiences in exclusive venues, such as truffle hunting in France or individual cooking classes with Michelin-starred chefs.
                  <br><br>
                  OUTSOURCE THE LEGWORK
                  <br><br>
                  Hate shopping? Outsource the task to The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia hotel's in-house concierge-service team, who can help you pick out jewellery and limited-edition shoes as gifts. Quintessentially's team once sourced a black crocodile Hermes Birkin bag worth $82,000 for a client, cutting its three-year waiting list to just three weeks.
                  <br><br>
                  "We've organised everything from a butler-serviced champagne dinner on top of an iceberg, to closing the Sydney Harbour bridge for a private proposal, and arranging a world-first opportunity for a couple to climb the Sydney Opera House and watch the New Year's Eve fireworks from the top of its 'sails'," recounts Quintessentially's executive director, Ms Caroline Lam.
                  <br><br>
                  Concierge businesses say the voraciously growing demand stems from heightened expectations of the highly commercialised holiday, coupled with the increasingly time-starved modern lifestyles of high-net-worth individuals.
                  <br><br>
                  "Roses are always lovely, but sometimes a little cliched. Singaporeans are all becoming much more creative and expressive in how we show our softer side to our loved ones, but don't necessarily have the tools to arrange such things," says CEO Andrew Long of Ten Group Asia Pacific.
                  <br><br>
                  Trying to get seats at a sell-out restaurant at the last minute? Strong relationships between concierges and chefs could sometimes be your ticket in, says Mr Eyton. "The strength of the concierges is that we are part-assistant, part-detective and part-magician."
                  <br><br>
                  Indeed, Aspire Lifestyles' most unusual request was from a customer in Singapore who wanted to send flowers to his girlfriend in Japan, but she would only give him a photo of the front gate of her house, and the longitude and latitude of the place, recalls Mr Andrew Quake, general manager of its Singapore office.
                  <br><br>
                  His team managed to locate her to send the flowers over eventually, after some sleuthing.
                  <br><br>
                  Though requests can take hours to days to pull off, depending on their complexity, Aspire's current record is a grand total of 40 minutes. 
                  <br><br>
                  "A customer from Singapore called at 8am, as he wanted a cup of hot latte delivered to his girlfriend in Seoul just before 9am, when she would step into the office. Eventually, we tapped on our network, and our consultants in Seoul managed to get it done successfully," adds Mr Quake.
                  <br><br>
                  Requests for Valentine's Day activities are typically from males, say concierge businesses, though there is equal demand from married and unmarried individuals.
                  <br><br>
                  Some concierge services such as Quintessentially charge an annual membership fee of $7,700 for unlimited requests, while others work based on commission from their service partners, so customers pay only for third-party costs incurred per request. 
                  <br><br>
                  Prices can start from a few dollars for a bouquet of flowers to US$250,000 (S$317,000) for a private charter of a yacht for an idyllic one-week sojourn that LesConcierges once organised.
                  <br><br>
                  And though Valentine's Day scrooges may say that leaving it all in the hands of a "Cupid concierge" reeks of insincerity, most concierges - of course - disagree.
                  <br><br>
                  "Most people have no problems engaging a wedding planner to ensure that their wedding turns out perfectly. No one would ever think that the man or woman lacks sincerity in this case. The same mindset should apply to Cupid concierges as well," retorts Mr Quake.

              <br><br>
              REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- Singapore has chalked out a three-point agenda with regard to its protest against Indonesia's recent decision to name its new ship, KRI Usman-Harun, according to an observer.
              <br><br>
              "The Singaporean government has finalized three key points in its national agenda, which is in keeping with its stance against naming of the new Indonesian ship as KRI Usman-Harun," Guspiabri Sumowigeno, the director of Center for Indonesian National Policy Studies (Cinaps), stated in Jakarta on Tuesday.
              <br><br>
              He explained that the first point in the agenda was that Singapore, as a US ally, was keen to garner attention from the superpower with regard to getting more military support by sending a message that it is threatened by the Indonesian military's revival.
              <br><br>
              He further added that Singapore has been diligently looking for a loophole to increase its military capacity and capability by supporting the US global policy. It has also offered itself as a buffer country for safeguarding the US interests in the region.
              <br><br>
              To support the "China Containment" campaign to block the effect of China's revival as a world superpower, it also sent its forces to support the US-led occupation operations in Iraq in 2003-2008, which resulted in the US offering strong military support to the country, he explained.
              <br><br>
              "Singapore's military development far surpasses its objective needs. Through an agreement with the US since 1990, its Sembawang military base has also been used as a maintenance facility by the US military," he remarked.
              <br><br>
              He reported that Singapore now has advanced military hardware. It has officially stated that its military budget reached US$4.8 billion and it also has 40 units of the F-16 fighter aircraft and tens of other fighter jets.
              <br><br>
              "Singapore is one of the Asian countries that is involved in the US research program for the development of the F-35 future fighter jet, which is a stealth fighter aircraft," he emphasized.
              <br><br>
              Guspi stated that in order to secure its sea area spanning only 12 sea miles around the island state, Singapore has tens of warships, four technologically advanced submarines and is still seeking to procure six stealth frigates from France, plus four AWACS aircraft that are capable of monitoring the entire South East Asian region.
              <br><br>
              He warned that the recent tensions between the two countries can be manipulated by Singapore to get additional military support from the US, by giving the impression that Singapore is threatened by two big countries in the region, namely Indonesia and China.
              <br><br>
              "This means that Singapore is seeking to build an international perception that Indonesia's military revival is equivalent to that of China threatening the South East Asian region," he pointed out.
              <br><br>
              "This is clearly hurting the spirit of cooperation that has been built over the past 40 years," he added.
              <br><br>
              Guspi explained that Singapore's second point of the agenda was its intentions to foster nationalism and improve its national identity.
              <br><br>
              He reported that Singapore has faced difficulties in nurturing nationalism among its citizens as they remain sharply divided on ethnic terms. There is also a common impression harbored by several people that Singapore is a mere gift from the colonial powers.
              <br><br>
              "This is what has robbed Singapore of its heroic and historic moments, and so, the history of confrontation with Indonesia has been considered its valuable asset in order to build Singapore's nationalism," he claimed.
              <br><br>
              Singapore's third point of the agenda is that the current regime in that country has been in power since the establishment of that country. Recently, voices have been raised regarding the authenticity of democracy in that country, Guspi stated.
              <br><br>
              The regime is fragile because the democratic process has so far been engineered to preserve its power, he claimed.
              <br><br>
              To prevent its popularity from declining and increasing demand for political reforms, it is now using its friction with other countries as one of its defense mechanisms, he added.
              <br><br>
              He added that the friction with other countries has re-strengthened the position of the ruling party.
              <br><br>
              Reconsolidation occurs in regime elements and in order to promote national unity, support to the government should be mobilized through mass movement and public opinion, Guspi emphasized.

              "The presence of a common enemy can distract people from social tensions, so that the political crisis, which has started to overshadow the nation, can be dwindled," he noted.
              <br><br>
              He explained that the pattern has also been used so far by Malaysia, which has always created problems for Indonesia.
              <br><br>
              It seems that Singapore's brittle regime is following the footsteps of similar regimes in Malaysia, he reported.
              <br><br>
              "All democratic political forces in Indonesia must be alert with regard to the presence of regimes, such as those in Singapore and Malaysia and take common actions to face them," he claimed.

               The New Paper
              <br><br>
               Tuesday, Feb 18, 2014
              <br><br>
               SINGAPORE - I keep that $2 note in my wallet's coin compartment. This way, I'll not spend it by accident.
              <br><br>
               Sure, the amount is small change by today's standards. Yet, this $2 note holds special meaning for me.
              <br><br>
               It was earned through sweat, and very nearly tears, and it reminds me of how, for some people, money is earned with much difficulty.
              <br><br>
               Toiling in the sun, picking up things that people discard, that is how they make a living.
              <br><br>
               On Thursday afternoon, I joined their ranks briefly at Serangoon Road, in search of cardboard boxes to be sold to recyclers. I wanted to find out if it is possible to earn a living this way.
              <br><br>
               My hunt began after seeing an advertisement on Facebook. One recycler was willing to pay 10 cents for 1kg of used cardboard cartons. There must be an error because the payout is too little, I thought.
              <br><br>
               But intrigued, I decided to give it a go.
              <br><br>
              A daily reality
              <br><br>
               At Veerasamy Road and Clive Street off Serangoon Road, 9 to 10 cents per kg is the daily reality for some senior citizens who form the lines at the two cardboard collection points.
              <br><br>
               They eagerly wait for the weighing scales to show a favourable weight.
              <br><br>
               "Gor chap kilo (50kg in Hokkien)... gor kor ($5)," Mr Lock Lee Jin, 50, who mans the collection point at Veerasamy Road, shouts to sweaty uncle Tan Kim Seng, 80.
              <br><br>
               It is demoralising to see others, who carry smaller hauls, being paid in coins. One elderly woman left with $1.50 after turning in 15kg of cardboard.

              Kirsten Han is a Singaporean blogger, journalist and filmmaker. She is also involved in the We Believe in Second Chances campaign for the abolishment of the death penalty. A social media junkie, she tweets at @kixes. The views expressed are her own. 
              <br><br>
              <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/why-controversial-pro-377a-guide-lawrence-khong-skewing-060344777.html">http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/why-controversial-pro-377a-guide-lawrence-khong-skewing-060344777.html</a>
              <br><br>
              Following the leak of a LoveSingapore document advising church leaders on how to mobilise supporters for Section 377A, chairman Lawrence Khong has come out to (once again) assure us all that he is not a homophobe.
              <br><br>
              â€œWe are not against people. Not even people who practise alternative sex,â€� he wrote in a statement to the press.
              <br><br>
              According to Khong, he and his fellow pro-377A campaigners are merely concerned about the nation, and concerned about families. They portray themselves as the valiant protectors of Singaporeâ€™s â€œsilent majorityâ€� and â€œmoral lawâ€�.
              <br><br>
              But itâ€™s all merely an illusion. LoveSingapore is a religious organisation, determined to influence Singapore â€“ a secular Singapore â€“ with their ideology.
              <br><br>
              â€œOur core values shape our dream to TURN this nation God-ward,â€� their website says. â€œIn a nutshell, since its inception, LoveSingapore is all about God's greatest glory seen through a life changed, a church revived, a nation transformed, a world evangelized.â€�
              <br><br>
              Khong has also made similar statements.
              <br><br>
              In a society as diverse as Singapore, how can -- and should -- such an organisation ever claim to represent a majority, silent or otherwise?
              <br><br>
              This could perhaps explain why LoveSingaporeâ€™s leaked guide also tells its readers to obscure their religious affiliations. It asks that church leaders do not use their church or religious rankings, and to use their personal email addresses rather than church ones. It wants its supporters not to be identified as coming from religious motivations, but to give people the impression that they are all simply concerned Singaporeans.
              <br><br>
              Itâ€™s highly disingenuous, robbing the public of the chance to consider their voice for what it is: an extremely vocal conservative Christian organisation aiming to influence policy and legislation with their particular brand of morality.
              <br><br>
              Their claim that it is â€œnot against peopleâ€� is also laughable. Khong and LoveSingapore have been obsessed with the issue of gay rights for a long, long time; perhaps spending far more time thinking about gay sex than gay people themselves do.
              <br><br>
              They claim not to be â€œagainst peopleâ€�, yet are ultra-sensitive to anything that might help a gay person.
              <br><br>
              They have been campaigning hard for the retention of 377A, portraying themselves as under siege from â€œhomosexual activistsâ€�, when the truth is that it's the equal rights advocates who have the uphill battle here.
              <br><br>
              They are so worried about any possibility of treating homosexuals with equality that they have pretty much begun campaigning against same-sex marriage before the conversation in Singapore has even gone that way.
              <br><br>
              Even the Health Promotion Boardâ€™s FAQ on sexuality was too much for them. Any presentation of information â€“ however backed up it might be by science and respected international organisations â€“ that does not label homosexuality as an abomination is unacceptable for Khong and LoveSingapore. They are not â€œagainst peopleâ€�, but they would deny said people access to information that could provide support and even save lives.
              <br><br>
              They are not â€œagainst peopleâ€�, but Khong has no problem lumping homosexuals in with wife-beaters, murderers and paedophiles.
              <br><br>
              â€œHate the sin but love the sinnerâ€� is a common enough religious teaching. But this is not what's happening in the case of Khong and LoveSingapore.
              <br><br>
              One cannot campaign so hard and for so long against the rights of gay people and still claim not to be against them. One cannot say things that are inflammatory and prejudicial against gay people and still claim not to be a homophobe.
              <br><br>
              Opposing the right of gay people to live and love as they want to is to be against them. Opposing the right of gay people to information on mental and sexual health is to be against them.
              <br><br>
              The issue of gay rights is an important one. Public discourse is important.
              <br><br>
              But we cannot let Khong and LoveSingapore dominate the discussion with their misrepresentation and prejudice.
