              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The 66-year-old nutritionist was, in some ways, the father of the food rights movement, having fought, often nearly alone, on various fronts over the last 15 years--in Los Angeles, in Washington DC, and in states around the country for legalization of raw milk sales and the rights of farmers to sell nutrient-dense food privately. It was his farm lease and food club models that were the basis of the arrangements used by Vernon Hershberger in Wisconsin and Alvin Schlangen in Minnesota. Those arrangements and a half dozen others were the common thread linking government legal assaults on farmers over the last half dozen years, described in my book, <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights</em>. Vonderplanitz’s agreements, formed under the auspices of a nonprofit organization he put together known as Right to Choose Healthy Food, mostly stood up well to the legal assaults. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">But Vonderplanitz seemed to be followed by controversy, never more so than when he went after his old partner in arms, James Stewart,  who launched the first Vonderplanitz-conceived private food club: Rawesome Food Club in Venice, CA., back in 2003 and 2004. Vonderplanitz began his assault on his former partner in October 2010, a few months after the initial government raid on Rawesome, accusing Stewart and a farmer who supplied Rawesome, Sharon Palmer, of misrespresenting eggs her farm supplied the food club. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Eventually, Vonderplanitz would go to the Ventura County District Attorney with his allegations, put up a web site to show off supposed evidence he had against Palmer,  and also file a civil suit against Stewart and Palmer. He abandoned the civil suit a few months ago, coming to a settlement that provided for him to take down the web site. He insisted after the settlement that he had additional evidence and allegations that he wanted to make public against Palmer. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">His seeming obsession with endlessly lashing out at Stewart and Palmer alienated many food rights supporters, and reportedly damaged his nutrition business. He advocated raw foods of all sorts as a means to fight disease and maintain health, and traveled around the U.S. and various parts of the world holding get-togethers where he would teach about his raw food concepts and diet. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><br></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">He grew up Richard Swigart, and changed his name in his early twenties. He also said he grew up autistic, and credited raw milk and carrot juice, consumed on the advice of a friend, with helping unshackle him from the effects of the condition. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Vonderplanitz died in a rural area of Thailand where he had a home, about three-and-a-half hours from Bangkok. According to close friend Larry Otting, Vonderplanitz was seriously injured a few days ago when he stepped out onto a second-story balcony on the house, and it collapsed or a railing collapsed. Vonderplanitz broke his back, and was taken to a local hospital where he was placed in traction. He was in such intense pain that he accepted pain-killing medication, and shortly after, went into a coma and died. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Otting is planning to travel to Thailand to retrieve Vonderplanitz’s body and bring it back to the U.S. Vonderplanitz has a son, whom Otting said was unable to make the trip. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">While he’s there, Otting says he plans “to investigate the balcony. It was strange that it just gave way like that.” </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Vonderplanitz related frequent tales about mysterious attempts on his life--he figured government or private corporate-hired agents working to derail his food rights activities were behind the efforts. In one episode a few years ago, he said he was tied to his bed in a hotel room in the Philippines while agents injected him with various toxic substances. In another last year, he said an auto he was driving in Thailand was sabotaged, causing it to roll over into a swamp; he and his girlfriend barely escaped from the car before they would have drowned, in his telling. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Ironically, Vonderplanitz was in Thailand in part because of yet another legal controversy. According to Otting, Vonderplanitz was helping Otting pursue a legal action against a Thai woman whom Otting had purchased a machine to make coconut cream. The woman had failed to deliver the machine after Otting and a group of investors had issued her a check for $5,000, he alleges. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Otting told me that Vonderplanitz didn’t have a direct interest in acquiring the coconut machine--it was being acquired by a business group Otting was involved with that wanted to produce a coconut cream sorbet. Vonderplanitz “was just a good guy. He was trying to get us a machine.” The machine uses the milk from coconuts to produce a creamier thicker  product than coconut milk. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Not surprisingly, reactions to Vonderplanitz’s death among food rights supporters varied widely. James Stewart, who adopted some of Vonderplanitz’s dietary recommendations to turn around various health problems he had had, said he had written Vonderplanitz an encouraging note earlier when he was hospitalized. After learning of Vonderplanitz’s death, Stewart wondered if his former colleague “had pushed the karmic envelope” in the controversy over Sharon Palmer. “If he does get reincarnated, he’ll come back and do a better job.” </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Otting said that Vonderplanitz “saved my life. I was headed downhill healthwise back in 1998. Using his diet, instead of losing wight and wasting away, I put on about thirty pounds.” Otting allowed that Vonderplanitz “went a little crazy about Sharon and James. But he felt he was lied to.” </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; min-height: 14px; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: normal; font-family: Cambria; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Otting expects there will be a funeral or memorial service of some kind, probably in Los Angeles, once he returns with Vonderplanitz’s body.</span></p>

              <p>The so-called Law of Attraction isn't some mysterious supernatural law, it's simply a common-sense observation, that when you're rich and healthier (ie. nature of work as powerful boss, better nutrition, more sleep, less stress, worry, medical bills, etc), you think/work/act more richly and hence create more personal/social/business opportunities to generate even more wealth. Conversely when you're poor and fear porverty (ie. nature of work as powerless employee, poorer nutrition, less sleep, more stress, worry, medical bills, etc), you think/work/act more poorly and hence limit or miss more personal/social/business opportunities to generate more wealth and instead head towards indebtedness. Thus, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. That's what the so-called Law of Attraction is really about.</p>

              <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's ex-girlfriend was reportedly executed by firing squad along with 11 others for allegedly making and selling a sex tape.</p>
              <p>According to a report in The Chosun Ilbo, Hyon Song Wol, a singer in North Korea's famed Unhasu Orchestra, was killed by machine gun along with 11 other members of the orchestra and the Wangjaesan Light Music Band</p>
              <p>The group had allegedly been arrested on Aug 17 for filming and selling a pornographic video featuring themselves.</p>
              <p>Their families were reportedly forced to watch the execution, after which they were sent to prison camps.</p>
              <p>Hyon was a popular North Korean singer who was famous for her 2005 hit 'Excellent Horse-Like Lady'.</p>
              <p>She is believed to have dated Kim in the early 2000's, after the young leader returned from boarding school in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Kim Jong Il however, reportedly disapproved of their relationship, and he ordered Hyon to leave the orchestra to keep her away from his son, who he was grooming to succeed him as Supreme Leader.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="font-family: century gothic;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Syria allies: Why Russia, Iran and China are standing by the regime </span></span><br><br></strong>By Holly Yan, CNN<br>August 30, 2013 -- Updated 0101 GMT (0901 HKT)<br><br><br><br>(CNN) -- Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime last week have heightened tensions internationally. There's been tough talk from Western leaders and a flurry of activity by the United States -- all of which seem to suggest that a military strike against the regime could be in the offing.<br><br>But through it all, Syria seems to retain the support of some good friends.<br><br>Why do Russia, Iran and China continue to support a regime that's accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in the 2-year-old civil war?<br><br>Here's why.<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;">RUSSIA</span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Why it cares: </span></span></strong><br><br>Two main reasons: One has to do with economics; the other with ideology.<br><br>a) <strong>Economics</strong>: Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers.<br><br>Syrian contracts with the Russian defense industry have likely exceeded $4 billion, according to Jeffrey Mankoff, an adjunct fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies Russia and Eurasia Program.<br><br>He noted the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated the value of Russian arms sales to Syria at $162 million per year in both 2009 and 2010.<br><br>Moscow also signed a $550 million deal with Syria for combat training jets.<br><br>Russia also leases a naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus, giving the Russian navy its only direct access to the Mediterranean, Mankoff said.<br><br>b) <strong>Ideology</strong>: Russia's key policy goal is blocking American efforts to shape the region.<br><br>Russia doesn't believe revolutions, wars and regime change bring stability and democracy. It often points to the Arab Spring and the U.S.-led war in Iraq as evidence.<br><br>Russia also doesn't trust U.S. intentions in the region. It believes humanitarian concerns are often used an excuse for pursuing America's own political and economic interests.<br><br>"Russia's backing of (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad is not only driven by the need to preserve its naval presence in the Mediterranean, secure its energy contracts, or counter the West on 'regime change,'" said Anna Neistat, an associate program director at Human Rights Watch.<br><br>"It also stems from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's existential fear for his own survival and the survival of the repressive system that he and al-Assad represent. In Putin's universe, al-Assad cannot lose because it means that one day he, Putin, might as well."<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">What it's saying: </span></span></strong><br><br>Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insists there's no proof yet Syria's government is behind the chemical weapons attack. And any plans to strike Syria would challenge provisions of the U.N. charter, the ministry said.<br><br>The ministry accused Washington of trying to "create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention."<br><br>On Wednesday, Russia walked out of a U.N. Security Council meeting where Britain was expected to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against Syria.<br><br>"The West handles the Islamic world the way a monkey handles a grenade," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin tweeted.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why it matters: </span></span></strong><br><br>Russia is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. It has the power to veto Security Council resolutions against the Syrian regime and has done so repeatedly over the past two years. So, if the United States and its allies are relying on a U.N. mandate to greenlight a military strike, they may be waiting a long time.<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: century gothic;"><span style="font-size: medium;">IRAN </span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Why it cares: </span></span></strong><br><br>Iran and Syria are bound by two factors: religion and strategy.<br><br>a) <strong>Religion</strong>: Iran is the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation. The Syrian government is dominated by Alawites, a Shiite offshoot, and the rebels are dominated by Sunnis.<br><br>That connection has bound them for quite a while. Iran counted on Syria as its only Arab ally during its eight-year war with Iraq. Iraq was Sunni-dominated.<br><br>The last thing Iran wants now is a Sunni-dominated Syria -- especially as the rebels' main supporters are Iran's Persian Gulf rivals: Qatar and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>b) <strong>Strategy</strong>: For Iran, Syria is also a strategically key ally. It's Iran's main conduit to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, the proxy through which Iran can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles.<br><br>In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks.<br><br>So, it's in Iran's interest to see al-Assad's regime remain intact.<br><br>Western intelligence officials believe the Islamic Republic has provided technical help such as intelligence, communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protests in Syria morphed into resistance.<br><br>A U.N. panel reported in May that Iranian weapons destined for Syria but seized in Turkey included assault rifles, explosives, detonators, machine guns and mortar shells.<br><br>Ayham Kamel of Eurasia Group believes the Iranians must be alarmed that the tide is turning against al-Assad.<br><br>"Iran probably has excellent information regarding Assad's position. That information would make clear that Iran is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region, greatly reducing its strategic reach," he said.<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">What's it saying: </span></span></strong><br><br>Iran has cast events in Syria as part of a much broader ideological battle. It's a "war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance," Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said.<br><br>Iran's position, as outlined by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and new President Hassan Rouhani, is that the Syrian government is a victim of international plots.<br><br>Iran believes the West and almost all Arab countries are in cahoots in an effort to implement regime change in Syria. Iran says the main objective of this plot is to make the region safer for Israel.<br><br>This week, Zarif warned of "graver conditions" in Syria is attacked.<br><br>"If any country attacks another when it wants, that is like the Middle Ages," Zarif said Wednesday.<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Why it matters: </span></span></strong><br><br>Many believe Iran is Washington's greatest threat in the region, especially with its nuclear potential. It's unclear how Iran might respond if Syria is attacked. But the rhetoric certainly has been ominous.<br><br>"Starting this fire will be like a spark in a large store of gunpowder, with unclear and unspecified outcomes and consequences," Khamenei told Iranian Cabinet members this week.<br><br>"The U.S. threats and possible intervention in Syria is a disaster for the region and if such an act is done, certainly, the Americans will sustain damage like when they interfered in Iraq and Afghanistan."<br><br><span style="font-family: century gothic;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">CHINA</span></strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Why it cares: </span></span></strong><br><br>China's relationship with Syria is more nuanced.<br><br>Some say it wants to maintain its financial ties. It was ranked as Syria's third-largest importer in 2010, according to data from the European Commission.<br><br>"Beijing's renewed interest in Damascus -- the traditional terminus node of the ancient Silk Road ... indicates that China sees Syria as an important trading hub," according to a 2010 report from The Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis institute.<br><br>But there's a bigger factor at play.<br><br>China has said foreign countries shouldn't meddle in Syria's internal affairs -- and perhaps for good reason. China has had its own share of international controversies over its policies with Tibet as well as allegations of human rights violations.<br><br>Finally, China doesn't want to reprise what happened with Libya.<br><br>It abstained from a U.N. Security Council resolution on that one, clearing the way for a NATO military intervention in Libya.<br><br>"It was rather disappointed with the payoff," said Yun Sun of the Brookings Institution, writing in the East-West Center's Asia Pacific Bulletin. "Neither the West nor the NTC (Libyan National Transitional Council) showed much appreciation for China's abstention."<br><br>So, he says, China has "formulated a far more sophisticated hedging strategy" when it comes to Syria.<br><br>"Rather than siding with either Assad or the opposition and standing aside to 'wait and see,' Beijing is actively betting on both."<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">What's it saying: </span></span></strong><br><br>China said it is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons and supports the U.N.'s chemical weapons inspectors.<br><br>It also said it wants a political solution for Syria -- though some say hopes for such an ending have waned.<br><br>"A political solution is always the only realistic means to resolve the Syria issue," Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.<br><br>Like Russia, China also walked out of Wednesday's U.N. Security Council meeting where Britain planned to pursue a resolution on Syria.<br><br><strong><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Why it matters: </span></span></strong><br><br>China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. And like Russia, China has repeatedly blocked sanctions attempts against the Syrian regime -- leading to a perpetual stalemate at the U.N. body to take any serious action on Syria. <br><br>CNN's Mariano Castillo, Catherine E. Shoichet, Ben Brumfield and Joe Sterling contributed to this report. <br></p></div>

              <p>A man who has been jailed for raping a woman is waiting to find out whether he has contracted HIV from her.</p>
              <p>Richard Thomas was sentenced to five years and four months after admitting raping the woman at her home in Leigh, Greater Manchester.</p>
              <p>He knew she was ill but did not know she had HIV and collapsed when police told him, Liverpool Crown Court heard.</p>
              <p>Thomas, 27, of Sandringham Drive, Leigh, raped the woman after she had taken a sleeping tablet.</p>
              <p>He said he had been drinking heavily and taken drugs, and could not recall the attack but believed the woman, the court heard.</p>
              <p>Thomas had let himself into the house uninvited in the middle of the night and the woman, who had taken a sleeping tablet, awoke to find him raping her.</p>
              <p>Harry Pepper, prosecuting, said: "She froze and no words were exchanged. He pulled up his shorts and left."</p>
              <p>Judge Mark Brown described the crime as "dreadful".</p>
              <p>Thomas is due to find out whether he has contracted HIV later in the week.</p>
              <p>His barrister, Virginia Hayton, said: "It is his own fault, if he had not committed this offence he would not have placed himself in this position."</p>

Though Harris considered selling the ring — he got it appraised for $4,000 — he ultimately couldn’t go through with it, and a few days later, he returned the ring to Darling.<br><br><img src="http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/j/streams/2013/August/130830/8C8802644-tdy-130830-BR-01.blocks_desktop_medium.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>“I am not trying to say that I am no saint, but I am no devil either,” he said at the time.<br><br>As a way to say thank you, Darling and her husband Bill Krejci started a fund to raise money for Harris to help him get his life back on track. “We set a goal for a thousand dollars,” Darling told TODAY in March. “We set it up because a lot of people who had been touched by the story expressed interest in helping Billy Ray.”<br><br>The fund raised far more than any of them expected — in just three months, people donated more than $190,000.<br><br><img src="http://msnbcmedia2.msn.com/j/streams/2013/August/130830/8C8804045-tdy-130830-BR-03.blocks_desktop_medium.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Harris talked to a lawyer, who helped him put the money in a trust. Since then, he’s been able to buy a car and even put money down on a house, which he’s fixing up himself.<br><br>And that's not all: After he appeared on TV, his family members, who had not been able to find him for 16 years and had heard rumors he was dead, were able to track him down. They were happily reunited, and Harris is now working on his relationship with them, including nieces and nephews he hadn’t even known existed.<br><br>"When I think of the past, I think, thank God that it's over," he told TODAY. "I mean, I feel human now." <br><br>And the Kansas City community hasn’t forgotten about Harris and his good deed. “I still see some of the same people,” he says, “but only now, instead of coming up and giving me change, they're coming up shaking my hand and, you know, saying ‘hey, good job’.”<br><br><img src="http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/streams/2013/August/130830/8C8802645-tdy-130830-BR-02.blocks_desktop_medium.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Since the fateful day that Darling’s ring landed in his cup, Harris’ life has done a 180. “This is what they call the American Dream,” he says. “I want to thank all the people that helped me out. I want them to see where all their efforts, blessings and kindness is going.”<br><br>And he has lifelong friends in the couple whose ring he returned.<br><br>Krejci and Darling now have a 20-month-old daughter, and they look forward to introducing her to Harris and explaining the role he played in her parents’ life. “I’ve talked to other mothers about this,” Darling says. “It gives [other moms] a real tangible story of really teaching kind of the difference between what’s wrong and what’s right."<br><br><img src="http://msnbcmedia1.msn.com/j/streams/2013/August/130830/8C8804203-tdy-130830-BR-04.blocks_desktop_medium.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Harris isn’t only good luck for the couple — he also appears to be good luck for the local baseball team! Krejci and Darling have taken Harris to six Kansas City Royals games, including one for Krejci’s recent birthday, and every single time the home team won.<br><br>“Overall, it just makes me feel good,” Darling says of the generous outpouring of support for Harris. “A lot of people came together to change this person's life when he is someone who really deserves that.”</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #0000cd; font-size: large;"><strong>Ikea at last cracks China market, but success has meant adapting to local ways<br></strong></span><span style="color: #0000cd;">Furniture giant has bent over backwards to accommodate Chinese keener on sleeping than shopping.<br>Sunday, 01 September, 2013, 6:10am<br><br>On a recent Saturday afternoon, Ikea's flagship mainland store - one of the world's largest - is abuzz with people. Walkways guiding visitors from one showroom to the next feel more congested than the road outside, and almost all 660 seats in the canteen are occupied. Yet the lines to the cashiers are refreshingly short - most are not here to shop.<br><br>The store is gripped by a kind of anarchy that would rarely be seen, or tolerated, in its country of origin. There are picnickers everywhere - their tea flasks and plastic bags of snacks lining the showroom tables. Young lovers pose for "selfies" in mock-up apartments they do not live in. Toddlers in split pants play on model furniture with their naked parts coming in contact with all surfaces.<br><br>On a king-size bed in the middle of the largest showroom, a little boy wakes from a nap next to his (also sleeping) grandmother. When the old woman casually helps the boy urinate into an empty water bottle, dripping liquid liberally on the grey mattress under his feet, most passers-by seem not to mind or even notice. The exception is a young woman who elbows her disinterested boyfriend: "Look, he's peeing into a bottle!"<br><br></span><a href="http://s1065.photobucket.com/user/joetys/media/SBF/7473f0cdc89423533845824616b76c4a.jpg.html"><span style="color: #0000cd;"><img src="http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u400/joetys/SBF/7473f0cdc89423533845824616b76c4a.jpg" border="0" alt=""></span></a><span style="color: #0000cd;"> <br><br>Most endemic, however, is the sleeping. After a few, rare clear days, the city's notorious heavy smog has returned, and is made worse by a sticky, dusty heat wave striking northern China. Weeks earlier, a photo of people napping in a Shanghai shopping centre to escape the searing heat went viral, but in the capital, it is Ikea's cool, conditioned air that is salvation for tens of thousands of its inhabitants.<br><br>The bedroom and living room sections on the store's third floor are the most popular. Virtually every surface is occupied by visitors appearing very much at home. Older people read newspapers or drink tea; younger visitors cuddle or play with their phones. Most, however, are sound asleep.<br><br>On an average day, the 42,000 square metre store lets 28,000 visitors through its doors - though this day might be particularly busy. And every day, Jason Zhang, who works in the bed section, patiently wakes up about a hundred of them.<br><br>"Excuse me, you can't sleep here," he says politely but firmly, waiting for the verbal abuse that often follows as he redirects them to a designated section near the canteen. "Other customers need to try the product. The resting area is just over there."<br></span><br><a href="http://s1065.photobucket.com/user/joetys/media/SBF/5ded67931ece9ff43ebbcafd3e671518.jpg.html"><img src="http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u400/joetys/SBF/5ded67931ece9ff43ebbcafd3e671518.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><span style="color: #0000cd;"><br><br>His efforts are mostly in vain. In the bedroom section, the few customers actually interested in buying mattresses struggle to find space to try them. Almost all the beds have people sprawled on them, or tucked in under colourful duvets, their shoes kicked off on the floor. In one showroom, two women and a baby are fast asleep in a bed, with a man, presumably the father, knocked out in an armchair next to it.<br><br>"I think it's just that shopping behaviour in China is very different," says Zhang, shrugging at the mayhem around him.<br></span></p></div>

              <p>An underage girl from China who went in search of a better-paying job to help clear her late father's debt was instead drugged, raped and forced to become a prostitute.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old Shandong native's ordeal, described by District Judge Low Wee Ping as "heartbreaking" and "horrific", was revealed in court on Wednesday (Sep 11) when three Singaporean men were sentenced to 11 weeks' jail each for having paid sex with her.</p>
              <p>The judge also chided their actions, telling one of the accused, Low Kia How, 50, that he is "a consumer of what we call international trafficking of a minor for prostitution".</p>
              <p>According to a report on The Straits Times, the court was told how the minor came about to be in her current plight.</p>
              <p>Her father had succumbed to cancer in October 2011, leaving behind a RMB100,000 (S$20,000) debt owed to relatives and loansharks for his medical treatment.</p>
              <p>The girl and her mother then seeked employment to pay off the debt, with the former landing a job at a hair salon.</p>
              <p>There, the owner suggested she work in a casino in Macau to earn more money, and brought her there. However, she could not find work there as she was below 18.</p>
              <p>It was then that she was tricked into meeting a Tang Huisheng, who drugged her with methamphetamine (Ice) and raped her. He also treated her as a sex slave, demanding her for sex every few days and forcing her into it by beating her if she refuses, reported The New Paper.</p>
              <p>He then told her he was taking her to Singapore to work as a prostitute so that she can earn more money, and that he would be her pimp.</p>
              <p>When she refused and begged him to let her go home, he locked her up in a room instead.</p>
              <p>She tried to escape by jumping out of the room, which was on the fifth storey, but ended up injuring her back and legs. She was caught by Tang and subsequently punished by him as he hit her on the back and chest.</p>
              <p>He then bought air tickets to Singapore, promising to let her return home after she worked as a prostitute here for two months.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, she was told to stand around Geylang to get customers and at the end of the day, he would take away all the money she made from prostituting herself.</p>
              <p>She worked in Geylang from May 18 to June 1, when she was arrested at about 5.10pm on the suspicion that she had been providing commercial sex while being below the age of 18.</p>
              <p>Tang is expected to be tried soon.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>Janice Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, whose traditional Hawaiian name comes from her late husband, said she would never consider using a shortened version, and so used local media to press officials to take action.</p>
              <p>"I love the Polynesian culture I married into, I love my Hawaiian name. It is an honour and has been quite a journey to carry the names I carry," Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, whose maiden name was Worth, told AFP.</p>
              <p>For years she has carried two forms of identification: her driving licence, which only has room for 34 characters, and her official Hawaii state ID card which in the past had room for all 35 letters.</p>
              <p>But the problem came after Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele's state ID was renewed in May -- and came back the same as her driver's licence, with the last letter missing, and with no first name.</p>
              <p>Then a traffic cop pulled her over. "The policeman looked at my licence and saw I had no first name. I told him it is not my fault that my licence and state ID are not correct and I am trying to get it corrected.</p>
              <p>"He then told me 'Well, you can always change your name back to your maiden name.' This hurt my heart," said Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, who was originally from New York and worked on Wall Street until 1991.</p>
              <p>"Over the last 22 years I have seen Hawaii is being bulldozed and the culture of Hawaii being trampled upon and this policeman treated my name as if it is some mumbo-jumbo," added Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele, whose friends call her "Loke."</p>
              <p>Exasperated, she took her case to a local TV station, KHON-2, who publicised the problem, putting pressure on the Hawaii Department of Transportation (DoT).</p>
              <p>Within days, authorities, who had previously told her it would take two years to change and the surname character limit would remain at 35, had decided they could act more quickly.</p>
              <p>"We understand how she feels and are working to correct the situation," Hawaii's DoT spokeswoman Caroline Sluyter told AFP.</p>
              <p>"By the end of the year, we should have the new character limits in place which will be 40 characters for the first and last names, 35 characters for the middle, and 5 for the suffix," she said.</p>
