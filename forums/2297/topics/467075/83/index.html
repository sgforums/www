              In regard to this article : <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/05/asia/singapore-smartest-kids/index.html">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/05/asia/singapore-smartest-kids/index.html</a>
                  <br><br>
                  
                  Many people think Singaporeans are only exam-smart because they blindly memorize and regurgitate. While that may apply somewhat to lower levels (eg. PSLE and O levels), it doesn't apply so much to higher levels, eg. A levels*, Olympiads, University levels. And at all levels, standards continue to increase and bell-curves continue to be steeper, due to increasing competition for academic qualifications and jobs, both intra-nationally and inter-nationally in an increasingly globalized context.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  *Singapore A levels are, by some standards and for some subjects, already more difficult than international A levels.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  In short, it is overly simplistic and wrong to say Singapore students are exam-smart merely because they blindly memorize. Blind memorization alone is increasingly insufficient for A level papers (eg. H2 Chemistry), and absolutely insufficient for Olympiads and international competitions.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  If Singaporeans always top the international rankings in mathematics and science, and are truly intelligent instead of blindly memorizing and regurgitation, why then (critics love to use this argument), has Singapore produced no Nobel prize winners?
                  <br><br>
                  
                  One major reason (there are others of course), which appears to have been overlooked by almost everyone else discussing this issue, is the exceedingly pragmatic Singaporean culture when it comes to money and career. (This holds true for other countries around the world as well, but especially for Singapore where costs of living continue to escalate amidst increasing competition from foreign talent and rising rentals by greedy REITS, even as the Sing dollar strengthens against other regional currencies... obviously there are unethical parties, organizations and industries covertly exploiting this, which is where all the money disappears to instead of benefiting the population... but that's the topic for another discussion altogether).
                  <br><br>
                  
                  Whilst ideally (and arguably), the most brilliant minds in any population should work and contribute to mankind's scientific advancement, but here in Singapore, other than Medicine, almost all the top students (who could have qualified for scientific careers) prefer the hugely more financially lucrative careers of banking and finance, law and other careers more profitable than in Science. The kiasu-ism and kiasi-ism, fear of not earning enough to survive or provide comfortably for your future family in increasingly competitive Singapore, coupled relentless societal pressure (eg. Hollywood glamorized Wall Street financial exploits, the proliferation of Top 10 Richest in Singapore / Asia / the World on the internet and social media), motivates one's greed to be the elite cream of the crop, the top 5% elite stratum of society right at the  of society, in this dog-eat-dog, survival of the fittest, rapidly globalizing Singapore.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  In short, this is one of the very real, major reasons, one that has been mostly overlooked and missed, why Singapore hasn't produced a Nobel prize winner. Not that there aren't any Singaporeans intelligent enough to do so, but that most Singaporeans strongly prioritize financial security and career stability over a PhD research career in the Sciences, which pays out a mere pittance of a fraction compared to careers in banking and finance.
                  <br><br>
                  
                  Banking and finance doesn't contribute anywhere as much benefit to mankind, as compared to science, medicine and technology; but it's where the money is, and therefore it's where most of the top brains, minds and students in Singapore, choose to go.

These unethical blokes earn way more than Lee Hsien Loong or any ministers, but they've contributed nothing towards the betterment of society (while PAP has arguably done a lot more good). Instead of minimum wage, all industries (especially those in the banking and finance related) should cut the obscene pay of the CEOs and top execs, and pay the low-wage foreign workers (rubbish cleaners, construction workers, etc) a lot better. Similarly, instead of increasing SBS and SMRT ticket prices, deduct from the obscene salaries of the CEOs and top execs. When she was CEO several years back, Saw Phaik Hwa (who lowered air-con in the MRT to pay herself more) admitted to drawing a $2 million dollar salary, owning 6 supercars (Ferraris, Lamborghini, Nissan GTRs, etc), and never having taken the MRT in her life. CEOs sure as hell don't deserve to be paid thousands of times more than the rubbish cleaners and construction workers, who actually work thousands of times harder than all these useless CEOs (way more useless than PAP, who at least have done some good for the country).</div>

Many (if not most) of the so-called Singapore-based companies in these industries that exploit foreign workers, are actually foreigner owned (eg. Malaysia, China, etc) companies with foreigner bosses, who are the ones guilty of exploiting their fellow countryman. It's not that there aren't any Singaporean employers guilty of exploiting foreign workers (of course there are), it's just that many people don't realize *most* of the exploiting employers / companies / bosses in these exploitative industries, are themselves foreigners.<br><br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blue-collar-workers-flock-singapore-230028522.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blue-collar-workers-flock-singapore-230028522.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Sodom and the neighbouring city of Gomorrah were destroyed by God, according to the Book of Genesis, because their inhabitants were riddled by sin and depravity. The final judgement was delivered after angels, disguised as men, were unable to find just 10 righteous people in the cities. However, life in the city appears to have come to a sudden halt near the end of the Middle Bronze Age and was all but abandoned for 700 years, say archaeologists.
