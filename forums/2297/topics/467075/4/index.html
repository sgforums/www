              <blockquote class="postcontent restore">May 5, 2013<br>Television Review<br>Foreign Bride as a Fetish and a Person<br>By MIKE HALE<br><br><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/05/06/arts/subseeking/subseeking-articleLarge.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Steven is a 60-year-old parking-garage attendant who lives in a small apartment above a store in the Northern California suburbs. He’s white, which is significant because he has what is politely known as an Asian fetish and popularly known as yellow fever. “They’re all so beautiful,” he says, looking at a display of thumbnail images of prospective Asian brides.<br><br>In the documentary “Seeking Asian Female,” showing on Monday night in the PBS “Independent Lens” series, Steven manages to persuade Sandy, a 30-year-old office worker from Shenzen, China, to come to the United States to marry him. And his good fortune doesn’t end there. The film’s director, who becomes immersed in Steven and Sandy’s lives and deeply implicated in the torturous course of their relationship, is Debbie Lum, an attractive young Chinese-American. When a friend of Steven’s comes to the apartment to meet Sandy, he sees Ms. Lum behind the camera and exclaims, “You’ve got two of them!”<br><br>Ms. Lum indicates that she set out to profile a man obsessed with Asian women in order to understand a phenomenon that has weighed on her own life: “I’ve been stared at, hit on and harassed by so many men like Steven,” she declares. “Seeking Asian Female” doesn’t have a lot to offer as anthropology, however. The nature of Asian fetishism remains as mysterious, or perhaps as obvious, as ever. Where the film succeeds is as an acerbic romantic comedy with Ms. Lum as a bumbling Boswell, alternately speeding the course of love or throwing up roadblocks.<br><br>As Steven and Sandy make wedding plans — her K-1 visa gives them four months to marry — fights erupt over money (he doesn’t have much) and whether he’s still infatuated with an earlier Chinese pen pal. Ms. Lum not only records these events but also becomes a semi-willing facilitator with divided loyalties, sympathetic to both her original subject and to the resourceful young woman stranded in a country whose language she barely speaks.<br><br>The dramatic arc of Steven and Sandy’s relationship (no spoilers here) is mildly suspenseful but also pretty familiar. Much more interesting is Ms. Lum’s willingness to portray herself as less than sympathetic, acknowledging — to some extent — her own preconceptions and serving as a stand-in for a skeptical and conflicted audience.<br><br>Though Steven’s predilections and creepy good cheer make her queasy, Ms. Lum is also suspicious of Sandy’s motives: “What kind of woman would move countries to marry a man she met online and barely knows?” Her knowledge of Chinese and the forced intimacy of filming conspire to make her Sandy’s best friend and lifeline, however; not sure how to handle the situation, she blunders along, warning Sandy at one point that Steven may not be “the guy you imagined him to be” and asking her at another, “Did you really just want the green card?”<br><br>Ms. Lum’s exploration of her assumptions goes only so far — ideas about sex and love are on the table, but issues of class and power that seem just as relevant to the story don’t receive the same attention. While Ms. Lum means to challenge stereotypes about cross-cultural romance and sexuality, her portrayal of Sandy often seems to echo a set of conventions about Asian women involving stubbornness, jealousy and manipulation.<br><br>What keeps this 54-minute film consistently engaging is Sandy herself, wary, pragmatic and, much to Ms. Lum’s good fortune, an absolute natural in front of the camera. Anyone with an Asian female in the family will feel a tug when she tells Ms. Lum, after another epic fight with Steven, “I kept wondering, has he eaten?”<br><br>Independent Lens<br><br>Seeking Asian Woman<br><br>On PBS stations on Monday night (check local listings).<br><br>Directed and produced by Debbie Lum; written and edited by Ms. Lum, Tina Nguyen and Amy Ferraris; Ms. Nguyen, Ali Sargent and Cianna Stewart, co-producers; Gordy Haab, composer; Stanley Tucci, host. </blockquote>

            <div class='col-md body'><p> I am a female exchange student who has been in Singapore for a term now. I have managed to fall in love with this country on so many levels during this time. I had almost come to the point where I felt that Singapore was my second home.<br><br>Yesterday however an incident occurred that made me pity Singapore and its people. Me and three of my girlfriends where hanging out in Clarke Quay. We were sober and was having a good time. At this point an older very large white man shows up and starts to talk very disrespectfully with us. Initially we ignore him and following I tell him to go away. The incident later escalates and the man starts approaching me. He keeps touching me and I keep pushing him off and at one point I tell him to move back and leave us alone or I would punch him. At this point the man literally has his chest at my head level and says "what are you going to do?". I push him away as hard as I can and start screaming at the top of my voice. I tell him to leave me alone and to stop following me and stop touching me. My friends are screaming at this point too and pulling me off from the scene.<br><br>What bothers me is that this happened in the middle of Clarke Quay. We were surrounded by grown men and people and NOT ONE PERSON HELPED!!! One guy even took out his phone to film the situation.<br><br>I am not expecting people to act like a night in shining armour, or to come and punch this guy. I am expecting people to have the balls to stand up for you opinions. To react to injustice, to make your voice heard. I expect that weather its men or women to take a stand.<br><br>You read about incidents of violence and abuse and even rape happening in public and people not reacting to it. Yesterday I witnessed it. Singapore is a country where a girl could be raped/abused/harassed in the middle of street and nobody would react even though she screams for help on top of her voice.<br><br>There may be some of you that will think that I should just have walked away and that I brought this on my self. If had only walked away I would be the victim. I refuse to be the victim. Unlike most girls I made myself heard and hopefully next time the asshole tries to harass girl he will think twice.<br><br>I dont feel like a victim, but I feel pity for you Singapore. You pride yourself in artificial decor. You make millitary service mandatory for the men in your country, yet you have failed to build any real men in your country.<br><br>I ask of you admin to post this, not as complaint on this country, but an indicator for people to start standing up. To remember to treat your women as your peers because in the end, to quote Mr. Brown "This may be a man's world, but it would be nothing without women..."<br><br>Disappointed-In-Singapore Exchange Student</p></div>

Meanwhile, the Indonesian Feminists Association told local media they will attempt to block the smelly law as they deem it discriminatory.<br><br>Talking to The Wadiyan, mayor Sayyid Yahia said the law aims to save people’s morals and behaviors. “When you see woman fart loud, she appears like a man. But if she sit sideways and pass it quietly, she looks like a woman,” Sayyid said.<br><br>Although the proposed law does not ban “quiet fart,” passing gas with sound is actually not uncommon in Southeast Asia, particularly for women consuming potatoes and peas. Obviously, women maintain that they feel healthier, farting loud. Fathima Khan, a medical doctor at the Al Banni Islamic Hospital in Aceh’s capital is critical of the proposed law: “There is no need to question this practice, let alone regulate it, because people do it for their health and safety,” she said.<br><br>The mayor declined to give The Wadiyan details of what the punishment would be for violators. While another member at the City council, who wished not to be named, said if convicted by the sharia court, the offender could receive 20 lashes for small farts and up to 3 months prison time for larger ones.<br><br>On another note, the local Islamic scholars were mostly divided over the law. Well-known Muslim activists like Bshar Abdulla voiced his objection, “How to pass gas is not regulated in Sharia. There is no mention of it in the Koran,” he said on his Twitter account. However, “the Islamic tradition and the values of modesty does not support women farting loud,” said Mehmood Hussain, a scholar and stenchy supporter of the law.<br><br>Under the new regulation, the mayor says that only women in the public space are going to be monitored. “It will be the responsibility of the husband to make sure that his wife upholds Islamic values at home”. He also argued that there is no scientific evidence supporting health benefits of passing gas, in Koran.<br><br>The City council will be evaluating the regulation in a week, after which it could turn into a by-law.<br><br><img src="http://wadiyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Fart-banned-801x1024.jpg" border="0" alt=""> </blockquote></div>

              <p><br><strong>4 Things Rich People Should Stop Saying</strong><br><br>By <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/author/ryanong/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Ryan Ong</span></span></a> in <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/category/featured-post/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Featured Post</span></span></a>, <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/category/money-talks/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Money Talks</span></span></a> | <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/2013/05/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">May 10, 2013</span></span></a> 6 Comments <br><br><br>I have nothing against rich people. Hell, I’m hoping to become rich too. And if you ask around, some people would place me in…would place me in the “not poor” category, let’s leave it at that. But that being said, I want to point out that there are some <em>seriously annoying</em> rich people in this country. Not because they have money, but because they like to say the following crap. If you’re one of them, please stop it:<br><br><a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/5072266832_ec08059681_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/5072266832_ec08059681_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Actually, the city lights are off. That’s the glint of money.<br><br><br><strong>1. If You’re Not Rich, It’s Your Own Fault</strong><br><br>Ah, the meritocracy argument. The belief that effort <em>always</em> correlates to success.<br>This belief conveniently ignores context. See,<em> certain professions pay better at different times and places</em>. If this were the 1940s, for example, my pay as a writer would kick seven shades of faeces out of a movie director. And if we were in the Middle Ages, we’d probably point at doctors and say <em>“That’s what happens when you don’t study hard</em>“.<br>Now, let’s look at 21st century Singapore: No matter how much effort a mechanic, cleaner, or childcare teacher puts in, that person will not earn more than an investment banker.<br>That isn’t necessarily because investment bankers work harder, or somehow contribute more to society (in fact, the closer to manual labour a job is, the more likely it is to directly benefit society). It’s just that the current economy makes banking a more profitable trade.<br><br><a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4160430749_23e274ab9d_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4160430749_23e274ab9d_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> If we can save the company $5 million, we might get an extra sandwich at lunch.<br><br><br>The investment bankers, like the app developers who work five hours a week, happened to be in the right place at the right time. They’re rich partly due to <em>circumstance</em>, and not because they’re inherently superior beings launched from Krypton.<br>I’m not suggesting they didn’t do any work to get there. Or that they don’t have talent. I’m just saying they need to acknowledge it’s not just will, but also circumstance (including educational opportunities) that gave them their success. And maybe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moneysmartsg?fref=ts"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">following us on Facebook</span></span></a>, because we talk about career upgrading all the time.<br>And that sometimes, people can’t succeed because they’re in the wrong place or time. Not because they don’t try as hard.<br><br><strong>2. Mocking the Amount of Money Involved in Scandals</strong><br><br>When a scandal hits the front page, there’s a lot of public indignation. Maybe someone <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/nparks-officer-suspended-for-foldable-bikes-purchase-worth-s-57-200.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">seriously overpaid for bicycles</span></span></a>, or the director of a charity fund decides “<em>Hey, you know what would help impoverished kidney patients? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Kidney_Foundation_Singapore_scandal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">A golden tap</span></span></a> in my office</em>.”<br>When that happens, we’re all shaken. It ruins our trust in charities, government bodies, etc. But then a small percentage of our population (typically the rich) will say something stupid. Stuff like:<br>“<em>Come on, $X dollars only? That sort of money is nothing! Why are you people getting worked up over what is, to me, a tiny amount?”</em><br>It gets even worse when backed by arguments like:<br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>$2,000+ is an okay price for a bicycle. I mean, who can’t afford to pay that money for a bit of convenience?</li>
              <li>Compared to how much swindler X made for charity / the government / a company, the money he took is no big deal</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Those arguments are (1) a slap in the face, and (2) missing the point.<br><br><a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3053052083_843c0af5b9_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3053052083_843c0af5b9_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Eh, I provide a LOT of policemen with jobs okay? Now put the money in the bag.<br><br><br>A few thousand, or hundred thousand, is not a small amount of money. It might <em>seem</em> that way, if you have a District 9 condo worth a Saudi Prince’s harem.<br>But for many Singaporeans, an amount like $57,000 could pay their HDB loan for years. When rich people roll their eyes at the “trivial” amounts, it’s no less than a wealthy, fat tourist waving a a drumstick at hungry villagers. We’re happy you’re rich and all, but you don’t have to act like a contemptuous dic…person.<br>Second, we’re not outraged at the amount of money involved. We get that, when someone commits a commercial crime, it isn’t so he can buy a $2 Slurpee. We’re outraged at the betrayal of trust.<br>It’s not about whether $10,000 or $10 was wrongfully taken. The point is that <em>it was wrongfully taken</em>. If your 10 year old son steals $20 out your wallet, how would you feel? Betrayed and alarmed? Or would you laugh and say “<em>Hell, it’s just $20?” </em><br><em>That’s</em> what we’re pissed about. And that’s why rich people need to lay off the “He may have stolen $X, but he made $Y” argument. It misses the point.<br><br><strong>3. Dispensing Advice That Only Other Rich People Can Use</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1969543922_d3790c8f75_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1969543922_d3790c8f75_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> “Well if it takes that long to maintain the building, you ought to hire yourself a secretary.”<br><br><br>Rich people who were born poor will never do this. But Singapore is home to the occasional heir, who never had to earn his money. And when that person gives advice, I cringe.<br>Mostly, the advice sounds like this:<br>Poor Man: <em>I don’t even have a bowl of Yong Tau Foo, I’m starving man.</em><br>Rich Brat: <em>Then why don’t you drink some Bird’s Nest? It’s very filling.</em><br>Other examples are:<br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Suggesting your relieve stress by taking a one month holiday, and not understanding why you can’t do this</li>
              <li>Wondering why you won’t go on an all salmon diet and sign up for a $3,000 Yoga class, when it’s for your own health</li>
              <li>Asking why you don’t just “take a cab there”. Every. Damn. Time.</li>
              <li>Suggesting you cure your poverty by investing in property or gold. Because he thinks someone who makes $1,200 a month is in a position to do this.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Look, if you inherited money, congratulations. We’re all happy for you. But if you’re going to walk around dispensing advice, may I suggest you<em> listen</em> first?<br>Perhaps if you spent less time talking, and more time understanding the issues of the less fortunate, you’d be able to make a real contribution.<br><br><strong>4. Saying That Money Trickles Down, Even if You Won’t Invest in Us</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/8117772216_a32f350fa3_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.moneysmart.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/8117772216_a32f350fa3_n.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Think of it as importing gold, except it walks, talks, and has a worse attitude.<br><br><br>Do you invest in local start-ups? Contribute a lot to charity? If you do, you <em>sort of</em> have a right to use the “trickle down” argument.<br>But you need to realize some rich people are just here to stash money, or for the tax breaks. Or to buy our property. And that money doesn’t “trickle down”. It sloshes around in their bank account, never circulating into our society.<br>Saying it “trickles down” is like putting a bag of plasma in my hand, and telling me if I hold it long enough I’ll have a full blood transfusion.<br>So if you’re one of those rich people who walk around saying: “<em>Singaporeans suck, they have no creativity, I’ll never invest here, blah blah blah</em>“, then stop using terms like “trickle down” or “a rising tide lifts all boats”. You do nothing for us. We’re doing<em> you</em> the service, by giving you a low-tax residence that you contribute diddly squat to.<br>Now back in the ’70s and ’80s, people didn’t put their money here because we’re a tax haven. Or because it’s easy to import cheap labour here. They came here to set up businesses and <em>invest in our workforce</em>, because we had the best and brightest.<br>They believed in us. Hell, we believed in ourselves. And as a consequence, we got richer together. Now <em>that’s</em> a trickle down effect. If we’re lucky, we’ll recapture that spirit.<br>But in the meantime rich guy, unless you actually invest in us, lay off the trickle down arguments.</p>
