              <p>A 14-year-old girl was helping her father at his drinks stall in a hawker centre at Toa Payoh Lorong 8 when her hand got caught in a sugarcane juicer.</p>
              <p>According to a report in The New Paper, the machine exerted so much pressure on Tan Li Xuan's hand that it crushed three fingers and tore off the skin on the wrist. </p>
              <p>Shin Min Daily News reports that the incident took place at around 8.40pm on Sunday (Dec 22).</p>
              <p>Li Xuan's father, Mr Tan Ah Guan, said he was packing some things when he suddenly heard his daughter shouting.</p>
              <p>When he turned over, he saw her right hand stuck in the machine.</p>
              <p>He immediately cut off the power to stop the machine and called the police and the SCDF.</p>
              <p>The machine was dismantled before Li Xuan's hand was freed. She was sent to Tan Tock Seng hospital. </p>
              <div>According to a report in The Straits Times, Li Xuan's grandmother suspects she had been trying to dislodge a jammed piece of sugarcane when the accident happened.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mr Tan had forbidden his three teenage children from operating the previous juicer, and had swopped the machine for a safer one just three weeks ago.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Li Xuan, a student of Guangyang Secondary School, had been helping out with the new juicer since it arrived, and was eager to ease her father's workload. </div>

              <p>Like it or not, it's genetically predetermined : Whites (both males and females) are perceived as more masculine, while EastAsians (both males and females) are perceived as more feminine. Hence, it's no wonder most men (both Whites and EastAsians) prefer EastAsian girls, while most girls (both Whites and EastAsians) prefer White men.</p>

              <p><strong>Confession pages are all the rage. Here is STOMP's choice of confession of the day. </strong></p>
              <p>Today's confession was penned by a NUS exchange student who wants to share about the amount of attention girls in Singapore gave him just because he is a foreigner.</p>
              <p><span><span>Here is the confession in full:</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>"Compared to my girlfriend I am average looking. In fact, all my friends can't believe why she fell for me and they tease me all the time.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>"When I went on exchange to Singapore, she was very worried that I'd cheat. I assured her and believed that the thought would never cross my mind.</span></span></p>
              <p>"However I was not prepared for the amount of attention females in Singapore would give to a white guy.</p>
              <p><span><span>"Its not just the<span> clubs that my exchange friends pulled me into; girls will get my number and follow up with "dates" even after a simple chat after class.</span></span></span></p>
              <p>"With so much attention showered on me, the temptation to cheat became very strong.</p>
              <p><span><span><span>"It culminated to the point when one of my female friends made a move on me and I seriously considered going ahead with the physical intimacy. For some reason I pulled myself away.</span></span></span></p>
              <p>"I realize that this must be something my girlfriend faces all the time, and yet she still stays faithful to me.</p>
              <p><span><span><span>"I didn't cheat in the end, but I'd like to say that changes in one's desirability can really change our views. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>"The same situation probably happens when an Singaporean girl goes to the West for an exchange as well. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span>"Singaporean guys will probably never experience this, and sadly will never understand."</span></span></span></p>

              <p>The first money pit is an actual pit — the <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porgera_Gold_Mine"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Porgera</span></span></a> open-pit gold mine in Papua New Guinea, one of the world’s top producers. The mine has a terrible reputation for both human rights abuses (rapes, beatings and killings by security personnel) and environmental damage (vast quantities of potentially toxic tailings dumped into a nearby river). But <a title="Fed data" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GOLDAMGBD228NLBM"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">gold prices</span></span></a>, while down from their recent peak, are still three times what they were a decade ago, so dig they must.</p>
              <p>The second money pit is a lot stranger: the <a title="Dealbook" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/into-the-bitcoin-mines/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Bitcoin mine</span></span></a> in Reykjanesbaer, Iceland. Bitcoin is a digital currency that has value because ... well, it’s hard to say exactly why, but for the time being at least people are willing to buy it because they believe other people will be willing to buy it. It is, by design, a kind of virtual gold. And like gold, it can be mined: you can create new bitcoins, but only by solving very complex mathematical problems that require both a lot of computing power and a lot of electricity to run the computers.</p>
              <p>Hence the location in Iceland, which has cheap electricity from hydropower and an abundance of cold air to cool those furiously churning machines. Even so, a lot of real resources are being used to create virtual objects with no clear use.</p>
              <p>The third money pit is hypothetical. Back in 1936 the economist John Maynard Keynes argued that increased government spending was needed to restore full employment. But then, as now, there was strong political resistance to any such proposal. So Keynes whimsically suggested an alternative: have the government <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter10.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bury bottles full of cash</span></span></a> in disused coal mines, and let the private sector spend its own money to dig the cash back up. It would be better, he agreed, to have the government build roads, ports and other useful things — but even perfectly useless spending would give the economy a much-needed boost.</p>
              <p>Clever stuff — but Keynes wasn’t finished. He went on to point out that the real-life activity of gold mining was a lot like his thought experiment. Gold miners were, after all, going to great lengths to dig cash out of the ground, even though unlimited amounts of cash could be created at essentially no cost with the printing press. And no sooner was gold dug up than much of it was buried again, in places like the gold vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where hundreds of thousands of<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/central-banking-with-other-peoples-gold-a-368bn-treasure-trove-in-lower-manhattan/5320276"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"> gold bars</span></span></a> sit, doing nothing in particular.</p>
              <p>Keynes would, I think, have been sardonically amused to learn how little has changed in the past three generations. Public spending to fight unemployment is still anathema; miners are still spoiling the landscape to add to idle hoards of gold. (Keynes dubbed the gold standard a “<a href="http://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/keynes-essaysinpersuasion/keynes-essaysinpersuasion-00-h.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">barbarous relic</span></span></a>.”) Bitcoin just adds to the joke. Gold, after all, has at least some real uses, e.g., to fill cavities; but now we’re burning up resources to create “virtual gold” that consists of nothing but strings of digits.</p>
              <p>I suspect, however, that Adam Smith would have been dismayed.</p>
              <p>Smith is often treated as a conservative patron saint, and he did indeed make the original case for free markets. It’s less often mentioned, however, that he also argued strongly for bank regulation — and that he offered a classic paean to the virtues of paper currency. Money, he understood, was a way to facilitate commerce, not a source of national prosperity — and paper money, he argued, allowed commerce to proceed without tying up much of a nation’s wealth in a “<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">dead stock</span></span></a>” of silver and gold.</p>
              <p>So why are we tearing up the highlands of Papua New Guinea to add to our dead stock of gold and, even more bizarrely, running powerful computers 24/7 to add to a dead stock of digits?</p>
              <p>Talk to gold bugs and they’ll tell you that paper money comes from governments, which can’t be trusted not to debase their currencies. The odd thing, however, is that for all the talk of currency debasement, such debasement is getting very hard to find. It’s not just that after years of dire warnings about runaway inflation, inflation in advanced countries is clearly too low, not too high. Even if you take a global perspective, episodes of really high inflation have become rare. Still, hyperinflation hype springs eternal.</p>
              <p>Bitcoin seems to derive its appeal from more or less the same sources, plus the added sense that it’s high-tech and algorithmic, so it must be the wave of the future.</p>
              <p>But don’t let the fancy trappings fool you: What’s really happening is a determined march to the days when money meant stuff you could jingle in your purse. In tropics and tundra alike, we are for some reason digging our way back to the 17th century.</p>

              <p>Excerpt from this excellent article :<br><a href="http://majorityrights.com/weblog/comments/the_evolution_of_gang_violence_in_australia">http://majorityrights.com/weblog/comments/the_evolution_of_gang_violence_in_australia</a></p>
              <p>But even more frustrating for operational police were the activities of this ethnic crime group, activities that set it apart from almost all others bar the Cabramatta 5T. The Lebanese groups were ruthless, extremely violent, and they intimidated not only innocent witnesses, but even the police that attempted to arrest them. As these crime groups encountered less resistance in terms of police operations and enforcement, their power grew not only within their own communities, but also all around Sydney — except in Cabramatta, where their fear of the South-East Asian crime groups limited their forays. But the rest of Sydney became easy pickings.</p>
              <p>AN EXAMPLE of the confrontations police nearly always experienced in Muslim-dominated areas when confronting even the most minor of crimes is an incident that occurred in 2001 in Auburn. Two uniformed officers stopped a motor vehicle containing three well known male offenders of Middle Eastern origin, on credible information via the police radio that indicated that the occupants of the vehicle had been involved in a series of break-and-enters. What occurred during the next few hours can only be described as frightening.</p>
              <p>When searching the vehicle and finding stolen property from the break-and-enter, the police were physically threatened by the three occupants of the car, including references to tracking down where the officers lived, killing them and “fucking your girlfriends”. The two officers were intimidated to the point of retreating to their police car and calling for urgent assistance. When police back-up arrived, the three occupants called their associates via their mobile phones, which incidentally is the Middle Eastern radio network used to communicate amongst gangs. Within minutes as many as twenty associates arrived as well as another forty or so from the street where they had been stopped. As further police cars arrived, the Middle Eastern males became even more aggressive, throwing punches at police, pushing police over onto the ground, threatening them with violence and damaging police vehicles.</p>
              <p>When the duty officer arrived, he immediately ordered all police back into their vehicles and they retreated from the scene. The stolen property was not recovered. No offender was arrested for assaulting police or damaging police vehicles.</p>
              <p>But the humiliation did not end there. The group of Middle Eastern males then drove to the police station, where they intimidated the station staff, damaged property and virtually held a suburban police station hostage. The police were powerless. The duty officer ordered police not to confront the offenders but to call for back-up from nearby stations. Eventually the offenders left of their own volition. No action was taken against them.</p>
              <p>In the minds of the local population, the police were cowards and the message was, Lebs rule the streets. For a number of days, nothing was done to rectify this total breakdown of law and order. To the senior police in the area, it was more important to give the impression that local ethnic relations were never better. It was also important to Peter Ryan that no bad news stories appeared that may have given the impression that crime in any area was out of control. Had these hoodlums been arrested they would have filed Internal Affairs complaints immediately via their Legal Aid lawyers and community leaders.</p>
              <p>SO WITH a police force on the verge of bankruptcy, the Middle Eastern crime problem was an explosion waiting to go off. I had observed the beginnings of Asian organised crime whilst at the Drug Squad and later at the National Crime Authority where I worked on two task forces, one of which was on Chinese organised crime. When I look back on the influence of Chinese organised crime in Australia, I see a gradual but sustained trend, not one of high peaks in terms of activity or incidents, but one of a well planned criminal enterprise that attracts little attention. It’s there but you can’t always see it.</p>
              <p>It probably took twenty years for the Chinese to become a dominant force in crime in this city. But Middle Eastern crime has taken less than ten years. So pervasive is their influence on organised crime that rival ethnic groups, with the exception of the Asian gangs, have been squeezed out or made extinct. The only other crime group to have survived intact are the bikies, although the bikies these days have legitimised many of their operations and now make as much money from legal means as they do illegally. In many ways they have adopted US Mafia methods of legitimate businesses shrouding their illegal operations.</p>
              <p>With no organised crime function, no gang unit except for the "South-East Asian Gangs Strike Force", the New South Wales Police turned against every convention known to Western policing in dealing with organised crime groups. In effect the Lebanese crime gangs were handed the keys to Sydney.</p>

              <p>Visitor comment posted by Ashish :</p>
              <p>One thing that stuck me immediately on reading the article (see preceeding post), is the similarity to the problem of gang warfare in Mumbai in India in the early part of this decade. From just fighting amongst themselves, the gangs turned to extorting money from professionals and businesses and started demanding “protection” money to allow them to continue in the city. Starting with the film industry, doctors, lawyers, businessmen etc. i.e just about anyone and all business who made a decent amount was getting threatening phone calls and people were being killed if they went to the police or did not pay up.</p>
              <p>These gangs, with predominantly muslim membership, carved the city into areas, with each gang controlling an area, or multiple areas. They were helped by the politicians and people were scared to say anything against them, so crimes were not reported and the gangs flourished.  The gangs became brazen enough to start attacking the police, knowing that the human rights commission, would always spring to their defense. Funny how there are human rights for criminals, but none for the upholders of the law, and law-abiding citizens.</p>
              <p>The approach of the Mumbai police to solve this issue was brutal, but effective and many of the cops became heroes. The cops created a department called as the Special Crime Branch - whose only mission was to clean the city of these vermin. These cops attacked the gang members and bumped (ie. assasinated) them off one by one by the way of staged “encounters” or "accidents". Over a period of 5 years they cleaned the city and killed more than 500 gang criminals who had taken the city hostage. This resulted in many gangsters relocating to countries like Pakistan, Malaysia and the Middle East, based on their religious identities and the fact that these countries dont have extradition treaties with India.</p>
              <p>There can be protests made by human rights activists, but the ordinary citizens of the city are thankful to the police for what they did.</p>

              <p>Phantom Cats or Alien Big Cats, are unusual in the sense that, unlike other crypto species where you don't even know what the creature is, in this case it seems quite clearly to be a panther (or similar species), but the mystery then becomes, why can't we find conclusive evidence of the Phantom Cat's existence, other than multiple sightings? It's almost as if the Phantom Cat was extraphysical / non-physical / supernatural.</p>

              <p>STOMPer <strong>Chuckz </strong>has come forward with a video of the incident where  <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/man-attacks-models-at-circular-road-till-one-hits-her-head-on-a-rock"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #500080;">three female models suffered injuries from a confrontation with a man at Circular Road</span></span></a> on Dec 12. </p>
              <p>Models Kuek Ziyi, 23, had been driving two of her friends, Anna Huang, 21, and Esther Lee, 19, to Boat Quay for supper, at around 3am. They claimed that a guy had blocked their path and turned aggressive when they honked at him. He had kicked their car which resulted in the scuffle. </p>
              <p>The STOMPer, a friend of the man involved in the confrontation, said however that the incident had started because the models' car had bumped into his side. Out of anger, he kicked their car.</p>
              <p>Chuckz said:</p>
              <p>"From what I know, the minute the girls came out of the car, they started pushing and beating the guy. </p>
              <p>"Out of self-defense, he pushed and kicked them away.</p>
              <p>"One girl actually punched him right in the face when he was held by people on both sides."</p>
              <p>According to him, the man was actually alone and did not have any friends with him. Passers-by had stopped to help break up the fight.  </p>
              <p>He added:</p>

              <p>Probe luxury condo buy by Rosmah’s son, opposition urges anti-graft body<br><br>BY YISWAREE PALANSAMY</p>
              <p>DECEMBER 28, 2013 04:05 PM<br><br>The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has been urged to investigate the purchase of a RM110 million luxury condominium in New York by the son of the prime minister Najib Razak’s wife, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor <br><br>PKR vice-president and Batu MP Tian Chua, in making the call, also took MACC to task for its apparent failure to convict high-ranking Barisan Nasional (BN) leaders who have made headlines for alleged corruption.<br><br>Referring to a report by whistleblower portal Sarawak Report, citing a New York real estate website, that 36-year-old Riza Shahriz Abdul Aziz had bought the property in November last year, Tian Chua said: “The revelation is shocking. At a time when the people are struggling with the cost of living, some are splurging.<br><br>"Where did he (Riza Shahriz) get that much money? RM110 million is a lot.”<br><br>Riza Shahriz is Rosmah’s son from a previous marriage.<br><br>The Sarawak Report cited The Real Deal, which said Riza bought the seven-bedroom property at West 63rd Street in Park Laurel, New York, on November 19 last year.<br><br>Tian Chua said such lavish spending by Najib's family was proof they were living beyond their means and as such the MACC should take action.<br><br>"There is all this evidence that the prime minister's family is clearly living beyond their means.<br><br>“Where did they get so much money?" he asked.</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>How did PM Najib's step-son come about having so much money?<br><br><em>Quote :<br>"According to reports by the French newspaper "Liberation", Altantuya found out that one of the parties involved in negotiations, Spanish company Armaris, paid out commissions of 114 million euros for the deal (reportedly one billion euros or RM4.7 billion for the purchase of three submarines). The commission was credited in the accounts of a company controlled by Najib Razak, Perimekar."</em></p>

              <p id="eow-description">Psychologist Kevin Dutton presents the classic psychological test known as "the trolley problem" with a variation. Take the test and measure your response on the psychopathic spectrum.<br><br>Transcript--<br>We all know about the psychopath's enhanced killer instinct, their finely tuned vulnerability antennae. But it may surprise you to know that there are some situations in<br>which psychopaths are actually more adept at saving lives than they are at taking them.<br>So let me give you an example of what I mean by that, okay?  Imagine you've got a train and it's hurtling down a track.  In its path, five people are trapped on the line and cannot escape. Fortunately, you can flick a switch, which diverts the train down a fork in that track, away from those five people, but at a price. There is another person trapped down that fork and the train will kill them instead. Question:  Should you flick the switch?<br><br>Now, most people have little trouble deciding what to do under those circumstances; though, the thought of flicking the switch isn't exactly a nice one, the utilitarian choice as it were, killing just the one person instead of the five represents the least worst option,<br>okay.<br><br>But now let me give you a variation. You've got a train speeding out of control down a track and it's gonna plow into five people on the line.  But this time you are standing behind a very large stranger on a footbridge above that track. The only way to save the people is to heave the stranger over.  He will fall to a certain death, but his considerable bulk will block the train, saving five lives.  Question. Should you flick the switch?<br><br>Now we've got what we might call a real dilemma on our hands, okay.  While the score in lives is precisely the same as in the first scenario, five to one, one's choice of action appears far trickier.  Now why should that be?  Well, the reason it turns out, all boils down to temperature, okay?<br><br>Case one represents what we might call an impersonal dilemma.  It involved those areas of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, in particular, the anterior para singular cortex, the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus - bit of neuroanatomy for you there - primarily responsible for what we call cold empathy, for reasoning and rational thought. Case two, on the other hand, represents what we might call a personal dilemma.  It involves the emotion center of the brain known as the amygdala, the circuitry of hot empathy.  What we might call the feeling of feeling what another person is feeling.<br>Now, psychopaths, just like most normal members of the population, have no trouble at all with case one.  They flick the switch and the train   diverts accordingly.  Killing just the one person instead of the five.  But, this is where the plot thickens.  Quite unlike normal members of the population, psychopaths also experience little difficulty with case two.<br><br>Psychopaths, without a moment's hesitation are perfectly willing to chuck the fat guy over the rails, if that's what the doctor orders.  Now moreover, this difference in behavior has a distinct neural signature.  The pattern of brain activation in both normal people and psychopaths is identical on the presentation of the impersonal moral dilemma, but radically different when things start to get a bit more personal.<br><br>Imagine that I were to hook you up to a brain scanner, a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, and were to present you with those two dilemmas, okay.  What would I observe as you went about trying to solve them?  Well, at the precise moment that the nature of the dilemma switches from impersonal to personal, I would see the emotion center of your brain, your amygdala and related brain circuits, the medial orbital frontal cortex for example, light up like a pinball machine.  I would witness the moment in other words when emotion puts it money in the slot.<br><br>But in psychopaths, I would see precisely nothing.  And the passage from impersonal to personal would slip by unnoticed. Because that emotion neighborhood of their brains, that emotional zip code has a neural curfew.  And that's why they're perfectly happy to<br>chuck that fat guy over the side without even batting an eye.<br><br>Directed / Produced by Jonathan Fowler &amp; Elizabeth Rodd</p>

              <p id="eow-description">Peter Norris Dupas (born 6 July 1953) is an Australian serial killer, currently serving three consecutive life sentences for murder. His violent criminal history spans more than three decades, and with every release from prison has been known to commit further crimes against women with increasing levels of violence. His criminal signature is to remove the breasts of his female victims.<br><br>As of 2007, Dupas has been convicted of three murders and is a prime suspect in at least three other murders committed in the vicinity of the Melbourne area during the 1980s and 1990s.<br><br>Arrest<br><br>Police investigations of the crime scene revealed Patterson had a 9.00a.m. appointment with a new client by the name of "Malcolm", as noted in her personal diary, alongside a mobile telephone number. The number was traced to an Indian student studying at La Trobe University named "Harry". Police learned Dupas had approached Harry with an offer of labouring work. On 22 April 1999, police arrested Dupas at midday at the Excelsior Hotel in Thomastown and charged him with the murder of Patterson later the same day.<br><br>Telephone records revealed Dupas had made three prior telephone calls to Patterson to arrange a counselling session to treat depression and a gambling addiction, the first from a public telephone booth approximately six weeks before her murder. Over the course of the next six weeks, Dupas made calls to Patterson in an attempt to establish her vulnerability. Dupas later told police he cancelled his appointment with Patterson after being told by her his problem was something he was able to work through of his own accord.<br><br>Police also noticed scratches on Dupas' face and hand, consistent with a recent struggle.
