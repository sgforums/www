              Dear TRS,
              <br><br>
               I was on the North South Line late at night travelling from Orchard to Toa Payoh when I came across some really disgusting behaviour.
              <br><br>
               A PRC auntie sitting a few seats beside me on the train actually peed on the seat and then just casually got up to alight at Novena.
              <br><br>
               She was sitting near the middle of the train and when she got up, I noticed that there was a wet puddle left behind. Her pants also seemed to stick to her legs as she stood up.
              <br><br>
               I just stared at her in disbelief. How could a grown woman just pee on the MRT and casually walk away?
              <br><br>
               When she noticed that I was staring at her, she got angry and shouted at me â€œWhat are you staring at?!?â€� in a strong PRC accent in Mandarin.
              <br><br>
               Other commuters in the train looked at her when she scolded me but after that she promptly left.
              <br><br>
               I didnâ€™t really have time to think what I should do.
              <br><br>
               I am really disgusted to see foreigners come here and literally pee and shit where ever they please without even a second thought or desire to clean up after themselves.
              <br><br>
               Chris

              <br><br>
              Gerhald Acosta was looking for a ride on his way home from his job at a paper mill plant in southwestern Uruguay, earlier this month. He later explained in a Facebook post that though several cars passed him, an SUV with a government license plate pulled over, according to RT.com. Upon getting inside, Acosta realized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mujica">Uruguayan President Jose Mujica</a> and his wife, Sen. Lucia Topolansky, were in the vehicle.
              <br><br>
               "I know this woman. It was Lucia, with Manuela the dog, and Pepe (Jose) in the front seat," Acosta told El Observador, according to Fox News Latino. "I couldn't believe it. The president was giving me a ride."
              <br><br>
               The president and his wife had been on their way to their residence when they picked Acosta up, according to El Observador. The hitchhiker said that Mujica was concerned about why Acosta, who had to return home unexpectedly, needed a ride.
              <br><br>
               Acosta said that though the ride was a brief one, he was moved by the couple's gesture.
              <br><br>
               "When I got out, I thanked them profusely because not everyone helps someone out on the road, and much less a president," he told El Observador.
              <br><br>
               While Mujica's decision to pick up the hitchhiker was a kind one, the leader is widely known for his acts of compassion. During a television interview in Montevideo last November, Mujica paused to give money to a man in need.
              <br><br>
               The leader has even been nicknamed "the world's poorest president," thanks to his decision to donate 90 percent of his salary to charity. When speaking about the money he actually keeps, Mujica told El Mundo, according to Univision's translation, "I do fine with that amount; I have to do fine because there are many Uruguayans who live with much less.

              <i>Malaysia BOLEH!</i><br><br>A private college student will never forget having sex with her boyfriend in his car recently, but for all the wrong reasons.<br>
              <br>
              While in the middle of their tryst, they were caught red-handed by two police officers, one of whom took full advantage of the situation.<br>
              <br>
              One of the police officers forced the student, 19, to perform oral sex on him, subsequently raped her in a public toilet and forced her to give him RM500. <br>
              <br>
              The police officers involved are attached to the Kota Damansara mobile patrol vehicle (MPV) unit and have since been arrested. <br>
              <br>
              The incident took place last Monday, when the victim went out for a date with her boyfriend who is in his 20s. <br>
              <br>
              A police source told Malay Mail that after their outing, the studentÂ’s boyfriend parked his car at a secluded area in Section 10, Kota Damansara. <br>
              <br>
              Â“The couple started having sex in the car but their act caught the attention of two police officers on crime prevention rounds,Â” the source said. <br>
              <br>
              He said the victim and her boyfriend were both naked when the two officers approached them. <br>
              <br>
              The policemen told the couple they would be arrested and taken to Kota Damansara police station for behaving inappropriately in a public place. <br>
              <br>
              The couple panicked and begged the policemen to let them off with a warning. <br>
              <br>
              Â“One of the officers handcuffed the girl and took her into the MPV, while his accomplice took the boyfriend in his car,Â” he said.<br>
              <br>
              The source said as they drove towards the police station the college student continued begging to be let off the hook. <br>
              <br>
              Â“Seeing this as an opportunity, the policeman demanded RM2,000 from the victim,Â” the source said.<br>
              <br>
              Â“When she agreed, he asked her to have sex with him.Â” <br>
              <br>
              The victim stood her ground and told the officer that she would not. <br>
              <br>
              Â“Both policemen pulled over right before the police station and allowed the couple to go but they took their phone numbers and other personal details,Â” he said. <br>
              <br>
              An hour later, the student received a call while she was at her hostel in Kota Damansara.<br>
              <br>
              The call was from the same officer who had earlier demanded sex from her. <br>
              <br>
              Â“The officer turned up at her hostel and forced her to get into his car, he drove towards Sunway Giza Mall and parked his car at a secluded area,Â” the source said. <br>
              <br>
              He then blackmailed the student and told her to perform oral sex on him or he would inform her parents of what she did earlier and also threatened to take her to the police. <br>
              <br>
              Â“The student gave in and while she was performing the act, the policeman panicked over whether someone would spot them.Â”<br>
              <br>
              The source said the officer then took her to one of the menÂ’s toilets in Sunway Giza mall and raped her. <br>
              <br>
              Â“He also forced her to withdraw RM500 from an automated teller machine inside the mall and then left her there.Â” <br>
              <br>
              The source said the victim thought everything was over but could not be more wrong, because the officer kept on calling her over the following few days, demanding she have sex with him again. <br>
              <br>
              Â“On Saturday, the victim lodged a police report.Â” <br>
              <br>
              The source said following the report, both the police officers were arrested yesterday morning.<br>
              <br>
              They are expected to be remanded today.

              Pinoy nurse kills 3 uk hospital patients, poisons 18 patients <br><br>
              <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/20/24D55CCF00000578-2918292-Victorino_Chua_denies_36_charges_including_three_of_murder-m-26_1421763635557.jpg">
              <br><br>
              A male nurse murdered three patients by putting poison in saline drips and leaving them as Â‘ticking timebombsÂ’ for other medics to administer, a court heard yesterday.<br>
              <br>
              Victorino Chua is said to have poisoned 21 people Â‘completely at randomÂ’ by lacing the drips with insulin then waiting for other nurses and doctors to unwittingly give them to patients.<br>
              <br>
              One of the survivors was left with a serious brain injury.<br>
              <br>
              Eventually, a pattern began to emerge and Chua, 49, was Â‘the common denominatorÂ’ in all the cases, the court heard.<br>
              <br>
              Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said it was a Â‘lotteryÂ’ which patients were harmed because the drips were unknowingly administered by others.<br>
              <br>
              Â‘In the vast majority of cases, the poisoner seems to have contaminated products completely at random,Â’ he told the court.<br>
              <br>
              As the victims became critically ill, Chua is said to have covered up his Â‘handiworkÂ’ by falsely recording that they were fine.<br>
              <br>
              In one case, he claimed a victim was Â‘comfortableÂ’ when in reality he was close to death after being poisoned with insulin, a jury was told.<br>
              <br>
              Mr Wright said ChuaÂ’s motive was hard to determine with precision, adding that Â‘only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conductÂ’.<br>
              <br>
              He said the nurse had Â‘turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others, to harming themÂ’.<br>
              <br>
              Filipino-born Chua faces 36 charges over an alleged poisoning campaign that spread panic through a busy NHS hospital between the summer of 2011 and January 2012.<br>
              <br>
              They include the murders of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, none of whom recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin.<br>
              <br>
              Chua is also accused of altering drug dosages, in one case putting an 86-year-oldÂ’s life at risk by changing her prescription chart after arguing with her daughter about her care.<br>

              Statement from Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan:<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Leaders from Malaya and their Sabah representatives should stop making an excuse of making calls for secession as seditious or against the Constitution to prevent Sabah and Sarawak from leaving the Federation of Malaysia. Instead of following the Umno BN dictatorial regime, a diplomatic and consultative approach would be a better option to persuade Sabahans and Sarawakians to remain in the Federation.<br>
              <br>
              The people in Sabah and Sarawak know for a fact that Sabah and Sarawak were taken for a ride and cheated outright in the formation of Malaysia.<br>
              <br>
              They also know that Malaya needs Sabah and Sarawak more than Sabah and Sarawak need Malaya and without Sabah and SarawakÂ’s oil wealth, Malaya and Malaysia would go bankrupt well before 2019 given its current national debt of about RM700 billion. <br>
              <br>
              Sabah and Sarawak has nothing or little to gain by remaining in Malaysia with the existing arrangement as the 12th and 13th State of Malaya masquerading as Malaysia.<br>
              <br>
              PM Najib made a huge mistake in announcing at the Umno general assembly last year end that the 1948 colonial Sedition Act will be amended with additions to make it seditious against calls for Sabah and Sarawak to leave Malaysia. <br>
              <br>
              Pakatan leaders should not be following in NajibÂ’s footsteps if they wish to have a realistic chance of taking over Putrajaya in GE-14. They would need the support of Sabah and Sarawak to win control of Putrajaya.<br>
              <br>
              If secession is seditious and or against the Constitution, why was it Singapore was allowed secession in 1965? ShouldnÂ’t the Singapore leaders then be charged for sedition if it was seditious?<br>
              <br>
              Not only did the federal government allowed Singapore to depart. They actually signed the agreement departing with Singapore before the motion to approve the departure was tabled in Parliament on 9th August 1965 without the MPs from Singapore. The federal Parliament was merely asked to endorse and rubber-stamp the departure.<br>
              <br>
              Obviously, they were not charged and Singapore was allowed to go separate ways because as said by Lord Lansdowne, Chairman of the IGC:<br>
              <br>
              Â“Â… any State voluntarily entering a federation had an intrinsic right to secede at will, and that it was, therefore, unnecessary to include it in the Constitution.Â”<br>
              <br>
              Nowhere is it stated in the Federal Constitution that Sabah and Sarawak are not allowed to secede. <br>
              <br>
              Even the British who started the sedition laws know better and the Sedition Act has been abolished in the United Kingdom where sedition is no longer a criminal offence. <br>
              <br>
              If the federal leaders care to listen, Sabah and Sarawak nationalists and activists are not seeking secession but restoration of the legitimate rights, privileges and autonomy of the Borneo States that were taken away or eroded since 1963. Of course, there was a basis that led to the formation of Malaysia and if that basis is not honoured, one of the lawful and legal recourse would be a de-merger or dissolution. In such an event, it is not secession.<br>
              <br>
              If the federal leaders wish to have Sabah and Sarawak remain in Malaysia, a soft and diplomatic approach would probably be more successful. Even the Attorney General had advised on this recourse. <br>
              <br>
              However, if the federal government thinks otherwise and were to charge any Sabah/Sarawak nationalist for sedition, it would be their gravest mistake.  <br>
              <br>
              It will be a golden opportunity to open the flood gates to the international community of the dark secrets and the wrong-doings against Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia. It will also mark the beginning of the end and break-up of the Malaysian federation.<br>
              <br>

              That's what I've always known intuitively. See how many pple drop like flies from running marathons?<br>
                      <br>
                      <img src="http://therealsingapore.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Bigstock-21109267-Runner-woman-with-heart-rate-monitor-running-on-beach-with-watch-and-sports-bra-top.jpg"><br>
                      <br>
                      Vigorous exercise such as fast running might be harmful to your health over time, according to a Danish study Monday that found light jogging is best for longevity.<br>
                      <br>
                      People who jogged strenuously and often, were just as likely to die as people who did not jog at all, according to the 12-year study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.<br>
                      <br>
                      But those who jogged lightly, between one and 2.4 hours per week, were the least likely to die suddenly, said the findings based on 1,098 healthy joggers and 413 healthy but sedentary non-joggers in the Copenhagen City Heart Study.<br>
                      <br>
                      Researchers had access to records that tracked hours of jogging, frequency and the individual's perception of pace.<br>
                      <br>
                      The optimal frequency of jogging was no more than three times per week, and slow to moderate joggers experienced significantly lower mortality rates than fast-paced runners.<br>
                       <br>
                      "It is important to emphasize that the pace of the slow joggers corresponds to vigorous exercise and strenuous jogging corresponds to very vigorous exercise," said Peter Schnohr, a researcher from the Copenhagen City Heart Study, Frederiksberg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
                      <br>
                      "When performed for decades, this activity level could pose health risks, especially to the cardiovascular system."<br>
                      <br>
                      Past research has found similar correlations between light to moderate exercise and long life, as well as the higher death risk associated with vigorous exercise.<br>
                      <br>
                      "If your goal is to decrease risk of death and improve life expectancy, jogging a few times a week at a moderate pace is a good strategy," Schnohr said.<br>
                      <br>
                      "Anything more is not just unnecessary, it may be harmful."<br>

              <p>Mr Ng is a fisherman and earns $600 to $700 every month. He lives with his grandsons, aged four and five, in a three-room flat in Jurong West.</p>
              <p>The friendly policewoman who has visited the widower for two years is Michelle Kok, a corporal at the Jurong West Neighbourhood Police Centre.</p>
              <p>Mr Ng, 74, told Shin Min Daily News that his wife died two years ago, leaving behind her daughter from a previous marriage. The single mother is in jail for drug use, leaving her two sons from two different fathers in his care.</p>
              <p>According to Ms Kok, Mr Ng's wife had a heart attack and died at home in July 2013. She was on the scene, investigating the case, when she realised that the house was bare-walled, without a single piece of good furniture, Shin Min reported on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"The house was dark, with no sofa, no bedframe. His whole family slept on tattered mattresses and the old cupboard looked like it could disintegrate any time," the 27-year-old said.</p>
              <p>Ms Kok had tried to switch on the ceiling fan, and it began working only when she used her hand to propel it gently.</p>
              <p>"When I walked to the kitchen, I found that there was no food on the table and was shocked. Later, I discovered that the only toy belonging to both the grandsons was an old plastic ball," said Ms Kok, who has been in the police force for close to three years.</p>
              <p>Afraid that Mr Ng and his grandsons would go hungry, she decided to deliver food to their home, bearing the costs out of her own pocket.</p>
              <p>She told Shin Min that she delivers food to Mr Ng about twice a month while on her way to work, spending between $15 and $20 each time on items such as biscuits, drinks and fruit.</p>
              <p>Ms Kok also took the effort to clean her own childhood toys and gave them to Mr Ng's grandsons, hoping that the items would put a smile on their faces.</p>
              <p>Her efforts are very much appreciated by Mr Ng, who had this to say: "She works long hours, but still takes time out to come to my house. Both my grandsons and I are very moved and thankful to her for her continued kindness to us."</p>

              [Singapore] - Man on the MRT suffering from mysterious medical psychiatric condition, that causes him to be severely bent over in such an awkward posture (note the bent angle of his neck, the stiffness of his outstretched arms, and the shape of his bowed legs). Notice that (video below) his body continues to throb like a jellyfish or octopus, even when seated.<br><br>
