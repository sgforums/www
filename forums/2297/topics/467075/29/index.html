              (For the purpose of this post, re-incarnation = physical incarnation = reincarnation)
                      
                      Recently, GuyL took the initiative to re-contact me, after an absence of several years (last week, I brought GuyL to meet RobinP and separately, GaryO).
                      
                      RobinP and GuyL have contrasting viewpoints about physical re-incarnation, or specifically their own personal re-incarnations.
                      
                      RobinP has the (commonly encountered in various religions) notion that physical re-incarnation, is for imperfect, flawed, fucked up beings (ie. everyone presently in physical incarnation). To quote RobinP, "<i>If we're perfect, we wouldn't be down here on Earth, now would we? *hehe*</i>".
                      
                      GuyL, on the other hand, has declared himself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>, a perfect, enlightened being who, out of self-sacrificing service to all beings, volunteers/forces himself to commit to endless cycles of physical re-incarnation (even though he doesn't need to). To quote GuyL, "<i>I have long resigned myself *siggghhh* to the fact that as a Bodhisattva, I will continue to physically re-incarnate endlessly, for the sake of others.</i>"
                      
                      Personally (with all due respect, and no offence intended), both viewpoints as expressed by RobinP and GuyL, are *equally* imbalanced, dogmatic, misguided, flawed, damaging, dangerous and even anti-cosmoethical.
                      
                      There is no such thing as perfection, therefore there is no such thing as imperfection. There is no ultimate enlightenment, evolution goes on forever. 
                      
                      Physical incarnation and reincarnation on Earth is *not* a karmic prison for fucked up souls, awaiting an ultimate enlightenment to be released from this horrible prison of physical re-incarnation on Earth.
                      
                      The idea of a self-sacrificing Bodhisattva who reluctantly commits himself to endless cycles of physical re-incarnation as an act of self-sacrificing service, is also severely dogmatic and flawed.
                      
                      We, everyone, all beings, all souls, physically incarnate and reincarnate, because we *choose* to, because we *want* to. Because physical incarnation and reincarnation, including on Earth, happens to be a tool, an optional tool, but one that is particularly vigorous and (brutally) effective in facilitating our progress along the twin objectives of *existence* (not just physical incarnation) itself : Personal Evolution (ie. personal growth and progress, hence contributing to CosmoEthics) and Assistantiality (ie. expressing our love by helping others, hence contributing to CosmoEthics).
                      
                      We (ie. all physical incarnates, nay, all beings in existence) are *not* forced to incarnate because we're imperfect and fucked up (ala RobinP), *nor* are we forced to incarnate because we're perfect, self-sacrificing Bodhisattvas (ala GuyL).
                      
                      Physical incarnation and reincarnation is, has always been, and will always be : a personal choice, a free-will option, a powerful tool for personal evolution and assistantiality, in the context of working productively and meaningfully (and here is where physical incarnation, eg. on Earth, gives a powerful boost in this regard) with all our multiple relationships and karma with all our loved ones (across physical incarnations and lifetimes), with others (not limited to just the human race, but encompassing all physical terrestrial kingdoms, extraterrestrial races and extraphysical beings), indeed with all beings in existence.
                      
                      Which is why physical incarnation, while a free-will option, is a particularly (and extremely) popular option for all beings, so much so that it is commonly mis-perceived as 'compulsory'. It is not compulsory, it is simply popular. Because as with all high-stakes, hefty business investments (including commonly, much loss, pain, sorrow and suffering, which is why many physical incarnates have the *temporary* perspective of "<i>I've had enough of physical re-incarnation! I wanna fuck off outta here and never re-incarnate again!</i>" resulting in the misguided viewpoints as expressed by RobinP and GuyL above), the hefty payout (ie. tremendous achievement for personal evolution and assistantiality, and contribution to CosmoEthics) is, in the overall big picture as seen by the higher self, well worth the investment and the risks.
                      
                      Physical incarnation and reincarnation is precious. Be good to yourself &amp; all beings, respect yourself &amp; all beings, and love yourself &amp; all beings, and may your physical incarnation be a successful one.

              How the Sultan of Brunei Violated His Sharia Law With Me
              <br><br>
              On Tuesday, I was greeted by a familiar face when I read through the morningâ€™s news: the sultan of Brunei. He looks older now than when I knew him, of course, his face doughier and more careworn.
              <br><br>
               When I was still a teenager, I was the mistress of the sultanâ€™s brother, the prince of Brunei. My usual stance is that they werenâ€™t bad guys, really. Just human and impossibly rich. I have often wondered what I would have done in their place, given all the power and money in the world. Iâ€™ve never come up with a satisfactory answer.
              <br><br>
               Now the sultan is making headlines for implementing Sharia law in Brunei, including a new penal code that includes stoning to death for adultery, cutting off limbs for theft, and flogging for violations such as abortion, alcohol consumption, and homosexuality. Thereâ€™s also capital punishment for rape and sodomy.
              <br><br>
               I am no expert in international human rights. My only qualification in commenting on this issue is that one drunken evening in the early â€™90s, the sultan and I committed at least two of the aforementioned offenses as we looked down on the lights of Kuala Lumpur from a penthouse suite.
              <br><br>
               Let me back up a bit.
              <br><br>
               I had barely turned 18 when I found myself at a â€œcasting callâ€� at the Ritz-Carlton in New York for what I was told would be a position at a nightclub in Singapore. When I got the job, I learned that the job wasnâ€™t in Singapore at all. Instead, it was an invitation to be the personal guest of the notorious playboy Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the youngest brother of the sultan of Brunei. At the time, the sultan was the wealthiest man in the world. I was a wild child consumed with wanderlust. I was hardly an innocent, but I wasâ€”when I accepted the invitationâ€”very, very young.
              <br><br>
               I imagine the man I once knew, holed up in a posh hotel suite somewhere, maybe with another American teenager in his lap, making laws that legislate morality.
               When I arrived in Brunei, I found out that the prince threw lavish parties every night, in a palace with Picassos in the bathrooms and carpets woven through with real gold. At these parties there was drinking (which was not legal in public), dancing, some fairly hilarious karaoke, and, most important, womenâ€”about 30 or 40 beauties from all over the world, comprising a harem of sorts.
              <br><br>
               The prince was rakish and clever and yes, even charming at times. I spent the next year and some change as his girlfriend. For a time, it was an adventure both glamorous and exciting. It was also lonely and demoralizing, and full of constant low-grade humiliations, including being given to the princeâ€™s brother as a gift (see: the Kuala Lumpur hotel suite). Although I was by no means a prisoner, I wasnâ€™t free to come and go as I pleased. By the end of my time there, I felt 10 years older and still not wise enough. It took me a long time to regain my footing, though I did find my way eventually. My struggles were internal and they were my own. In this context, they were a privilege.
              <br><br>
               Stoning is practiced or authorized by law in 15 countries now. It is disproportionally applied as a punishment for women, often as a penalty for adultery. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, consider it cruel and unusual punishment and torture. According to the international rights organization Women Living Under Muslim Law, stoning â€œis one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms.â€�
              <br><br>
              And yet it is the privilege of the prince and the sultan to misbehave. The picaresque escapades and legendary extravagances of the brothers are indulged with a collective wink. For everyone else residing within Bruneiâ€™s borders, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, freedoms are curtailed, and those limitations now are potentially enforced by brutal violence.
              <br><br>
               Cast stones at me if you will for my past improprietiesâ€”plenty have. Of course, those stones will be metaphorical. As the citizen of a free society, it is my right to transgress, as long as I donâ€™t break any laws or impinge on the freedom of others. Itâ€™s my prerogative to sleep with all the princes I damn well feel like. I live with my choices.
              <br><br>
               As the citizens of Brunei face the erosion of their rights, I imagine the man I once knew, holed up in a posh hotel suite somewhere, maybe with another American teenager in his lap, making laws that legislate morality.

              On a recent trip to the United States, Tony Blair, ex-Prime Minister of the UK and now U.N. Middle East Peace Envoy, addressed a major gathering of Native American Indians.
                      <br><br>
                      He spoke for almost two hours on his success in bringing about a lasting peace settlement amongst the warring nations of the Middle East, likening it to the way that the U.S. Government found a suitable agreement with the North American tribes.
                       <br><br>
                      At the conclusion of his speech, the crowd presented him with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name - Walking Eagle.
                       <br><br>
                      A very proud Tony then departed in his motorcade, waving to the crowds..
                       <br><br>
                      A news reporter later asked one of the Indians how they came to select the new name given to Tony Blair. They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of shit that it can no longer fly.
