              Video :<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jSUr64f7W-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jSUr64f7W-4</a><br><br>BEIJING â€“ Chinaâ€™s loss to Japan on a popular game show devoted to mental athletics has left the countryâ€™s netizens atwitter and provoked some national soul-searching.<p>The battleground was the popular television show â€œSuper Brain,â€� and the eventual winner a 9-year-old Japanese girl.</p><p> The series is a sort of weekly mental Olympics, pitting teams from around the world against China in a series of three brain-bending events.</p><p> In recent competitions, China has gone up against Germany and Britain, with contestants fighting over such questions of national honor as who can solve a Rubikâ€™s cube the fastest.</p><p> Last Fridayâ€™s match against Japan â€” the country China loves to hate â€” was one of the most hotly anticipated, and widely watched, of the season.</p><p> For the last event in the triathlon, contestants were given mere seconds to find the answers to arithmetic problems that would take the average adult minutes â€” and a calculator â€” to solve.</p><p> When the dust settled, Japanese math prodigy Rinne Tsujikubo had demolished her Chinese competition, as well as fellow teammate Takeo Sasano.</p><p> Sasano, who is in his 30s, holds the Guinness World Record for mental addition: 15 three-digit numbers in 1.7 seconds.</p><p> The diminutive Tsujikubo played it cool throughout the contest, even after she mistakenly wrote one digit in a difficult problem.</p><p> That error allowed Team China to stay neck-and-neck for most of the competition, but in the last few minutes Tsujikubo completely blew the opposition away.</p><p> In the final round she multiplied two seven-digit numbers â€” and double-checked her work â€” before her competitors, or teammate, had seemingly even finished writing their answers.</p><p> The blistering speed with which she solved the problem left everyone, including the audience, dumbfounded and handed a win to Japan.</p><p> Xinhua, Chinaâ€™s official news agency, devoted a five-page write-up to the match, lavishing most of its attention on Tsujikuboâ€™s mind-bending â€œmathleticism.â€�</p><p>Whatâ€™s her secret? Studying the Japanese abacus, known as soroban, she told an interviewer before the show.</p><p> Abacus classes are a common, if not necessarily popular, after-school activity in Japan. After years of practice, devotees develop the ability to do sums on a mental calculator, solely based on visualization.</p><p> The skill is known as flash anzan (mental calculation) and is the centerpiece of an annual abacus competition.</p><p> Tsujikuboâ€™s demonstration of the skill seems to have captivated Chinese viewers, who have watched the online version of the show almost 22 million times. Most were blown away by Tsujikuboâ€™s superhuman arithmetic skills.</p><p> But inevitably, online comments showed signs of wounded nationalism. â€œLetâ€™s fiercely trample Japan underfoot,â€� one commenter wrote.</p><p> Other viewers, however, had a more introspective take on Japanâ€™s victory. Soroban, noted another commenter, were imported to Japan from China, where the tradition has largely died out.</p><p>â€œThe island nation,â€� he wrote, referring to Japan, â€œdefeated us with one of the best things left to us by our ancestors.â€� Perhaps, he said, â€œthatâ€™s worth reflecting on.â€� </p><p>

              <img src="http://therealsingapore.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/leeke.jpg"><br><br>Chinese Newspaper Wan Bao published a fascinating piece of news on Lee Kuan Yew's condition in SGH.
              <br><br>
               The report said that after the hoax of Lee's death was spread online and reported on internatonal news outlets CNN and CCTV news, Lee Kuan Yew was conscious enough to say a few words despite his condition.
              <br><br>
               The ailing Lee Kuan Yew mustered whatever energy he could and firmly reminded reporters of the need to do their due diligence before reporting any news. 
              <br><br>
               Elder Lee reminded them that if they were not professional in reporting news accurately, they credibility of the media will be lost and their influence will diminish. 
               <br><br>Even when he is critically ill, Lee Kuan Yew still can lecture reporters on the need for professionalism? Is he a legend or what?<br><br>
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
               Is this what Lao Lee was referring to when he said :

               I drove along Joo Seng Road every Thursday evening and I alway happened to see a man around his 50s sitting along the walkway. 
               He's not wearing a top,just a short without shoes. 
               I bought a packet of vegetarian rice for him just now and ask him why is he always sitting there,he told me that he used to be a general worker but due to some problems with his brain,not sure is it tumor or not,didn't ask in details.He is not able to work and don't have any family members to support him. 
               He is staying alone nearby.He also told me that he has a few hundred dollars in his bank account which is a 1 time subsidy from the government. 
               He do not want to spend the money on food because he worry that after he spend all his money,he will die(This is what he told me). 
               If anyone happen to see him along Joo Seng Road, please help him by buying him a packet of rice.Feel free to talk to him. 
               You can also help him by sharing this post. A small gesture of yours may help this man by filling his stomach for the day. 
               I've attached a picture of the place and I will take of photo of him when I see him again.

            <div class='col-md body'>Posted on some "Confession" page on FaceBook :<br><br>About five years ago my husband Sean and I were struggling to pay our mortgage after he'd been forced to change jobs and I'd taken time off work to have our first child. His new position, in the finance division of a major company, paid a lot less than his last job and we were going to the wall financially. It looked as if we were going to have to go to my parents for a big loan to make sure we didn't lose our dream house and end up on the streets.<br><br>Eventually, after six months of working himself nearly to death, a much better job came up in Sean's division. The salary and bonuses he would earn from the promotion would set us up for years and not only pay for the house, but allow us a holiday and a few luxuries as well. I can't underestimate how much we needed Sean to get that job. He was good enough and had worked hard enough, but the fact that he wasn't senior in the company might count against him.<br><br>A couple of weeks after the position was advertised and after Sean had written an excellent application that he had submitted to his boss, I found myself dragged along to a night out with the families of his co-workers. As the boys from the office let their hair down to celebrate the end of the financial year, we girls joined in as well. I hadn't had a night out since my child was born and I guess I went a little over the top with my drinking.<br><br>As the night wore on and my husband, a little worse for wear, retreated to a couch with a few of his mates to keep on drinking, I felt a hand across my back and looked up to see the head of Sean's division standing behind me. He leant down and whispered quietly in my ear. He said, 'You're a beautiful woman'. I didn't know what to say. I didn't even know if he was serious, so I giggled a little. He leant in again and kept whispering, "Kirsty, I know that you and Sean are having problems. I can help." I asked how and he said, "They've chosen somebody else for the new position. But I can choose whoever I like and I can pick him." I stayed silent waiting to see what deal he would make me. His hand became a little heavier on the small of my back and he continued, "I've been looking at you all night. I want to make love to you." I turned to tell him where to go and he interrupted me, "Don't say no yet. Just think about what this job means to Sean. One night with me and you're set. Think about it," and he walked away.<br><br>I stood for a few seconds trying to gather my thoughts and dissect what had just happened to me. Eventually I dragged Sean home, but having sobered up upon hearing Tom's proposal I had a sleepless night lying next to him wondering if long-term financial security was enough to betray my husband for. Was it even a betrayal? It was for him as well.<br><br>The next few days were spent discussing the state of our mortgage and how we needed him to get the job to save the house. How could I tell him that there was no way he was going to get it unless I gave myself for him? I knew there was only one thing I could do.<br><br>One day when Sean had left for work I went through his address book and found Tom's mobile phone number. I called him and said that I would give him what he wanted in exchange for Sean's promotion. He called me back a few minutes later and gave me the address of a motel where we would meet. For the next hour I let this middle aged man use my body as he liked on the promise that he would hold up his end of the bargain.<br><br>We left the motel and I sat in my car for another hour crying. Had I done the right thing? Would I be double crossed? A few minutes after I eventually managed to start my car and drive towards home my phone rang. It was Sean. I couldn't bear to speak to him so I let it ring out and continued to drive. It rang again and I ignored it again. It was only the third time that it rang when I answered it. He breathlessly told me that he'd been chosen and would start his new job on Monday. We'd been saved. I cried again. They were tears of joy with a lot of bitterness and regret mixed in. We were saved, but at what price?<br><br>Sean has since proven to be one of the best employees that the company has. He's earned bonuses that he never would have in his old role and looks set to be promoted again. But every time he proudly talks to me about his work and how successful he is I have to look away in shame because I can never reveal the terrible secret about how he came to be there in the first place.</div>

              Now it's 4.30am (Sun 22 Mar 2015) 7 police cars with blue/red lights flashing at Marine Parade road *outside* Laguna Park (next to Mandarin Gardens and Victoria School, near Siglap Center). <br><br>
                  
                  Thought it might be a road block, but cars aren't stopped, just slowed down as they passed.
                  <br><br>
                  Anyone knows what's going on?

              Wrestler Booker T took down an armed robber after eating Singapore noodles at McDonalds in Texas USA :<br><br><img src="http://s.mlkshk-cdn.com/r/1YH8"><br><br>HOUSTON, Texas (AP) -Employees of a McDonaldâ€™s fast-food restaurant in the Texan suburb of South Houston have today spoken about their relief to see former world wrestling great, Booker â€œBooker Tâ€� Huffman, subdue a lone gunman during an attempted robbery of the outlet on Tuesday evening.<p> Itâ€™s believed Mr Huffman, a former WWE wrestler and current commentator, was a patron of the restaurant with his wife, Sharmell and his three children â€“ when an armed male entered the venue with a ski-mask covering his face and demanded money from staff at the register.</p><p> Andrew Torres, an 18-year old employee of the South Houston diner, says it was like he was watching the wrestling as a young boy all over again.</p><p>â€œI mean, Booker was sitting down with his familyâ€¦ Ordered the Singapore noodles off the kids menuâ€¦ You know, being a normal customer â€“ but then this guy came in with a gun and all of a sudden heâ€™s pointing it at my face and telling me he wants money,â€� says Torres, who was working the front counter at the time of the hold-up.</p><p>â€œIt was really scary because the diner was at full capacityâ€¦ but when the guy in the mask came in, it went completely silent. I was in complete shock â€“ I couldnâ€™t even move my arms,â€�</p><p> â€œIt was a bizarre experience because the gunman wanted money but I was so terrified I couldnâ€™t move â€“ and he knew thatâ€¦ no one else is the diner was doing anything. It was like we were paused in timeâ€¦ Until I heard a familiar voice shouting from the back corner of the diner.â€�</p><p>Torres has said that â€œBooker Tâ€� Huffman had removed his shirt and began shouting his iconic WWE catch-cry â€œCan you dig it? Sucker?!â€� before sprinting across the room and performing a signature wrestling manoeuvre on the attempted robber.</p><p> The restaurantâ€™s manager, Sara Tampico, says it was a â€œspectacularâ€� citizen arrest.</p><p>â€œMr Huffman stood on the table and removed his shirt, before bounding across the restaurant, table to table. He was flying through the air and his â€˜locsâ€™ [dreadlocks] were going everywhere. He scissor-kicked the robber and knocked him out cold! He was flying so high in the air that his waist was in line with the gunmanâ€™s head,â€� says Ms Tampico, who despite being very thankful for Booker Tâ€™s actions, wasnâ€™t entirely sure who he was at the time.</p><p>â€œAfter he had immobilised the threat â€“ all of the customers in the restaurant cheered and started dancing. I had never heard of â€˜Booker Tâ€™ before, but apparently everyone else had. They formed a circle around him and he did some sort of breakdancing move on top of the unconscious gunman,â€�</p><p> â€œAfter all that, he sat right back down and finished his Singapore noodles,â€�</p><p> â€œIt really was spectacular. My employees say it was just like on the television â€“ he did his famous â€œscissor kickâ€� to subdue the gunman and followed it up with what they call â€œThe Spinaroonieâ€� (breakdancing manoeuvre).â€�</p><p>Local police are yet to comment publicly, however they have confirmed that Mr Huffman is helping them with their investigation, while the gunman has been taken into custody. Huffman has stated that he will not be commenting until police enquiries are complete.</p><p> Reported by Clancy Overell in Texas, QLD. Margaret Turner contributed to this story at The Associated Press, Washington. </p><p>
