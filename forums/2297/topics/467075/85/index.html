            <div class='col-md body'>In another case of road rage gone tragic, 1 men fired a gun at the other man's vehicle, shooting his 4 year old daughter in the head, killing her instantly. If only every country in the world had Singapore's strict gun laws and successful enforcement (yet another aspect of Singapore's success thanks to LKY's governance). Alas, tis too late, coz guns are already everywhere in the USA, and also everywhere in almost every other country outside Singapore. Whatever gun laws they enact from here on out, will be too little too late. As Barack Obama sadly repeats ad infinitum, the number of Americans dying every year from gun shot wounds inflicted by fellow Americans, are tens of thousands of times more than Americans dying from foreign terrorist attacks.<br><br><a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2015/10/22/man-charged-in-albuquerque-road-rage-killing-of-4-year-old-girl/">http://www.pressherald.com/2015/10/22/man-charged-in-albuquerque-road-rage-killing-of-4-year-old-girl/</a></div>

              I was walking along Ang Mo Kio Central tonight, when out of the corner of my eye I spotted an old uncle standing blankly next to a bin. Iâ€™m not sure what prompted me to approach him but he had a strange despairingly look. It was a look I was not familiar with. 
              <br><br>
              â€œIs everything okay?â€™â€™, I asked him in mandarin. He seemed quite surprised by my question and said he was okay, but just a little hungry. He then immediately asked if I could spare him some money for food.
              <br><br>
              Instinctively all my alarm bells went ringing. This has to be a scam and Iâ€™m not about to be your victim. Iâ€™m not going to fall for your little pity ploy. So I said sure, letâ€™s go to a nearby coffee-shop and Iâ€™ll buy you some food. He seemed relieved by that suggestion.
              <br><br>
              Upon getting a seat, and at his request we ordered a bowl of fishball soup and some iced milo. We started to talk. Uncle is 83 this year and he has a wife at home that he cares for, however she isnâ€™t with him as it is inconvenient for her to leave the house. His son, in his fifties, gets by earning $1000 a month, which is insufficient to support the family. And therefore, to avoid being a burden, he resorts to asking for meals and money from the public when they get hungry. 
              <br><br>
              And then suddenly, I was overcome with shame. Here I was, an able bodied working adult, earning a decent salary and never having to worry where my next meal was going to come from, yet here I was, worried that an old man was about to swindle me of a couple of dollars. Uncle said that the people who were most willing to help were usually the youngsters because they were the least suspicious. And it taught me an important lesson today. 
              <br><br>
              It seems that we have become a nation of detached, distrusting strangers. As we grow older and as many of us enter the corporate world, we grow increasingly disillusioned of the world and its devices. We learn to look after our own interests first. We become cautious, skeptical and apprehensive. We forget to take care of one another. Perhaps if we learn to care for one another a little more and choose to see the good in people, then maybe, just maybe we can make the world a slightly better place for those who need it most.
              <br><br>
              A short while later, i left him with some money and went on my way. It was probably the most meaningful amount of money Iâ€™ve spent in a long long time. Sometimes we forget how blessed we truly are.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is unfortunate that the girl didn't receive immediate proper (western) medical attention, and only received herbal remedy from the local indigenous culture she belonged to. But even if she had rushed to a hospital that had access to proper (western) medical care, without correct identification of the exact species of snake and venom, even proper (western) medicine is quite helpless (as observed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Stories">Dr House episode</a>). In such scenarios, without exact identification of the snake and venom, the most medical science can do is to amputate the leg, if the anti-venom(s) attempted fails. This might at least save the victim's life. It is unknown if this 13 year old girl eventually died from the snake venom, or if she had survived (after the late amputation).<br><br>[October 2014] - 13 yr old girl's leg rots away after snake bite.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2804722/Girl-s-leg-shrivels-turns-BLACK-snake-bite-causes-leg-rot-away.html"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/27/1414421502510_Image_galleryImage_female_patient_of_13_year.JPG"><br><br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2804722/Girl-s-leg-shrivels-turns-BLACK-snake-bite-causes-leg-rot-away.html</a></div>

              [Singapore] - CCTV video shows supernatural phenomena<br><p>Remember, there's no such thing as supernatural. *Everything* is natural, including extraterrestrial UFOs, ghosts (earthbound psychotic post-mortems), angels, psychic phenomena, reincarnation, etc. It's only a matter of whether or not science on this planet has advanced sufficiently to understand it at this point in time. What you do not yet understand, you call it magic or supernatural. For instance, travel back in time to the dark or middle ages, or to another planet with a more primitive civilization, and give a fully working iPad to a man there, and he'll say the iPad is magic or supernatural. Actually, the iPad is totally science, just not yet understood by the science for that man on that planet at that point in time.</p><p>For instance, Religious Creationism versus Scientific Darwinism. Both are over-simplified and thus erroneous in their limited understanding. The truth encompasses both without contradiction.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Singapore] - Stool (chair) captured by CCTV footage shown swaying on its own before crashing to the ground at Chinatown bar</p><p><img src="http://images.singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/styles/featured_image/s3/featured/2015/10/stoolmain.jpg"></p><p>Video :<br><a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/this-urban-jungle/for-real-stool-seen-swaying-on-its-own-before-crashing-to-the-ground-at-Chinatown">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/this-urban-jungle/for-real-stool-seen-swaying-on-its-own-before-crashing-to-the-ground-at-Chinatown</a></p><p>

              As I was asleep from Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur, there was a loud deafening bang and smoke filled the cabin. The fire alarm was ringing non stop in the plane. Passengers on the plane were in shock and fear. We thought it was engine failure or maybe terrorist attack but finally realized it was an e-cigarette which exploded mid flight...
