            <div class='col-md body'>And this is already LKY's Singapore, where racial harmony is already among the best in the world. If this occurred in Malaysia (with unfair racist bumiputra policies in place, and where racism between Chinese and Malays are actively encouraged by all the political parties for their own selfish political manipulative agendas to win votes), such incidents would spark violent and mass racial riots. Thankfully this is Singapore, where by and large (ie. relative to Malaysia), Chinese and Malays have genuine mutual respect for each other and are well integrated, and where racism is already (again, relative to Malaysia and the rest of the world, eg. Australian racism against non-whites, etc) at its minimum.<br><br>A Singaporean Malay posted this on Facebook after he kena a racist remark by a misguided Singaporean Chinese boy : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanininininini/posts/10208472680680449?pnref=story">https://www.facebook.com/sanininininini/posts/10208472680680449?pnref=story</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Palestinians and the Israelis are both guilty of genocide against each other. It's naÃ¯ve to blindly support one side against the other (when people and nations do so, it's out of self-serving interest, fear and a perception of a common enemy, based on religion and international politics). Nonetheless, you should be able to sympathize with both sides, because both sides have suffered (and continue to suffer, each feeling thoroughly victimized and wholly convinced the other side is the bad guy) much pain, suffering and loss, and hateful vengeance begets more hateful vengeance, and there is unfortunately no simple solution in sight (nor will there ever be). But do not forget that there are good Palestinians and there are good Israelis, who seek to collaboratively work towards a peaceful and mutually beneficial long-term ceasefire. May their efforts prevail, and may peace finally prevail in the Middle East someday.<br><br><img src="http://www.todayonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/photo_gallery_image/public/photos/43_images/jonathanongujang_26122015_620_698_100.jpg"><br><br>Articles :<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/msian-student-owns-i-love-israel-facebook-post-apology-plea-forgiveness">http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/msian-student-owns-i-love-israel-facebook-post-apology-plea-forgiveness</a><br><a href="http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malaysian-student-fires-up-facebook-with-i-love-israel-post-after-athletes">http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malaysian-student-fires-up-facebook-with-i-love-israel-post-after-athletes</a></div>

                          <br>
                          I have been living for almost 17 years, and never ever once have I dated anyone. To say that, I am proud of it.<br>
                          <br>
                           Many girls around my age or even those younger than me would have started to date by then. <br>
                          <br>
                           However, never I ever had the thoughts of dating anyone, as long as I have yet to graduate from college, or maybe graduate from university. <br>
                          <br>
                           I have always thought about how great it is to have a boyfriend, who will always care for you, tell you how pretty you are everyday, send you home from school or work, lend a ear when you need one etc. <br>
                          <br>
                           However, never have I ever experienced all those things before. So basically, I am someone who is 'pure' you may call, or someone who is inexperience in a relationship.<br>
                          <br>
                           I do watch a lot of Korean dramas, and I have ever wished to have those kind of sweet and loving relationship. If you watch those dramas, you will know what I mean.<br>
                          <br>
                          6 brave guys have confessed about their feelings towards me, and would like to date me.<br>
                          <br>
                           Despite some of their efforts of sending me never ending sweet text messages, giving me flower, writing cards and giving chocolates during Valentines Day, neither did succeed in winning my heart. <br>
                          <br>
                           Out of 6 of them, two of the guys are the hottest guys in my school. Those two guys are famous within the girls, and many girls would like to date them. I wonder why didn't I even accept them when they are the so called the ' popular' and 'hottest' people in school. <br>
                          <br>
                           I mean that most girls would feel proud if they date someone who is popular or hot. However, not me. <br>
                          <br>
                           It is not that I am picky in choosing who I would want to date. It is just that I am not ready for a relationship at that time, since I was 13 years old, who doesn't even know a single thing about relationship. <br>
                          <br>
                           I am 17 now, and I am still not ready for a relationship. So, what I did was to decline each of them in a friendly way. After declining them, some still remain to be my normal friend, some didn't even want to talk to me, and some went off to find a new girl who they could get attached with.<br>
                          <br>
                          Thinking about that, I am thankful to have not dated any of them. <br>
                          <br>
                           What I observed in most of them is that they are all 'playboys', who would keep changing partners. Whenever they see a new girl who looks attractive to them, they will break up with their current girlfriend, and try to play hard to get that new girl. What kind of bulls**** is this. I observed that there are many playboys in my society, who will go for girls based on their looks and sexiness, and not their personality. <br>
                          <br>
                           This makes me not having trust in any guys. There is also a sense of hatred in me towards them. <br>
                          <br>
                          Apart from that, why should I even bother to have a boyfriend ?<br>
                          <br>
                           Why do girls and boys around my age even bother to be in a relationship.<br>
                          <br>
                           We are still students, and what we should do is to study, and upgrade our knowledge and not mingle around here and there to find someone who you want to be in a relationship with. <br>

              <i>Someone posted on another forum</i><br><br>Someone emailed me the following article, "those were the days" which I find it nostalgic and I would like to share it with you all: <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Without any maids, our mothers cooked, cleaned and took care of the whole family. They still had time to chat with neighbours.<br>
              <br>
               Everyone had candy floss, fizzy drinks and shaved ice with syrups. Diabetes were rare and aspirin/panadol cured all illness.<br>
              <br>
               We rode adult's bicycle to school, the richer ones had their own mini-bikes. Ironically, we all had problems with our brakes, and after running into the bushes a few times, we learned how to solve the problem.<br>
              <br>
               Prefects were a fearful lot, more fearful than the teachers. Detention class was like going to prison for a day. We had "public canning" in schools. <br>
              <br>
               NO ONE ever won the big prizes on "TIKAM". It was a scam but it did not stop us from coming back for more. <br>
              <br>
               Motorbikes were rode without helmets. It was rare to ride a private taxi. Taking a bus was luxury - we either cycled or walked to everywhere.<br>
              <br>
               We drank water from the tap and NOT from bottles.<br>
              <br>
               We spent hours in fields under the sun, playing football or flying kites, without worrying about UV rays. It did not affect us.<br>
              <br>
               We roamed free, catching spiders and did not worry of Aedes mosquitoes. We kept our spiders in match boxes and ready for a fight anytime. <br>
              <br>
               With mere 5 pebbles, girls played endless games; and with a tennis ball, boys ran like crazy for hours.<br>
              <br>
               When it rained, we swam the drains &amp; canals to catch "ikan keli", none of us were dissolved in rain.<br>
              <br>
               We shared one bottle of soft drink with friends, NO ONE actually worried about catching anything.<br>
              <br>
               We ate salty, sweet &amp; oily foods, bread had real butter and sometimes condense milk. We enjoyed very sweet coffee, tea, and "ice kacang" but we were not obese because WE WERE OUT PLAYING ALL THE TIME!!<br>
              <br>
               We left home in the morning and played all day till hunger drove us back home. When needed, our parents knew how to find us. NO ONE actually watched over us and WE ALWAYS WERE SAFE.<br>
              <br>
               WE DID NOT HAVE HANDPHONES BUGGING US. We rode bikes or walked over to a friend's house and just yelled for them!!<br>
              <br>
               We did not have Playstations, X-boxes, Nintendo's, multiple channels on cable TV, DVD movies, no surround sound, no phones, no personal computers, no Internet. WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them!! Our TV was black and white.<br>
              <br>
               We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and we still continued the stunts.<br>
              <br>
               We did not have birthdays parties till we were 21, that is when we started to take notice of girls. <br>
              <br>
               We have not heard of the word "chinese or malaysian or indian". We only knew our friends by names. Their parents were Ah Soh, Ah Pek, Pak Cik and Mak Cik or Uncle and Aunty.<br>
              <br>
               In badminton, we did not change the shuttle as long as it was in flight. Regardless of how many feathers were left in the shuttle, our game continued....<br>
              <br>
               Match-boxes were always "chilly" or "king kong" brand ...; to own a box of matches from a hotel was something great.<br>
              <br>
               Regardless of whether we could afford one, we always knew Maths tuition was $5.00 a month.<br>
              <br>
               All parties were held in the void decks downstairs or in tents.<br>
              <br>
               We felt pleased to see a policeman and we were always eager to tell police everything we saw. <br>
              <br>
               Morris Minor and Volkswagen Beetle were on our roads driven alongside Kingswood, Vauxhall, Opel and Chyrsler. Executives of companies drove Peugeot 504. Japanese cars were considered "inferior". There were no traffic   lights, only roundabouts. <br>
              <br>
               The whole kampung came together during kenduris and all took turns to "kacau dodol". Chinese, Indians and Malays were all part of kenduris and all of us spoke Malay.<br>
              <br>
               Our favourite local performer was Rose Chan and the Beatles were the most popular band. John Wayne's westerns on Sunday Cheap Matinees were 25 cent per show.<br>
              <br>
               Malay weddings had joget sessions in the night, it was the only time to ask the Malay lady for a dance.<br>
              <br>
               Ketupat were NEVER plastic wrapped.<br>
              <br>
               Football was played barefooted in torn-filled "padangs", rain or shine, but still Quah Kim Song and company made us proud, we actually beat Malaysia team in Malaysia Cup!<br>
              <br>
               The bayi mata instilled fear and were highly regarded <br>
              <br>
               Susu lembu was delivered to our house by our big, friendly and strong "Bayi" on his bicycle. All "jagas" were "Bayi" and no place got robbed.<br>
              <br>
               "Laksa" and "Ding Ding Tang" man came peddling. "Kacang Puteh" man walked balancing on his head top, 6 compartments of different type of murukus.<br>
              <br>
               We played "gasing", made our own kites &amp; had kite fighting with glass glued threads and made wooden guns &amp; used seeds from plants for bullets.<br>
              <br>
               Kang Kong was free, easily harvested by riverside. "Kembong" was 30 cents a "kati" and nobody wanted "Ikan Pari" (stingray).<br>
              <br>

              <br>
               Yet this generation has produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever!<br>
              <br>

              <br>
               And YOU are one of them!!<br>
              <br>
               CONGRATULATIONS!!<br>
              <br>

               Have a blessed n nostalgic feeling going down the memory lane.
