            <div class='col-md body'>[USA] - 1 year old little girl dies under general anesthesia at a visit to the dentist. Few people realize that general anesthesia (ie. using chemicals to artificially suppress the brain &amp; nervous system to artificially force a loss of consciousness) *always* carries a risk of death, and every year, many people die under general anesthesia in relatively minor surgical procedures, including plastic surgeries. At least the little girl didn't suffer, and the death will not be traumatic for her soul, who will prepare for her next physical incarnation soon, with a good possibility (depending on karmic arrangements) of incarnating as the next child of the same parents.<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/04/01/toddler-dies-dental-work/82529004/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/04/01/toddler-dies-dental-work/82529004/</a></p></div>

              Actually, we do not know the exact time each of the individual text messages were sent. If the ex-husband had actually waited a full hour later (as he originally implied) to text him the big reveal, the mocker's life might have been permanently ruined. So either the ex-husband was being extremely kind (if he texted the big reveal immediately), or he was being extremely sadistic (if he waited a full hour later to text the big reveal).<p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true. In any country, almost all of the unemployed are frustrated and upset with the economic system which they feel has failed them, and (semi-justifiably) blame it on the government, and consequently vote against the ruling party in the general elections. It's not the government's fault per se, because all systems (by the very nature of wealth) favor the rich over the poor. Cest la vie.

              Lester Tan posted : "Victim has lousy friends who refuse to stand by her when she's been traumatised. Even going to the extent of using Jesus' name to get her to not report. Friend's mother also another idiot. If you know your daughter's friend was victimised, you should set an example and get her to do the right thing as well."</p><p>Annabel Jador posted : "I am a Christian, but forgiving does not mean you let the person off scott free. The forgiveness of GOD is unconditional when he turns to the Lord, but he must ask for forgiveness and be truly sorry first. He almost raped the girl. She can forgive him by praying for him, but she shouldn't let him off."

            <div class='col-md body'>[Modern-day Slavery] - All across the USA and Europe, people eat shrimps or prawns peeled by modern-day slaves. When one of the workers the AP interviewed tried to escape, her boss dragged her back by her hair and beat her up. Shrimp or prawns from factories like these end up in the supply chains of Whole Foods, Wal-Mart, Red Lobster, and Olive Garden, across USA and Europe, the AP found.<p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/synthetic-replacement-shrimp-made-slaves-120000096.html"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8CqPYJ8bom53kableDi83g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjMwO2g9NDA2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/theatlanticwire.com/3e40574dee71c59035e41075abedf170"><br><br>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/synthetic-replacement-shrimp-made-slaves-120000096.html</a></p></div>

              Why few Americans appear in the Panama Papers :<br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/why-few-americans-appear-panama-papers-051219886.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/why-few-americans-appear-panama-papers-051219886.html</a><p>TheRighteousHand posted : <br>The reason why there are no Americans in the list is because the ICIJ journalists investigating the so called leaks are funded by American billionaires, Georg Soros being one of them. They said it was "leak" but actually it was not any inside leak. Fonseca already said that the files were hacked by outsiders. The fact that the western journalists claim it as leaks already showed their agenda - try to deflect attention away from the hacker(s). No prize for guessing who is behind the hack. Clue no. 1 - no prominent American being "attacked" or disclosed in the list. Clue no. 2 - target of the attack is Putin/Russia and China.</p><p>William posted :<br>The conspiracy theory was spread by China and mostly, Russia. But, I already thought nothing of the conspiracy theory, since it is obvious that corrupt US politicians do not hide their assets in panama, but in other places.

              Given the oversaturation of cop-&amp;-gangster movies and TV dramas from Hong Kong, you might understandably dismiss this as more of the same. But it's surprisingly good. It's a double edged thingie : despite the oversaturation, Hong Kong's television &amp; movie's extensive experience with this genre, serves very well to up the ante and ensure the high quality of new productions of this genre.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borderline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Borderline</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaiNj8y-BsQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaiNj8y-BsQ</a>

              It's like those famous real-life controversial criminal cases in the USA that they base movies and TV series out of. Even though this case has gone to trial and the verdict handed out, but now another story emerges that could completely unravel and reverse the case. While you may of course, doubt the credibility of this new 'witness', but it's a well known fact that the police (who are always under pressure to close cases) and the courts (in any country) are naturally prejudiced against known gangsters, and guilty verdicts are often handed down even if the accused gangster turn out to be innocent of this particular crime.<p>22 YEAR OLD GANGSTER CLAIMS HE WAS FRAMED FOR RAPING GIRL, 13, IN VIRAL "STAIRCASE ROMP"<br><a href="http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/22-year-old-man-denies-raping-girl-13-viral-staircase-romp">http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/22-year-old-man-denies-raping-girl-13-viral-staircase-romp</a>

              â€œOur encounter with OCBC Premier Banking has been a living nightmare; we are sharing our experience to raise awareness of the bankâ€™s ruthless tactics behind its smiling public facade.<p>
              
               Our bank Relationship Manager sold us a â€˜4 month SGD Equity Fix Coupon Quanto Callable Investmentâ€™ product when we asked for a short-term savings plan or stable investment to allow us to earn a small incentive for our nearing retirement. We had some concerns regarding the choice of shares initially, but she assured us that the bankâ€™s investment experts will assist in choosing shares with high growth potential, and even claimed that some of her customers were already earning profits. We were not sophisticated investors and were definitely not interested in high-risk investments, but she continually assured us of the stability of this investment, so we signed the deal under the impression that it was a stable short term investment with satisfactory returns.
              </p><p>
               Everything went well for the first 3 months until just before the maturity date, when she informed us that our investment had incurred a loss and advised us to hold it until it recovers. We had no access to any stock exchange or share price information, until the 7th month when we received a wealth report from the bank indicating, to our horror, that our investment value had dropped by more than half, and is now worth almost nothing.
               We requested for a market analysis report of the company share and realized that the company was in fact a very unstable and high-risk one, unlike what our Relationship Manager described. There was no transparency in the entire transaction. 
              </p><p>
               We appealed to their management and subsequently their Customer Assurance team to no avail, and the latter shook us off by asking us to seek resolution through FIDReC which handles up to only S$50k per claim â€“ barely half of what we have invested.
              </p><p>
               Every cent we saved and every carefully crafted plan we made over the years to pave the way for a smooth retirement â€“ which seemed so close within our reach after decades of tireless work â€“ had to be halted. Plans changed. Dreams shattered.
              </p><p>
               We came to the bank to deposit our hard-earned savings with trust and hope to earn some incentive to support our retirement but instead it cost us almost everything we invested within just a few months. We hope our story will prevent others from being put through the same ordeal.â€� </p>
