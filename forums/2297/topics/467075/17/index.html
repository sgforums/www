              <p>Blind date from hell :</p>
              <p><a href="http://behindthebasics.blogspot.sg/2013/11/the-blind-date.html"><span style="color: #005688;">Original blog post here</span></a><br><br>OMG, Where do I even start? <br><br>So he started by asking what time I'd be done as he was going to catch a movie which would be ending at 7. I said I'd be done by 5, but you know, it's Orchard so it'd be quite easy for me to entertain myself till then. I also said that I had one condition - that he chooses where to eat. Because you know, I really am not that picky when it comes to food. Yes, I like to eat good food. But you know, it's not on my priority list. As I had previously illustrated here, in a post entitled "Sorry, but I still think food is a waste of money." And his reply was, "OK SET!" (or steady, somewhere along these lines).<br><br>So I went shopping in Forever 21... <strong>And at 7:15 pm...my nightmare began.</strong><br><br><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://i44.tinypic.com/2hd493l.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br><em>Wah he really loves his emoji icons hahahaa</em><br><br>Anyway, he was talking in a very badly accented act-atas voice. Which broke into ah-beng Chinese after 5 sentences.<br><br>"æˆ‘ä¸�çŸ¥é�“lehï¼�æˆ‘çš„æœ‹å�‹è¦�æŽ’é˜Ÿlorã€‚ä»–å¥³æœ‹å�‹å•¦ï¼�ä¸�çŸ¥é�“å¥¹è¦�ä¸�è¦�å�ƒã€‚ã€‚ã€‚"<br><br>I told him to WhatsApp me after made up his mind.<br><br><br><img id="vBCodeIMG" class="vbimgcodelimit" title="Resized image - click to view original size" src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2u4shvd.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="514"><br><br>So we reached the cafe and he spent a long time telling me about how he likes quiet spaces and how this cafe was quiet and never too crowded. We ordered food (It took very long. I think he was trying to appear cultured and deep by flaunting his knowledge on the fish burger.) and he then told me about his sales job at the alcohol company. Which he quit three months ago. But you know. What do I know about drinking right? <br><br>Matthew, "So what kind of alcohol do you like. WAIT, no let me guess...*squints and gives me the once over* you are a vodka girl."<br>Me, "No."<br>(Actually I quite like vodka but he was annoying me so I just disagreed reflexively.)<br>Matthew, "Strange. Most girls like vodka."<br>(Oh so that's how you guessed?! Brilliant.)<br>Me, "I am not most girls."<br>Matthew, "Oh really meh. Then what alcohol do you like?"<br>Me, "Whiskey."<br>Matthew, "Like Chivas?"<br>Me, "No. Laphroaig."<br>Matthew, "What?"<br>Me, "Laphroaig."<br>Matthew,"Oh. å¥½åƒ�æœ‰å�¬è¿‡ã€‚It is not that good right?"<br>Me, "Actually I drink most alcohols except for Midori."<br>Matthew, "Midori?"<br>Me, "Melon Liquor. The green coloured one."<br>Matthew, "Ohhh. You don't like the taste of melon is it?"<br>Me, "No I am okay with melon. I just don't like the taste of Midori."<br>Matthew, "Do you eat watermelon?"<br>Me, "Yes. Midori is not watermelon."<br>Matthew, "Really meh? So you don't like melon?"<br>Me, "No I don't like midori, it's a different taste."<br>Matthew,"So you don't eat melon?"<br><br><br><br>Oh and you know how he talked to me? He liked to start each sentence like this...<br><br>"This may be too technical for you but...."<br>"I don't want to bore you with all the jargon...."<br>"I don't think you will understand but..."<br>"I would tell you but it may be too complicated for you..."<br><br><br>Then, we paid for the bill. <strong>Throughout dinner he was trying to impress me by talking my ear off, but when the bill came, the first thing he did was to flip it towards me.</strong> Hello, at least look at how much your share is first right? <strong>And then he went "I think you need $0.70 more. Nevermind, I treat you."</strong><br><br>Yes. In conclusion, my advice to everyone, is never to go on a blind date. It's terrible and bad and unless you want to spend the evening trying not to die, or are trying to apply the skills you learnt in your anger management class, STAY AWAY.</p>

              <p>Dear CPF: Give Me Back My Money!<br>By Jeffrey Cuellar | MoneySmart – Mon, Nov 18, 2013 12:00 AM SGT<br><br>Dear CPF,<br><br>For years you’ve taken a cut from my paycheck under the promise of social “protection.” In a way, you’re like a very well-intentioned gangster, protecting my money from well… me right?<br>I’m grateful though that you at least “allow” me to use some of my money towards buying a home, or to subsidise (partially) my hospital bills.<br>I’m not going to ask what you do with my money while it’s in your hands (I’m sure it’s just sitting there untouched right?). But I do ask that you let me use it for pressing emergencies that directly affect me and my family’s well-being.<br><br>What do I mean?<br>Let me enlighten you.<br><br><strong>1. For Retrenchment<br></strong>My financial obligations won’t stop if I get retrenched. Finding a job takes 2-3 months at best. I’m lucky I have enough savings to last me 3 months, but what if it takes longer? What if I had no savings to begin with?<br>Any unsecured debt I have (credit cards, car loan, personal loans, etc.) still needs to be paid – otherwise I risk damaging my credit with late payments or even default. The banks don’t care that I lost my job. They’re about as sympathetic as a cat watching a rodent struggle in a mousetrap.<br>But if I could use my “account” to service my unsecured debt if I get retrenched, even if it’s just to make my minimum payments, that would give me the financial flexibility to weather the situation. Plus, it would discourage those without savings from worsening their financial situation by going to Ah Longs for money.<br><br><strong>2. For Education<br></strong>Ultimately, the government wants me to be successful. The more successful I am, the more taxes I can contribute to our nation’s economy. So why can’t I use some of the money from my account towards education, whether I want to pursue an MDA-approved training course or a degree?<br>You don’t need me to tell you that education improves my earning potential, which is a win-win for everyone. I improve my standard of living while the government takes a greater amount of tax revenue. Plus, if I’m working in a sunset industry that has a bleak outlook, I can get the training I need to transition to a more promising profession.<br>But not everyone has the money on hand to pay for education… oh yeah, they do – you’re holding it CPF! So ease up a little on the funds distribution and let us chant Jerry Maguire’s “help me, help you” line together yeah?<br><br><strong>3. For Growing Transportation Costs</strong><br>Paying for transportation in Singapore is like choosing how you want to be tortured. The choices differ, but the result is the same – you’re still paying hundreds or thousands of dollars a month just to commute daily!<br>It doesn’t matter whether you own a car or use public transportation, the cost to travel to and from work, pick up the wife and kids, or take the family out to Sentosa is always increasing. All you have to do is see how much COE, ERP, taxi, and public transportation rates have increased over the last few years.<br>Of course, I don’t own 3 cars, nor do I live in Sentosa Cove – and neither do a majority of citizens who suffer every time transportation costs rise. But it would help if I could use some of my funds as a monthly “transportation allowance” to offset the financial pain felt by price hikes.<br><br>In Conclusion…<br><br>Now, before you crumple up this letter (if you haven’t already), I have one more thing to say…<br><br>Tax payers won’t need to support me with these situations. That’s because this money is already mine to begin with (or so you tell me). All I’m asking is that you make it easier for me to access my funds so I can patch up my social safety net.<br>If you need to validate my situation before dispersing my funds to prevent “fraud,” I’m fine with that. I’d rather deal with the inconvenience of a sloth-like bureaucracy than have to worry about how I’m going to come up with cash in an emergency.<br>Again, I’m grateful for the monthly shakedown that’s necessary for my retirement. But you’ve got to be a little more flexible when it comes to financial emergencies that cannot wait.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>A Messenger of Singaporean Frustrations<br>P.S. Umm…. yeah, if you could let me use my funds to cover the hospital bill for childbirth (c’mon, we’re doing you a favor by creating more taxpayers) and for elderly friendly renovations to take care of my ageing grandparents without sending them to a home, that would be great.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A backpacker from the United Kingdom has visited countries like Africa and Yemen, but picks Kuala Lumpur as the most dangerous place he has ever been to.</p>
              <p>Dave Ramsay had related his experience about being stabbed and mugged in the city on travel site Virtual Tourist.</p>
              <p>The incident took place near Hard Rock Cafe in Jalan Sultan Ismail on Oct 5.</p>
              <p>Dave was stabbed in the chest and then slashed across the arm with a knife, before the robber fled with his bag. Dave said there was no regard for his life (unlike robbers elsewhere in the world who just want money, and not your life) since he was attacked before being robbed, instead of the other way round.</p>
              <p>However, his ordeal did not end there.</p>
              <p>Not only did it take 30 minutes to reach a hospital as most taxis did not stop for him after seeing blood, police were also ineffective and inefficient.</p>
              <p>According to Dave, security at local venues did nothing. Tourist police also did not ask anything about the robber and only produced a report for an insurance claim, making the victim feel they had no interest in pursuing the criminal.</p>
              <p>Dave even called the tourist police office a "conveyor belt of victims coming in".</p>
              <p>"This place needs avoiding big time. I have travelled to Africa, Yemen, and SE Asia for nearly 30 years and I am not a squeamish person but I genuinely believe this to be the most dangerous place I have been to, due to the vast number of incidents and the frequency of them. It's epidemic," wrote Dave.</p>

              <p>Bill Gates Can’t Build a ToiletBy JASON KASS<br>Published: November 18, 2013</p>
              <p>In addition to eradicating polio in India and starting the personal computer revolution, the Seattle Superman of our age has managed to make going to the bathroom a cause célèbre. Five years ago, if I’d told people I worked on toilets, they would have surely assumed I was a plumber. Now, they exclaim: “Oh! Isn’t Bill Gates into that?” <br><br>More than one-third of the world’s population, approximately 2.5 billion people, doesn’t have access to a toilet. The Gates Foundation and a handful of celebrities like Matt Damon deserve credit for putting this sanitation crisis on the map.</p>
              <p>The trouble is that the Gates Foundation has treated the quest to find the proper solution as it would a cutting-edge project at Microsoft: lots of bells and whistles, sky-high budgets and engineers in elite institutions experimenting with the newest technologies, thousands of miles away from their clients.</p>
              <p>Just consider some of the parameters of the Gates Foundation’s first Reinvent the Toilet Challenge: Create a “practical” toilet that is suitable for a single-family residence in the developing world. Make sure it takes in the bodily waste of an entire family and outputs drinkable water and condiments, like salt. And while you’re at it, make sure that the toilet is microprocessor-supervised and converts feces into energy. And all this has to cost just pennies per person per day. That’s some toilet.</p>
              <p>The winner of last year’s contest invented a solar-powered toilet that converts poop into energy for cooking. Impressive — but each one costs $1,000.</p>
              <p>Other models boasted membrane systems, treatment of fecal sludge using supercritical water oxidation (heating water to 705 degrees Fahrenheit, or 374 degrees Celsius, then injecting oxygen) and hydrothermal carbonization (oxidizing feces at a high temperature and high pressure while under water).</p>
              <p>High-tech toilets are exciting, but even the Gates Foundation has admitted that “the economics of such a solution remain uncertain.” In plain English: No one can afford them.</p>
              <p>They are beyond impractical for those who need them most: the residents of slums in countries like Haiti, Indonesia and Bangladesh, where people make between $1 and $5 per day.</p>
              <p>Just imagine the fate of a high-tech toilet in one of these communities. What happens if the unique membrane systems get clogged? Or if the supercritical water vessel or the hydrothermal carbonization tank leaks, or worse, explodes? Or what if one of the impoverished residents realizes the device is worth more than a year’s earnings and decides to steal it? If the many failed development projects of the past 60 years have taught us anything, it’s that complicated, imported solutions do not work.</p>
              <p>The people I’ve met in countries like Peru, El Salvador and Haiti tend to be subsistence farmers in the countryside or residents of big-city slums who do odd jobs to make ends meet. They are survivors. They make use of what they have, and are often very good at fixing things. But don’t ask them to become industrial engineers overnight.</p>
              <p>When I listen to Mr. Gates talk toilets, I think of Juana, who lives in Belén, Peru, a city of 65,000 on a tributary of the Amazon River. Her neighborhood is under water half the year. During the other half, the drainage ditches are filled with excrement and rats.</p>
              <p>When Juana needs to relieve herself, she walks on a narrow plank for about 30 feet until she arrives at her bathroom — four rotting wooden posts wrapped with a tarp. She stands, precariously, on two narrow slats perched above a ditch and does what she needs to do. She also knows that her kids play nearby and worries about their getting sick, since the waste goes directly into a stream.</p>
              <p>Poor sanitation contributes to 2,000 childhood deaths from diarrheal diseases every day. Unfortunately for Juana, and the millions of people who live on marginal, waterlogged land, there are no cheap solutions available. What they need are the kind of toilets that they can buy or build with a few weeks’ savings.</p>
              <p>Ecological toilets that use natural composting to break down waste are simple to construct, waterless and are easy to fix. This is the go-to toilet for cottage owners in America who live too close to the water to have a septic system.</p>
              <p>The only problem is they’re too expensive, with price tags of over $1,000. In Haiti, an organization called SOIL has successfully brought low-cost composting toilets to over 20,000 people, and my organization is working on developing a more affordable version.</p>
              <p>Even simple solutions like the Peepoo bag, which inexpensively (less than 2 cents per bag) sanitizes waste before turning it into fertilizer, are huge improvements. They can also be critical in saving lives after natural disasters.</p>
              <p>If we embrace these low-tech toilets, we’ll be on the right track to getting 2.5 billion people one step closer to a safe, clean, comfortable and affordable toilet of their own. That’s something worth celebrating this World Toilet Day.</p>
              <p>Jason Kass is an environmental engineer and the founder of the organization Toilets for People.</p>

              <p>It is often the case, that there are multiple complex factors that coincidentally and/or collectively create various phenomena or observations, and no one factor accounts for everything.

She continued to asses if he was really following by taking another route home. And he was still behind her. So she stopped to call me and he stopped too. That was when she finally knew he was tailing her. <br><br>I told her to go to a crowded place, which was then the NTUC fairprice, Rivervale Plaza entrance. I called out for my 2nd sister and we made our way while keeping our youngest sister on the phone all the time. We found her at the traffic light junction and this man was standing just beside her and instinctively we knew that he was the one. My 2nd sister went straight to my to console her as she was already it tears, frightened. While I went straight to the guy, face to face and shouted "Why you follow her?!" He pretended to be on his phone and looked away while the rest of the pedestrians were staring at me. And I bet you, I was thunderous loud! I stared at him while he crossed the road to the opposite side. When all of this was happening, my 2nd sister saw 2 more Bangladeshi men emerged, approaching this man. <br><br>I am not sure if these people operate in groups, but to have this happen in broad daylight in a known safe neighbourhood, it is ALARMING. I have always heard or read such incidents from acquaintances but for it to happen to my own sister,it is darn scary and eye opening.<br><br>Please dear people, NOTE his face. If you see him around and he is not following you then LOOK OUT for the people around. He might be tailing someone else.<br><br>He might not act now, but REALLY let's prevent any unnecessary incidents that we might regret one day. Let's share this picture to alert one another!<br><br>May God keep us and our loved ones safe. Amin...<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Raudah Abdullah<br><br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Alternative-View/358759327518739?hc_location=timeline">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Alternative-View/358759327518739?hc_location=timeline</a></blockquote></div>
