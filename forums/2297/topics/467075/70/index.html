              KNN I was on a SMRT bus drive halfway reach at bus stop then suddenly, the bus driver stop engine... Without giving any notice to passenger, I saw the bus driver leap out of the car like olympic sprinter and run all the way to koptiam.
              <br><br>
              I thought WTF, got bomb in the bus or what, he just throw the bus at the bus stop. But when I see him run to the coffee shop then I realised he probably went to shit.
              <br><br>
              KNN inside so warm and so I went out for a smoke break.
              <br><br>
              FIRST time I take public bus can go smoke break.
              <br><br>
              Anyone encountered this before?

              I told them to sit as the trai was empty and they were still hesitant, politely declining. Then I said, ""Eh recruit, I'm a officer and I order you to sit! Anybody say anything ask them to look for me, I'm Major Lim from XXX camp!"" To which they profusely thanked me and sat.

              Actually, I was a lance corporal in the army a long time ago but I think this situation is ridiculous and I think I'm doing my part to protect our young soldiers from the assholes in the public.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another regrettable illustration of why the human world of money, finance and economics is unethical and only serves to widen the rich-poor divide : In India, 1/3 of its people suffer from having no access to electricity at all. At the same time, India's power plants are shutting down due to lack of profitability required to sustain operations : because they can't find enough paying customers to buy their electricity : because the poor cannot afford to pay for electricity, and there aren't enough rich paying customers (businesses and industries and even the Indian government have financial problems and are unable to pay the power plants regularly) to sustain profitability of the power plants. This results in India's infrastructure becoming woefully underdeveloped, which in turn condemns the poor to a vicious cycle of ever-worsening poverty.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/india/indias-power-plants-struggling-find-customers">http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/india/indias-power-plants-struggling-find-customers</a></div>

His family said he had been giving a colleague, Liu Jia, a lift.</p><p> According to a local TV channel, the three families met two days after the accident when Wang's wife and his father are said to have apologized to the victims' families and gave each 50,000 yuan (US$8,055).

            <div class='col-md body'>Myanmar fisherman goes home after 22 years as a slave<br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/myanmar-fisherman-goes-home-22-years-slave-054429865.html#">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/myanmar-fisherman-goes-home-22-years-slave-054429865.html#</a><p>TUAL, Indonesia (AP) â€” All he did was ask to go home.</p><p>The last time the Burmese slave made the same request, he was beaten almost to death. But after being gone eight years and forced to work on a boat in faraway Indonesia, Myint Naing was willing to risk everything to see his mother again.</p><p>So he threw himself on the ground and begged for freedom. Instead, the captain vowed to kill him for trying to jump ship, and chained him for three days without food or water.</p><p>He was afraid he would disappear. And that his mother would have no idea where to look.</p><p>Myint is one of more than 800 current and former slaves rescued or repatriated after a year-long Associated Press investigation into pervasive labor abuses in Southeast Asia's fishing industry.</p><p>Thailand's booming seafood business alone runs on an estimated 200,000 migrant workers, many of them forced onto boats after being tricked, kidnapped or sold. It's a brutal trade that has operated for decades, with companies relying on slaves to supply fish to the United States, Europe and Japan â€” on dinner tables and in cat food bowls.</p><p>Myint, his family and his friends recounted his story to AP, which also followed parts of his journey. It is strikingly similar to accounts given by many of the more than 330 current and former slaves from Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand interviewed in person or in writing by AP.</p><p>In 1993, a broker visited Myint's village in southern Myanmar with promises of jobs for young men in Thailand. Myint was only 18 years old, with no travel experience, but his family was desperate for money. So his mother finally relented. When the agent returned, he hustled his new recruits to grab their bags immediately.</p><p>Myint's mother wasn't home. He never got to say goodbye.</p><p>A month later, Myint found himself at sea. After 15 days, his boat finally docked on the remote Indonesian island of Tual, surrounded by one of the world's richest fishing grounds. The Thai captain shouted that everyone on board now belonged to him: "You Burmese are never going home. You were sold, and no one is ever coming to rescue you."</p><p>Myint spent weeks at a time on the open ocean, living only on rice and the parts of the catch no one else would eat. As Thailand's seafood export industry has expanded, overfishing has forced trawlers farther into foreign waters. So migrants are now trapped for months, or even years, aboard floating prisons.</p><p>During the busiest times, the men worked up to 24 hours a day. There was no medicine, and they were forced to drink boiled sea water. Anyone who took a break or fell ill was hit by the captain. Fishermen said that workers on some boats were killed if they slowed down, while others simply flung themselves overboard.</p><p>Myint was paid only $10 a month, and sometimes not at all. By 1996, after three years, he had had enough: He asked for the first time to go home.</p><p>His request was answered by a helmet cracking his skull.</p><p>He ran away. An Indonesian family took mercy on Myint until he healed, and then offered him food and shelter for work on their farm. For five years, he lived this simple life. But he couldn't forget his relatives in Myanmar, otherwise known as Burma, or the friends he left behind on the boat.</p><p>In 2001, he heard one captain was offering to take fishermen back home if they agreed to work. So, eight years after he first arrived in Indonesia, he returned to the sea.</p><p>But the conditions were just as appalling as the first time, and the money still didn't come. If anything, the slave trade was getting worse. To meet growing demand, brokers sometimes even drugged and kidnapped migrant workers to get them on board.</p><p>After nine months on the water, Myint's captain told the crew he was abandoning them to go back to Thailand alone. Furious and desperate, the Burmese slave once again pleaded to go home. That, he said, was when he was chained to the boat.</p><p>Searching desperately, he found a small piece of metal to pick the lock. Hours later, he heard a click. The shackles slid off. He dove into the black water after midnight and swam to shore.</p><p>Myint hid alone in the jungle in Tual. He couldn't go to the police, afraid they might hand him over to the captains. He had no numbers to call home, and he was scared to contact the Myanmar embassy because it would expose him as an illegal migrant.</p><p>He had lost nearly a decade to slavery, and had suffered what appeared to be a stroke, leaving his right arm partly paralyzed. He started to believe the captain had been right: There really was no escape.</p><p>By now, he had forgotten what his mother looked like and knew his little sister would be all grown up.</p><p>In 2011, the solitude had become too much. Myint moved to the island of Dobo, where he heard there was a small community of former Burmese slaves. He continued to live quietly, surviving on the vegetables he grew.</p><p>Then one day in April, a friend told him an AP report on slavery had spurred the Indonesian government to start rescuing current and former slaves. Officials came to Dobo and took Myint back to Tual â€” the island where he was once enslaved â€” to join hundreds of other free men.</p><p>After 22 years in Indonesia, Myint was finally going home. But what, he wondered, would he find?</p><p>The flight to Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, was a terrifying first. Myint, now 40, was a stranger to his own country.</p><p>Making his way to his small village, he spotted a plump Burmese woman.</p><p>They exploded into an embrace, and the tears that spilled were of joy and mourning for all the lost time apart. "Brother, it's so good that you are back!" his little sister sobbed. "We don't need money! We just need family!"</p><p>Minutes later, he saw his mother, running toward him.</p><p>He howled and fell to the ground. She swept him up in her arms and softly stroked his head, cradling him as he let everything go.</p><p>He was finally free to see the face from his dreams. He would never forget it again.</p></div>

              Singapore may be the only corruption-free country in the world...<br><br>Posted 2 years ago on another Sg forum :<br><br>A fortnight ago, I flew to Vietnam last min to attend an important "family" matter there. It wasn't my first time there alone (been there more than 20 times). When I was approaching the immigration counter to get my passport stamp, I notice the officer was smiling saying something while looking at me. I thought he was talking bout my appearance especially my full sleeve tattoo so I didnt really bother much &amp; proceed to Q. While in line, I notice it was longer than normal as the Angmo tourist was talking to the officer. Shortly after, it was my turn &amp; never once in my life I'd have expected such thing to happen to me. When I walked to the counter, these were the dialog:<br>
              <br>
              <b>Me:</b> Good afternoon (&amp; handed over my passport)<br>
              <b>Officer</b> (look at my passport, look at me): Can I see your return ticket?<br>
              <b>Me </b>(surprised): <img src="images/smilies/eek.gif" border="0" alt="" title="EEK!" class="inlineimg"> I do not have as I do not know when will I be going back S'pore.<br>
              (Officer look at my renewed passport which was collected only 2 days ago again &amp; kept quiet)<br>
              <b>Me:</b> Is there any problem?<br>
              <b>Officer: </b>Sir, you cannot enter Vietnam without a return ticket. You have to go back Singapore.<br>
              <b>Me:</b> I'm not aware of such rule here, sorry. I've been here many times &amp; this is first time ask to show return ticket. <br>
              <b>Officer:</b> I cant let you enter our country without a return ticket. <br>
              (he took out a Vietnamese language printed &amp; show me)<br>
              <b>Officer:</b> Sir, Singapore people can have visa up to 6 months with return ticket. Sorry. You have to go buy a ticket &amp; fly back Singapore. <br>
              <b>Me:</b> I'm really sorry I didnt know tt. Can you please help me. My mother-in-law is sick (I lied, she's not sick). Tt's y I do not know when I will go back. I came here very last min. As you can see, I only bought my ticket flying here yesterday night. Please help me. My mother-in-law is very sick &amp; my fiance is waiting for me out there (pointing towards the exit). Please. <br>
              <b>Officer: </b>You have a wife here? Call her.<br>
              <b>Me:</b> Can I borrow phone? I dont have top up for sim to call her. <br>
              (I took out my iPhone 4) <br>
              <b>Officer:</b> No no no.... You call her now.<br>
              <b>Me:</b> Can I borrow something poke my phone? (showed him my phone where the sim are) <br>
              (he ask his colleague for the pin)<br>
              <b>Officer: </b>this is your wife? (took my phone pointing the screen, then start looking at some latest photos)<br>
              (return my phone after a few flicks. I was thinking tt I'm glad not to have other women's pic there.)<br>
              <b>Me: </b>Sir, sim changed but no top up. You lend me your phone &amp; I call her.<br>
              <b>Officer: </b>(Gave me back my passport) You have to go buy return ticket &amp; go back Singapore.<br>
              <b>Me:</b> (stunned) Come on sir. Dont do this to me. Please. <br>
              <br>
              - If I'm correct, if any deportation should occur to any foreigner, the counter officer or any available officer will escort the foreigner to the secured location/ office to process the deportation procedure. <br>
              But I felt funny shortly cos his butt is still glued to his chair &amp; he didnt even call for any officer. He jus kept looking at me &amp; grin. <br>
              Then I knew what I have to do. <br>
              <br>
              <b>Me: </b>Please help me sir. thank you. (sandwiched a $50 note in my passport &amp; handed to him)<br>
              <b>Officer:</b> Ok. Next time remember to prepare a return ticket. This (pointing into my passport) is souvenir for me. (stamped my passport)<br>
              <b>Me:</b> Thank you (took my passport &amp; walked off in quick pace pissed) <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Mad" class="inlineimg"> <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Mad" class="inlineimg"> <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Mad" class="inlineimg"><br>
              <br>
              I felt relieved when I stepped out of the airport b'cos I finally get to know the feelings of those Beauties coming here happily but instead  they were being sent back home.<br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <b><i><u>I'd like to know: </u></i></b><br>
              <br>
              1) Since we do not need any visa to enter certain countries, do we still need a return ticket before being granted entry?<br>
              <br>
              2) Can I choose not to bribe, will I land myself into further trouble? <br>
              <br>
              3) If you r in my shoe, what's ur next action? Go back? Give in? Report?<br>
              <br>
              Any members with any different bad encounters with any authorities, pls share w me. Wanna know the Dos &amp; Donts of all these. Thx.

              Hi all, This girl is from the Philippines not Vietnam or China or Brazil. If you look at the investigation We Are Anonymous have done we show the same room this evil girl features in with another incident involving another dog and 2 other girls. These 3 girls were working for the same syndicate who were making Crush Videos. Both of the right leaders named Dorma and Vicente Ridon are now serving LIFE in prison for these crimes. The girls were underage and when they turn 18 will be charged also for these offences. They are under the authority and care of child services in the Philippines. When we have all of their names confirmed we will post them.<br> https://www.facebook.com/anonymousforjustice/photos/pb.273925916089983.-2207520000.1434839118./484473281701911/ <br> https://www.facebook.com/anonymousforjustice/photos/pb.273925916089983.-2207520000.1434839116./484474895035083/
