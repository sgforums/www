              <p>A new London skyscraper has been blamed for reflecting light and heat from the sun onto buildings in the next street, scorching the sidewalk, dazzling passersby and melting parked cars.</p>
              <p>Business owners and motorists hit out at developers of 20 Fenchurch Street in central London for starting fires, causing damage to paint work, cracking tiles, and smoking a carpet.</p>
              <p>According to an article in <strong><a href="http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/09/walkie-talkie-building-in-london.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Amusing Planet</span></span></a></strong>, one journalist even managed to fry an egg on the hotspot.</p>
              <p>When the sun reaches a certain position in the sky, a beam reflects from the concave south side of the building.</p>
              <p>This phenomenon apparently lasts for around two hours a day and will come to a natural end in about three weeks’ time as the autumnal sun stays closer to the horizon.</p>
              <p>As a precautionary measure, the City of London has agreed to suspend three parking bays in the area.</p>
              <p>The developers of the tower had been aware of the risk of the curved glass building acting as 'a giant magnifying glass', but had concluded there would not be a problem.</p>
              <p>“We are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short-term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future,” the spokesperson added.</p>

              <p>Every day for the last two weeks, this dog named Huang Huang has boarded buses to search to find its missing owner in Chengdu China.</p>
              <p>According to Huaxi Metropolis Daily, the dog scours the vehicle from seat to seat, hoping to pick up the scent of its master.</p>
              <p>Each day, it waits patiently in line for the bus to arrive, then boards with other passengers to repeat its routine.</p>
              <p>Drivers say he spends up to ten hours every day searching for its owner.</p>
              <p>As night falls each day, it gives up and disappears into the darkness, only to return the next day to start anew.</p>
              <p>A bus conductor named Fung believes that he had seen Huang Huang standing with its owner in the carpark about a month ago, but the man has since disappeared.</p>
              <p>Fung has considered taking Huang Huang home with him but feels that it may be too early to do so yet.</p>

              <p>The report by Wealth-X and UBS said that 50 Ultra-High Net Worth (UHNW) people in Singapore made it to the ranks of the super rich after property prices kept rising, rising, and rising last year. The Wealth-X mission statement: Provide our members with intelligence that allows them to acquire new relationships, expand existing ones, and eliminate compliance hurdles.<br><br>UHNW individuals are defined by Wealth-X as having total assets of at least <br>US$30 million (S$38 million). On average the 1,355 UHNW Singapore residents have US$180 million in total assets. Together they have a combined wealth of US$160 billion. Singapore has a ratio of billionaires per capita 3 times higher than <br>that of the United States, with one billionaire for every 200,000 residents.<br><br>Of course, not all their money is made from property asset enhancement. The <br>government has made sure the rich get richer, through measures such as:<br><br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Gains derived from the sale of a property in Singapore is not taxable as it <br>is deemed as capital gain;</li>
              <li>There is no estate duty payable for deaths on and after 15 Feb 2008;</li>
              <li>Generally, dividends paid on or after 1 Jan 2008 by a Singapore company are <br>not taxable. Foreign dividends received in Singapore on or after 1 Jan 2004 by <br>resident individuals are also not taxable;</li>
              <li>Goods &amp; Services Tax or GST on Investment Precious Metals was removed by <br>the Singapore government on 1 October 2012.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>Throughout the course of history, the flow of migration has always been <br>directed towards destinations where there is perceived freedom and prosperity. <br>Nobel prize-winning economist and champion of laissez-faire economics Milton <br>Friedman referred to this as “people voting with their feet”. It works both <br>ways. Singapore is very welcoming and inviting to the über rich, it is also <br>getting very hostile to those struggling to make ends meet. The tragedy is that <br>the poor are too tied down by debt servicing to make the relocation with their <br>feet.<br><br><strong>A Mr Tan, 71, who has a postgraduate in mathematics, actually pleaded with <br>his doctor to end his life and his wife’s two years ago. Even he could not do <br>the math, caring for his dementia afflicted wife, a son with <br>obsessive-compulsive disorder and a daughter with schizophrenia, all on the <br>pathetic financial assistance and food rations from the community development council. There’s no report on the ultra destitute individuals in <br>Singapore.<br></strong></p>

              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="clearfix">
              <p>Think again.</p>
              <p>Just when you think you are safe from bullying by venturing out into the working world, presuming that surely everyone is mature and will not resort to childish bullying tactics to get their way, you discover that the workplace is no different and it seems like school all over again with a whole new set of nightmares.</p>
              <p>Victims of workplace bullying are usually emotionally abused; there are no scars or bruises but the pain they suffer goes deeper.</p>
              <p>Here are accounts from some victims.</p>
              <p><strong>The Newbies </strong></p>
              <p>Newcomers are common targets as they are new to the company and have yet to form relationships with others; hence they are seen as easier to bully because they have no one to support them.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, newcomers are also seen as threats, especially in a competitive working environment.</p>
              <p>Megan is a 19-year-old sales assistant who is currently being bullied by her 25-year-old co-worker.</p>
              <p>"I only started this job about three months ago. As soon as I started she thought I was taking all her shifts and (she was) complaining all the time," she says.</p>
              <p>While Megan was learning the ropes, this co-worker became progressively nastier to her.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"She would talk to other colleagues about me behind my back, I would walk in the room and they would stop talking, then they would whisper and giggle and look at me and just subtly be really mean.</p>
              <p>"She has also been trying to sabotage me and another colleague by giving me incorrect information, and telling me to lie to customers. She even hid a signed contract from one colleague just to get him in trouble.</p>
              <p>"There was one incident where she told the manager while I was standing there talking to him that I shouldn't be getting any shifts because I don't know what I am doing.</p>
              <p>"I have confronted management with it and I believe they have indirectly dealt with it but have taken no real action.</p>
              <p>"It affects me because I feel really nervous coming to work and I don't like walking into the same room as her. It really upsets me and I have cried at work before.</p>
              <p>There was a day when I just couldn't come in to work because I didn't want to have to deal with it anymore. I have wanted to leave my job but it is just one person and I try not to let it get to me."</p>
              <p>Min, in her 20s, also experienced bullying some years ago while working at her first job.</p>
              <p>"On my first day I felt discriminated against. I felt unwelcome. During the first week I even had to go lunch by myself.</p>
              <p>"I would get a very bad response and support from the Technical and Software Department whenever I needed help.</p>
              <p>"I later found out that everyone in the company hated my senior who likes to lick the boots of the company general manager and never actually does his work.</p>
              <p>"All he does is talk to the GM the whole day and come out with all sorts of recommendations and command others to do it. Because of that, there's (a lot of) office politics going on with this senior and other departments.</p>
              <p>"I later confronted the Technical and Software colleagues and asked why they treated me that way. They told me they thought I was recommended by my senior and presumed that I'm his ally.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"I said it was very unfair that they judged me without asking or verifying. In the end, I became close to them and turned against my senior."</p>
              <p><strong>Veterans</strong></p>
              <p>It is not just bright-eyed fresh grads who are prone to bullying; on some occasions, even those nearing retirement are targeted.</p>
              <p>Lynn could not believe that someone like her, in her 50s, could be a target for bullying.</p>
              <p>"I just rejoined the company; I had left many years ago to care for my family, among other reasons. The person who is bullying me is in her 40s. She is always trying to put me down. She tried to separate me from others by telling them I'm a loner," she says.</p>
              <p>"Bullies are insecure. She saw me as a threat and told others that I was incompetent. It did not help that she is popular among colleagues; some believed her."</p>
              <p>Lynn was not easily affected by the bullying, given her years of working experience.</p>
              <p>"As an older person, I know where I stand. I just let others know. I also found out that she is mean to others, not just me. My colleagues are now more careful in dealing with her," she said.</p>
              <p><strong>Guys, too </strong></p>
              <p>Aside from women, men can also be victims of bullying at the workplace.</p>
              <p>Alex was 23 when he joined his company and somehow became the target of a senior colleague.</p>
              <p>"She would tell blatant lies about me in front of the boss. I tried to defend myself but as she was second in command, naturally he believed her more than me.</p>
              <p>"She would try to sabotage my projects, make life difficult for me at work and also turn my colleagues against me," he said.</p>
              <p>It did not help that one of his superiors was sexually harassing him. He quit soon after.</p>
              <p><strong>Potential targets </strong></p>
              <p>As the above examples show, targets of bullies can exist at any stage of working life. "Firstly, bullies always target people they think they control," said psychologist Karen Goonting,</p>
              <p>She added that an employee could also become a target if he/she:</p>
              <p>Has at least one vulnerability that can be exploited;</p>
              <p>Is different from others;</p>
              <p>Is conscientious, a quiet achiever, good at his/her job, is agreeable and well-liked;</p>
              <p>Shows independence of thought or deed;</p>
              <p>Gets more attention from others than the bully does;</p>
              <p>Has inappropriate social skills and has annoyed the bully;</p>
              <p>Is unassertive and prefers to avoid conflict;</p>
              <p>Has a dispute with the bully; and</p>
              <p>Is just in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
              <p>She added that sometimes, a victim can be chosen because the bully's previous target leaves the organisation.</p>
              <p>"If there is no likelihood that you will be physically assaulted, the quickest way is to inform the bully personally, assertively and respectfully that you will not be bullied," Goonting said.</p>
              <p>"Be prepared with concrete examples of the bullying ... the bully may feign ignorance or, as often happens in Malaysia, say it was all a joke and you are over-sensitive."</p>
              <p>Bullies pick targets they think they can control, so "the objective here is to show the bully that you will not allow him or her to control you."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From TREmeritus<br><br><img src="http://www.tremeritus.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/WP_0002571.jpg" border="0" alt="">There is a char kuay teow foreign trash selling at the corner coffee shop of Lorong 23 and Geylang Road. Beware when paying for your food as there is a scam going on there.<br><br><strong>My friend paid $50 when the plate of char kuay teow arrived, expecting <br>change; but immediately, a China woman appeared selling cashew nuts, etc. He bought a packet of nuts from her out of his generosity even though he did not need it.</strong><br><br>This woman appearing suddenly is to distract and cause delay in my friend <br>receiving his rightful change of $46 as the plate costs $4. My friend then asked <br>the char kuay teow seller for his change and the foreign trash hawker gave him <br>$1. When my friend said he paid him $50, the FTrash insisted he was paid $5 and <br>got his fellow char siew fun hawker to back him up. The two of them insisted <br>they received $5 and not $50. My friend was alone so what could he do? Two <br>against one and both swore on their fathers and mothers lives they received $5 <br>and not $50.<br><br>He walked up and left the plate on the table uneaten; DISGUSTED that <br>Singapore imports such foreign TRASH as foreign talent. He can afford to donate <br>his $46 to these crooks as he believes in Karma, because these two hawkers will <br>receive their punishment ten-fold in future.<br><br>These cheap trash are the immigrants S’pore attracts and welcomes with open <br>arms as long as they are Chinese. In western countries, one has to be <br>educationally qualified from a recognised University and have sufficient work <br>experience and savings before one is accepted by their Immigration Departments. <br>Even then, jobs are difficult to get as the employers there prefer to employ <br>their own citizens first.<br><br><strong>Over here, the numerous Chinese hookers sitting in that coffee-shop daily, <br>work in cahoots with these foreign talent con-men to cheat and run scams. <br>Immigrants from China, Philippines and India replace Singapore Citizens as <br>employers here think only of lining their own profits with lower salary costs. <br>There is no national pride especially among the elite and the connected as our great leader LKY has led by example to care only for themselves with incomes of millions of dollars annually.</strong><br><br>The ‘peasant’ population can go to hell and commit suicide and even their <br>hard-earned CPF is ‘robbed’ from them by the Minimum Sum Scheme/Scam. So is <br>there ANY HOPE for the normal ‘unconnected’ Singapore Citizens in Singapore?<br><br><br><br><strong>No Hope for Sg</strong></p></div>

This contest takes place every time the experiment is tried."</span></h3>

Maybe our society is more civilised," he said, laughing.<br><br>Is the actor worried that the issue will affect his career or popularity?<br><br>"I'm always worried about this, because as an actor, the viewers are my bosses too," he said.<br><br>"But as long as they're willing to watch me, I'd be glad to act for them."<br><br>Will he still consider getting into a relationship in the future?<br><br>Cao seemed taken aback by this question and initially tried to avoid it by saying he is busy filming a new drama, Soup Of Life, in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>The media pressed on.<br><br>What about marriage?<br><br>Cao seemed to cave in to the media pressure, and replied in mock exasperation: "Now I need to earn money to buy milk powder (for my daughter), I don't have time!"</div>
