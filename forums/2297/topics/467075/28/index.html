              KOTA KINABALU - A 29-year-old Chinese national and a Filipino resort worker have been abducted from a resort off Semporna. The Chinese woman from Shanghai, and the 40-year-old Filipino worker at the resort were snatched by as many as six unidentified gunmen at around 10.30pm Wednesday from the Singamata Reef Resort in Semporna. Malaysian security forces have been put on full alert along its sea borders with southern Philippines. Sabah police have yet to make an official statement on the incident though Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) director general Datuk Mohammad Mentek has confirmed the kidnapping. Details remain sketchy, though it is believed that tourist was taking a bath in her room when the gunmen forced her out into a boat. It is as yet unclear clear where the resort worker was when she was abducted. There were about 61 tourists from China at the resort at the time of the incident. One of the tourists at the resort, a newspaper journalist from China, reported that many of the holidaymakers were in their rooms at various parts of the resort when the incident occurred. The tourist only came to know of it when the management ordered all guest out of their rooms after police arrived minutes after the gunmen fled with their captives. "A roll call was done and it was only then did they realise the tourist and a resort worker were missing," he reported.

              A female Chinese tourist and a hotel staff member were allegedly kidnapped on Wednesday night by suspected Philippine rebels, the West China Metropolis Daily reported. The incident occurred at 10:30 pm when a group of armed men took the two women from a hotel at Singamata Reef Resort, in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and then fled the scene by boat.About 60 Chinese and European tourists were in the hotel at the time. A reporter from the newspaper heard rapid footsteps and women screaming. One witness saw the alleged kidnappers get in a boat whey they left, and said the women were screaming "help". Around 11 pm, about 20 armed local police arrived at the hotel and guarded the area. Hotel staffers said the intruders are suspected to be Philippine rebels. The kidnapped tourist was confirmed to be from Shanghai. Chinese consulate general in Kuching has started a 24-hour emergency number to assist families of the missing tourists. Malaysian police have asked all hotel guests to make a statement about the incident. The case is under investigation. The Kuching consulate-general has published a 24-hour hotline 0060128861953 for the families of tourists.

              Road rage (like most social disputes) occurs when both parties feel they have been unfairly victimized by the other. Both think, "I'm the good guy here, he's the bad guy. This is unacceptable. I've gotta do something about this."<br><br>
              Read the visitor comments (25% of visitors blaming the front car, 25% of visitors blaming the back car, 50% of visitors blaming both cars). Who do you think is more at fault, and what would you have done if you were the a) front car, and b) back car ? <br><br>

              A friend sent me an sms saying how he spent a great deal of psychic energy over the weekend cursing his ex-boss. After performing Vibrational State, he said he realized that all that cursing was from his intruders, and that he wonders "how many other things everyone is doing are not from our own intentions, but are from intruders..."
                      <br><br>
                      This person (and almost all others) has missed the point entirely. It takes 2 hands to clap, and you can't push all responsibility unto the intruders. It was your own intentions, thoughts and emotions (what IAC calls thosenes) that attracted the intruders (with similar issues as yourself) to you in the first place.
                      <br><br>
                      Furthermore, the point (or evolutionary purpose) of consciential intrusion, is twofold : for the intruders to intensify, magnify and support your thoughts, emotions and issues (if these issues are unhelpful, they are the intruders; if helpful, they are the guides &amp; helpers), so that you can more clearly work with these issues (ala purpose of physical incarnation) for yourself.
                      <br><br>
                      The other flip side (self-evolution and assistantiality-for-others are flip sides of the same coin) of intrustion, is so that you (ie. the physical incarnate, the 'intrudee') have the opportunity to use your personal strength and wisdom (in working with your issues and therefore indirectly with your intruders), to guide, inspire and shift the intruder's perspective and vibrations (for the most part, they are not in consciential contact with the extraphysical guides &amp; helpers, they require physical incarnates to help them with this).
                      <br><br>
                      This is the more CosmoEthical, loving and helpful perspective of dealing with and working with Intrusion, rather than an antagonistic, fear-based, pushing-away-responsibility way of blaming intrusion, which is not helpful (either to yourself or to the intruders).

              [Singapore] - Corrinne May's article on being a Singaporean
              <br><br>
              What does it take to be a Singaporean? Let us count the ways.
              <br><br>
              By Corrinne May
              <br><br>
              What is it about the sound of the Singaporean accent that makes my ears prick up when I hear it overseas, miles away from Singapore? 
              <br><br>
              Itâ€™s funny how, just like a call to a homing pigeon, I can somehow always pick the accent out, from a crowd of people talking, in the middle of an airport, or a shopping centre.
              <br><br>
              And my eyes scan for the speaker, a familiar face perhaps. More often than not, I will end up following the speaker and asking him or her if they come from Singapore. Most of the time, the answer is yes. Half of the time, the answer is â€œMalaysiaâ€�.
              <br><br>
              Iâ€™ve heard it said many times, that you can take the Singaporean out of Singapore, but you cannot take the Singapore out of the Singaporean.

              I could tell people who have went to CHC before encountered some upsetting events too, mainly with cell group leaders in the church.
              
               Hereâ€™s to share top 3 unpleasant incidents committed by cell group leaders-
              
              1. Calling church members the spawn of devil
              
               I have 2 friends who attend CHC together since they were kids. They were also dating for 2 years when this incident occurred. They were both from different cell groups.
              
               Lets call the boyfriend Matthew and the girlfriend Jenny.
              
               Jenny was together with Matthew at his house when a fight broke out between Matthew and his mother. The fight turned violent so Jenny called Matthewâ€™s cell group leader named Claudia over to help resolve the situation. 
              
               Claudia was never in favor of Jenny because of personal judgment issues and hence has been disagreeing with their relationship from the start. She took the opportunity to brainwash Matthew that Jenny was the cause of his sour relationship with his mother and she was a bad seed in the church. She strongly advised him to end the relationship immediately in front of Jenny.
              
               Claudia then went to Jenny and scolded her, making her feel like the worse person on earth and that she was a sinner and the spawn of the devil. Her words were piercing and merciless. 
              
               Since Claudia was a cell group leader and was a prominent figure in church, Jenny felt that she might be right and started blaming herself from that point on. That very night, Jenny was still traumatized by the whole event and the words that Claudia had said to her. She was suicidal and totally broken. From the very start of the relationship, Matthewâ€™s relationship with his mother had never been good. Jenny was the girl that brought them closer, getting both of them out for dinner, going to church together, and going shopping together and even overseas trips together. Yet Claudia accused her of being the culprit who sparked the fight that day.
              
               Jennyâ€™s mother had to call the pastor of Claudia for a mediating session for Claudia to explain herself and apologize to Jenny.
              
               The whole incident was uncalled for and for a well-respected cell group leader to say such hurtful and pain-inducing words to another church member should not be tolerated.
              
               The course of action taken by the pastor was unknown but doesnâ€™t seem like much was done because Claudia was still a cell group leader a month later.
              
               2. Collecting of offerings during cell group meetings.
              
               So one of my friends named Chad who was a member with CHC for a long time went for a make-up cell group meeting (if you canâ€™t make it for your once a week cell group meeting, you have to go for a make-up session with another group).
              
               During the meeting, that particular cell group leader realized that Chad did not give any offering during the collection segment. So after the meeting he went to confront Chad: 
              
               Cell group leader: â€œHi, I realized you didnâ€™t give anything during the offering segment.â€�
              
              Chad: â€œYes I will be giving tomorrow when I go for service.â€�
              
              Cell group leader: â€œBut as a matured member, you should at least give something to set an example to the newer members.â€�
              
              At this point Chad was speechless. One on hand he didnâ€™t want to offend the cell group leader but on the other he knows that this cell group leaderâ€™s mentality is totally screwed up.
              
               First of all, I have to post a question to CHC. Why is there a need to collect offerings during cell group meetings? These meetings are conducted in membersâ€™ house and thereâ€™s a separated cell group fund collected for the hosting member to prepare refreshments. These offerings collected from cell group meetings still go to the church.
              
               So basically the church collects: Tithes, offerings during service, offerings during cell group meetings, mission fund and building fund.
              
               Secondly, when one gives his offerings to God he gives it to God. So why is it that a cell group leader is questioning members if he chose not to give his offerings. And just because there are new members? Setting an example? Chad is giving to God with a sincere heart not giving JUST BECAUSE HE HAS TO SET AN EXAMPLE. If setting an example is so important, why not make all pastors declare how much they give as tithe, offerings, and the various pledge funds?
              
               This brings me to my third point as well-
              
               Do you people know that CHC has a database to keep track on how much each member gives as tithe per month? 
              
               They have also made giving very convenient; you can pay by cash, cheques, credit cards and nets using the AXS machines around the church. Online donation is also available 24/7.
              
               So if a member fails to give his tithe/ fulfill his pledged building fund for that month, his cell group leader would call him and question him. The guilt tripping and the embarrassment would make you head down to church and queue up at the AXS machine the very next day.
              
               They make sure EVERY SINGLE MEMBER pay their tithe RELIGIOUSLY even if you are a secondary school student. 
              
               So imagine if a family of 4 attends CHC together and the man is the sole breadwinner, he tithes, gives some money to his wife who will then tithe and then allowance to their 2 kids who will also then tithe. How much of that manâ€™s salary actually gone to the church before he could actually put food on the table?
              
               3. Fornication
              
               There are many events that are of course unpublicized showed cell group leaders getting attached romantically with their members. They therefore carry out sexual intercourse committing fornication in church.
              
               Once they break up, their secrets starts coming out because if you remember from my previous article, â€œaccountabilityâ€� needs to be practiced. So the member/ cell group leader has to confess during counseling.
              
               Final words
              
               The distinctive hierarchy practiced by CHC has somehow proven itself to be detrimental to them. Pastors have too many things to worry about than their membersâ€™ well being and therefore leave it to the cell group leader to micro-manage the members.
              
               The cell group leaders themselves are most of the time unqualified in their field because they do not have proper guidance on how to manage people. All that they have done is bootlick the pastors and their previous cell group leader who would nominate them to go through a â€œcell group leaderâ€� course. These leaders take on responsibilities which overtime shown that their skills are inadequate to handle. 
              
               Of course, there are cell group leaders out there that have been doing a good job. I hope the good ones surpass the bad ones but they can never make up for the detrimental effects the bad ones have caused. Cell group leaders help to change life and gives members advise to make life decisions often, this is no Nintendo game. 
              
               Imagine if there is more than one Claudia, how many Jenny could have committed suicide by now?
              
               And of course, the offering part:
              
               Dear CHC, asking your members to cut back heavily just so that they can build Godâ€™s house, asking your members to sell their houses to build Godâ€™s house, all these are national joke.
              
               I have been in this church for years and I have witness so much, I was present for every service, cell group meeting, sub zone meeting, zone meeting, conference, seminar, bible study, prayer meeting, crusades, mission fund, building fund etc. I have sacrificed so much for this church, I was 14 and I was going through my puberty. To contribute to the mission fund that year I pledge $500.
              
               For 2-3 months I brought sandwich from home to school every single day. When I had $500 and I put it in the envelope, tears engulfed me and I told myself it would be worth it.
              
               Years later came building fund, I did my part and sacrificed so much. I was always hungry but I still starve myself just so I can make my pledge amount for the church. My parents found out that I have been giving so much money to the church they were so angry and cut my allowance by half. I did not make it for my pledge amount but I still gave as much as I could. 
              
               I will never forget how painful it is when I put that money into the envelope during that service and singing â€œChurch Without Wallsâ€�.
              
              Years later it came out in the news that the leaders have used the building fund money to fund Sunâ€™s failed career. HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE ME WOULD FEEL? MY SAVINGS, MY SWEAT AND BLOOD. I have given in vain and no china wine could drown my sorrows.
              
               Proven guilty or not, God will judge you when the day comes. I might not have given much as compared to the wealthy businessmen in the church, but what I gave was ALL that I had.
              
               I dare not call myself a Christian now because I do not belong to any church. My impression of churches and Christians has been tainted ever since my experience in CHC. I still live under the shelter of my parents who are much happier now that Iâ€™m out of CHC. My parents are doing well financially but Iâ€™m still waiting to reap what I have sowed to CHCâ€™s Mission and Building Fund. (I know what the Pastor would say; â€œyour reward awaits you in heaven. It might not be earthly material blessing.â€�) I hope the brainwashed City Harvesters would soon realize this cultâ€™s influence and grow out of it as soon as possible. Or in a more ideal scenario would be that the Pastors of CHC change the structure of the church and be more sincere to help member grow closer to God than just focusing on how to squeeze as much money out of members as possible.
              
               Whenever I hear the letters CHC nowadays, mixed feelings rush over me. I have decided that the years I spent, the money I gave and the lesson I learnt were all worthless. The prosperity gospel works for those who are preaching the prosperity gospel, I call the leaders of CHC â€œThe Wolf of Christianityâ€�.
