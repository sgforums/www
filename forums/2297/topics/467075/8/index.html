              <p>STATEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE ON ALJUNIED-HOUGANG-PUNGGOL EAST TOWN COUNCIL HAWKER CENTRE CLEANING INCIDENT</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/content/pmosite/mediacentre/pressreleases/2013/July/statement-from-the-prime-minister-s-office-on-aljunied-hougang-p.html">http://www.pmo.gov.sg/content/pmosite/mediacentre/pressreleases/2013/July/statement-from-the-prime-minister-s-office-on-aljunied-hougang-p.html</a></p>
              <p>1.     Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the grave charges made by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan in Parliament, that MPs Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh were untruthful, were ‘personal attacks’. He also questioned if Minister Balakrishnan’s statement was good politics for Singapore. Mr Low is wrong to have done so.<br><br>2.     Good politics is first and foremost about integrity. Singapore has succeeded because we have honest, upright people in politics: people who can be trusted to uphold the public interest, to speak the truth even when it is inconvenient, and to admit mistakes when things go wrong. This is how we have built trust between Singaporeans and their leaders, worked together to build the nation and improved everyone’s lives.<br><br>3.     If we cannot trust a politician to tell the truth, then we cannot trust him or her to safeguard public funds, to put public interest ahead of personal gain, or to make decisions affecting the well-being and security of Singaporeans. This is the standard that we must hold ourselves to, and that Singaporeans have rightly come to expect from those in politics, whether in government or opposition.<br><br>4.     This is why we must take accusations of dishonesty against political leaders very seriously. If any of my PAP colleagues is accused of lying, I will investigate and get to the bottom of the matter. If he has lied, there is only one option – he has to go. If he is innocent, I will insist that he clear his name publicly. The matter has to be resolved one way or other. It cannot be left as an “I say, you say” matter of opinion, which leaves a permanent question mark hanging over his reputation, and the reputation of my government.<br><br>5.     Conversely, before any Minister accuses any one of dishonesty, he must make sure that he is fully able to back up his charge. Minister Balakrishnan’s statement in Parliament was not just his personal opinion, but the government’s official position which the Cabinet had approved.<br><br>6.     Minister Balakrishnan circulated a dossier in Parliament setting out evidence that AHPETC’s Property Manager, Mr Tai Vie Shun, and AHPETC’s contractor, ATL Maintenance Pte Ltd, attempted to make the hawkers pay extra to clean the high areas. These documents directly contradict the statements by Ms Lim and Mr Singh that the Town Council and its contractor had not asked the hawkers to pay extra for the cleaning. The core issue is therefore honesty and integrity.<br><br>7.     In Parliament, Mr Low maintained that he had neither spoken to Mr Tai nor previously seen the documents in the dossier. He promised to try to find out who had actually asked the contractor to quote for the cleaning. But the next day, Mr Low reversed course without explanation, and said that he would not conduct any investigation.<br><br>8.     This is troubling, especially in the light of previous similar incidents. In the Budget session last year, Mr Singh plagiarised an article from the Internet, passing it off word for word as his own speech. More recently, AHPETC failed to explain why in 2011 it had appointed FM Solutions and Services Pte Ltd (FMSS), a company owned and run by close Workers’ Party supporters, to manage their Town Council, without tender and at a much higher price than the prevailing rate. Now FMSS, running AHPETC, has tried to charge hawkers extra for cleaning their hawker centres, and Ms Lim and Mr Singh have tried to cover it up.<br><br>9.     Mr Low cannot leave these grave doubts about the integrity of his fellow MPs unresolved. This is not how members of a First World Parliament should conduct themselves. Neither is this the sort of politics Singapore needs.<br></p>

              <p class="left">It's definitely NOT true that Vietnamese is derived from Cantonese or simplified French. I'm Cantonese and I've been working and living in Vietnam for years. <br><br>Many Vietnamese words ARE indeed derived from Cantonese, e.g. thank you, hotel, university, student, traffic, hotpot, soy sauce, etc, etc. But the language as a whole is incomprehensible if you try to figure it out using Cantonese. Unless you speak it since young, it's very difficult to pronounce Vietnamese words properly. Vietnamese has 6 tones and Cantonese has 8.<br><br>There are however many Vietnamese Chinese who mainly speak Cantonese albeit with a weird accent. In Chinatown, most signboards are in Chinese and you can converse with most of them in Cantonese although you may still have some problem understanding them because the accent is very different from what we are used to. <br> </p>

This is incidentally why southerners call themselves Tang (a later dynasty than the Han) people rather than Han people.<br><br>Before conquest by the Han Chinese, these regions were occupied by peoples such as the Yue (Viet) who later mixed with the ethnic Hans. The resulting languages are probably what we call Cantonese (several very distinct varieties including the Xinning that my father spoke), Hainanese, Hokkien, etc.<br><br>Not only do these languages often sound like Vietnamese, they also share grammatical and lexical features with that language as well. Indeed, the southern 'dialects' have more similarities with Vietnamese than they do with the northern dialects in many cases.</p>

Monosyllabic languages are often tonal languages; due to the use of tones, the number of available monosyllables is significantly more than in non-tonal languages, making shorter words more practical.

              <p>1. My mother was given allopurinol on 11 Nov 2009. This was the first time <br>she was taking this medication.<br><br>2. Any side effect, whether serious or not, was not disclosed by the doctor <br>before prescription.<br><br>3. Rashes surfaced on my mother body on 23 Dec 2009. I informed the doctor. <br>The doctor did not pull out the allopurinol but instead prescribed another <br>medication called Hydroxzyine to suppress the itchiness and rashes.<br><br>4. Rashes did not subside. I admitted my mother to hospital on 26 Dec 2009 <br>(it was a Saturday). The doctor who prescribed allopurinol was not in, probably <br>she doesn’t work on Saturday and Sunday. Hospital on-call doctor also did not <br>stop the allopurinol medication.<br><br>5. The doctor who first prescribed allopurinol to my mother finally stopped <br>the drug on 28 Dec 2009 and started to disclose serious side effect about the <br>drug, which we know was already too late. All in all, my mother continues for <br>another 5 daily dosage before the drug was finally withdrawn.<br><br>6. A whole chain of reactions started off on my mother for the next 2 to 3 <br>months. I called it the “torture chamber process” – Her skin got ripped off 90% <br>from her body, blood spilled out, hair fell off, wrapped up bandages like an <br>Egypt’s mummy, lips got burnt, tongue got burnt, finger nails came off. Wait a <br>second, did I just say “finger nails came off?” Yes, I just did, and it’s true. <br>The scariest moment was when my mother screamed so loud in pain when the nurse <br>needed to change the old bandages which stick hard to my mother raw skins.<br><br>7. Around March 2010, I began to do my own research and investigation on what <br>went wrong. I don’t have a clue at that time, except a nurse ever told me “it’s <br>allopurinol again”. That gave me a hint on something – history repeats itself. <br>So I went for background internet check. I dig deep. Indeed I did. I found <br>something, an article from Health Sciences Authority (HSA): <a href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/etc/medialib/hsa_library/health_products_regulation/safety_information/adr_news_bulletin.Par.75889.File.tmp/ADR_News_Aug2009_Vol11_No2.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/etc/me..._Vol11_No2.pdf</span></span></a>. <br>By the way, HSA is a statutory board of MOH.<br><br>8. On the front page of the article, the heading reads “Serious skin <br>reactions associated with allopurinol”. The 1st paragraph on the front page <br>reads “HSA would like to alert healthcare professionals (that is, including the <br>doctors) on a series of local suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports of <br>death associated with the use of allopurinol locally.” Also on the front page, <br>the 2nd paragraph reads “Four fatal cases linked to allopurinol use were <br>reported to HSA over the first five months of 2009.” If you remember the <br>previous link (the horror pictures) which I provided in my previous thread put <br>up by TR Emeritus, these were actually the same four cases.<br><br>9. On the second page of the article under the HSA’s Advisory heading, in the <br>second paragraph, it reads “An early signs of rash and skin reactions may be <br>indicative of a more serious reaction such as SJS or AHS, healthcare <br>professionals are advised to educate their patients on early recognition of <br>allergic reactions, on the importance of prompt withdrawal of the drug at the <br>first sign of rash and to seek medical advice.” <strong>Key phase – withdrawal <br>of the drug at the first sign of rash.</strong><br><br>10. Now, this HSA article was published in August 2009, meaning to say this <br>article came before the doctor first prescribed the allopurinol to my mother on <br>11 Nov 2009 (see item 1 above). This was about 3-months gap, so logically the <br>doctor should have seen the article and read about the HSA’s advisory. However, <br>when rashes occurred on my mother body, the doctor did not heed the HSA’s <br>advisory to stop the allopurinol. Well, maybe we think the doctor is always so <br>busy; 3-months time is still not sufficient time for the doctor to read the <br>HSA’s advisory. Well, continue read on…<br><br>11. I found another link from HSA: <a href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_products_regulation/safety_information/DHCPL/2001.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsapor...HCPL/2001.html</span></span></a>. <br>It said, on 22 Oct 2001, “Physicians are….to inform patients to discontinue <br>allopurinol therapy at the first sign of rash and to seek medical advice. <br><strong>So the same key phase “withdraw allopurinol at first sign of rash” is <br>not new, it has been existed for more than 10 years.</strong><br><br>12. The doctor who prescribed the allopurinol to my mother was a senior <br>doctor, holding a Senior Consultant designation. If history repeats itself, how <br>could it be possible for the doctor not to withdraw the allopurinol after I <br>first informed her about the rashes on my mother? Well, that’s probably <br>Singapore Medical Council is trying to find out now.<br><br>So far I have only referred on my mother case. What about the rest – those <br>repeated cases? Read on…<br><br>13. About a year later, an article released <a href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/etc/medialib/hsa_library/health_products_regulation/safety_information/adr_news_bulletin.Par.63167.File.tmp/ADR_News_Apr2011_Vol13_No1.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/etc/me..._Vol13_No1.pdf</span></span></a> <br>indicated that there were 6 cases on skin disorders due to allopurinol. I sent <br>an email to HSA to ask if my mother belongs to one of the 6 cases. HSA came back <br>to me and confirmed that it was.<br><br>Now, the interesting part, what happen to the rest of the 5 cases? DOA? (I <br>mean Dead Or Alive?) It appears that there was a breach on these doctors who did <br>not follow the HSA’s advisory. In fact, I sent another email to ask if they are <br>taking any disciplinary action against these doctors who did not follow their <br>HSA’s advisory. HSA came back and said the professional conduct of doctors is <br>not under the purview of HSA but governed by Singapore Medical Council (SMC). In <br>other words, HSA will not take any action and it’s only up to those who are <br>educated enough, dig very hard to source evidences and then file in complains to <br>SMC. So, the elderly are not protected because they (most of them) are not <br>educated enough to know the real truth.<br><br>14. If you just do your sums, from the time 22 Oct 2001 which HSA first <br>disclosed the news until now, there must be quite significant cases – 20, 30 or <br>40 cases? The scary part is still not the patients who died or suffered a lot of <br>allopurinol deadly side effect. The scariest part – the doctors continue to walk <br>free and think nothing is wrong by not withdrawing the drug at first sign of <br>rashes.<br><br>MOH should have stepped in to investigate the cases for possible breaches, <br>and should not wait for elderly to response. Or, better still, the government <br>should initiate a Committee of Inquiry, because it seems that there is a lapse <br>of medical protocol – doctors did not follow health’s advisory, patients die or <br>suffer a lot, and the doctors still walk free.<br><br>As to whether the hospital or doctor is negligence, this is what I have to <br>say:<br><br>I have a discussion with my lawyer before whether to take on (meaning sue) <br>both hospital and doctor, or only on doctor. It was my decision to take on both <br>hospital and doctor. My rationale of suing the hospital is to ask them (assume <br>mediation takes place in future) to waive off all the past medical expenses and <br>provide future medical treatment to my mother, whereas suing the doctor is to <br>ask her to pay for my mother pain and suffering. If I only sue the doctor, the <br>hospital can come after me (since I didn’t sue them, it can mean they did <br>nothing wrong) to ask for the medical expenses paid up, and it doesn’t make <br>sense for me to get the compensation from the doctor side to pay for the <br>hospital side. So I ask my lawyer to take on both parties. Moreover, it’s <br>employer-employee relationship, so technically the hospital should hold <br>accountable (it’s called vicarious liability in legal terms) for their doctors <br>mistake.<br><br><strong>The Writ of Summon is only served to both parties last week (3 July <br>2013 – Wednesday)</strong>. All along I hold off to serve the writ because I <br>don’t want to put both the hospital and us in an awkward position, for example, <br>like hospital provide treatment to my mother and I still sue them. I have no <br>choice but to serve the writ because the high court has given us the final <br>ultimatum. Either we serve the writ to the hospital and doctor by 4 July 2013, <br>if not, it will be considered void.<br><br>After the writ is served, I anticipate “reciprocal effect” or “tit-for-tat” <br>action from the hospital side, since the suing has begun on our side. Trust me, <br>they will make things difficult for us such as applying court judgment to chase <br>my mother out. When I heard from my lawyer that the hospital lawyer is going to <br>do that, I quickly email to MOH directly to try to hold off the hospital from <br>chasing my mother out. I will consult my lawyer on the next course of action, <br>while we wait for our next PTC (pre-trial conference) in high court next Tuesday <br>(16 July 2013).<br><br>Thanks and regards,<br><br><strong>Anthony Lim Boon Han</strong><br></p>

I'm pretty sure they will follow my order, and all of them will get a male secretary soon," he said, adding that there were about 50 senior officials in the province who had hired female secretaries.<br><br>Last year, the Gorontalo administration demanded 3,200 male civil servants to transfer their monthly pay to their wives' bank accounts in order to limit the number of affairs. </blockquote></div>

              <p>The Secret Space Program - Full Documentary.</p>
              <p>Published on Feb 7, 2013</p>
              <p>In this documentary the authors discuss the secret space program, what it is, who is behind it and why? Is there a human civilization living off-world with highly advanced technology and knowledge about the existence of aliens? Why are we being kept in the dark?</p>
              <p>They feature lot of people and attendees of the Secret Space Program conference in Amsterdam who also share their own experiences with UFO sightings. Then, they hit the streets of Amsterdam where the locals speak their mind about aliens, abductions and making contact with ET.</p>
              <p>Since approximately 1980, a secret space fleet code named 'Solar Warden' has been in operation unknown to the public... Is this nonsense, is it a conspiracy or is it simply so sensitive that it will cause uproar around the world?</p>
