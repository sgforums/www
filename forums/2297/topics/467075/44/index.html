              Ali Abdul Jalil successfully flees from persecution in Malaysia :<br><a href="https://weehingthong.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/ali-abdul-jalil-activist-seeks-asylum-in-sweden/">https://weehingthong.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/ali-abdul-jalil-activist-seeks-asylum-in-sweden/</a>
              <br><br>
              Excerpt :
              <br><br>
              KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 28 â€” After activist Ali Abd Jalil, Malaysia can expect more from its Malay-Muslim community leaving the country to seek refuge abroad if local Islamic authorities continue to prosecute those they deem as having â€œdeviantâ€� opinions, Datuk Zaid Ibrahim said.
              <br><br>
              The one-time de facto law minister said despite professing the religion of the federation, Malays in Malaysia do not enjoy complete freedom in how they practise their faith, as they are beholden to Islamic scholars even though they should only answer to God.
              <br><br>
              â€œWe can expect more Malays to be prosecuted for saying or doing anything that can be perceived as menghina Islam,â€� Zaid wrote in a blog post titled â€œSave the Malaysâ€�.
              <br><br>
              â€œMore and more will be forced to seek asylum in other countries to escape jail. The wealthy ones are already in London and Melbourne.â€�
              <br><br>
              Zaid said those who have chosen to stay in Malaysia must continue the fight to assert Malaysia as a multi-racial country where other religions can be practised freely, as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.
              <br><br>
              â€œLetâ€™s point out to the authorities that even Muslims have rights, and that itâ€™s not them we have to answer to, but God. They may accuse us as being kafir, munafik, jahil and much more, but let them â€” they are the ones who are misguided,â€� said Zaid.
              <br><br>
              â€œTo the Malays who believe and support democracy and human rights, let us be brave even when we are labeled or accused of being deviant. If we do not want this country to be controlled by fascists, then we must be prepared to go to jail.â€�

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone posted on the internet :<br>I saw a China show, about 12 ladies choosing 1 guy that come to the stage. Some questions will be asked, and that guy to need present his requirement for an ideal partner. This guy say he is poor and look for a woman with big breasts and big ass that can give birth to multiple children, and she must be hard working to earn a living with him together. After this, all 12 ladies switched off their light as a sign that they give up this guy. Later this guy reveal, he is actually the son of a rich billionaire. All the ladies ask, can I switch on the light again??? This man say NO. This is a very good way to find a woman that truly love YOU, not your asset.</div>

              [China]- Plane forced to turn around when China woman passenger asks Thai AirAsia stewardess for boiling water (ostensibly to cook her instant noodles), and when the Thai stewardess brings it to her, the (horrible excuse for a human being) China woman immediately flings the pot of boiling water into the poor Thai stewardess' face. It's a miracle the Thai stewardess wasn't permanently blinded.

              Someone posted :<i><br><br>A friend who was there told me what happened actually, the chinese guy bought the kebab, but because i think the chinese guy was
                   busy doing something, he told the kebab seller he will return in 10 mins (the chinese guy paid before leaving).<br><br>
                  
                   Now when the chinese guy returned, the egypt guy said the chinese guy had not paid (which was untrue), so chinese guy was unhappy as the egypt guy was basically cheating him, so he got angry and ask his money back, but the egypt guy refused to return his cash and instead called him motherfucker and so the chinese guy shoved him.<br><br>
                  
                   This kind of scam very common on streets of cairo, they will ask to pay first and when you return to collect your goods, they will say you never paid even if you paid before leaving.<br><br>
                  
                   Moral of story never pay for the goods in advance especially if the seller is a foreigner in singapore, always COD </i><br><br>

              A funny thing happened to Chinese American comedian David Fung when he was in Singapore. He was in a club when a white man walked by, shoving him aside as if he was invisible. Whether deliberate or not, this sort of behaviour drives some Singaporeans batty and online forums are incandescent with outrage when expatriates are captured on video using their bodies, cars or bicycles as little bubbles of white privilege. David, 28, and brother Andrew, 26, make a living from YouTube videos that explore and poke fun at absurdities and frictions that exist between Asians living in the United States and the white majority. "It is what it is, man," says David of the club incident. "I've accepted that racism exists," interjects Andrew in that rapid-fire, riffing style familiar to the more than 640,000 subscribers of their channel, FungBrosComedy. - <br><br>

            <div class='col-md body'>HHO Sailing posted :<br><br><i>Don't be fooled by this. It is widely known that Koreans are very cunning, dishonest, scrupulous, conniving, and very sneaky. For Koreans Image is everything! If you have read up about this, Cho Hyun-ah's Father (chairman) and Korean Air had only tried to publicly make it right by having his daughter humiliate herself AFTER he and Korean Air tried to bribe the pilots to say otherwise but didn't work. They got caught trying to cover it as you could read below, so they went to plan 'B'. Where's the honor in that?... Shouldn't the father and Korean Air be reprimanded too?...<br><br>"When Park returned to South Korea on a separate flight after being forced out from the plane, five to six officials from Korean Air came to visit his home every day and asked him to give a false account to authorities of what happened, he told KBS. The officials asked him to tell investigators that Cho did not use abusive language and that he voluntarily got off the plane, Park said."</i><br><br>[YouTube] - News report on the incident :<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfzfU4tY4tc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfzfU4tY4tcM</a></div>
