              <p>The YouTube account holder who posted this video, alleges that "<em>Dr Greer is saying these hybrid beings r benevolent. Do research on alien abductions that involve physical examinations,sexual experiments even human-animal hybrid splicing.These demonic malevolentï»¿ beings have been working with military n government officials at area 51,pine gap n many off limit facilities. Evidence is there..just look!</em>"</p>
              <p>In other words, he's alleging that Dr Greer and those involved in the Alien Disclosure Project (who are attempting to educate the public that the US Govt as well as organizations such as the Illuminati, have hidden the truth of alien extraterrestrial presence on Earth) are themselves either deliberately or unwittingly puppets of greater 'demonic' agendas, of the 'demonic' alien extraterrestrials.</p>
              <p>It's quite clear, that both Dr Greer, as well as the YouTube account holder, both have good intentions. Dr Greer is perhaps focused more on the positive, beneficial extraterrestrials (those who wish to assist humanity), while the YouTube account holder is focused more on the negative, malevolent extraterrestrials (those who have their own selfish manipulative, 'darker' agendas with humanity), and hence the YouTube account holder's fearful (but unfounded) suspicion of Dr Greer's liason with the darker ETs.</p>
              <p>The truth is a little more complex than either Dr Greer or the YouTube account holder realizes.<br style="clear: both;"></p>

              <p><strong><em>She looks 15 months old, but she’s turning 15 years old. She can’t walk or breathe on her own, and has come close to dying many times. But she survived. It’s a miracle that she can play the keyboard and paint, or that she laughs easily. Her rare illness has bankrupted the family, but to her parents, she’s the most precious person in the world</em>.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When Mr Teo Qi Kuang and his wife Florence Chew were expecting their first child, they were like any other couple.</strong> “We prepared for our baby’s arrival with so much enthusiasm. We wanted only the best for her,” Madam Chew, 44, recounts in an interview with The New Paper on Sunday in her four-room flat in Bukit Panjang.<br>“I pored over books for information and even bought a journal, all ready to chart our little one’s developmental milestones. I even made plans to enrol her in baby shows.”<br>The housewife smiles wryly, then says: “But the recordings stopped three months into my daughter’s life.”<br>Pei Shan was first hospitalised when she was four months old. She displayed signs of stridor, a high-pitched wheezing symptom that occurs as the opening between vocal chords becomes narrower.<br>Madam Chew recalls: “That was when doctors noticed that her limbs were shorter than that of a normal baby of her age. We were advised to monitor her condition as the physical growth of girls can sometimes be slower.”<br>That was the start of the couple’s journey of pain.<br>Mr Teo, 54, a cabby, says: “One (health) condition after another followed. Each time we thought we’d overcome one hurdle, another blow would hit us and we would have to go through the roller-coaster ride of suffering and emotions. It does not seem to end.”<br>Till today, doctors have yet to diagnose Pei Shan’s exact medical condition.<br>Pei Shan turns 15 on Aug 5. But for all intents and purposes, she is stuck in a baby’s body – baby fat is still present on her limbs, and she wears a diaper.<br><strong>As her parents share the girl’s chequered medical history, we are struck by the family’s immense courage and resilience.</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Teo says: “Our happiness (at being parents) turned to despair. Sometimes, I wonder, why us? What did I do in my previous life that I now have to repay that debt? In the beginning, we focused only on trying to overcome the situation, there was no time to think of anything else.”<br>He looks this correspondent in the eye, then adds: “I have gone to bed wishing that I’ll never wake up the next morning, thinking that it would be so much better that way.”<br>While it may be just a passing thought, it reveals the intensity of his helplessness and frustration.<br>“But I quickly remind myself that it would be so irresponsible. My wife and child will be left to care for themselves.”<br>Madam Chew gave up her job as a bank clerk to become Pei Shan’s full-time caregiver when the girl was nine months old.<br>Today, the devoted mother is sensitive to every sound that comes from her daughter’s room.<br>In the first hour of the interview, Madam Chew excuses herself several times to attend to her child.<br>“She’s calling out for us.<br>“Because of Pei Shan, I have become very sensitive to sounds, especially the ones that she makes.”<br>She points to the oxygen machine and says: “You hear this (whirring) sound? It sounds normal to you, right? But no, the sound I hear tells me that it’s time to send for someone to service the machine.<br>“I can hear the sound from the anklet that she wears even when I am in the toilet or kitchen. Or she’d go, ‘mee’ (short for mummy), and I can hear her calling for me. She makes a movement, I’d be able to hear it. Even if it’s very noisy.”<br>Pei Shan is home-schooled.<br>Madam Chew says: “When Pei Shan was about two years old, she attended Margaret Drive Special School for about a year. But being exposed outside meant she was more prone to infections, and that would land her in the high dependency ward.<br>“Once, her oxygen level dropped to nearly zero and she turned totally blue. We almost lost her then.”<br>Mr Teo adds in a choked voice: “Whenever she is infected and has to be warded, she has to go through rounds of suffering. Doctors find it tough to draw blood for tests or insert drips because they cannot find her veins.<br>“Despite the pain, Pei Shan does not cry. She will just bear it because she knows it hurts us. But you’d see big, fat drops of tears rolling down from the corner of her eyes.<br>“And my heart just shatters.”<br>They eventually pulled her out of school.<br><strong>Pei Shan’s mental growth has been remarkable. She is mature and knows how to please her loved ones.<br>A keen learner, she plays the keyboard and loves to draw.</strong></p>

              <p>A watercolour piece that she did made it to the front cover of Club Rainbow’s commemorative hardcover book, Colour of Life, Celebrating 20 Years of Club Rainbow, last year.<br>Pei Shan communicates mostly in English, but she can also speak Mandarin and Teochew.<br>Mr Teo says: “She is definitely getting better now... and stronger. I love her so much... it’s like... ”<br>His voice trails off and he pauses for a full 20 seconds as he fights back tears and tries to regain his composure.<br>He raises his hand to wipe his eyes, then continues in an emotion-choked tone: “She is my precious child.”<br>Madam Chew is the caregiver and disciplinarian.<br>She says in an amused tone: “My daughter always says that mummy is the one who nags and nags. Papa does not scold her. And he gives in to all her requests.”<br>We ask Pei Shan: “Who do you love more?”<br>She breaks into a big smile, giggles, then says: “Both.”<br>Madam Chew replies teasingly: “(Are you) sure or not?”<br>Pei Shan’s smile widens.<br>Who is more fierce? “Mummy.”<br>Does your daddy scold or punish you? “Don’t have.”<br>What about mummy? “Yes.”<br>Pei Shan’s responses indicate a child basking in her parents’ love.</p>

              <p>Every little action, word or sentence are what the couple consider miracles.<br>She spoke her first word when she was about four years old.<br>Madam Chew recalls: “She was sitting here (in the living room) and I was in the kitchen opening the freezer door when I heard a small voice go ‘ice’.<br>“I was stunned. And I was wondering if she said ‘eyes’... but I realised she was referring to ice cubes.”<br>Mr Teo shares how once, when Pei Shan had to be sent to the intensive care unit, his wife was crying so hard because they thought they would lose her.<br>“As my girl was being wheeled into the lift, I heard her call out ‘Daddy’ so loudly. That was when I told my wife not to worry. I knew for certain our little fighter would be fine,” he says.<br>Going out with Pei Shan wasn’t easy at first.<br>Madam Chew says: “They’d say, ‘Wah so pitiful’ and I’d boil (with anger). Some parents would pull their children away, like my daughter is a freak, and that made me fed up too.<br>“I used to get very angry, but her papa would advise me not to allow them to affect me.”<br>She adds: “But there are also kind and nice people, who’d chat or play with her.”<br>Mr Teo finds consolation in the fact that Pei Shan is oblivious to the outside world.<br>He says: “Sometimes, she’d ask us why she looks different from the other children (of the same age), and we always tell her that’s because she is special and unique.<br><strong>“She is a happy child and little things like watching her favourite show or eating her favourite food make her day.”<br>The future, however, remains uncertain.</strong></p>
              <p>Madam Chew says: “Other than telling us that she is suffering from ‘a very rare disease’, no doctor or professor has been able to give it a name.”<br>Right now, her medical record reads: “Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III (MPS III)?”<br>MPS III is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Sufferers generally do not display any signs of the condition at birth, but symptoms begin to appear during early childhood. Affected children often initially have delayed speech and behaviour problems.<br>“But even visiting professors and doctors (from overseas) have told us that Pei Shan’s case does not quite seem like it,” says Madam Chew.<br>Mr Teo says: “Whatever it is, we just know it’s like a blood disorder.”<br>Mr Teo says they had to abort plans to have another baby.<br>“Doctors told us that if we have a second one, there is a 70 per cent chance that the child will be like Pei Shan. Would you dare take that risk?”<br>Though the family is now getting financial assistance from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital’s medical social welfare, the initial medical expenses have taken a toll on them.<br>Mr Teo is a declared bankrupt.<br>The former insurance agent used to earn up to $10,000 in a good month.<br>He says: “As I became more preoccupied with her condition, I lost the passion to work. One thing led to another, and soon I found it hard to keep up with the payments.”<br>He now drives a London cab, which also doubles up as Pei Shan’s mode of transport.<br>“I asked to switch to it this year when my old cab was up for scrap.<br>“It’s so much easier to move around with her because we don’t have to fold up her customised stroller, which carries a heavy tank of portable oxygen.”<br>Mr Teo is now worried about his own health – he suffers from Slipping Rib Syndrome, a condition that has worsened in the past couple of years.<br>“I went for another MRI last month, and the doctor told me that it’s in a ‘very severe’ state. He suggested that I undergo an operation,” he says.<br>Cost, however, is an issue.<br>“Where do we find the money? And the worst part is, there is no guarantee I will recover. I’ve been warned that it’s a time bomb sitting inside me, but what if I become paralysed even faster than if I had left it alone?”<br>He prefers to take it one day at a time. It’s the same approach he adopts with his child.<br>“One small step a day. For me, as long as I return home and my baby can greet me in her usual cheerfulness, filled with so much love, it’s a day well lived,” he says.<br>Which perhaps explains why Madam Chew “complains” that “papa spoils the little one”.<br>“He’d give in to all her requests, like buying an extra pack of biscuits when she still has half a packet at home,” she says with a laugh.<br>Pei Shan loves to order home delivery.<br>Madam Chew says: “I cut her hair once a month, and one day, I told her, why not sometimes when I do that, we order fast food?<br>“She was so happy that she told her father when he returned home... and he included a bonus, ‘Let’s do that once a month then. You get to order what you like when you have a haircut’.”<br>Mr Teo laughs heartily and Pei Shan’s face lights up in a big, bright smile.<br><img src="http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/mkpeishan2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Pei Shan’s life expectancy is not known, say her parents.<br>Madam Chew says: “I have thought about it and I can tell you honestly, I hope she’ll go before us. Otherwise, who will take care of her?<br>“It took us so many years to learn how to take care of her intricate condition, to be absolutely careful.”</strong></p>
              <p>She adds: “I have told Pei Shan before, ‘If one day you find yourself fighting for your life (in the hospital) and the pain is unbearable, just let go. Mummy will let you do so’.<br>“I told her that she’d go to heaven and she should not worry about papa and mummy.”<br>Madam Chew smiles sadly: “Pei Shan asked me, ‘Then what will you and papa do?’<br>“Well, I replied that her father will likely continue working and I’d look after others, like suffering children or her grandmother.”<br>And the innocent girl asked: “Then what will I do in heaven?”<br>Madam Chew says: “I told her she’d be an angel. Our little angel in heaven.</p>

              <p>Former Conservative MP, Michael Portillo pushes his body to the brink of death in an investigation into the science of execution.</p>
              <p>As the American Supreme Court examines whether the lethal injection is causing prisoners to die in unnecessary pain Michael sets out to find a solution which is fundamentally humane. To do so he examines the key methods of execution available today: he discovers why convicts can catch on fire in the electric chair, learns how easy it is to botch a hanging and inhales a noxious gas to experience first hand the terror of the gas chamber.</p>
              <p>Armed with some startling evidence Michael considers a completely new approach. Will it be the answer? There is only one way of finding out - to experience it himself.</p>

              <p>Would the heirs of these PAP ministers join politics and run for elections too, like the Lee family did? They would certainly have strong mass appeal to Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Service difference between private and public hospital A&amp;E</p>
              <div class="content">
              <div id="post_message_1620335"><blockquote class="postcontent restore">I guess by now you heard about the guy who went to CGH with an 8cm gash bled for 7 hours until he fainted because of overcrowding in public hospital.<br><br>4 weeks ago, I went cycling with a 'mixed' group of people just friends of friends 8 pple. 4 I met for first time. One was girl who drove family's Mercedes whom one of my friends befriended from some online chat or something. We rented bikes and were on our way. We were only 10 minutes into our cycling when accident happened. We were on the cycling path then the guy in front turned to bedok jetty...the Mercedes girls skidded and haad a deep cut near shin about 5cm long..not as bad as a gash like the 7 hour wait case but deep enough to bleed continuously. If I had such a cut I would just press the skin together put plaster and tahan until clot. But this was a girl and there seem to be quite a lot of bleeding... someone suggested that better go hospital and get stitches.<br><br>Me and another guy volunteered t take her. Initially we wanted to take her to Changi Hospital but the girl said she wanted to go to this hospital called East Shore Hospital which was also quite near. I never go to East Shore before because I only only go public hospital so I had to Google map the route to the place.<br><br>When we reach East Shore hospital there was hardly anyone in the A&amp;E only a few pple who appeared to be waiting for pple already being treated. From the time we took the Mercedes girl into East Shore to the time the doctor saw and treat her was less than 5 minutes. My friend and I waited outside while she received treatment<br><br>I have been to A&amp;E of public hospitals many times sometimes old folks in my neighborhood fall break their bones or somebody's kid kena food poisoning and need treatment ...many times I have t insist they go to A&amp;E because it is very expensive for them ....one neighbor's kid vomited until what looked like bile cane out with vomit but parents were poor so they didn't want to bring him..I said must go and I would pay for everythng ... carried the kid downstairs and call for taxi but when I got to the public hospital a&amp;e we still have to wait several hours for the doctor....it is always long queues and hours of waiting at A&amp;E in public hospital.<br><br>Back to Mercedes. girl. We waited for her for about 20 plus minutes as the doctor stitched up her cut. When everything was done, we went to pay ...I was just standing next to Mercedes girl when the cashier said, "Your bill is $512"....I wanted to say "$500 plus for a few stitches...are you bloody out of your mind..." but Mercedes girl calmly took out a black credit card dunno from which bank but has the word MANHATTAN on it and paid the cashier,<br><br>That was the first time I go to a private hospital A&amp;E and its like a different world ....of the privileged while the rest of us make do and struggle with 7 hour waits and faint...the guy who died from dengue also waited for hours until he gave up and went to GP..,...no may be he died because he was poor...<br><br>As for Mercedes girl ...she is indeed a nice person she took the trouble to find my phone number to call and thank me just for accompanying her to East Shore hospital...I found out her family is a big player in the furniture business. I certainly don't blame her or begrudge her for the wide difference in healthcare...nothing at all to do with her. <br><br>It is the govt policy that divided healthcare due to aspirations of becoming medical hub for the rich to earn more profits by turning public goods into a for profit service, When you do this ordinary singaporeans have to auffer the high cost of your desire to earn more profits. It is things like this that amplify the effects of inequality in income and this divides our society .... </blockquote></div>
