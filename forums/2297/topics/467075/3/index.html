              <p>"Dark Skies (2013)", now screening at GV cinemas, starts out appearing as a supernatural horror movie about ghosts and possession, but the plot soon reveals itself to be about malevolent extraterrestrial alien intrusion and abduction.</p>

And when we say tiny, we're talking six inches from head to ET toe.<br><br>The film, called "Sirius," will also depict how readily available forms of alternative energy technology are what extraterrestrials may be using to travel here from the cosmically improbable distances between their home world and ours.<br><br>If this is all true, and that's a very big IF, it will certainly answer the ages-old question of whether or not humans are alone in the universe.<br><br>The force behind "Sirius" is Steven Greer, a former emergency medical physician. He's actively pursued avenues to get the U.S. government to reveal information about alien reality -- information that the powers-that-be have always maintained doesn't exist.<br><br>"Sirius" includes graphic footage of the supposedly humanoid entity of "unknown classification" by DNA sequencing.<br><br>A side view X-ray of the miniscule creature was also released to reveal its internal structure.<br><br><img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1071392/thumbs/o-ATACAMAHUMANOIDXRAY-570.jpg?6" border="0" alt=""><br><br>The film is Greer's latest effort to shine a light on the supposed cover-up about visitors from other planets.<br><br>In 1993, Greer created The Disclosure Project with the goal of getting the government to fess up its alleged UFO and ET knowledge as well as information about advanced energy and propulsion methods.<br><br>"What people need to understand is the secrecy around UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence really has nothing to do with ETs. It has to do with humans and the power that is resting in large corporations and financial interests that do not want you to know the truth.<br><br><br>More details on the possible ET specimen will be forthcoming when "Sirius" has its Hollywood premiere on April 22, followed by a limited theatrical release and simultaneous video on demand launch.<br><br><strong>Watch this 'Sirius' trailer</strong><br><br>

              <br>Greer further claims that, for the past 100 years, advanced science and technology have been known about that can be used by the whole world.<br><br>"This really is the greatest story never told," Greer said. "Once people understand that classified projects have figured out how UFOs operate, they will realize we no longer need oil, coal and nuclear power. This is the truth that has driven the secrecy."<br><br>Whether or not the little humanoid turns out to be from another planet or is a previously undiscovered species from good old Earth or is simply a hoax has yet to be determined.<br></div>

              <p>Homemade ice lemon tea, or teh-o-ice-lemon (or it's lime variant, teh-o-ice-limau), is now (only in recent years, where previously only Seasons/Yeos/etc canned lemon tea versions were available) readily available at most kopitiams and even food courts in Singapore. Used to be you could only get these in muslim eateries such as Simpang Bedok and Waroeng Penyet (whose Marine Parade branch has shifted next to Katong 112, due to rising rentals and landlord greed). Now homemade ice lemon tea is available almost everywhere (eg. HDB kopitiams, Mark Lee's Old Town White Coffee, etc). Among the fast food restaurants, only KFC had always offered it (and it's still good today). But be sure to manually squeeze the lemon slices yourself (ie. with your hands) before you drink.</p>
              <p>Not only is homemade ice lemon tea probably the best tasting drink around, it's an excellent source of fresh vitamin C (provided you squeeze the lemon slices thoroughly with your hands), which everyone should drink daily.</p>

              <blockquote class="postcontent restore">Yes, this sort of thing is more common than people might care to admit. In some cases, it's just psychological : you just tend to notice such instances of falling sick (or whatever, this psychological phenomenon isn't limited to falling sick after talking about your health, it's in fact linked to the Murphy's Law observation) more after you talk about your health. In some other cases though, it could possibly be something else...<br><br>Anyway, that's why many people keep some thoughts to themselves, because they don't want to "jinx it".

              <p>What people call "love", especially "love at first sight" or "I love him/her despite his/her looks" is really karma. Everyone has pre-existing relationships with many other souls from across lifetimes. Love, like many other aspects of human existence particularly relationship, continues across lifetimes, by way of karmic momentum (and inertia as well).</p>
              <p>So it's really no surprise at all (at least to people who have a deeper understanding of such matters), that the Stomper surprised herself by falling in love with someone she felt wasn't worthy of her own looks.</p>

              <p>Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology. You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world's largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything.</p>

              <p>This is happening (and has been since the dawn of humanity, but it's getting worse with each passing day) in every country, including Singapore.</p>
              <p>Every day, the average (ie. poor; note that average here doesn't refer to mean, but to mode) man-in-the-street sees advertisements for new luxury condos priced at millions of dollars (and the average man-in-the-street doesn't even have $100k cash), most units of which are snapped up by the super rich, the billionaries and multi-millionaries (both local and increasingly, foreign), who do not do any work at all (as they've millions of dollars across multiple investments which yield compounding amounts of passive income), as opposed to the man-in-the-street (as well as the super poor, exploited construction labourers who were the ones who toiled with their sweat and tears building these luxury condos!) who are at the oppressive mercy of their super rich bosses at work, as the rich bosses and CEOs pay themselves obscene amounts, eg. 1000x the pay of the man-in-the-street or the-worker-on-the-ground, while doing negligible work, eg. 1/000x the hard work of the worker-on-the-ground, particularly the worst paid professions which are also the hardest most miserable jobs, eg. cleaners. Because if the man-in-the-street workers even think of demanding fairer, more equitable pay commensurate with their hard work (relative to their corporate bosses, CEOs, company owners, etc), they would get fired by their bosses, and they fear for their rice bowls, because their family depends on them, and thus their miserable jobs, to survive.</p>
              <p>In today's world (across every country, but especially those with obscene Gini coefficients),  the rich keep getting obscenely and exponentially richer while doing no real work (of contributive value to humanity), while the poor keep getting miserably poorer even as they work themselves to death.</p>
              <p>This results in increasing resentment of the poor majority masses towards the elite rich minority, a rich-poor class social divide, which not only perpetuates an increasing crime rate, but unravels the fabric of every society, threatening society's and humanity's hastening decline and ruin.</p>

              <p>I know it's karmically arranged and all that, but the thought of two 5 year old girls innocently picking up yoghurt left on the street, eating it, and dying a terrible death from it's poison (one of the girls died within hours, the other died only after a week of suffering), still breaks my heart. Hopefully both girls have received healing in the afterlife, and are both doing ok now.</p>
