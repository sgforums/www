            <div class='col-md body'>[Singapore] - He suffers not just from a disfiguring disease, but also from the cruel words of strangers. Neurofibromatosis is completely non-contagious, but he often gets cruel scoldings from total strangers in public in telling him to move away, to leave the place, and not to be seen in public. A customer who saw him at work even complained to his boss to have him fired from the dishwashing job that he needs in order to support himself. He walks many kilometers to work everyday because he can't afford a taxi, and he doesn't take the bus and MRT in order to avoid the cruel stares from the public. Yet, he refuses to accept donations, telling well-wishers to donate the money to charities who need money more than he does.<br><br><a href="http://mypaper.sg/top-stories/diner-asked-dishwasher-tumours-be-sacked-20151116"><img src="http://mypaper.sg/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/image/20151116/MY_20151116_TNPMAN16_P_1840498.jpg"><br><br>http://mypaper.sg/top-stories/diner-asked-dishwasher-tumours-be-sacked-20151116</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Islamic State warned in a new video on Monday that countries taking part in air strikes against Syria would suffer the same fate as France, and threatened to attack in Washington. - <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/islamic-state-threatens-attack-washington-other-countries-122304353.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/islamic-state-threatens-attack-washington-other-countries-122304353.html</a><br><br>A top Iranian army commander said Monday that his troops would take "decisive" action if Islamic State group militants come within 40 kilometres of its borders with Iraq and Afghanistan. Iran, the major Shiite Islamic power in the Middle East, is heavily involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq against the jihadists, primarily Sunni Muslims who denounce Shiite Muslims as apostates who must be killed. The comments from General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, who heads Iran's ground forces, came after Iraq's foreign minister said intelligence sources showed Iran was among countries IS had plans to attack. - <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/iran-cut-threat-afghan-iraqi-borders-army-140800409.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/iran-cut-threat-afghan-iraqi-borders-army-140800409.html</a><br><br>Several Malaysian leaders including Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein are now targeted by the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), The Star reports. â€œI confirm that Isis is targeting our leaders, but the threat will not stop us from continuing our fight against terrorism in the country and the region,â€� Hishammuddin was quoted as saying in the report. - <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/malaysian-leaders-isis-crosshairs-says-014403448.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/malaysian-leaders-isis-crosshairs-says-014403448.html</a><br><br>As terrorist savages expand the scope of their attacks beyond the Middle East and America, how long more before Singapore takes a hit? ISIS has already put up an article in its English magazine, Resurgence, detailing how it could attack Sembawang Naval Base. How will Singaporeans react, then? - <a href="http://redwiretimes.com/cow-beh-cow-bu/singapore-is-a-prime-target-for-a-similar-paris-massacre/">http://redwiretimes.com/cow-beh-cow-bu/singapore-is-a-prime-target-for-a-similar-paris-massacre/</a><br><br>If there is one country the terrorists spreading mayhem the world over want to hit, it must be Singapore. This oasis of calm is an obvious target as it houses many Western companies, has a significant immigrant population and is considered pro-western in many of its policies and actions. â€œLackey of the Americansâ€� is a description that can be easily pinned on the country by the haters of the Western super power. - <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/comment--singapore-the-elusive-terror-target-082523628.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/comment--singapore-the-elusive-terror-target-082523628.html</a><br><br>Fanatical zealots tend to overreach, just as Hitler disastrously overreached when he invaded Soviet Russia. In its recent actions, ISIS has over-reached. In the past few weeks, ISIS or its sympathizers blew up a Russian civilian airliner and suicide-bombed a neighborhood in Beirut controlled by Hezbollah, in addition to its barbaric attacks in Paris. This all may be consistent with ISIS's warped world view--but it is strategic insanity. You can't attack everybody without bringing everybody into a coalition against you. - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/a-grand-bargain-with-putin-against-isis_b_8570252.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/a-grand-bargain-with-putin-against-isis_b_8570252.html</a><br><br>Anonymous Declares War On Islamic Extremists - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOUvgPsiAFc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOUvgPsiAFc</a></div>

There can be lots of drama within a single episode, eg. in "Shari Noble" season 4 episode 4, a woman trying to have sex with her dog gets her nipples bitten off (the dog was subsequently murdered by her furious husband), a woman (one of the main characters) having a one-night stand with a lesbian stranger wakes up to find one of her kidneys surgically stolen (ala the urban legend), and an escort agency sex slave gets her perfect face smashed in with a large marble sphere by her gangster mamasan (a recurring character in the series) just so the cosmetic surgeons will be forced to operate on her and change her face as the mamasan desires. All this is in just 1 episode, out of over 100+ drama-packed episodes across 6 seasons.<br><br>Shari Noble season 4 episode 4 : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twD-SrA28fw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twD-SrA28fw</a><br><br><a href="http://niptuck.wikia.com/wiki/%22Shari_Noble%22">http://niptuck.wikia.com/wiki/%22Shari_Noble%22</a><br><br><a href="http://blog.chron.com/tubular/2006/09/another-jaw-dropping-episode-of-niptuck/">http://blog.chron.com/tubular/2006/09/another-jaw-dropping-episode-of-niptuck/</a><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck</a><br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nip-Tuck-Complete-Various/dp/B003XWEQ8E">http://www.amazon.com/Nip-Tuck-Complete-Various/dp/B003XWEQ8E</a></div>

You want it, but to respond to hatred with anger would be to give in to the same ignorance that made you what you are.</i></p><p><i> Us two, my son and I, we will be stronger than every army in the world. I cannot waste any more time on you as I must go back to [my son] who has just woken from his sleep.</i></p><p><i> He is only just 17 months old, he is going to eat his snack just like every other day, then we are going to play like every other day and all his life this little boy will be happy and free, because you will never have his hatred either."</i><br></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Former US State Department Peter Van Buren shared his thoughts on the "World vs ISIS" war in a post that has gone viral :<br><br><i>"Stop what we have been doing for the last 14 years. It has not worked. There is nothing at all to suggest it ever will work. Whack-a-mole is a game, not a plan. Leave the Middle East alone. Stop creating more failed states. Stop throwing away our freedoms at home on falsehoods. Stop disenfranchising the Muslims who live with us. Understand the war, such as it is, is against a set of ideas â€” religious, anti-western, anti-imperialist â€” and you cannot bomb an idea. Putting western soldiers on the ground in the MidEast and western planes overhead fans the flames. Vengeance does not and cannot extinguish an idea."</i><br><br><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/11/15/paris-you-dont-want-read">http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/11/15/paris-you-dont-want-read</a></div>
