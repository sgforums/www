              <p>wait, what abt those top 5 jcs with the cop (cut-off-point) of 2 &amp; 3? (HCJC &amp; RJC). You mean they count 2 or 3 subjects only? I suppose all jcs will accept the after-bonus score, just that students with HMT are more favoured. Thus a student with HMT who scored 8 raw with an after-bonus of 4 will get in some good jc faster than another student without HMT who scored 6 raw and got an after-bonus of 4, which seems the same. But it's not.</p>

              <p>wah i think u a bit arrogant here. so are you implying that your usage of your vocab is 100% perfect? we might not use "spam" in its full dictionary context but surely you can read its implied meaning here. from your definition of spam, it includes "junk email", so by using "spam" here, you should also understand that it merely refers to your posting of irrelevant information(or junk). also, not everybody will go read dictionary for meaning of words before using it. do you really read the dictionary before you use every single vocabulary? </p>
              <p>"<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px; color: #333333;">so what if u think the paper is easy, nub school think easy alr what about pro school who are probably scoring much much higher then u .  by that time ur A or whatever expection will go down the drain ."</span></p>
              <p>^this is total insult to the weaker students. watch your language in public. calling other schools that are not as prestigious as the one youre in dosent make them "nub". it is pure insult to call other schools(even if they may be weak schools) "nub" in public. you might be a top scorer, but dont forget people also aspire score well like you(may do).</p>
              <p>how would you feel if you were a weaker student who found that paper to be easy and had hopes of getting an A with all the hardwork put in? please think for others.</p>
              <p>and i havent heard of any people complaining about the top 5 jc only accepting raw scores, so why is that a concern? besides the top 5jcs of trying to get the best intake of students, no other jcs have the incentive to admit students based on raw scores only...</p>
              <p>although i can only agree with you on 1 point, nobody can call an exam a joke if they cannot score straight A1s for it.</p>

              <p>the point here is not about being hypocritical through avoidance of usage of the word "nub". its simply to consider for others. for example, if youre not a very good looking person, would you really be preferred to be termed by others as a "fking ugly guy" or "not as good looking as blah blah"? the latter at the very least is much less damaging on one's pride. by being indirect on certain sensitive issues esp. in public many times helps you to avoid unwanted conflicts with others.</p>
              <p>i dont know, from your post it merely seemed like you wanted to dash people's hopes of getting As. the reality of achieving stems from a desire to do so. if you extinguish the desires from the start....</p>

              <p>so you see your best friend get worse than expected results, but you got better than expected results, you will just chuck him at one corner and forget about him since its a dog-eat-dog world right? dont have to care about others, others wont care about you when youre feeling down too.</p>

              <p><br>Right.</p>
              <p>So your school is "freaking lousy" with a "cap for express like less then 230", and it really makes me wonder what I should classify MY school with a <br>"cap for express like less than 220".</p>
              <p>I didn't know we judge our schools purely on PSLE intake without considering O' Level results and non-academic achievements.</p>
              <p>You really should just stop posting about this anymore and just shut it, because people's impressions of you is simply getting from bad to worse, though I'm half-expecting your reply to go along the lines of "So what? I don't care what you all think of me".</p>
              <p>No, I'm not talking about your posts making you seem like an elistist (even if you say you are not).</p>
              <p>Your 2nd last line ..</p>
              <p>"besides... its a dog eat dog world, seriously, who cares about other's feelings?"</p>
              <p>It just showed us a lot about your character and attitude towards life.</p>

              <p>i can only say that if this is your current impression towards life then it will somehow change next time. your method may work sometimes, but it dosent work for all situations. sometimes you simply have to face the fact that the world dosent revolve about you.</p>
              <p>i think from everything you've argued, it shows youre a pretty selfish person at heart.</p>
