              Hi, I'm currently taking my 'O's and I am unsure on where I should go next, JC or Poly. Therefore, could you clarify my doubts? Here's some background info, I am currently scoring 14 for L1R5 and 10 for L1R4. My goal is be an accountant and study for my degree at NUS Business School. I am the kind that doesn't study over a long period of time but to usually cheong 1-2 weeks before the exam.
              Here's my questions:
              For Poly, which course should I take to achieve my goal and where is the best the place to take it? as I do not believe the brochures for polys my school is giving me.
              For JC,. I have really no idea what's going on there. All I know is H1 subjects are the'easiest' subjects while H3 subjects are the 'hardest'. Is that true and do we get to choose our own subjects?
              What subjects do I require to qualify for my entry to NUS?
              For L1R5,  Is it a must to include maths? The subjects and taking is English, MT, Maths, Combined Humans(Hist/SS), Combined Science(Phy/Chem), POA, Literature.
              What's a typical Poly or JC timetable?
              Is POA considered a Humans subject and can I include it in the L1R5 instead of maths? 
              
              Thanks for your help  In advance.

              <p>Why NUS for business? I always feel NUS business is the weakest of the 3 public Uni.</p>
              <p>For poly, obviously you would need to take accountancy and to enter Uni, u'll need a GPA of about 3.7-3.8/4.0 to qualify. SP and NP should be good choices for poly i think.</p>
              <p>For JC, i think you should be able to do any subject combination you like since Acc has no specific requirement. You will get to choose your subject combinations but that it limited to what sort of combinations the JC you go to offers.</p>
              <p>Poly timetable like uni timetable isn't fix at a certain time everyday. They vary depending on the time your lessons start so starting in the afternoon, having wierd timetables with long breaks etc might be possible. JC timetable is just extended of sec sch timetable.</p>
              <p>Maths is a required subject for both poly and JC admission as far as i remember so you cannot replace it unless the system has changed since its close to a decade since i done my O's...</p>

              <p>You can check the course contents at all the poly websites. They should generally be the similar with some maybe having additional focus in some areas.</p>
              <p>Lecturers depends on your luck lah. Sometimes a course is taught by more than 1 lecturer or just nice the sem u taking the module they change lecturer also won't be surprising.</p>

              <p><br> I meant the studying environment. Is the lecturer good? Is the
              course at that particular poly good? Because I was told that the
              things they study differ from poly to poly.</p>

              <p>lecturer all the same one, be it poly, uni, private uni etc. Generally all lecturers are knowledgeable, but they're not like MOE teachers who have to go through NIE to learn how to teach students.</p>
              <p>Lecturers just come into the lecture to teach a subject. How they teach is up to them. So if u suan, kana those jialat one, prepare to self study on ur own.</p>

              <p>Why NUS for business? I always feel NUS business is the weakest
              of the 3 public Uni.</p>
              <p>For poly, obviously you would need to take accountancy and to
              enter Uni, u'll need a GPA of about 3.7-3.8/4.0 to qualify. SP and
              NP should be good choices for poly i think.</p>
              <p>For JC, i think you should be able to do any subject combination
              you like since Acc has no specific requirement. You will get to
              choose your subject combinations but that it limited to what sort
              of combinations the JC you go to offers.</p>
              <p>Poly timetable like uni timetable isn't fix at a certain time
              everyday. They vary depending on the time your lessons start so
              starting in the afternoon, having wierd timetables with long breaks
              etc might be possible. JC timetable is just extended of sec sch
              timetable.</p>
              <p>Maths is a required subject for both poly and JC admission as
              far as i remember so you cannot replace it unless the system has
              changed since its close to a decade since i done my O's...</p>

              <p>I think there is no BEST uni for a particular subject. So private sector, a business deg is a business deg. NTU, NUS, SMU, etc about the same to them. How they decide whether to hire u is usually dependable on how u present urself.</p>
              <p>Public sector wise, dun even need to care. A business deg from these three uni are recognised equally.</p>

              <p>Accountancy would be an ideal choice. However, you must really be very consistent and work hard for every semester (probably all As at least) to be able to proceed to local universities.</p>
              <p>If not, and if you are really sure about being an accountant, you can complete your accounting diploma and go for ACCA.</p>

              <p>There is still preferences in the industry and some companies 'openly' mentioning they prefer certain grads in the past.</p>
              <p>Pay scale has some differences as well if you do go and read the reports by the universities on the hiring rate of their students and the pay etc etc. Perception of best uni etc is not just on how they market themselves but also the amount of international accredations etc they have gotten which differs among the 3 Unis with NUS having the poorest for its Masters programme at least.</p>

              <p>haha yeah, unless u are really smart, its unlikely that u can score well if you only study 2 weeks before exams in jc.</p>
              <p>not saying that you have to study all the time though, just that studying for Alevels is different from studying for Olevels. u need to understand the topics as they teach, and not leave it till the end.</p>
              <p>H1 is just learning a bit lesser topics at the same depth compared to H2. the norm is to take either 3H2s and 1H1 or 4H2s. according to the score guideline given on the net, the entry to nus acc requires AAA/A = 3 H2 and 1 H1 distinctions.</p>
