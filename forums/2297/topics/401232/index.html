              <p><strong><span>Student bullies teacher by pulling her 
              bra strap</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>By VEENA BHARWANI</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mon, May 31, 2010, The New Paper </strong></p>
              <p>HE was a 15-year-old student and a bully.</p>
              <p>She was timid and his teacher.</p>
              <p>Last May, the student pulled her bra strap during a physical 
              education lesson.</p>
              <p>The incident left her humiliated in front of the other students. They
               started laughing at the teacher,whois in her late 20s.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse, she realised later that another student had 
              maliciously recorded the incident on his mobile phone and uploaded it on
               YouTube.</p>
              <p>This served as a catalyst for her breakdown, said the founder of 
              Coalition Against Bullying for Children and Youths (CABCY), Esther Ng, 
              47, who related the teacher’s story to The New Paper.</p>
              <p>She also counsels adults.</p>
              <p>Madam Ng, a psychotherapist, said the teacher had approached CABCY, a
               non-profit organisation, as she needed help coping with the episode.</p>
              <p>Formed in 2005, CABCY runs workshops in schools for students, 
              teachers and parents on how to deal with bullying. CABCY also offers 
              consultation services to schools, organisations, parents and students on
               topics related to bullying.</p>
              <p>Madam Ng said the teacher tried to recover from the first incident, 
              but when one of her students showed her the video on the Internet, she 
              went on a downward spiral.</p>
              <p>“This teacher was humiliated and stripped of her power two times – 
              the first time when the student sexually harassed her by flicking her 
              bra strap and the second when another student maliciously used his 
              mobile phone to record the incident and then uploaded and circulated the
               video.”</p>
              <p>She added: “She had to see a psychiatrist and was on 
              anti-depressants.”</p>
              <p>“She was so humiliated and kept wondering who else had seen the 
              video. It completely shattered her. She couldn’t get out of bed and kept
               crying all the time.” The video was taken down soon after it was posted
               online, said Madam Ng.</p>
              <p>She said the teacher went on medical leave for one month soon after 
              the episode.</p>
              <p>She continued to take medical leave four or five times a month until 
              February this year.</p>
              <p>The teacher decided not to make a police report as she didn’t want to
               make a big deal of a student bullying her.</p>
              <p>Madam Ng declined to reveal more as she said the teacher is still 
              fragile, even a year after the incident. She said the teacher was 
              bullied because she was an easy target.</p>
              <p>She said: “She is a nice and non-assertive person who will say yes to
               anything so she is a natural target for bullies.</p>
              <p>“When her superiors come up to her with extra work, she would not say
               no even though she already had much to do. That was part of the 
              problem.”</p>
              <p>Madam Ng said the teacher is learning to be more assertive in school.</p>
              <p>“She is a bit better now, she has stopped taking medical leave and 
              has gone off medication.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Resolved</strong></p>
              <p>Madam Ng said the teacher told her that the incident was resolved by 
              the principal and was not referred to the Ministry of Education (MOE).</p>
              <p>As she declined to give us the name of the teacher or the school, 
              this could not be verified.</p>
              <p>Speaking in general on teachers being bullied in school, an MOE 
              spokesman said that teachers have many channels to go to if they have 
              been abused.</p>
              <p>She said: “Typically, teachers who have concerns can raise them to 
              their supervisors or beyond to their school leaders… They also have 
              access to their Cluster Superintendent, MOE’s Personnel Division and 
              Senior Management.”</p>
              <p>When asked about dealing with such students, the spokesman said 
              schools may use disciplinary measures where appropriate and have the 
              autonomy to decide on the approach, taking into consideration the 
              students’ level of maturity and intent.</p>
              <p>The spokesman added: “More importantly, we believe disciplinary 
              measures need to be coupled with an educational approach by providing 
              the necessary counselling and guidance.”</p>
              <p>Psychiatrist Adrian Wang at Gleneagles Medical Centre said he sees 
              cases of teachers being bullied in school a couple of times a year.</p>
              <p>He said: “I see many teachers and some of them complain of being 
              bullied by their superiors and even their students and they get 
              depressed as a result.”</p>
              <p>Dr Wang said that in the last three years, he has observed a shift in
               the kind of students and parents that teachers have to deal with.</p>
              <p>He said: “Students are becoming more demanding and so are parents. 
              They are not as supportive as they used to be in the past.”</p>
              <p>Seven principals and nine teachers The New Paper spoke to said they 
              have heard of teachers being bullied though such cases are quite rare.</p>
              <p>The principals said that they train their teachers to handle 
              boisterous students.</p>
              <p>They also hire more experienced teachers and they also give teachers 
              an avenue to talk.</p>
              <p>Mrs Fanny Tan, vice-principal of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), 
              said: “Our teachers are experienced and know how to deal with the boys 
              and conduct themselves in a classroom.</p>
              <p>“Boys can be very vocal, but they know we do not tolerate rudeness 
              and teachers should be respected.</p>
              <p>“If teachers cannot handle a class, we will get a mentor who will sit
               in with them… New teachers also have a mentor who accompanies them 
              during lessons and helps them during their first few weeks.”</p>
