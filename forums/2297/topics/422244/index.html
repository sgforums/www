              <p>2. Which one should I buy for Pure Physic, Pure Chem, and Pure Bio , E-MATH, and AMath:</p>
              <p>a. Yellowreef Chalenging Drill Qns (which costs a lot) or</p>
              <p>b. Maths-digest.com O level?</p>
              <p>c. or other titles</p>
              <p>(<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note Maths-digest.com also sells challenging qns for subjects other than math.  Two are known as two publishers which sells challenging qns)</span></strong></p>
              <p>3. Should I buy notes and guidebooks (specify&gt;&gt;)</p>
              <p>4. How did you prepare for your O level/ how SHOULD I prepare? ( all subjects)<br>How did your school teachers prepare you (i'm not from "school which teach us how to do challenging qns..")? How to score very well then?</p>
              <p>5.Did he/she/they use panpac additional math book at sec 3 and tell you to do the challenging qns from the book (the red bullet qns)?</p>
              <p>Thanks for everybody..</p>
              <p>Actually I wanted to continue to post on the sticky thread about O level.. but it seems it is locked...</p>

              <p>Hello ^^</p>
              <p>New here too:D<br><br>About your questions</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li>You must have interest in the subject to score well. Try to like the subject and gain interest in it. Tuition is not really needed if your foundation is strong</li>
              <li>Browse thru each of them at book stores like popular. Different peeps have diff ways to study so that would depend on your style</li>
              <li>Quick study guide would be great a day or two before your examinations and tests as they summaries all the main points. You can make your own notes too. It would be better to make your own notes, as you will tend to better remember the things that you than what you read.</li>
              <li>Practices question in the Ten Year Series(TYS). Many questions that comes out during the o lvl are similar to the ones in the TYS</li>
              <li>yes?</li>
              </ol>Good luck with your Os<p></p>

              <p>Generally, ''O'' levels isn't really that tough. As long as you put in consistent effort and start preparing for Os around June/July, you ought to be fine. So... regarding your questions, here are my answers:</p>
              <p>1. No, tutors aren't needed. Teachers more than suffice in secondary schools, as they don't go at lightning-fast pace like JC teachers and have the time to offer you one-to-one remedials should you really require help.</p>
              <p>2. I have never heard of a or b, so I can only recommend other titles XD</p>
              <p> - TYS is a must have. All secondary students have a copy each for the maths and science topics &gt;&lt;</p>
              <p> - <span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">Impact, O Level Physics Workout (MCQ), Gabriel Lionel Morais. The MCQ questions available in this book really stretch (and confound) students, and since Os Physics paper also set MCQ questions aiming to confound students, the book would be a great help XD (Besides, my Physics teacher had this habit of lifitng questions from this assessment book, so it helped me in scoring As in school-based exams XD XD XD)</span></p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">3. Depends on whether are you struggling with that subject. If you are, purchase the guide books. If you aren't, just save yourself the money and make do without them.</span></p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">4. I did the TYS and other school's exam papers. Needless to say, I also completed my homework. And of course, CHECK YOUR ANSWERS! That's a really important step that most students seem to neglect for some strange reason or other. You might have completed your work, but not necessarily correctly. So, check your answers THOROUGHLY!</span></p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">As for notes. . . well, I have never been great at making notes, so I just coped with the notes that my teachers provided me with XD</span></p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">And yea, I started revision in June/July. An hour or two a day would be enough ^^</span></p>
              <p><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-1">5. No.</span></p>

              <p>1) From the past experience, there are few types of students who approached me.</p>
              <p>a) student lagging behind the syllabus<br>b) average student, just need some help<br>c) Fast learner, self-directed learner, want to know more about topics</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Depends on what you want to focus. Assessment book is like a tool. Use it correctly and it will serve its purpose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Basically, if you have some spare cash, you may want to buy notes from better schools. :-D Usually graduated student sell those notes online for a small price. You can even get the original copy. If no money, then it's okay. Cos most of the stuff are in your worksheet already. Different school present their material differently.</p>
              <p>Buying notes is just a added advantage to you for exposure to more types stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) If you are reading Point no. 4, send me a PM, i will send you a book which I've written that specifically answer this question. :-D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) No.</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt; Did he/she/they use panpac additional math book at sec 3 and
                                      tell you to do the challenging qns from the book (the red bullet
                                      qns)?</p>
              <p>I generally tell my students to attempt <em>all</em> the questions in their textbook (there are three add maths textbooks, and all three are excellent!).  Jumping straight to the red dot question without having completed and fully understood the blue followed by the yellow dot questions first is a very bad idea.</p>
              <p>After completing all the questions in the textbook, attempt the questions in the workbook that accompany the textbook.  This will further strengthen your understanding of the subject matter.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I recommend attempting questions from the older textbooks.  My favourite is L.H. Clarke's Additional Pure Mathematics, published in 1965!  The style of some of the questions are markedly different, and this will give you some practice on older, and questions asked in a different way.</p>
              <p>If you're interested in the solutions to the PanPac Additional Mathematics textbook in PDF format, go to http://www.ascklee.org/Stuff.html</p>
