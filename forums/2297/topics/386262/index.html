              <p>Hello everyone!,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for stopping by my thread , now i'm really concerned if i ever have a chance to have a 'N(A)' Certificate if i passed all subjects but with 22 points as in (ELMBA3) Grade. I need your opinion about this because lately (HNITEC) or 'Higher Nitec' Requires a Grade 4 or &lt; In order to Get a direct admission into it and guess what? - I got '5' as my EL Syll A Grade!!. i'll say it's a "close shave" but am i still eligible to have the 'N' Level Certificate?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know how else am i going to tell you.. i really need your replys because it's been past 1 weeks from the date of result slips being issued and yet i'm still worried if i still can have a chance to have the 'N(A)' Level certificate..with these :</p>

              <p>Ok.. , Noticed the above consist of a fixed value of '7' in all as in subjects. I scored 22 points if i were to filter '5' subjects and best 'Three' out of 'Seven'. I wasted 2 Points and that 2 points i've wasted it by playing computer games for 1 year. it was a lesson , i'd really appreciate it when i see my results.. absolutely no regrets.. Why? - i Pass every subjects with an exeptional of lower grades.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been accepted into ITE (college west) - AMK</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd understand that the ITE (College West) - AMK Campus page ins't updated ever since the results release for the GCE 'N' Level. is it a new course held at AMK Campus or the misinteprited the data transfer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My dream was to be a lawyer , the everyday children ambition from 'stereotypes' of parents who thinks 'Lawyer' - it will boost up my family name? - I'll say for those who think like that have seriously used the old ages too much untill they don't even know the meaning of 'NEW CRITERIA' and 'ERA'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm sorry if you find that a little bit too abusing the job title or it's just that 'you are jealous' - it's for me... =.=</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'd understand very well that i've realised my destiny and not dream and that fate is in the hand of god. i solely accepted that..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now , my question is.. does the mentioned course above have a better future career with the prestige of having a 'Degree' - as the education level/Qualification?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or.. Does having a 'Degree' in any fields will boost up my salary into better paying jobs? if you have , please enlist them in your replys.. i'ill so much look forward into'em.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now , if you're ever wondering.. i'm a Post-Secondary Education student who is anxiously waiting to start the new chapter of life in ITE or so called the 'dustbin for leftovers' - Why are you saying that?!?!?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd got to be honest with you guys , i've been to U.S.A before and i think their education system was way better than in singapore. In singapore , they want 'fresh ripe fruits of labours' into their developing strategy and the 'bad fruits' will be dump into thrashbag - The "ITE"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise , i've nothing to say in the above content and that i really need your reply so as to fill in the untold answers in my mind.</p>
