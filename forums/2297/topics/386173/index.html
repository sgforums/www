              <p>Subject combination has NO effect on your chance to enter any JC. All it affects is your choice of subjects in JC which is more limited for comb sci students.</p>
              <p>To enter a JC you need to get below 20 points for L1R5 and how good a JC you want will depend on how well you do and not your subjects.</p>
              <p>Maths is just practice practice practice.</p>
              <p>This is the dunno how many times a combine science student is asking about their chance in JC in the past 2 months...</p>

              <p>Hi lady death,</p>
              <p>To improve your Mathematics, besides working on it regularly, you can also try seeking help from the students in your class who are strong in it whenever you have problems. However, if you are really having great difficulties in grasping the concepts, you may wish to consider hiring a tutor to help you out.</p>
              <p>As for the rest of the questions, I believe dkcx has kindly helped to answer them already.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi, what do you mean by good jc? To me, YJC, MJC, JJC, AJC, etc, are all good :)</p>
              <p>You would need to score below 20 to enter JC, and probably around 12 to 15 points to enter the JCs I mentioned..........</p>

              <p>Hmm. Got a question here.</p>
              <p>When you say 8-10 A1s guarentees a spot for RJC and what not, does it mean that the MOE does not only look at the L1R5 and bonus points before posting students? Based on what I hear, no matter whether you got 6 A1s or 10 A1s, the L1R5 is still the same and, assuming bonus points deducted are the same and that both chooses the same JC as first choice, MOE would not favour one student over the other.</p>
              <p>Which is actually true?</p>

              <p>Jc choice does not really matter, <em>though its hypocritical i'm saying this.</em></p>
              <p>math is just practise. And you only need 20 points to enter a Jc, which i feel isn't hard if you put in some effort</p>
              <p>And I think, with your subject combi, it may not be advisable to enter science stream, especially in a "good" jc, eg. (AJC, MJC, SAJC, NYJC [realistic ones lol]) 'cause i have a few friends who did that and are under a lot of pressure. Of course, with hard work, it is possible; so do not give up hope by heeding what i said :x</p>

              MOE will look at the L1R5 first, but let's say Hwa Chong has 2 spots and there are 2 students, one with 6 A1, the other with 10 A1s, it would only be fair if the 10A1s student be rewarded with a spot. 
              
              it would be thoroughly unfair to let 6 A1 have same footing as 10A1. if they had the same footing, then every non-IP student can just focus on 6 of their best subjects and forego the rest. this will definitely not be fair. furthermore, 9-10A1s isn't that hard to get, considering the best 1600 of the cohort is not taking O levels.

As I recall, they have repeated many times on the websites that they will allocate the students based first on their L1R5 minus bonus points, then the choice. And just about every non-IP student is focusing mainly on 6 of their best subjects. Anymore is simply for bragging rights. Besides, if such a method is in place, what of schools that only have 8 subjects for their best class? Won't the students there lose out to those in other schools that have 10 subjects for their classes?</p></div>

              Hey thr! 
              Looking at ur subjects combi I feel it is not going to be easy to enter a good JC (I mean top 5 JCs like RJC, HCI, VJC NJC and TJC ). 
              This is because you only take 6 subjects, which is to say, you cant choose any your L1R5, not like if you have say 8 subjects where you can choose the best 6. (of cos L1 is Eng and 1 of the R5 is combine human). Therefore, in order to get in a good JC, you need to score at least on average A2 for every subject you take. If you are confident about that, then chance of entering VJC NJC TJC could be quite high. If not you can also choose other quite good JCs like ACJC AJC SAJC and NYJC.(imho L1R5 btw 9 to 15)
              Also, Math in JC is like a must, everyone takes it. So A math in Sec sch is impt.
              I would suggest you look for a tuition teacher if you find it hard to cope with sec 3 and 4 math. If you need any help pls feel free to pm me, I am giving math tuition =P. so consider this a self advertising if you dont mind~
              Oh ya another thing. each year, all the JCs will moderate their L1R5 criteria base on the cohort performance.
              All the best!!
