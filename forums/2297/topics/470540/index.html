However, she did not feel happy nor successful.<br><br>Here is the confession in full:<br><br>"AAA/B. That is what I got for A levels.<br><br>"Are you going to start judging me based on the results?<br><br>"Let me tell you this. Although results play an important role in our lives, losing yourself over grades is not worth it.<br><br>"As an individual in the 21st century, you have the power to make your own decisions and choose not to succumb to any kind of pressure.<br><br>Live life as you want to. You are definitely worth more than the distinctions printed on the result slip.<br><br>"PSLE score: 223. I cried when I saw my results. It was so bad. It proved how 'dumb' I was. My relatives were getting above 250.<br><br>"In the midst of preparing for 'O' Levels, I broke down and cried again. I felt utterly useless. My teacher told me that I had to drop Pure Physics because I couldn't make it.<br><br>I realised why I broke down: my self-worth was directly related to grades.<br><br>"After several failed attempts to excel and 'increase' my worth, I decided that 'A' Levels was the best opportunity I had to prove myself. I worked hard and burnt the midnight oil. Finally, my hard work paid off: TOP 3 in Level.<br><br>"But those days were not long. I was given the opportunity to mingle with top students from other JCs. They were smart, sleek and charismatic. I felt like a total loser, seriously, What am I with the existence of such people? I started comparing myself to others to boost my confidence.<br><br>"Right after 'A' Levels, The Lesson struck me hard. I work for myself and no one else. I work hard to stretch my own potential.<br><br>"Academic success does not mean immediate success in life. Everyone is different. Why bother comparing yourself to others? What have I been doing for the past two years? Basically staring at endless stacks of notes and tutorials.<br><br>"You are truly successful when you feel satisfied with life. I wasn't exactly happy because:<br><br>"1. I neglected my family members.<br><br>"2. Friendship turned sour because of competition.<br><br>"3. Spiritually, I was empty.<br><br>"Success can come in many forms. You know success when you feel it. Sometimes, academic success isn't everything.<br><br>"True, you can be scoring straight As and feeling so damn confident of yourself and the life ahead.<br><br>"But don't forget that everything comes with a price. It is your responsibility to balance work, life and family. Find your equilibrium.<br><br>YOU ARE WORTH MORE THAN GRADES."</div>
