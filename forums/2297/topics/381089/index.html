              <p>Hi fellow forummers, it's a lengthy post of my circumstances but pls bear with me.<br><br>Lately, and even right now, I am considering seriously the idea of trying again for my O's next year 2010. The last time I took O's was during the year of 2001, and the results I obtained were far from expected. L1R4=25. Horrible, pathetic, and simply way too outrageous. I always knew I could perform well at all subjects except english, if I worked doubly hard at it.<br><br>For the record, my results from sec 1 to sec 3 are in the following ranges:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>English (C5-C6) =&gt; i know, i sulk at it... :(</li>
              <li>Chinese (A2-B3) =&gt; i like this subject</li>
              <li>e-Maths (B3-B4) =&gt; this is okay, if i practised hard enough</li>
              <li>Combined Sci (Bio, Chem) (A1-A2) =&gt; for both (mug like hell)</li>

              <li>Geo (A1-A2) =&gt; mug</li>
              <li>POA (B3) =&gt; hate this, but didn't do too badly either</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Okay, here comes sec 4 results (totally screw-up, a number of reasons)<br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>English (C6)</li>

              </ul>
              <p>Alright, after listing both sec 1-3 grades as well as sec 4 grades, you can see this is totally outrageous, and a far cry from my standards. English, which is not my forte, has constantly appeared as a formidable and unforgiving arch-rival towards regular flunctuations in the range of my results. As for the others, I supposed it's within my means.<br><br>Now then, no excuses, no bullshits and straight to the reasons.<br><br>First, I had a crush on one of my female classmate. She's popular, above-average looks (to my ratings, though not to the agreement of others), friendly, and was really nice to me. Problem is, I was a totally greenhorn when it comes to love relationships, and I didn't know whether she was flirting endlessly with me, or just plain touch-and-go kind of girl towards the right mate. So, ultimately, in the end, the thoughts of her constantly disrupted my concentrations, to the point where I often flicker a look here and there to her. Now, I can safely said my feelings have subsided, though my ego is bruised, perhaps also becoming cautious towards relationships.<br><br>Secondly, during that time, there was a big family crisis in my home. My dad occasionally resort to verbal abuses towards the family, and there was quarrels now <br>and then. It was really hard to concentrate, and I was getting more and more depressed each day at home, not to mention the super-high stress incurred thanks to O's. Now, we aren't on talking terms, and the relationship has worsen akin to a cold war.<br><br>Thirdly, because of these issues, I resorted to gaming as a form of comfort and solace in pure solitude, even to the chagrins of some of my peers who were working really hard, arriving each morning with full loads of study materials cum full energy ready for the ultimate battle towards O's. Now, I completely quit gaming, it was too time-consuming.<br><br>That's all, the three main major points that lead to my downfall. I am well aware of it, self-bashed myself before, and now thinking whether it would be a good idea to retake it again. Problem is, the syllabus has changed since 2001, and I not sure if I can manage to do it well again as a private candidate.<br><br>I have completed my diploma in poly, national service (NS), and looking for jobs.<br><br>Any good advices, suggestions, helpful comments are all greatly welcomed and appreciated.<br><br>Thanks for reading!<br><br>Alp</p>

              <p>If u can it would be better for you to move on from your dip and leave the O's cert behind. 3.0 is still good enough for studies in overseas uni etc with good number of exemptions if it was from a local poly.

              <p>Hi fellow forummers, it's a lengthy post of my circumstances but
              pls bear with me.<br> <br> Lately, and even right now, I am considering seriously the idea of
              trying again for my O's next year 2010. The last time I took O's
              was during the year of 2001, and the results I obtained were far
              from expected. L1R4=25. Horrible, pathetic, and simply way too
              outrageous. I always knew I could perform well at all subjects
              except english, if I worked doubly hard at it.<br> <br> For the record, my results from sec 1 to sec 3 are in the following
              ranges:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>English (C5-C6) =&gt; i know, i sulk at it... :(</li>
              <li>Chinese (A2-B3) =&gt; i like this subject</li>
              <li>e-Maths (B3-B4) =&gt; this is okay, if i practised hard
              enough</li>
              <li>Combined Sci (Bio, Chem) (A1-A2) =&gt; for both (mug like
              hell)</li>
              <li>Hist (A1-A2) =&gt; mug</li>
              <li>Geo (A1-A2) =&gt; mug</li>
              <li>POA (B3) =&gt; hate this, but didn't do too badly either</li>
              <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Total L1R4 = 10 - 15
              !!!</em></span></span></strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Okay, here comes sec 4 results (totally screw-up, a number of
              reasons)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>English (C6)</li>
              <li>Chinese (B3)</li>
              <li>e-Maths (C5)</li>
              <li>Combined Sci (B4)</li>
              <li>Combined Humanities (Hist - E8, Geo - C6)</li>
              <li>POA (C6)</li>
              <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Total L1R4 = 24
              !!!</span></em></span></strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Alright, after listing both sec 1-3 grades as well as sec 4
              grades, you can see this is totally outrageous, and a far cry from
              my standards. English, which is not my forte, has constantly
              appeared as a formidable and unforgiving arch-rival towards regular
              flunctuations in the range of my results. As for the others, I
              supposed it's within my means.<br> <br> Now then, no excuses, no bullshits and straight to the
              reasons.<br> <br> First, I had a crush on one of my female classmate. She's popular,
              above-average looks (to my ratings, though not to the agreement of
              others), friendly, and was really nice to me. Problem is, I was a
              totally greenhorn when it comes to love relationships, and I didn't
              know whether she was flirting endlessly with me, or just plain
              touch-and-go kind of girl towards the right mate. So, ultimately,
              in the end, the thoughts of her constantly disrupted my
              concentrations, to the point where I often flicker a look here and
              there to her. Now, I can safely said my feelings have subsided,
              though my ego is bruised, perhaps also becoming cautious towards
              relationships.<br> <br> Secondly, during that time, there was a big family crisis in my
              home. My dad occasionally resort to verbal abuses towards the
              family, and there was quarrels now<br> and then. It was really hard to concentrate, and I was getting more
              and more depressed each day at home, not to mention the super-high
              stress incurred thanks to O's. Now, we aren't on talking terms, and
              the relationship has worsen akin to a cold war.<br> <br> Thirdly, because of these issues, I resorted to gaming as a form of
              comfort and solace in pure solitude, even to the chagrins of some
              of my peers who were working really hard, arriving each morning
              with full loads of study materials cum full energy ready for the
              ultimate battle towards O's. Now, I completely quit gaming, it was
              too time-consuming.<br> <br> That's all, the three main major points that lead to my downfall. I
              am well aware of it, self-bashed myself before, and now thinking
              whether it would be a good idea to retake it again. Problem is, the
              syllabus has changed since 2001, and I not sure if I can manage to
              do it well again as a private candidate.<br> <br> I have completed my diploma in poly, national service (NS), and
              looking for jobs.<br> <br> Any good advices, suggestions, helpful comments are all greatly
              welcomed and appreciated.<br> <br> Thanks for reading!<br> <br> Alp</p>

              <p>Hi Alp,</p>
              <p>Perhaps you will like to share with us as to which area of studies you are interested in. Putting that aside, I will strongly suggest that you do not attempt to retake your "O"-lvls, since you already have a Diploma from a local poly. Your GPA of 3.0 is enough to enter a few of the courses in local universities as mentioned by Forbiddensinner, though the most important thing is that you must have an interest in these courses.</p>

              <p>dckx, you have raised a valid point to re-address the need vs the sake of an O's cert. Even so, after applying to a number of jobs, i still have employers flashing their application forms highlighting the need to fill in O's credits, besides the highest qualifications.  So, I feel that without achieving proper results towards the number of subjects, which is eight in total in this case, is highly disadvantageous to the job applicant.</p>
              <p>I do agree with you on the difficulty of performing well in subjects that have changed over time, which is one of my main concerns towards a full curriculum retake. It's a calculated risk, no doubt, and also one which might bring forth a new wave of results - through hardwork, patience, and perserverance.</p>
              <p>For the part on further studies, it could work out too. I have read posts from forumers who had been to europe, particularly countries like Finland, as well as to US, Oz, and Canada, and received their degrees from reputable unis. Bottomline is still financially able to do so.</p>

              <p>Other than private unis, I have done my fair share of research as well into the courses of local unis. From what I have gathered from substantial posts so far, a number of the poly applicants with gpa 3.5 and below, who have either applied to local NTU or NUS, excluding the inclusion of "high demand" courses, have all been rejected. Not to mention taking account into foreign applicants. The lowest point who managed to get in was 3.4 with good cca records, together with O's results.</p>

              <p>TrueHeart,</p>
              <p>After much self-analysis, the area of studies which i have contemplated so far are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Applied Plant Science (Horticulture)</li>
              <li>Social Science (Counselling, Social Work)<br></li>
              <li>Chef, specializing in japanese cuisine, or western - possibly italian.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The last option is entirely reserved for the moment; I have read accounts of <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>, and wondered if it was a good idea to even think about it. The ability to work under pressure, long working hours, low pay, and in front of great heat are some of the traits required of a startup cook working to be upcoming chef.</p>
              <p>For social science degree,  I am not sure if I am able to cope due to my poor grasp of English Language. The same goes for applied plant science in horticulture.</p>
              <p>Given the choice, I would have picked social work a long time ago, as i believed this is a very meaningful career geared towards individuals who wants to make the world a better place for others of lesser privileged.</p>

              <p>Hmm, i will still recommend u try to persue a uni education if u can ever afford it. Currently economy is just recovering so companies might be more particular about the people they hire but don't feel demoralised because of ur O's results.</p>

              <p>TrueHeart,</p>
              <p>After much self-analysis, the area of studies which i have
                          contemplated so far are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Applied Plant Science (Horticulture)</li>
              <li>Social Science (Counselling, Social Work)<br></li>
              <li>Chef, specializing in japanese cuisine, or western - possibly
                          italian.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The last option is entirely reserved for the moment; I have read
                          accounts of <em>Hell's Kitchen</em>, and wondered if it was a good
                          idea to even think about it. The ability to work under pressure,
                          long working hours, low pay, and in front of great heat are some of
                          the traits required of a startup cook working to be upcoming
                          chef.</p>
              <p>For social science degree,  I am not sure if I am able to
                          cope due to my poor grasp of English Language. The same goes for
                          applied plant science in horticulture.</p>
              <p>Given the choice, I would have picked social work a long time
                          ago, as i believed this is a very meaningful career geared towards
                          individuals who wants to make the world a better place for others
                          of lesser privileged.</p>

              <p>Hi Alp,</p>
              <p>Do not worry about your poor grasp of English, for as long as you are willing to work hard on your language proficiency, it will definitely get better as time goes by. I also believe that there are language proficiency modules for most full-time counselling degrees, hence you can make good use of them if you are to take up this degree in UniSIM or other foreign universities.</p>
              <p>By the way, please do note that Horticulture degrees are not available locally. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a side note, I believe that the lowest GPA among poly students who entered the three local universities last year is slightly lesser than 2.55, which comes from the NTU Art, Design and Media degree course.</p>

              <p>By 10th percentile, they mean that 90% of the undergraduates for that particular degree course got a GPA higher than the amount shown.</p>
              <p>NIE's 10th percentile is below GPA 3.00 as well.</p>

              <p>Just a note, NTU ADM has students of lower results since ADM does not really put alot of emphasis into the results but requires each applicant to submit a project or something related to their course of interest and it is that project which is being considered for their admission and less their actual academic grades which is why the cutoff seems to be that low.</p>

              <p>There are AAA/A people everywhere but i would say ADM students mostly have a passion for what they are studying and would require a certain level of ability before they are admitted.</p>

              <p>Isn't a pass in english all that is needed for most such courses?</p>
              <p>Actually before really going to start a career in social service, i would advice u to consider starting 1st as a volunteer for a period of time and ensure that is really your interest before you consider making it ur career.</p>
              <p>As a volunteer myself, i've seen many people who initially had alot of passion and interest but somehow things don't seem to turn out as what they were expecting and they slowly loss passion and interest to quit in the end.</p>
              <p>Its best to have some experience, know that its really what you want before you go invest in time and money for a proper course since its too late to regret after you have obtained your cert.</p>

              <p>Indeed, it's stated on the site that the minimum requirement for entry to social degree courses on english language is a pass. Even though it's stated plainly, I do enjoy overcoming the limits of my own ability, and also intend to head to the States to obtain an LCSW license to work there, if everything works out as planned. Afterall, that's where the main branch of social work started. So, it's really a marathon towards english competency in the short-term and long-term.</p>
              <p>Truth be told, the lofty aspirations in my mind need to be brought down to the practical reality of the world. I've not volunteer in any professional organisations, though I do enjoy conversing with young children and elderly.</p>
              <p>I agreed a voluntary session would help anyone seeking a long-term career in the social service to re-adjust one's expectations, re-align one's proper vision, and review the decision before it's being cast in stone. So, dckx, where do you actually volunteer? Care to share some info?</p>

              <p>I volunteer at the Singapore Boys Hostel which is under MCYS and also at a Family Service center near my place. I'm more dealing with youths and kids in my volunteery work.</p>
              <p>However i should be leaving the boys hostel soon as i've applied to join YCM as a youth panelist next year.</p>
              <p>Anyway its dKCx not dckx...</p>
              <p>If u are looking for volunteery work, u can just check with any of the family service centers near your area. Most of them will be looking for volunteers for various tasks mostly tuition. U can also go to old folks home and offer to help if u like to interact with elderly.</p>
