            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i admit, for many of you, studying of chinese is hell, or even nightmare for some. When i was a sec sch or JC student, i have seen many students crying over it.<br><br>Now i have produced a guide to make your studying of chinese better, more fun and maybe improve your results!<br><br>For "all" (weaker/stronger) students<br><br><span class="large">Improve the basics of a language:vocabulary and understanding </span><br><br>following extract taken from "H1 chinese" thread which i have suggested to one of our fellow forumnite:<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">when i say "read" newspaper, not just read thru, flip it and forget abt it. at the end of the day, u will still forget. My suggestion is that, take a notepad and a pen with u, when u are reading newspaper and see a word that u nvr seen before or u dun understand, write it down in your notepad. do this for every article you read in your newspaper. when u finished reading the newspaper, take a chinese dictionary and check out all the words u do not know. rmb the hanyupinyin and zhao ju of the words (if ur dictionary has it), write down everything.  </span><br><br>Doing the above will help a lot. I myself have used this method and my chinese improved by leaps and bounds.<br><br>As you all know that reading and understanding is the key to improving English language, same goes for chinese (Chinese is also a language!), reading more chinese books will help in your general overall understanding in chinese and you will find that you will not stumble that much when you read chinese passages and exam questions.<br><br>For a start, read short stories ( or what u call, "san wen" ). These stories are actually short, but very interesting and yet easily understood. i recommend local chinese author books for a start.<br><br><span class="large">Common problem in chinese </span><br><br>For composition, with many years being a student, one of the major problem is "cuo4 bie2 zi4" (wrong words). Due to the little more "complexity" in chinese language, this problem is sometimes unavoidable, even for stronger students.<br><br>One of the solution to address this problem, what i suggest is, greatly expand your "bank" of vocabulary in chinese words (see the above paragraph in red). With a greater bank of chinese words, you will be able to differentiate the different kind of words used for different things. Many students actually can write beautiful composition, but due to too much cuo bie zi, many marks are lose and a A grade compo becomes a B grade compo.<br><br>DONT RELY ON YOUR DICTIONARY DURING COMPOSITION EXAMS!<br><br>you can ask me, then why the hell we are allowed to bring dictionary into the exam hall for?<br><br>Bear in mind that, dictionary is there to help you with occasional " forgetfulness " , it is not your "literature" passage!<br><br>Use the dictionary only after u have finished writing your composition. This will prevent you from losing your train of thoughts. Leave spaces for words that you do not know so that you can check them later, not flipping here and there duing the exams!<br><br>Check your sentence structure, tell youself whether it makes sense or not. If not, change it! change to something which you understand. If you do not understand, then i dont think your teachers will understand it too!<br><br>Use idioms in your chinese composition. I know weaker students may find it hard to do so, but chinese idioms are taught since primary school, so actually in my opinion, there is no excuse for you not to use. Use of idioms, even very simple ones, will improve your overall mark of your compositon.<br><br>Choosing the topics to write:<br>Generally, for secondary schools and Junior college (H1, H2 chinese), topics are generally classified into two types:<br><br>1. Narrative topics<br>2. Argumentative topics (Famously known as: Bao zhang bao dao.......)<br><br>So which one to choose and write?<br><br>1. If you are full of imagination and your chinese writing skills is good (know how to use a lot of idioms and descriptive words), go for narrative type of questions. Narrative questions are easier to "go out of topic" so do be careful.<br><br>2. If you read a lot of newspaper and is very well informed by current affairs and stuff, go for arugmentative topics.If you know how, you can also use a lot of idioms, descriptive words in arugmentative type of questions. Arugmentative essay are harder to go out of topic because you basically have to just deal with and debate about the topic thats all, unless you purposely write something out of point.<br><br>I will recommend arugmentative essays for weaker students because it would be easier. Why? As you all know more China students are studying here, they are taking the same chinese paper as us (if we do not talk about higher chinese, even so they have to take normal chinese first). (Most of us have to take O level chinese, they too). To them, our O level chinese is actually very simple for them. As narrative essay requires huge amount of vocabulary to make it "shine", they certainly do have the required condition to excel well in this area and honestly not many local students can do this.<br><br>So you can ask me, is it really that difficult to score As with China students around? Absoulely not. Remember, there is something called arugmentative essay. So far, topics that are set are all based on local affairs. As a Singaporean, you should be well informed and know a lot more on local affairs than a foreign student  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. Thats where you can score.<br><br>For formal and informal letter (Famously known as gong han and si han, applicable for secondary school):<br><br>Informal letter: less memorisation of letter format but more creativity in content needed to score higher marks.<br><br>Formal letter: More memorisation of letter format but less emphasis in content (actually, if you ask me, the content are literally "dead" (means, all are about the same!))<br><br>Weaker students, choose gong han. It is "dead" stuff and you can score marks by memorising!!!<br><br>For stronger students, you may want to choose si han if you are thinking of scoring "rocket high" marks for this section. However, as i say again, watch out for "out of topic" danger. It can make your "rocket" reach your destination or explode anytime.<br><br>PAPER 2:<br><br>I am not very sure how has chinese exam's format changed now (2 years sicne i took my H2 J1 chinese exam), but i am pretty sure that for secondary school chinese, no more memorising of "han zi" is needed. i will just touch on the tecniques for cloze passage and comprehension.<br><br>Cloze passage:<br>(more to be added on)<br><br><span class="large"> For Stronger students</span><br><br>Keen to improve your chinese to the next level? Try these:<br><br>If you listen to chinese pop songs, why not learn from the lyrics and how they write?<br>Copy down the words or descriptive phrases that you think has made an impression on you.<br>If you are not sure what that phrase means exactly, use a dictionary to help you!<br><br>after copying, try to apply it in your everyday school work composition excerise! During my secondary school days, i copied down one of the phrases from Jay Chou's lyrics and applied it in my composition. My teacher was very impressed  (probably he didnt hear jay chou's song) and got a very higher mark for it.<br><br>If you read si da ming zhu (i will strongly recommend you to read at least one, with xi you ji the easiest one), learn from their style of writing. True, sometimes the way it is written is very "chim" but do consult your teachers or friends if you do not know or understand any part. Or alternatively, read those "jian3 hua4 ban3" (simplified version), it is easier to understand, after that then you proceed to read the original ones.<br><br>If si da ming zhu bores you, why not try wu xia xiao shuo, especially by jing yong. Quite interesting, though i have not really finished reading one (i prefer san wen and short stories), and it will surely enriches your knowledge of chinese vocbulary.<br><br>Stay tuned for more.....<br><br></div>
