              I am sorry, but I think the correct answer should be that both carbon dioxide and oxygen react in the blast furnace. <br>
                      <br>
                      Let me explain. (You may want to Google for images and videos of furnace, to see how a blast furnace looks like)<br>
                      <br>
                      Say we have an iron ore (haematite) and we want to extract iron from it.<br>
                      <br>
                      Haematite contains iron(III) oxide and impurities, such as sand and clay (limestone).<br>
                      <br>
                      To extract the iron, we add the haematite, limestone and coke (carbon) from the top of the blast furnace. <br>
                      <br>
                      Next, we blow hot air into the furnace near the bottom.<br>
                      <br>
                      The oxygen in the hot air reacts with coke (carbon) to form carbon dioxide.<br>
                      <br>
                      The carbon dioxide in the hot air, as well as the carbon dioxide formed, reacts with more coke (carbon) to form carbon monoxide.<br>
                      <br>
                      This carbon monoxide reacts with iron(III) oxide to form iron and carbon dioxide.<br>
                      <br>
                      The carbon dioxide formed (and not used at all) escapes through the top of the furnace, along with carbon monoxide (either did not react or not used at all) and nitrogen, as waste gases.<br>
                      <br>
                      The iron is formed in molten state and it runs to the bottom of the furnace.<br>
                      <br>
                      As mentioned earlier, the haematite contains impurities such as sand and clay (limestone). When iron is formed in molten state, it is mixed with the impurities.<br>
                      <br>
                      The heat decomposes the limestone (calcium carbonate) into quicklime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide.<br>
                      <br>
                      This quicklime (calcium oxide) then reacts with acidic impurities such as silicon(IV) oxide (sand) to form a liquid called slag.<br>
                      <br>
                      This slag floats on top of the molten iron and they run off separately at the bottom of the furnace. Slag can be sold for use as a constituent of cement.<br>
                      <br>
                      With that, we obtain the molten iron.<br>

              Air is a mixture of several gases.<br>
              <br>
              The percentage composition (by volume) of clean air is as follows,<br>
              <br>
              Nitrogen: 79%<br>
              Oxygen: 20%<br>
              Carbon Dioxide: 0.03%<br>
              Water vapour: 0-5%<br>
              Noble gases: Argon: 0.9%<br>
              Noble gases: Neon and Helium: 0.002%<br>

              Oxides of Nitrogen (nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide) are formed from the following sources, when the temperature is very high:<br>
              - lightning activity during thunderstorms<br>

              <p>Yup, I'm a tutor and I raised this question to check the consensus; its one of those that could be argued either way. </p>
              <p>Appreciated Jurongresident's detailed reply, apologies if he spent the extra time to do it thinking I'm a student. </p>
              <p>For what it's worth, the publishers (cambridge?) suggested answer is only carbon dioxide and oxygen, but I thought a student shouldn't be faulted to include nitrogen also.  </p>

              TYS publishers are not certainly not Cambridge. TYS publishers pay MOE for the right to publish the questions (the answers are by the various authors hired by the publishers), as the copyrights are co-owned by Cambridge and MOE. The official Cambridge mark schemes are (by law, due to a legal agreement between MOE and Cambridge) confidential and cannot be revealed to the public. It is fairly common (especially for A levels, when it becomes even more complicated) for all the different TYS publications available on the market to all give different answers for an ambiguous, challenging or problematic, open-ended Singapore A level exam question (every year there's a couple of such qns). This happens even for MCQs, but naturally to a lesser extent.

              <p>From what I heard, if I heard correctly, the people who create the "answer key" for TYS open-ended questions are JC students or University students, who are hired by the publisher to write the answer for them. </p>

              <p>TYS answer keys are not written by JC students. They are qualified educators usually I guess.</p>
              <p>I was approached by one publisher for the O Level Physics before, but I was hesitant because of the numerous conceptual errors that the TYS answers contain for previous years and do not really want my name to be on the answer key. Fortunately they managed to find another person to author the answers.</p>
              <p>Different TYS will have different mistakes. The main problem is that students may not be able to understand that the answers are conceptually wrong because they may regard TYS answers as the holy grail.</p>
