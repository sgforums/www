              <p>Hey guys/gals.<br><br>I've been very worried about SBQ section of the papers</p>
              <p>Would it be alright if anyone is willing to draft out the standard structure of the answer?</p>
              <p>Eg, Source A and B is difference is saying (issue). In source A, (quote). this tells us that the source is implying that (explain). however in source B, (quote), tellling us that (explain)..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really need help for these standard questions, eg message, purpose, usefulness,reliability.</p>

              <p>Help please! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>

              <p>i shall teach la... at the same time revise...<br> <br> for SBQ!!!  SBQ NOT SEQ...<br> <br> i always categorize them to 3 type... comparison, prooving,
              usefulness..<br> <br> those who are hardworking should know what i am talking
              about....<br> <br> comparison: example of question : how different are Source A
              compared to Source B.. (something like that la)<br> <br> things to do for comparison :  </p>
              <p>- read and understand the source</p>
              <p>- underline the main points of the source, (example, to
              encourage? to blame? to persuade?<br> <br> - REMEMBER TO UNDERLINE THE EVIDENCE (this is to bring ur essay to
              a high lvl, congratz u lvl up!)<br> <br> - when writing, i suggest, or rather i always paragraph each point
              in one paragraph, for example ( compare tone with tone, i.e. Source
              A has a aggressive tone, condemning... as i can see from the words
              used "fuck" and "damn" , while Source B has a very persuasive tone,
              who and who hoping that... as the words used "i hope you would
              consider" and "it would be good if.." suggests.)   then u
              go to another paragraph, talk about other thing other than tone,
              like for example purpose, to persuade? to encourge?<br> <br> - as u can see from the above point, i always give evidence to back
              up my stand, like i say Source A is aggressive, evidence being
              words used like ...<br> <br> - it will be good if u can further explain each point, why he is
              aggressive?( condemn who and who? kena bombed?) but keep it short,
              if not u got no time.. for me SS always very hard to end nice
              one..<br> <br> - please note that provenance is counted as "LOW level" , it would
              be good to add it as a so called extra paragraph, a short one will
              do..<br> <br> Some questions also ask about <span style="color: #ff0000;">WHAT</span> are the difference between
              ....?<br>  some question ask about      
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">HOW</span> different...?<br> <br> for me, WHAT are the difference...,  u only give the
              difference, NO similarity<br> for the HOW different, give 2 difference and 1 similarity, if u
              have time give 1 more different even better.. but dun think so, dun
              risk it...<br> <br> but if they ask how SIMILAR... u give 2 similarity, 1
              difference...<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><br> NOTE: PLEASE NOTE I AM NOT A TEACHER, ONLY A STUDENT TAKING O LEVEL
              THIS YEAR, I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A FULL MARKS FOR SBQ AND I AM ONLY
              REVISING, BUT I DARE SAY I AM CONFIDENT IN MY SBQ, (ABOVE 18 MARKS
              OVER 25 MARKS.) THEREFORE WHAT I WRITE MIGHT BE
              WRONG!!</span><br> <br> Note note: i also am long winded, but thats cuz i am revising too,
              thats why need to be a bit precise.. haha!</p>

              <p>ok now for the 2nd part, the USEFULNESS<br><br>example question for usefulness... How useful is this source in telling you...?<br>How far does this source help u to understand....?   how comprehensive is this source in....?<br><br>- always keep in mind what the source is asking, they source could be asking how useful is this source in telling u how successful is Singapore... but the Source can talk about WHY singapore is successful, and not HOW...  what i am trying to say is, pls find the RELEVANT information from the source, and sometimes it can be very tricky...<br><br>- then u divide to 2 parts, one being the useful part, one NOT useful...   for example:<br>Useful, this source is useful in telling me the perception of ...<br> this source tells me about how singapore is built which makes it successful, evidence...<br><br>NOT useful : from what i had learnt, this source did not tell me whether the ... has helped in singapore growth, <br><br>also from source L also stated how singapore became successful, but the Source B did not tell.. <br></p>
              <p>- u can also say that the source is NOT RELIABLE, THUS not useful in telling me the truth... since i cannot trust...<br> ( this links to reliability)<br><br>- basically, it is about the limititation the source has, what the source have, what it dont have... give evidence, can be from other source (cross-reference) or from ur contextual knowledge<br><br>Note: to be honest, i am quite weak in this category, i always run a bit out of point to the reliability, so rmb to control urself, always link back to the usefulness.. it is mostly on how u phrase the question...<br><br>Note note: once again, let me repeat that i might have WRONG THINGS... i am just posting, for fun and for revising,  and i am NOT a teacher..</p>
