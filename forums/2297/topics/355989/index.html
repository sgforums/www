              <p>I find the following very interesting... for all those who has already graduated from JCs...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By Shawn Woo</strong></p>
              <p>THIS year marks the first time that junior colleges have just one
              intake for Year 1 students - something I find both a tragedy and
              travesty.</p>
              <p>I believe the period between the first and second intakes,
              affectionately known as 'the first three months', is something that
              needs to be experienced to be appreciated.</p>
              <p>
              
              School
              means more to students during those first three months than just
              lecture notes, homework and mid-year exams. Without it, we lose a
              massive social experiment, where teenagers get together and - horror of
              horrors - act their age.</p>
              <p>The spontaneity needed to get people mass dancing to awkwardly
              choreographed Britney Spears' songs, for one, stems from a time of
              innocence and naivete found only in the first three months.</p>
              <p>Yes, it doubtlessly caused massive headaches for administrators. But
              the time was enriching for other reasons, as several aspects of JC
              culture emerged:</p>
              <p><strong>Uniform swopping</strong></p>
              <p>Without knowing for sure where they would be, students wore their
              secondary school uniforms in junior college during that time, which
              they commonly exchanged with one another.</p>
              <p><strong>Lecture hopping</strong></p>
              <p>Before having to settle on one subject combination, students sampled
              a variety of subjects by crashing lectures they had no business
              attending - yes, even if that meant skipping other classes.</p>
              <p><strong>Orientation</strong></p>
              <p>Everyone knows that the first week of JC is orientation week, a time
              of OGs (Orientation Groups), mass dances, campfires and Angel-Mortal
              games - making it ripe for indulging in orientation hopping too, across
              JCs islandwide.</p>
              <p><strong>Enjoyable classes</strong></p>
              <p>Teachers, too, get inspired. The first three months inspire some of
              the most creative lessons. With students half switched-off and
              inattentive, what better time to experiment with the curriculum? I
              recall one literature class at which we were even tasked to critique
              songs by The Beatles and Rolling Stones. You don't have to be dull to
              be educational.</p>
              <p><strong>Boy meets girl</strong></p>
              <p>Inevitably, romance blossoms. With grades far from our minds, there
              is a sudden spike in boy-girl activity. Those from single-sex secondary
              schools turn this season into a time of discovery - complete with
              cringe-worthy faux pas, awkward silence and all-round discomfort. Call
              them life lessons.</p>
              <p>These features of JC1 have now evaporated. Sure, orientation will
              probably be just as fun, and firm friendships will still be forged. And
              yes, most importantly, students will experience a smoother transition
              from secondary school.</p>
              <p>But I still feel a sense of loss.</p>
              <p>No first three months, no 'honeymoon period'. All too soon, the very Singaporean mentality of 'mugging' will set in.</p>
              <p>This little quirk in the Singapore education system will be sorely
              missed - if not from an educational standpoint, then from a
              socio-cultural one.</p>
              <p>For what it's worth, I had a blast.</p>

              Singapore with a degree in political science last year. He is now a
              management associate at a local bank. He spent his first three months
              of JC at National Junior College.</strong></p>
