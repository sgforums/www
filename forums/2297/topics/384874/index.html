              <p>Hi! I'm currently doing engineering in NTU year 1 and after my 1st semester, I realised that I really can't stand the Sciences in general, especially Physics. No matter how hard I study for it, do the tutorials and revise, I still can't grasp the concepts. It is a "you think you get it" kind of feeling but when I do the questions, I realised that I still can't get it. I don't know why is that so. Is it because I'm inept? Or my study methods are wrong? I do all my tutorials, past year questions but I still can't do most of the questions in my exams. They really twist and turn the questions this time and the questions are totally different from the past year exams.</p>
              <p>After my exams which I think I screwed up pretty badly, I was actually thinking of changing course to Mathematical Sciences in NTU. I've always had a passion for Math but when I applied for it last time, I couldn't get in because of the competition and my bad science grades. So I was hoping to get in this time. But my friend who is in that course told me that to score an A in a module there is really hard as the cohort is small and you are competing with the scholars and really good students. Unlike the engineering cohort which is large. So you have to be really good in what you do or else I will get mediocre grades. And my friend is also thinking of switching course as he wonders what can one do with just a Math degree?</p>
              <p>So my question those who have a background in Mathematics, should I really change course? Are the courses in there really tough? And what prospects when one graduates with a Math degree? Attached below is the curriculum for Math Sci in NTU. Maybe someone can tell me how the modules in there are like? Tough? Interesting?</p>

              <p>I'm not replying you on whether you should switch course to read Mathematics instead of Physics, I'm only making some comments :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>" but when I do the questions, I realised that I still can't get it. I don't know why is that so. Is it because I'm inept? Or my study methods are wrong? I do all my tutorials, past year questions but I still can't do most of the questions in my exams. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No it's not because you're inept or incompetent or uninteresting as a person. It's because you're inept or incompetent or uninterested in physics. It's two completely unrelated issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Put it another way : if you're theistic, think of it as we're all created as unique individuals with unique skills, interests and strengths. If you're atheistic, think of it as our unique DNA determines us as unique individuals with unique skills, interests and strengths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two equally (and highly) intelligent persons. One could be a physicist/pianist/meat-lover/religious/IT-expert, and the other could be a biologist/guitarist/vegetarian/atheist/martial-arts-expert. And each might well be a complete idiot/inept/incompetent/uninterested in the other person's field or expertise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Doesn't make one right and the other wrong. Or one better than the other. Just makes them unique from each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you honestly find yourself struggling with Physics and don't enjoy it anymore, go ahead and read something else (that you find more interesting, whether Mathematics or something else) in the University and base your future career on something else. Life is too short to be miserable or wasted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Regarding the theistic vs athesitic scenario, I made mention of it coz I was just reading a guestbook conversation on a Dr House blogsite, between an atheist and a religious. For those interested, I've reproduced the conversation in the Crapbox thread stickied.)</p>

              <p>I can't say for Mas, but for those of us who take Maths in NIE, we do have some common modules such as Calculus and Linear Algebra, and we are even using the same prescribed text. Simply putting, Maths in NIE is a subset of Maths in Mas.</p>
              <p>I can tell you a lot of people here are regretting majoring/minoring in Maths, as they are doing badly for it. Uni level maths is many steps up of that of JC level - There is a lot of theorems to prove, application of rules and theorems, and lesser pure mathematical calculation as compared to before. </p>
              <p>Mas Maths is definitely much tougher than NIE Maths, so you may want to reconsider your options before jumping over in a haste.</p>

              <p>As a SPMS students with friends as Maths Majors, i can say that the senior years are not as easy as what the year 1 foundation courses are like since yr 1 work is alot of revision of A maths and H2 maths etc. I got friends who are minoring in maths and already dying when they just need to do 2 yr 2 maths modules.</p>
              <p>There is no course that is exactly easy to study or get As. Every degree course has their easy and hard modules so 1 sem is a bad gauge especially if your friend is a 1st yr like you since the foundation maths modules are doable even for me who did not really touch much maths after O's.</p>
              <p>Regarding the exams, there was alot of feedback that NTU wide this sem has been a killer sem for many courses with a suddenly surge in killer papers, i myself having been killed by at least 2 so having papers that differs significantly from past years seems a norm this sem.</p>
              <p>How u feel is how i felt when i was doing my physical chemistry modules (UltimaOnline should know, i always complain about them :p) but if most people also can't grasp it well, you should not be too bad. Its more major when everyone around you tells you the content is easy and you are the only 1 who can't understand it.</p>
              <p>In terms of jobs prospect, engineering grads definitely have a wider range of job compared to maths majors who end up more in banks, MOE or like 1 of my friend, just doing an admin job after graduating last year.</p>
              <p>Before you really consider changing courses, you might like to drop by career office and counselling center and talk to the people there regarding the job prospects and the counsellors about your problems to see whether they can offer you some help or advice.</p>

              <p>Thanks to Forbiddensinner, dkcx and UltimaOnline for the advice. You guys have always helped me out no matter what the case and I really gotta thank you guys. =)</p>
              <p>Ever since the exams ended, I've been really demoralised as my 1st exams in Uni didn't go as well as I hoped. But that is over. Right now, I should focus on my future career path that I should take. It is true that engineering has more prospects but I don't know if I can survive the 4 years. The problem with me is that I've always sucked at science and I don't know why even till now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> I like Math and I think I'm good at it, but not excellent like those foreign talents &amp; scholars. So the worrying factor for me is the competition if I really do switch to SPMS. I guess I had better think even more about it before I make any decision to change course. If you guys have any more advice or personal experiences to share with me, feel free to post them here. They would be much appreciated. Thanks again! =)</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi! I'm currently doing engineering in NTU year 1 and after
              my 1st semester, I realised that I really can't stand the Sciences
              in general, especially Physics. No matter how hard I study for it,
              do the tutorials and revise, I still can't grasp the concepts. It
              is a "you think you get it" kind of feeling but when I do the
              questions, I realised that I still can't get it. I don't know why
              is that so. Is it because I'm inept? Or my study methods are wrong?
              I do all my tutorials, past year questions but I still can't
              do most of the questions in my exams. They really twist
              and turn the questions this time and the questions are totally
              different from the past year exams.</p>
              <p>After my exams which I think I screwed up pretty badly, I was
              actually thinking of changing course to Mathematical Sciences in
              NTU. I've always had a passion for Math but when I applied for it
              last time, I couldn't get in because of the competition and my bad
              science grades. So I was hoping to get in this time. But my friend
              who is in that course told me that to score an A in a module
              there is really hard as the cohort is small and you are competing
              with the scholars and really good students. Unlike the engineering
              cohort which is large. So you have to be really good in what you do
              or else I will get mediocre grades. And my friend is also thinking
              of switching course as he wonders what can one do with just a Math
              degree?</p>
              <p>So my question those who have a background in Mathematics,
              should I really change course? Are the courses in there really
              tough? And what prospects when one graduates with a Math degree?
              Attached below is the curriculum for Math Sci in NTU. Maybe someone
              can tell me how the modules in there are like? Tough?
              Interesting?</p>

              <p>Hi -Wanderer-,</p>
              <p>Only you can decide for yourself whether to change course or not. Weigh the pros and the cons of changing course before you make any decisions, and ask yourself whether you place passion above prospects, difficulty over passion...etc.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
