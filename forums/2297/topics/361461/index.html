              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>           I join this forum in hope of getting some valuable advice from whoever that reads this post. It may drag a little, so please bear with me.</p>
              <p>           A little background:</p>
              <p>           I studied in SP, graduated with a diploma in DECC. Electronics computer communications. My batch didn't have any GPA system in place yet. But as a benchmark, i was able to get into NTU EEE and NUS electrical. My O level L1R5 was 17. Now i'm studying in a UK university (southampton) doing electronics engineering. I am one of those direct entry students. My dad is a engineer as well. And a very good one. His thinking is 'get a degree and go to work.' Even in choosing my poly course, he had a great influence in it.</p>
              <p>          Now my dilemna is:</p>
              <p>          When i applied for the university through UCAS, i did visit the education fair in SP. I applied for a physchology course in a new zealand uni. I got into that but as it was a 4 years degree, my dad objected to it. My interest lies there i guess.</p>
              <p>          Over here, my results for my 1st semester was 38.5 for 5 modules. I failed 2 modules and got all border line results for the rest. As most of the guys would have known, 2 years in the army can really make you forget lots of stuff. Nevertheless, i tried hard as it was my first exam in 2 years. I was pretty shocked at my results to say the least. I didn't know why i couldn't memorize things or have the same passion for engineering in the past. I know my passion for engineering actually kinda started to fade during my final year in poly but i pressed on because it was the final year. I thought i could do that again - 'press on'.</p>
              <p>         I am really struggling over here. I attend lectures and i have the feeling why am i over here. The projects over here are mind boggling and i spend so much time on them that i do not even have time to revise. And i will feel just so drained on weekends.</p>
              <p>       Right. I spend so much time writing all of the above so as to let you know the situation i am in. Now, i need your help if you are still reading this so far:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>      I am thinking of switching my course. And study in singapore. I don't want to waste my parents or rather my dad money anymore. I am thinking of</p>
              <p>     PSB - UOL economics and management (hons)</p>
              <p>     SIM-GE - Economics (hons)</p>
              <p>     What do you guys think about me switching to economics? Do you think it will suit me? I went to the '1st 3 months' in pjc before and i took econs during that period. I am pretty interested in it. I know it is a short period of time to decide this 180 degree change but i don't think i can really carry on studying engineering.</p>
              <p>      I would like to know if any of the forumers over here have the same experience before? I know there is a teacher over here, i would like to hear your advice as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Thank you.</p>

              <p>This seems more like AA than homework but nevertheless...</p>
              <p>You mentioned your earlier interest is in psychology so why the decision now to do econs instead?</p>
              <p>Personally i feel interest is important and since its just the start of your course and you are already doing badly, i would suggest you just switch to something which you can study and have more interest in. If you can't even score in the 1st year, subsequent yrs would be alot harder as the content gets more and more difficult. If you can't cope and end up being terminated (touchwood) from uni, that would have wasted a large sum of money and time.</p>

              <p>Actually, there are two. Myself and Moderator Wee Wen Shih (who's doing his reservist right now, so he may not be able to advise you in this thread).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As my personal specialty is only in Chemistry and Biology, I have little in way of direct comment regarding any of the other disciplines you mentioned, only to add a universal truth which you already know -for education at the University level (moreso than at any earlier levels) and the corresponding lifelong career path it ties you into, personal interest and genuine passion is a NECESSITY, not a luxury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the sake of your future, and indirectly your Dad's as well (ie. family financial health), you MUST switch to a course and career, which resonates deep within you as your calling in life. ONLY when you do what you love, and love what you do, will you have opportunitites to succeed and excel, including financially.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no comment on Economics (either at PSB or SIM), as I have no interest in that area. But I DO KNOW that you don't have a choice - you can't remain (out of fear) in your current course and die a slow and painful death. It doesn't make sense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to open your mind to a wide range of different career possibilities (including ones you may not have given yourself the chance of consideration before). See which calls out to you, which feels right and fulfilling (even exciting!) for you. Then base your further studies on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is your life, this is your fight. Do what you need to do.</p>

              <p>Firstly, how do u know u really like psychology? Do you have any experience to understand it enough to like it? Psychology is not like those u see in the movies where the bugger can psychoanalyse the criminals and correctly guess their future behaviours.</p>

              <p>We wun know if it suits you. Only you urself know. Did u pick econs using elimination of others courses? Such that econs is the only "least dislike" among the others? Seems to me you are unsure. Perhaps 2 years into the course, u may post the same thing, only this time wanting to switch to another course.</p>
              <p>I vaguely feel ur situation, being a poly engineering grad to ntu engineering grad, to nothing regarding engineering in working life.</p>
              <p>Anyway, some things to consider on picking another course. What u like about it. What can u work as after ur course. I urge u to really think it thru. It took u 2 years to realise u dun wanna be an engineer. How can u judge that u like econs based on 3 mths in JC?</p>

              <p>Thank you all for your quick responses.</p>
              <p>airgrinder. What you've said really hit me.</p>
              <p>I actually felt the interest for engineering fading in my poly years but i sort of 'undermine' my dislike for it. In fact, i've actually spoken to my parents, or sorta hinted to them that i am finding engineering boring. His response was 'just get a degree and work., ' not all people find a high relevance of their scope of work to their degree', 'you think all people got what they really want in life?' So bottom line, he wanted me to 'grind and bear'. And i did just that.</p>
              <p>I've borrowed psychology books to read during my poly days and thus i have a vague idea about it. I decided not to pursue it as i'm not sure if the job prospects are good or if i can imagine myself doing that for the rest of my life.</p>
              <p>Yes all of you are right as to how do i know if econs is really my cup of tea or if 'i will post again in another 2 years lamenting my wrong decision'. This i can't guarantee as well but what i can guarantee is i am really at my wits end about my course now. I'm really tired and am just literally forcing myself to study.</p>
              <p>I chose Econs because of it has a wider area of employability, ensures longer 'shelf life', and according to my grades in O levels and the information i've gathered from friends and the net. <a href="http://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/social-science/economics-major.htm">http://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/social-science/economics-major.htm</a></p>
              <p>I apologise if i've posted in the wrong forum but really appreciate the kind advice all of you have given me so far. I will be back around late june and i will try to straighten things up asap. Any help and advice greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>Hi. I was from NUS EE :D<br>Let me share with you my views and hopefully be able to motivate you and guide you in making a decision you won't regret.</p>
              <p>Army wise, I taught tuition so as not to forget my stuff, so I had an upperhand in the first years of uni :D <br>But then.... to do that is too late.... We have to focus on the present...</p>
              <p>Basically, I would say that one studies engineering in the uni for the training of their analytical and creative mind. It's tough, it's hard, but that's what make graduate engineers special. Also, you have to work smart and not just work hard. Sounds cliche, but you have to find out and discover study methods right now that work wonders for you. Scoring bad for the first sem doesn't kill you; it just means you have to work twice as hard as others to pull up your grades.</p>
              <p>What I would think is that because you scored bad, you are now trying to find reasons like you have lost your passion, etc, etc, etc, in hindsight. I might be wrong, but finding reasons or excuses isn't the way to go. Instead of saying you scored bad because you lost passion, look back, and answer to yourself, have you tried your very best and work hard enough not to regret? What have you done during the semester? Did you wake at 7am and sleep at 12 midnight at night, with the time in between spent mostly in lectures and in revision and understanding the chapters? I did that. Many of my friends who did well did that. You have to make certain sacrifices if you want better scores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding switching to economics, have you ever thought that you could also possibly score just as bad (*touch wood*)? Then how? Would you then consider quitting and finding another field again? 3 months of econs in PJC doesn't give you enough idea on what is about. To me, econs is interesting; I have took in for 2 years in JC and one module in uni. Your essay skills have to be extremely good, you have to do much much more research than engineering, including current case studies, etc, etc. You will have to form opinions. It is afterall a soft science then a hard science like engineering.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you decide to switch in the end, you could try SMU for their econs business double degree, and apply for their scholarship to do so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever you do, guide your actions with my maxim: "Don't do anything which would make you look back and regret in the future".</p>

              <p>Wee_ws, i want to do that. I really want to.</p>
              <p>And eagle, am glad i'm able to find someone in the same field as i am. Yes, i agree that engineering do require an 'analytical and creative mind'. I would not like to think that i am actually 'finding reasons and excuses'. Because like i've said, i have started to not like what i'm doing in SP already. I have been trying to read up books on physchology and talking to mentors who are doing other fields.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, i think i just lack the courage to make this change because i'm afraid of failing. My dad was the main influence in every thing that i've done since poly already. I do not bear any grudges or blame him for what i am today, but rather for my lack of courage.</p>
              <p> Thus, I am all ears to every piece of advice that everyone over here gives.</p>
              <p>And yes eagle, i do not wake up religiously at 7am and go to bed at 12 midnight everyday but i do attend lectures and do the ridiculously tough labs every week. During the christmas and easter break, i just feel so drained that i can stay in my hostel room for days.</p>
              <p>I know what this might seem to other people when i quit - a quitter.</p>
              <p>But then again, if i really do change my course, i want to excel because i hate this feeling. The feeling of being lousy in everything that i am doing now.</p>
              <p>Thank you all still for the advice. Appreciate it.</p>

              <p>TS, it really depends on yourself. If you are getting crap results, then you have two options: Buck up or Get off.</p>
              <p>Since you have more or less made up your mind about course-hopping, then just go ahead and do so.</p>
              <p>But on the otherhand, if you think it is so easy for you to do well in psychology or econs, both which you have only minimal experience with, then you are being very foolish indeed.</p>
              <p>Do not take up courses only for the reason that they are known to have a high employment rate for graduates, because plentiful of 'coconuts' mixed with geniuses will be thinking the same thing as you.</p>
              <p>Looking at your situation, I dare say whatever route you choose, you will regret it later. Now this is ironically, human psychology.</p>
              <p>If you take up either econ or psychology, later you will regret not taking the other one as you are not doing well enough. If you remain in engineering, you will regret not taking either of the two other courses.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is still your own choice. Go ahead, make it, and regret it.</p>

              <p>Hi :)</p>
              <p>I'm not in the same field as you, but would like to share a little experience of mine that is somewhat related. Back when I was enrolling for JC, I was in two minds over which stream to choose - science was the practical one, yet arts was where my passion lies. I opted for the science stream in the end, because it seemed to be the 'better' choice.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, my grades were anything but pretty. And at the end of my first year, I abruptly decided to redo everything. So I switched to the arts stream, chose a whole set of different subjects, and started from year one again. My results thereafter were considerably better, and eventually got me into university, and into my desired course. On hindsight, I'm glad I made that decision then, for realising what I really wanted, and discovering the area that I could excel in. :)</p>
              <p>I hope you'll bring about the change you want, and <em>need</em>. God helps those who help themselves.</p>
              <p>All the best!</p>

              <p>Psychology is a very memory intensive type of course where you have ALOT of reading and memorising to do as well as being able to analyse and use the information you learnt to apply to different situations.</p>
              <p>As a psychology minor student in NTU, i would say i enjoy what i learn in psychology more than my actual major and i have considered doing a 2nd degree later on in psychology.</p>
              <p>If you are really looking towards high pay jobs, engineering beats many other courses really and psychology is never going to be a very high paying job industry. I am unsure about econs though and its job prospects but for me i'll go do psychology for interest and not pay.</p>

              <p>If you really plan to do econs, i don't think there is really much basics to start from since there are people who never done econs in JC/poly and still managed to do it at degree level so just give it a try if thats what you really feel you want but do try to do some 'homework' and research on its contents etc before you really decide whether its where your interest lies.</p>

              <p>Thanks lee012lee. I hear you. I know i am making a very risky decision thus i am trying to gather as much information as possible over here. I will be back soon, during late june. During which i will read up on econs and talk to friends who are doing it if there are any. And I will have a quick look at their past year exam papers and look at the 'model answers' if there are any.</p>
              <p>By doing so, i know what are the expectations of me when i do decide to switch over this course. I know there are boring and dry modules for every disclpine. I was able to produce average results because i forced myself to? I thought to myself 'one more year to army then to other courses already' THAT was my motivation. Yet again, i was too afraid to move to other courses and just decided to go with my dad's decision in the end.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i've decided. If my results for 08/09 turns out to be less than 55 overall(which is less than a 2-2 second lower), i will give up my place overseas. The results should be released around july.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              to go with my dad's decision in the end.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i've decided. If my results for 08/09 turns out to be
              less than 55 overall(which is less than a 2-2 second lower), i will
              give up my place overseas. The results should be released around
              july.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>Have you talked to your parents about this and got their opinion as well? Don't plan everything and in the end your parents are not agreeable and leads to more problems later on.</p>

              <p>From what TS has said thus far, I believe his father will DEFINITELY object to him jumping over to some other courses.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, this is yet another major point. If TS has the earning ability to support himself and study at the same time, then course-hopping will not be that hugh of a problem. Otherwise, it will be better off for him to stay in engineering, as his father probably will neither support him morally nor financially for taking up another course instead.</p>

              <p>That might be true but if you never tried you never know. Most parents still cares about their children and will still consider their opinions especially since TS is no longer a young boy and should be old enough to know what he wants now.</p>

              <p>I guess my dad's not that hard to understand after all.</p>
              <p>I used to skype with my parents once a week when i first came here, ever since i got my first semester results, which is like around march, i have not been skyping with them already. Only occasional calls. I will always put it off saying i am busy,tired,blah blah. So the answer as to whether i have discuss with my parents yet is a no.</p>
              <p>What i'm trying to go when i get back is to gather as much info, talk to as much people possible and then STAND FIRM on my decision already. I must do it already.</p>
              <p>Forbidden sinner i have thought about doing part-time studies before, because i do not want to waste my parents money anymore - worst come to worst. But considering i am doing a 180 degree course switch, i reckon i would need more time to 'level up' and i really want to do well in it. Part time will cause some distractions i'm afraid. But, yes that is not an option that I will cancel out if things do turn out ultimately that way.</p>
