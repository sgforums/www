              <p class="MsoNormal">Some disputes:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q4 – It is unclear if the ‘volume of oxygen released’ refers
                              to the total volume of oxygen collected at the designated time interval (e.g.
                              between 1s and 2s) or else, simply the volume of oxygen collected (from 1s to
                              2s). So, the answer can be either (B) or (D).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q5 – The answer could also be (D). Adenoviruses can be used
                              as a vehicle to deliver a functional TP53 gene to the tumour cells, rendering
                              them susceptible to p53-mediated apoptosis (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11498763">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11498763</a> for details). It would be incorrect to suggest that the mutant virus can only
                              replicate inside tumour cells [option (A)], since the adenovirus can replicate
                              in <strong><em>both</em></strong> the wildtype and mutant cells (N.B.: Entry of the adenovirus into the cell does
                              <strong><em>not</em></strong> cause cell damage, since the adenovirus is endocytosed into the cell, hence
                              this should not stimulate the wildtype cell to express p53 thereby triggering
                              apoptosis).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q6. Crossing over can occur between non-sister chromatids in
                              a homologous pair of chromosomes (which is widely known) as well as between
                              non-homologous chromosomes [a lesser known process known as <strong><em>ectopic
                              recombination</em></strong> (see <a href="http://www.genetics.org/content/129/4/1085">http://www.genetics.org/content/129/4/1085</a> for one such study investigating this phenomenon in<em> D. melanogaster</em>)]. Transposons may participate in the latter
                              process as well, as they ‘jump’ (‘cross’) from one chromosome to another. The correct options should thus be options 1, 2, 3 and 5. However, since there is no such option in this context, either option (A) or option (B) would be valid in this context.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q11. The correct answer should be (B).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q23. The answer could also be (C). This is because even if
                              the heterozygote is only able to produce half of the enzyme concentration as
                              the homozygous dominant individual, enzymes are generally very efficient catalysts
                              (with a very high turnover rate), hence they are able to generate a substantial
                              amount of product even at low enzyme concentrations. (N.B. Inactive/non-functional
                              enzymes are generally either subjected to the cell’s refolding mechanisms, or
                              else broken down to prevent their accumulation in the cell). This allows the
                              heterozygote to manifest a phenotype which is virtually indiscernible from the
                              homozygous dominant individual, hence contributing to the difficulty to
                              establish a causative relationship/link between the genotype and phenotype of
                              the individual based on the observed parental and offspring phenotypes (as noted in the
                              question), thereby satisfying the requirements in this context.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q27. The answer should be (B). This is because despite
                              numerous textbooks which claim that 2 ATP molecules are directly produced per
                              molecule of glucose oxidised in the Kreb’s cycle (or else, 1 ATP molecule is
                              produced per turn of the Kreb’s cycle), this is actually an anomaly, since the
                              Kreb’s cycle generates a GTP molecule per turn of the cycle (during the
                              conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate) (see Molecular Cell Biology, 6<sup>th</sup> edition, p. 489 by Lodish <em>et al</em> for
                              details). Ironically, Molecular Cell Biology, 6<sup>th</sup> edition includes
                              the same anomaly of equating GTP to ATP in this instance. In fact, GTP is a
                              very different molecule from ATP, as may be clearly noted by its (GTP, <strong><em>not
                              ATP</em></strong>) involvement in GPCR activation (for signal transduction),
                              microtubule polymerization, etc. Likewise, ATP is utilised in enzymes such as
                              adenylate cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, while GTP cannot be utilised in this
                              case by the same enzyme (i.e. adenylate cyclase), but rather by a different enzyme (guanylate cyclase). Hence, it is vital to note
                              the distinction between ATP and GTP (and not to equate the two, although numerous correlations may be drawn between both molecules as described above). Thus, the correct answer to this question
                              should be (B).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q33. This question is relatively unclear, as there are
                              several factors which affect variation of DNA and proteins (besides its
                              sequence). For instance, in eukaryotes, variation in proteins is also due to
                              alternative splicing, differences in folding, etc. Likewise DNA has a three
                              dimensional structure as well, though this may only be eminent in the
                              regulation of transcription. Hence, (D) is also a probable answer in this
                              context.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Q37. The correct answer is (C). Heterozygous RFLP loci allow
                              us to distinguish between the individual arms of a homologous chromosome pair,
                              thus allowing for effective mapping of genes between 2 unique heterozygous
                              restriction sites (thereby causing the formation of different fragment sizes
                              for mutant and wildtype organisms). This is known as <em>chromosome</em> <em>mapping</em>. RFLPs
                              cannot however be used to determine the base sequence of the genome (as there
                              are insufficient palindromic sequences to do this) – for sequencing, we’d need
                              to use Sanger dideoxy, pyrophosphate or 4<sup>th</sup> gen sequencing
                              methodologies (which are well beyond the scope of the H2 A-Level syllabus).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Of course UCLES would likely have different perceptions with regards to the answers provided here (in which instance, I’d like to see their variations).</p>
