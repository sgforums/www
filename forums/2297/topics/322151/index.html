              <p>These days I am kinda busy - you know, the 'O' levels are close. I think
                  everybody felt at least once that there are too many things to do (especially true for Art and DnT students due to coursework) and
                  the time just isn’t enough, so one post about time management and good
                  practices when studying should be useful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>

              <p><strong>Create a good environment</strong>!</p>
              <p>If you can go to library
                  and stay there it is very good - there you have the motivation and the
                  atmosphere that helps you concentrate better. Of course, there are
                  cases when you can’t use that space - for example if you have something
                  to talk you can’t do it there.</p>
              <p>Your room can be a good solution too,
                  but here you have more temptations - the TV,
                  the internet, the flowers you haven’t watered recently … If you can you
                  can escape these temptations and you have all the materials you need
                  you’ll gain some time by staying at home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Take your own notes</strong>!</p>
              <p>When you finish reading a
                  paragraph try to sum it up in 2-3 phrases. That should help you to keep
                  in mind what you have learned and it’s useful when you revise your
                  notes. When you’re doing that you also verify if you really understood
                  what you read or you only have the impression of understanding it. Of
                  course you can return and make additional notes. That and the practical
                  applications are the active part of studying.</p>
              <p>It isn’t enough to
                  recognize the truth, it’s necessary to practice it. This would work with my previous tip on re-writing notes to improve memory. So instead of just re-writing blindly, try to make the notes shorter everytime. This would help you to remember the facts yet only need a few lines of "anchor" sentences to bring back all your prior memory to the subject</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Study groups</strong> <strong>are a very good idea!</strong></p>
              <p>3 or 4 people is
                  ideal. This idea has pluses and minuses - you can ask other people to
                  explain what you don’t understand and you can fix your knowledge by
                  answering other’s questions, but there is a dark side too. When you’re
                  working with somebody else you tend to talk about anything except
                  subject at hand. Choose carefully your study mates and impose some rules
                  - discuss only when you have too, give answers as short as possible and
                  don’t take breaks until you finish the chapter. That should work - and
                  if it doesn’t, it’s better to give up the study groups.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Combine theoretical knowledge with practice!</strong></p>
              <p>One of
                  the biggest mistakes people make is that they forget to implement and apply their
                  knowledge accordingly. Exercises are more important than theory so I suggest to
                  spend at least 60% of your time doing exercises. Another thing very
                  very important is the “doing” part. If you understand the method to
                  solve a problem it doesn’t necessarily mean that you can actually solve
                  the exercise. If you have more time try to find the solution yourself,
                  then you can compare it with what you have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, there are situations when you don’t have too many exercises
                  to do; geography doesn’t have as many practical applications as
                  physics. You can still <strong>train yourself by thinking of questions</strong> and trying to answer. Creating questions that cover all the information
                  you have to know is important too. Most new 'O' level guide books include a "recap" section at the back of the chapter. You can write it down in a small card and try to answer them. When you can give the correct answer easily you’re ready to pass the exam; you can concentrate
                  on other subjects from now on.</p>

              <p>In response to your question, although it is good to set priority for your studies, DO NOT jeopardize other things. E.g family gatherings, going out with friends. I'm not suggesting you to neglect your studies. But do not give social events a miss just to study.</p>
              <p>In fact, as I'm studying for my Os this year. I'm still very relaxed compared to my other classmates. I'm doing better then majority of them in fact. It all boils down to Time Management and using the "GTD" system well.</p>
