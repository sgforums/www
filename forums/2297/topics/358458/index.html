              <p>I received a letter of acceptance from NTU for Chemistry and Biological Chemistry.</p>
              <p>I heard that it is a relatively new course started recently. Can anybody enlighten me about the job prospects after studying this course?</p>
              <p>There's an internship/attachemnt in the 4th year, so I think that's very important to find job in future yea?</p>
              <p>Between NTU CBC and NUS School of Science, which is better?</p>
              <p>Thanks=]</p>

              <p>I'm a yrÂ 3 CBC student so if you have any direct questions to ask you can pm me.</p>
              <p>Job prospects are mostly the samefor any chemistry course so if you are concern about that, either uni is the same.</p>
              <p>The main difference is that NUS course is a 3 years degree course with 1 additional year honours for the top 20-30% of the students while NTU is a 4 yrs direct honours course with attachment OR final year project in the 4th year.</p>

              <p>Maybe I can add something constructive. The relative new course should be in its fifth year when you get in anyway.</p>
              <p>Actually job prospect isn't really a good gauge to whether the course is good or not, I mean you may end of in an industry that doesn't deal with chemistry in the future. Or be in the administrative department of that pharmaceutical company etc.</p>
              <p>Unless you really want to excel in the field of chemistry and do research, then we can talk about job prospects. But 4 years is really a long time.</p>
              <p>If I'm not wrong, in the 4th year, you either do 2 FYPs if you want a first class honours. If not, it'll be 1 industrial attachment and 1 FYP. Oh well, as I was saying, industrial attachment also doesn't really mean you'll be doing research based work for that company. It all boils down to that company that you are applying for 3 years later.</p>
              <p>And for which science is better, NUS or NTU, I think (I THINK, think only huh) NUS will win hands down.</p>
              <p>Oh right, my two cents' worth. Again, I may be wrong.</p>

              <p>Its EITHER FYP OR attachment and not both. This has been changed already and the minor FYP is no longer compulsory for attachment students. The main FYP is required for the 1st class honours.</p>
              <p>NUS has more experience and has a longer history in its chemistry course but NTU being a new school has better equipment and facilities since everything are newly bought and likely to be more advanced than NUS since its impossible to replace all the equipment in a chem lab too often.</p>
