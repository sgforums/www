              <p>Sorry, but may i  ?</p>
              <p>im 16 this year, the approach my father, has been taking for the past few yrs is .</p>
              <p>'' Do whatever you wan, i dun give a damn, just produce me some results  . ''</p>
              <p>please only focus on a few really essential subjects for your son . dunid all As .  eg, Eng/math/sci . aiya. just those critical subjects, u get my point ''</p>
              <p>'' b4 u want to do anything, ask him for his opinion , eg . do you wan tuition ?  then u tell him to reason with you why have or why no tuition , eg, '' Son: my subjects still okay, so dunid etc, etc '' </p>
              <p>so ultimately its all the things u leave ur son to do. of cuz</p>
              <p>when his results is bad, say with a serious face and ask him, what do you plan to do to improve your results ?  Do you need help or tuition ? ''</p>
              <p>all in all, sec1 and 2 dunid care 1 la, just pass pass can liao, get the basics right &gt;_&gt;</p>
              <p>its sec 3 and 4 thats impt .</p>
              <p>Let him do the thinking/ planning ! Not you !</p>
              <p>ok if all else fails i duno liao. sorry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>** please at least analyse his attitude 2 work here  *</p>

              <p>From the post i believe there might be something to do with the environment of his classroom.</p>
              <p> One of which might be that some of his classmates, or even the one next to him is not doing his work, for the reasons that "no lah, my parents never force me to study, i last min also get good results". Sometimes people will say stuff like that in hope that you will not study and win him in terms of results.</p>
              <p>In the next teacher and parent meeting session, OR call his teacher in private and ask them about what is going on in the classroom(like whether was he being called a nerd or sissy or whatever thing) Not trying to offend anyone here, but some times having a china student in the class willl cause some trouble. Some are very notorious, like to distrupt the class.</p>
              <p>Just tell him that it does not matter how they laugh at you  now, becos eventually you will become their employer and they will work for you</p>

              <p>yup..uncertain...no matter what..a basic education is the

              <p>I see your agony, Etan0065. But like i have said, if your son choose to fail, u can never stop him. Therefore, I think there is a serious need for your son to go for counselling to uncover the reasons why he is so unmotivated. Only by knowing the reasons, then u know how to motivate him.</p>

              <p>My son is in Sec 2 this year...result has been in the mid..50
              plus % .  We have tutors for him...but it seems tht he is not
              motivated to study.  Always thinking of compu games...which we
              allows him during the weekends if it is sch term.  He neglects
              his school works and tutors' work...and if need to do...he just
              complete it without giving his heart in it...attitude is do la...so
              that no complains.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought of giving up...leave him alone and let him failed...then
              he will wake up...but as parents, I really do not want to see it
              happen..especially this year is streaming year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We spent alot on tuition...and is rather painful..especially in
              this time of recession.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am very worry and in a fix....and because of this issue...we
              tend to argue and I know this is very unhealthy for our
