              <p>Eh well. the above title kinda sums up my problem.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I had my preliminary maths paper yesterday. The paper was easy but I think I made quite a number of careless mistakes and I dreamt about it just yesterday. I woke up, and to my horror, realised that the "mistakes" I dreamt were actually reality. I did make them. But before that I had a nightmare that was even worse, I got a real lousy grade for Maths. That isn't really the matter. The issue lies with the fact that my teacher had expected me to score full marks or near full marks for my prelims. And this seemed to give me a lot of pressure when I realised I made so many mistakes that my teacher would see as "stupid mistakes" but I also feel disappointed with not being able to give her my best shot for the last round of school exams.</p>
              <p>Also, because my brother, who was under her teaching just a few years back, fared excellent in her Math subjects and this teacher expects me to do just as well. Not that I'm doubting my abiltity, just that it makes me feel dumb when I can't even live up to someone's expectations despite trying to give my best...</p>
              <p>Sometimes the more I think about it, the more upset I become. But I know I have to sober up because there's still a long week(about 2 weeks) left for the remaining papers.</p>
              <p>Sounds like a dumb frustration, yeah.</p>

              <p>Dear Audi,</p>
              <p>  The past is gone. The future is uncertain. What matters is now, because that is where the future (that you desire) is made.</p>
              <p>  When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</p>
              <p>  It is now important to pick yourself up from where you have fallen and move on with faith and courage. The prelim exam is just a full-dress rehearsal before the real thing. You can make as many mistakes as possible during the rehearsal, but remember not to repeat them during the real performance.</p>
              <p>  Jiayou!</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Many students do not like to recheck and recheck their answers during tests and exams, and I believe you are one of them. Hope the incident makes you wiser.</p>
              <p>Many students find it a fuss to reread what they have written, and when their teachers spot them and tell them, they just change the answers accordingly without realizing the consequences.</p>
              <p>Some even when their exam papers or test papers comes back, results low but when the teachers go through the answers, they realized that most are careless mistakes and the fact is that they know how to do them, so do not feel any urgency.</p>
              <p>All these bad habits will eventually lead to poor Os and As results. Those that really do well are people who are meticulous and check their answers when they have finished (with the excess time) and take the effort to do the questions at a steady pace, not rush through the questions without proper presentation of working etc.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents through. </p>

              <p>Prelim paper usually refers to "O"-lvl prelim or "N"-lvl prelim, though mostly it is the former.</p>
              <p>It is basically a test paper set by the school before the actual "O" and "N" lvl, to give the student a rough gauge of their standard ( Though usually highly inaccurate, because neighbourhood schools standards are set too low, while the standards of prestigious schools like RI are set too high )</p>

              <p>Last time I was also super careless... Imagine that I could have almost scored full marks for my F Maths Paper 2, but near to 20 marks were careless!</p>
              <p>Then I decided that there should be a way to train to reduce careless mistakes... I thought and thought about it, and in the end, my conclusion is more practice. However, practice not blindly, but with understanding, taking care to note down which areas you are frequently careless in. The more you do and the more careless mistakes you make, the more you will be aware of.</p>
              <p>Reason: When you do your exams, you will be more attuned to where your common careless mistakes lies, and you will take extra care to check these areas more frequently, and take extra care not to make the same errors.</p>
              <p>I find that this method works well :)</p>
