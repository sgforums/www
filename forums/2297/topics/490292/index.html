              <p>Hello all, </p>
              <p>I am seeking to transfer to a JC from Poly. I am currently in Poly year 1, starting semester 2 in a week time. I am retaking E-math O Level, hoping to score a grade higher (B3 to A2/A1). </p>
              <p>I know that it is quite uncommon for a poly student to seek transfer to a JC but the thing is I always wanted to pursue an A level certificate then later on pursue a degree I am passionate about. After going through the 1st semester in poly, it was just not my cup of tea. I realised I needed to do something ASAP to 'get out' of poly. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am not particularly interested in the reasons why should I leave poly or poly is better than JC etc etc. I have already made up my mind.</span></p>
              <p>However I need to know what are the procedures required for the transfer, and what are implications involved. I am a male, so I believe CMPB will 'chase' after me after I transfer. Also, I remeber that JC won't allow any students from who are currently in another instiuition/poly. That means I only have 1 day to settle the withdrwal from poly and everything on posting day? (Since the next day I have to report to a JC)\</p>
              <p>I am just clueless what should I do now and I HAVE to transfer to a JC no matter what.</p>
              <p>Just some basic info about me:</p>
              <p>Born Jan 1998</p>
              <p>SP, Year 1 Engineering Course.</p>
              <p>L1R5 (2014): 15-2=13nett </p>
              <p>After this year's retake (prepared), I am seeking to transfer to TPJC/SRJC Arts Stream as I am more humanities inclined. This 2 JCs are also nearer to my place.</p>
              <p>I really need help and advise on this as time is running out. Thanks for reading. Appreicate all your help in advance.</p>

              <p>FireIce,</p>
              <p>Thanks for that advice. So I actually have to arrange for a interview with the P? Do you know of anyone who actually got accepted into a JC from Poly? I cannot find anyone to to talk 1-1 to with reagrd to this issue since I dont know anyone in the same situation as me.</p>
              <p>CKTR,</p>
              <p>That gave me some slight reassurance. I did call up MOE, they told me the same thing as well. Go through JAE using SingPass &gt; Choose your JC &gt; Wait for Posting &gt; Posted to a JC &gt; Withdraw from Poly. I really hope TPJC/SRJC accepts me. Hope my e-math can pull up to 11-12 to secure a better chance. (MJC is out of the qn....) Steady ah, if we go TPJC come find each other. </p>
              <p>Sounds kind of easy (when they say it) but how to deal with CMPB side? I am a male, have to serve NS, and born in January. </p>

              <p>You should actually go for h2 math (almost a must). All engineering courses and science courses require h2 math. Even most business courses require h2 math..... If not u are limiting your choices in uni, best to check your desired uni course in nus or ntu or smu website. </p>
              <p>I am actually in the same exact situation as u. Heck even L1R5 same. I also retaking Os this year (Amath and emath).

              <p>Wah, thats some rare coincidence there. I agree H2 Math is a must. I am most def going to pursue a degree in FASS, NUS, so science wouldn't be one of the impt subjects (although its required for some courses).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Probably going to take H1 Chem. I scored an A1 for my combi sci (phy/chem) but just not confident enough to take up H2 sci subjects. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Heard from a friend in MJC and she told me that H2 Sci (Physics and Chem for her sub combi) is really very very very tough, coming from a combi sci background. She scored an A1 too. </span></p>
              <p>Oh yep, my GPA is so-so only because I failed to show any form of real interest in this course...the only module I love is Engineering Mathematics, because it's 'A maths' The real reason why I joined this course is because of its COP, didn't give it a real thought........ </p>
              <p>...that's why I am in this predicament today. Just hoping that everything will go smoothly and I can start afresh in JC &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>I think your subject combo also around the same as mine because i also take combine science(phy/chem). If you are able to score in poly subjects ( u engineering right) u should do fine in jc physics , for example circuit analysis (dk what they call it for your poly but should be same content or a bit harder) as it is repeated content for Alevel physics, at least for my course.</p>
              <p>For engineering math u learn vectors and complex no.  right? They are part of h2 math too but jc one will be more complex.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #666666;">Not really into phy to be honest. Generally, sci is not really my thing, except for chemistry.</span></p>
              <p>yes, for math we learned complex num alr. Vectors is unheard of in 1st sem, maybe next sem bah! And I most likely will go TPJC, unless tjis time round E math will pull up my overall to allow me to hit SRJ's COP. Sigh..............am just worried..</p>
              <p>FireIce, JC is cfm tough de! That's y aft O lvl I have to start preparing for J1 even though I am technically still in poly. </p>
