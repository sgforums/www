              <p>i also scored 40+ in maths when im in sec 2. My school allowed me to take amaths too, though i think they allowed everyone to take amaths.</p>
              <p>Although almost everyone in my school struggle in amaths at the beginning, many of us still score A1s in prelim exam and tests through constant practice(like doing homework assignments and Ten Years Series in sec 4).</p>

              <p>No irony there. A good scientist is also a good mathematician. You can never really do well in science in the future if your maths suck.</p>

              <p>If your grades are good enough, you are likely able to enter a double Sciences stream based on merit alone. I know of a lot of people who fail Maths in Sec 1 and 2, but got into double Sciences stream because their grades are good enough. Sec 3 and 4 when they are being drilled, they all score pretty well for Maths. Even if no As for their Maths, at least a pass is obtained.</p>
              <p>Don't drop A Maths. You will regret it when you enter poly or JC.</p>

              <p>i doubt tuition really helps much. u must put in the extra effort too. </p>
              <p>and i wonder why people want to go jc when the syllabus revision is getting more frequent and more topics are excluded. in my opinion going to jc will only mean that u are letting your results in future to determine which course are u qualified to go in university, and does not necessarily mean u know what you want to do when u grow up. </p>
              <p>amaths btw is not just for admission into jc science stream. it helps even for those students who are planning to go poly especially engineering courses. </p>

              <p><br>POA is not very related to Maths actually; to do POA you only need the basics ( addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).</p>
              <p>You still can pick up A-Maths in Poly (its a must for entry to JC) and that to enrol into NUS you must have A-Maths so its basically when you study and not a type of choice in the end ... ...</p>

              <p><br>For my RP, A Maths = Advanced Maths. I only took it on year 2 sem 1 as my elective module, taking it helps to enrol into univeristies in Singapore, but only if you pass this module get at least a C for overall grade (UT + daily presentation).</p>
              <p>Anyway, there are two parts of Advanced Maths. So, for what I had taken was: A Maths Part 2 which is about linear equation (basic algebra etc...)</p>
              <p>And I would be deciding to take A Maths Part 1 during Year 3 sem 2.</p>
              <p> Thus, there won't be problem to understand and pass it if you do most contributions with the teammates in every of the lessons for both A Maths modules and score well for the UTs too.</p>

              <p>if you don't get into double science, combined sciences isn't a bad thing also.</p>
              <p>in fact, you might even be able to focus better on combined sciences since each component will be about 70% of the pure subject itself.</p>
              <p>i didn't get into double science class when i was in secondary school.. but i focused and worked even harder to get a good grade for combined sciences, and it's really not that difficult to do well for combined science.</p>
              <p>so even if you don't get double science, it's not the end of the world! all the best anyways.</p>
