              1) Are Singapore universities (NUS/ NTU/ SMU) overrated???
              
              2) Is a degree from (NUS/NTU/SMU) recognized by employers overseas - it would be great if anyone can share any of their experiences :)
              
              3) I was looking at Singstats and based on what i see, the general starting pay of fresh university graduates  (NUS/NTU/SMU) in Singapore is around 2.8k+ --&gt; is this true???
              
              4) It is easy for a  (NUS/NTU/SMU) graduate (take engineering course for example) to find a job here in Singapore???
              
              p.s. I just finished my a-levels and i'm full of doubts about what my future is going to be like T.T

              <p><strong>1) Are Singapore universities (NUS/ <span>NTU</span>/
              SMU) overrated???</strong></p>
              <p>They are decent, and they are cheap (as compared to going overseas). Less study loan to repay when you start working.</p>
              <p>Employers base their pay on the degree and class of honours you are getting, and not by the name of the university. That being said, Singapore unis are set as the benchmark, so don't go off to an ulu ulu uni and expect the same employment prospects as local uni grads.</p>
              <p><strong>2) Is a degree from (NUS/NTU/SMU) recognized by employers
              overseas – it would be great if anyone can share any of their
              experiences <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></strong></p>
              <p>Yes, it is. But subjected to whether you have the opportunity to apply for a job overseas, taking into consideration of immigration requirements for each country.</p>
              <p><strong>3) I was looking at Singstats and based on what i see, the
              general starting pay of fresh university graduates (NUS/NTU/SMU) in
              Singapore is around 2.8k+—&gt; is this true???</strong></p>
              <p>The level of pay will depend on your chosen profession and industry. Starting pay for lawyer is $5k; doctors, $3.5k; teachers $3k; accountant, $2.8k.</p>
              <p>Even among engineers, pay differs. It is common for aerospace and chemical engineers to make $4k-5k/month, while mechanical, electrical and civil engineers struggle to hit $3k starting pay.</p>
              <p><strong>4) It is easy for a (NUS/NTU/SMU) graduate (take engineering
              course for example) to find a job here in Singapore???</strong></p>
              <p>Yes. Do you think that all the graduates are sitting at home shaking legs? It depends on how much you expect to be paid.</p>
              <p><strong>p.s. I just finished my a-levels and i’m full of doubts about
              what my future is going to be like T.T</strong></p>

              <p>Statistics tell one side of the story, annecdotal accounts tell another side. Both sides can be misleading. At this stage, you should be looking at the general statistics cos you're going to be one of thousands entering the job market when you graduate which will tell you your chances of landing a job that pays that amount. Not your chances of following in the footsteps of whichever high paying first person account you hear from. </p>
              <p>In any case, by the time you graduate, the winds of economic change might have blown and all these statistics would have changed! The world's a very volatile place now. One invention and a whole department might be made redundant. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead of asking how much you want to earn, have you asked yourself what you would like to do? For e.g. If someone paid me $10,000 per month to listen to Justin Bieber songs all day long, I won't ever ever want that job. </p>

              <p>1) Are Singapore universities (NUS/ <span>NTU</span>/
              SMU) overrated???</p>
              <p>2) Is a degree from (NUS/NTU/SMU) recognized by employers
              overseas – it would be great if anyone can share any of their
              experiences <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>3) I was looking at Singstats and based on what i see, the
              general starting pay of fresh university graduates (NUS/NTU/SMU) in
              Singapore is around 2.8k+—&gt; is this true???</p>
              <p>4) It is easy for a (NUS/NTU/SMU) graduate (take engineering
              course for example) to find a job here in Singapore???</p>
              <p>p.s. I just finished my a-levels and i’m full of doubts about
              what my future is going to be like T.T</p>

              <p>1) It depends on what you call overrated. Frankly speaking its quite a stupid question to me that doesnt warrant much thought because I couldn't afford anything other than local unis and so ranking is not what I looked at. (I believe in the merits of our education system in allowing social mobility since I benefited)</p>
              <p>2) Yes. </p>
              <p>3) Another question that cannot be answered. In case you wonder, its not hard to believe anyway. You expecting graduates to earn upwards of 10k/month ah?</p>
              <p>4) Finding job is more than just your degree. Its about how you channel your available resources to look for opportunities and position yourself to grab them. If you are full of doubts now, its normal, but you should think hard.</p>
              <p>Now.</p>
