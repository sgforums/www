              On a UK student forum, a girl posted the following :<p><i>Okay a bit of background about me - I'm very ambitious and I always have been very academic, I like being successful and academia is my passion. I am studying for my masters degree in a science subject, and I might pursue a PhD. I have all of these big dreams for the future that I'm working on slowly. I've always wanted a partner who is similar to me somewhat so he has a similar passion for academia, or at least is working towards his dream job and has big goals. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               My current boyfriend lives in another country at the moment. When I met him he was exactly what I wanted, he had these big dreams and was studying so hard everyday because he was so determined, he wanted to be a doctor and was aiming for medical school, I loved that. Anyway, he said he didn't get the grades he wanted to and would rather not go to any med school at all than a 'crap one', and now doesn't want to become a doctor and isn't going to university. He's happy working in his father's clothing boutique. He says if he moves to England and marries me, he's happy opening up a little clothes shop and selling clothes. This shocks me because he's always talked about his extreme passion to become a doctor so this is such a change. Plus in terms of job prospects, if he comes to England, he has no degree, no A levels or GCSE's, just an international high school qualification. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               I feel guilty for feeling very disappointed in him, he could've retaken this exam, he could go to this 'crap' med school and succeed and STILL become a doctor but he's given up. Love shouldn't be about dreams/goals but I feel like we are becoming so incompatible and I should lower my standards but I feel like we are so different now. Someone please knock some sense into me. </i></p><p>
              Someone then replied her :</p><p><i>It's this attitude of partners judging others capabilities which leads to insecurities and low self-esteem. If you love him, you'll accept him for whatever he does. </i></p><p>
              My personal comments :</p><p>True love is indeed unconditional, but loving someone unconditionally doesn't necessarily mean he/she is the right person for you to marry. For a marriage to work, you'll need a lot more than unconditional love. You need mutually beneficial and complementary characters, personalities, habits, philosophies and goals (on every level, from professional career to family &amp; friends to spirituality), and you'll need financial stability and sufficiency as well. Too many marriages break down and end in divorce, just because one or both spouse(s) kena financial difficulty, even if they (at initial point of marriage) truly and deeply loved each other.

              Peace between the superpowers is peace for the entire world. Having Trump, Putin, Xi and others as trigger-happy cowboys may make for exciting news, but would be holding the entire world hostage (no one is safe if large scale war erupts, not even Singapore).

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you know... although here in Singapore you can only get your hands on a half-dozen Kit Kat flavors, but there have been over 300 different flavors of Kit Kat (many of them a one time only release) ever manufactured, and over a hundred different flavors are available at any one time in Japan (Kit Kat is big in Japan because while it originated in the United Kingdom, the brand name sounds similar to the auspicious Japanese phrase "You Win!" hence the snack is taken as a good luck token).

              Now on Mediacorp channel 8 : "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journey:_Tumultuous_Times">The Journey: Tumultuous Times</a>" today's episode on the communists + bus company employees clash against the colonialists + bus company employers in the Hock Lee bus riots.<p><i>The Hock Lee bus workersâ€™ strikes began on April 23, 1955. The incident was a result of failed negotiations between the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company and its bus workers. The workers wanted better working conditions while the employers wanted to protect their business interests. The strikes eventually escalated and resulted in a violent clash among the Singapore Bus Workers Union, Hock Lee Employee's Union, the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Student Union and law enforcement on May 12, 1955. The event has been commonly understood as a violent confrontation between colonialists and communists. The event was however also born out of the conditions of colonial society as well as being part of a necessary modernisation trajectory that Singapore was embarking on.</i></p><p>

During the weight cut, I was unable to breath and felt off balance from the pressure in my sinuses. I was not feeling well enough to risk getting punched in the head with such pressure.â€�
                  </p><p>
                  And so, she made the decision to withdraw and sparked outrage among the fan base, many of whom complained about spending thousands to travel to Las Vegas, buy tickets, pay for accommodations and then not get to see the fight they came for.
                  </p><p>
                  <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RNNqeaHj7gj5FZWJbbbgrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDk2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/18a9e127339b9da88a1247f0f8e75482"></p><p>
                  
                  Oh, strawweight champion 52kg Joanna Jedrzejczyk gallantly offered to step up and fight the 61kg Shevchenk, which Shevchenko quickly agreed to. There were plenty of issues with that, though, not the least of which was that Jedrzejczyk hadnâ€™t taken a pregnancy test that is required by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Results take three days to come back and Bob Bennett, the commissionâ€™s executive director, wouldnâ€™t allow her to compete without one.
                  </p><p>
                  
                  Jedrzejczyk is one of the most entertaining fighters, male or female, in the UFC, but did anyone really want to see her without benefit of a training camp go against someone as good and as prepared as Shevchenko?
                  </p><p>
                  
                  It isnâ€™t fair to blame Nunes, though, and it wasnâ€™t like White could have â€” or would have, if he had the ability â€” forced her to fight. Imagine the liability the UFC would face if it had tried to force Nunes to fight when she said she wasnâ€™t feeling well and then something terrible had happened to her in the event.
                  </p><p>
                  
                  If she couldnâ€™t breathe properly, she couldnâ€™t compete at the highest level of a sport that requires significant cardiovascular capacity.

              In addition to what the article says, I would advise against underestimating the biochemical and neurological link between physical health &amp; disease, with psychological health &amp; disease. Psychological dis-ease of all kinds (eg. profound sense of loss and sadness, chronic anger issues, loneliness, poor self-esteem, etc) significantly increases the risk of many diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc ; just as apparently physical diseases of the physical body also adversely affects one's psychological and mental well-being, eg. unhealthy diets or chronic sleep deprivation (ie. 99% of Singaporeans) significantly increases the risk of all types of dementia, in addition to genetic predispositions.<p>
