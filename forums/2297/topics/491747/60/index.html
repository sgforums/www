              <p>
              My old secondary school was considered to be a rubbish dump, where all delinquents gathered. Fighting is like drinking water to us, only the one with the hardest fist command all respect. Growing up in this environment made me think that fighting solves all problems. 
              </p><p>
              I was never early for school. Every morning, I just simply stared at the prefect on duty, he/she would definitely be intimidated and let me in without fail. One fine day, I was late as usual. The new prefect on duty was a cute petite girl. I smiled at her and asked her to let me in but she refused to do so, hence I resorted to my usual intimidation method but she stared back right into my eyes instead. In the end, I my discipline master slapped me with 1 week worth of detention. I kept swearing and cursing because this little chilli padi wounded my ego. Therefore I decided that I had to teach her a lesson. 
              </p><p>
              After school, I gathered my underlings and went into to her classroom to mess up her table and poured out all her belongings from her bag. Initially she tried to fight back by scratching me insanely hence I had to push her back into her chair. Tears started flowing out of her eyes while she stared at me with a face full of hatred as if I had killed her parents. Iâ€™m a person who has a soft spot for girls who are crying. Being totally clueless on how to pacify a crying girl, I left in a hurry after telling her, â€œYou winâ€�.
              </p><p>
              That night I just couldnâ€™t forget the way she stared at me. I touched the scratch marks on my hand and smile. The very next morning, I brought a really big lollipop and waited for her to appear at the school gate so that I could apologize to her. She refused to accept my apology despite how relentlessly I tried. Finally she broke her silence and told me to take a step back. I followed her order without thinking and she slammed the school gate right in my face. â€œYou are late for school again. Please wait for teacher to open the door for you bah.â€� I got outplayed out by her yet Iâ€™m not angry at all. Strangely I was feeling happy instead as I had developed interest in this sadistic little chilli padi.
              </p><p>
              The probability of me getting to know her is close to zero because Iâ€™m the kind of guy she detests the most. Luckily fate played a part in matching us up. When I heard that another ah beng was finding trouble with her, I raced to her classroom immediately. I dragged him out of the classroom and gave him a beating. I nearly got expelled due to this incident and I was shocked when I learnt that she actually begged the principal to pardon me. 
              </p><p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysian politicians often paint an erroneous picture of Sg taking advantage of My over water. Fact is, My does not have the water treatment technologies (or more precisely, the funds for it) for the southern region of My, and Sg sells back the treated ready-to-drink water to My at a specially low price (relative to the cost of the billion dollar treatment plants and technologies). So it's really a win-win deal. It's true that if My reneges on the deal, Sg will suffer more than My, but My will also suffer from a lack of sufficient flow of treated ready-to-drink water to this southern region of My as well. It's true that My could choose to fork out the billion dollars to invest in their own water treatment plants, but they obviously thought it over, and realized the water deal with Sg, even after taking into consideration inflation over the decades, must still be worth it to My themselves.<p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/malaysia-says-retain-water-deal-singapore-111200977.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/malaysia-says-retain-water-deal-singapore-111200977.html</a></p></div>
