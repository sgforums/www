              Police are still trying to identify at least 33 missing (presumed abducted, raped and murdered) women whose snapshots were found in psychopathic serial killer Lonnie Franklin Jr.'s home after his arrest. The images were part of a chilling discovery of nearly 1,000 photos of young women or teenage girls â€” many nude and some who appeared to be unconscious or dead â€” hidden in Franklin's house. <b>Several other psychopathic serial killers also prowled the area, preying on the same type of victims, who were often sexually assaulted, murdered and then dumped in alleys, parks or trash bins.</b> The killings were believed to be the work of one man dubbed the "Southside Slayer," though several culprits were later arrested and charged with additional crimes as DNA evidence became more sophisticated. The killings inspired the formation of a community group, the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders, to raise awareness of the danger to women and pressure police to investigate more thoroughly. One of the group's founders, Margaret Prescod, continues on that mission. She distributes fliers with the photos of the unidentified women found in Franklin's house and said <b>she wants police to continue investigations into what happened to over 200 women who have gone missing in that area or whose killings remain unsolved.</b><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/grim-sleeper-headed-death-row-mystery-remains-155810283.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/grim-sleeper-headed-death-row-mystery-remains-155810283.html</a>

              <p>"There are different types of wrongs. First, there is a process error. Then there can be an error in substance. Then there can be an error both in process and substance. One must keep these distinct. What happened here is it's a pure process error. If you look at that, contrast with an error in substance which may or may not have legal consequences," he said. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"For example, let’s say you have an association, and there is going to be a challenge for the chairman at the Annual General Meeting. The chairman quickly brings in new voting members to defeat the challenge – that process is legal. But from the view of substance, is it correct? It depends on the circumstances," Mr Shanmugam said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Take another situation, let’s say a group takes over an organisation and that organisation has a lot of money. The new group appointed its friends. It sets up a structure that helps vacuum money out of the organisation. And its own accountants say in writing 'despite repeated requests, the organisation did not provide us with all the critical documents relating to the transactions with the friends'. And assume they repeated every year, and yet the organisation doesn’t do anything – that is an error. Both in process and in substance. And that is unlawful and that must have consequences. So let's keep things in perspective," said Mr Shanmugam. </p>

              [Singapore] - It looked like we would struggle to reach our goal of raising Sg$95,000. And then it happened. The parents of a John, a young boy with special needs showed up at the reception of MediaCorp. John had heard the radiothon on the air and he had something recorded his personal message to share with the listeners. And when we played it, we heard an innocent child make a simple, sincere plea. To please have the chance to be treated like everyone else. We played that recording over the air. And in those 2 minutes and 39 seconds John changed the world. Grown men called us from their cars â€“ barely able to control their tears as they reacted to his heart-wrenching words. We played the recording a total of 4 times that weekend. At the end of the 95 hours, and mostly because of the recording, we had more than Sg$980,000 in donations and pledges, over 10 times the original goal, which without John, we couldn't even raise.<p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2016/08/joe-augustin-writes-non-political-note-about-the-cancer-that-is-credit-stealing-upper-management/">http://mothership.sg/2016/08/joe-augustin-writes-non-political-note-about-the-cancer-that-is-credit-stealing-upper-management/</a>

              [Thailand] - A three-year-old girl's head was split open by an electric ceiling fan - after a tragic accident while playing with her father. Em Phoeykiln, 25, was making his daughter Oum laugh by picking her up and throwing her in the air in their living room in Rayong, Thailand. But on one occasion he lifted her a fraction too high and her head collided with the spinning fan. The impact was so hard the metal blade bent and the toddler's skull could be seen underneath the gashed skin. Oum was rushed to hospital after the accident in Rayong, Thailand. Before the emergency surgery required to save her life, doctors asked parents if they could afford cost of Sg$2.4k surgery bill. Father Em, was told: "Don't be slow to decide, as it could be too late soon". Father agreed, but now has to sell off all his possessions to pay for the medical bill.<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3734476/Three-year-old-girl-s-head-sliced-open-ceiling-fan-father-throws-air-played.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3734476/Three-year-old-girl-s-head-sliced-open-ceiling-fan-father-throws-air-played.html</a>

              Is zombie drug Flakka behind cannibal frat boy attack? Florida teen may have taken 'five dollar insanity' drug before 'stabbing to death random couple and feasting on dead man's FACE' <p>

                  Earlier that evening, Harrouff was out at a sports bar with his parents, but got agitated and stormed off, prompting them to call police</p><p>
                  Harrouff was found on top of John, biting the flesh off his face, before a stun gun, four police and a K-9 were used to pull him off</p><p>
                  Harrouff also allegedly stabbed the Stevenses' neighbor, Jeff Fisher</p><p>
                  Fisher heard screams, rushed over to help, and gasped for air during 911 call where he told dispatcher he was 'bleeding profusely'  </p><p>
                  The 19-year-old Florida State University student was a former high school football player and wrestler, described by police as 'abnormally or supernaturally strong'</p><p>
