              SINGAPORE - A 28-year-old freelance model was singing in a karaoke lounge with her friends on 12 Dec 2017 when she suddenly felt numbness in half her body, along with a headache. Ms Karen Stella Wong was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where she went into a coma and died three days later, Shin Min Daily News said in a report on Tuesday (26 Dec 2017).<p>

              [Singapore] - Woman accuses male executive of sexual harassment, ends up in jail<p>

              The man says : "All the troubles started when during a regular meeting where one of them tries to negotiate her salary with me by bringing out of all things, the gender pay gap. I explain to her that in this company we will pay you for what you are worth. Not because of your genitalia. We do not care about your sex, but what you can bring for the company.â€�
              </p><p>
              Some time later, the executive was informed that a complaint had been lodged against him and that he would have to meet with Human Resources to discuss it. Apparently, the executiveâ€™s comments about â€œgenitaliaâ€� and â€œsexâ€� were the basis for the sexual harassment complaint. Human Resources promptly dismissed the complaint.</p><p>
              
              The man continues : "I am extremely pissed off with her so i started to mess with her work by making unrealistic demand. Her work eventually got sloppy due to all the stress im putting on her and she quit 4 months after the incident. After she quit i decided that I wasnt done yet and i lawyer-ed up and sue her for damages for the incident. Well to make long story short she lose, and sheâ€™s in jail due to no money.â€�</p><p><a href="http://www.theindependent.sg/woman-falsely-accuses-male-executive-of-sexual-harassment-ends-up-in-jail/">http://www.theindependent.sg/woman-falsely-accuses-male-executive-of-sexual-harassment-ends-up-in-jail/</a></p>

              SINGAPORE -
              A man came up with a plan to rob prostitutes to earn some easy money and his two friends agreed to help him. DPP Teo said after the victim opened the door, Foo entered the house and prevented her from closing the door so that Wong and Tanaka could go in. Wong punched Ms Xiao in the face, and both he and Foo pushed her head several times. They warned her that they were Singapore police officers, with Foo flashing his Institute of Technical Education (ITE) identification card. Tanaka guarded the victim in the living room while Wong and Foo stole $300 and two mobile phones from her room.

              Actually, it's not so clear cut. Only if you sufficiently understand all of the relevant facets (and how many people do? pity), including genetics, biochemistry, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, psychical, karmic, spiritual, and the supernatural realities, would you be able to make a clear case-by-case judgment on the actual underlying mechanism and reality of each psychiatric patient. In many of the cases, it will be a concordant and simultaneous overlap of functions across these domains and modalities. Eg. a genetic predisposition causing a biochemical imbalance in the brain together with the prerequisite and preexisting karma of the soul brought down into this physical incarnation allowing for psychical intrusion by psychotic post mortems and other non-physical beings of various natures and differing agendas, resulting in schizophrenic symptoms and diagnosis. Ideally, treatment will be multi-faceted and multi-modality, but don't be naÃ¯ve, how many in today's society really understand all of the multiple domains involved?<p>

              The sad part is, such recurring instances worldwide are the consequence of the vast majority of 'customers' being well-to-do people eating away (prolly even da-baoing) but yet refusing to pay at all (not even the minimum cost to defray costs or break even), and not because of genuinely poor people who can't afford to pay, who are in the minority.<p>

                  A cat has miraculously survived a 30-minute cycle in a washing machine after he was given the kiss of life by his shocked owner.
                  </p><p>
                  Nine-month-old Tiggy was motionless and not breathing when he was desperately pulled from the washing machine drum by devastated owner Rae Sutton at her home in Bilston, West Midlands.
                  </p><p>
                  But after <b>Mrs Sutton, 72, gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Tiggy, the cat began breathing again</b> and was rushed to the nearest veterinary practice.
                  </p><p>
                  Tiggy later awoke from a coma after being given an oxygen mask, and returned home just three hours after his initial ordeal.

              Do Singaporeans really need foreign maids? Or is it really a symptom of poor household management (thus needing to hire maids) in a majority of cases? Not to mention human-rights abuses and exploitations, rife within the domestic maid industry (as is the case with the foreign workers construction industry, but that's a separate topic). Regardless, this particular maid certainly gave her Singaporean employers a colorful experience.<p>

              Visitors to Copenhagen zoo, no stranger to controversy, and Givskud Zoo, some 20 km from the city of Vejle in central Denmark, may now have to brace themselves for the bloody spectacle of cute little hamsters and bunny rabbits being savagely ripped to shreds by an apex predator.<p>This unusual scheme, which has come under fire for its cruelty, has been initiated by the two zoos to give their carnivores a more varied diet as well as to teach children about the animalsâ€™ true nature.</p><p>â€œIt's good for the animals to have a varied diet. Plus with pets like rabbits or hamsters, there is fur that is fun to chew on, and their intestines are super-healthy for the tigers and lions,â€� Copenhagen zookeeper Sophie Eller told Denmarkâ€™s TV2 channel.
                  
                  </p><p>â€œPeople are emotional, so we spend a lot of time telling them what is about to happen. I think people would prefer something meaningful, like feeding tigers and lions, rather than just having their pets put down (by lethal injection at veterinary clinics) and incinerated.â€�
                  </p><p>
                  â€œWhen people come here with their rabbits, it is to have them put down. We don't want to hide it from children,â€� added Givskud Zoo director Richard Osterballe, claiming that the measure wasnâ€™t just another way for people to kill off their pets.</p><p>
