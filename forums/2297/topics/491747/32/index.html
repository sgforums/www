            <div class='col-md body'>[Singapore] - Singapore Ambassador-at-large <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bilahari+kausikan">Bilahari Kausikan</a> shared the following Singaporean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak_and_dagger">cloak-&amp;-dagger story</a> of political espionage.<p><i>"I was then pretending to study in the University of Singapore. I did something that could potentially have had serious ramifications â€” what I am never going to say, so donâ€™t bother to ask. Nobody knew what I did except my fellow conspirators â€” or so I fondly believed â€” but things began to go pear-shaped and I thought Iâ€™d better come clean before everything crashed.</i></p><p><i>I telephoned my father, then (Singaporeâ€™s Ambassador) in Moscow. Before I could say anything on a line that like all Embassy lines was obviously tapped, my father said he knew about it and told me to tell Mr Chia. I dutifully called Mr Chia. Again before I could say anything he said he knew about it, and told me to go and meet Mr Nathan at Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) which was then in City Hall, now our National Gallery.</i></p><p><i> With more than a little trepidation, I made my way to City Hall and was tremblingly admitted into Mr Nathanâ€™s presence. He wasnâ€™t then working in MFA. He must have just borrowed an office in MFA to meet me as he was then in a department whose very existence a callow youth should not know about let alone visit. Again he already knew all about what in the innocence of youth I had thought was secret. Why did you do it, he demanded. I answered the best I could. Mr Nathan sat in grim faced silence, apparently pondering what I said.</i></p><p><i> Who else was involved, he suddenly barked at me. No one I said. Donâ€™t lie. No one, I insisted. Again he pondered in silence. I sat before him nervously for what seemed an eternity.</i></p><p><i> Will you take responsibility, he finally asked. Exasperation momentarily overcame fear. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been trying to do, I snapped.</i></p><p><i> Whatâ€™s the worst that can happen to you, Mr Nathan snapped back. I donâ€™t know, I replied, puzzled. Will you be hanged, he asked.</i></p><p><i> I donâ€™t think so, I hope not, I replied, by this time thoroughly discombobulated, which I now realise was his intention.</i></p><p><i> Mr Nathan broke into a smile â€” and those of you who know him should know he had a very charming smile â€” So what are you worried about? You did what you thought was right, it was stupid, but you wonâ€™t be hanged. Go, he said.</i></p><p><i>I got up and made for the door. He called me back. Good that you are willing to take responsibility for what you thought was right, he said. Never evade responsibility, but if you want to play such games again, ask someone who knows how, he said. I fled."</i></p><p> - Bilahari Kausikan.</p><p>Someone commented, "<i>I know exactly what Bilahari Kausikan did but I'm not going into details either. At the time there was a cloak-&amp;-dagger battle of wits going on between the <a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.php?id=1088">Pyramid club</a> and <a href="http://nussu.org/history">USSU</a>. USSU spies had caught the Pyramid club spies while they were doing some dastardly deed in the dead of night. Bila and his team got away with it because they were agents of the PAP establishment in the first place. Nathan's "magnanimity" had nothing to do with the outcome. Had the tables been turned (ie. had he been anti-PAP spying on PAP), the consequences would have been severe. I've said all there is to know about the episode. A crime was committed and he was not prosecuted. The pattern repeats itself.</i>"</p></div>
