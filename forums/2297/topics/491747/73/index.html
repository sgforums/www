            <div class='col-md body'>When the governments (ie. Trump vs Xi JingPing) pick fights, the fights spillover to innocent civilians on social media. The situation looks to be deteriorating, as long as Trump and Xi JingPing keep it up and exacerbate these wars on multiple fronts (eg. South China Sea military escalation). If this keeps up, thousands of innocent Chinese in USA are going to be targeted and victimized, beaten up by gangs, escalating to rapes, tortures and murders.<p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/mvwtej3dh/photo_10.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/ksrg3z9w5/photo_3.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/8lxektc5x/photo_4.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/54pdhz8wl/photo_6.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/wx4gjmml1/photo_9.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/a7vgrfkd1/photo_7.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/33jn7g0.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/kudgvqllh/photo_10_Copy.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/3x6c53zyt/photo_5.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/utuhvc3px/photo_2.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://s32.postimg.org/5b3j4fyz9/photo_8.jpg"></p></div>

              [Australia] - Four people have been killed, including a 10-year-old child, and at least 15 injured after a car drove into pedestrians in Bourke Street, one of the busiest areas in Melbourneâ€™s central business district. 
              <p>
              Victoria police said on Friday afternoon the victims were a child and a man and a woman, both in their 30s. None of the dead were believed to be related. A fourth victim, a 33-year-old man, died in hospital on Friday night.
              </p><p>
              Victorian police commissioner Graham Ashton said the death toll could rise further, as five of the injured were listed as in critical condition, including a toddler whose pram could be seen lying on the road amid the carnage.

              Just the couple's way of having some creative fun with gatecrashing, no need to read too much LGBT and/or psychiatry issues into it. But in the first place, gatecrashing is an useless archaic tradition in which the 'fun' often comes at the expense of forcing insensible activities against the participants' free will, similar to forcing the bride/groom to drink excessive, liver-destroying ethanolic drinks during the wedding dinner, and/or the NUS/NTU sexually offensive orientation activities.<p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-12.17.43-PM.png"></p><p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2017/01/spore-bride-and-groom-swap-roles-for-the-best-wedding-gatecrash-youll-see-today/">http://mothership.sg/2017/01/spore-bride-and-groom-swap-roles-for-the-best-wedding-gatecrash-youll-see-today/</a></p><p>Dog must be thinking : <i>Can these coconaden humans pls leave me out of their nonsense</i>...  -___-"</p><p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-21-at-12.38.03-PM.png">

            <div class='col-md body'>Insane. A damn shame this isn't a real move. With such an awesome trailer (can you believe a man named Gonzalo Gutierrez took just 3 days* to create this video from scratch, using nothing more than a couple of actors and a computer?), if he used this to crowdfund the movie (assuming he wanted it made), he will probably actually succeed in getting the required funds. Talk about an insanely awesome resume piece for Gonzalo Gutierrez.<p>Trailer video for "Underland : The Last Surfacer" (a movie which does not exist)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHp8NT14Cw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHp8NT14Cw</a></p><p>Edited to add : Pierre Png.

              Amos Yee is now full of regret, and now wants to protest against the US Govt policies he feels victimized by.<p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/straits-times-complain-like-amos-yee.jpg"></p><p><i>After languishing in American jail for now a total of 24 days, according to my pro bono human rights lawyer, Sandra Grossman (whoâ€™s been doing a tireless and absolutely fantastic job on my case, by the way), she was in contact with the immigration officers and was hoping that after they heard that the nature of my case, would release me in a few days. However, that did not happen. I just got a letter that said that my court date (not release day) is scheduled for 30th January. Yes, you heard that right, fucking 30th January. What the fuck?! 
                      </i></p><p><i>
                      
                      That means I will literally have spent a total of 50 days in American jail, that is longer than anything that the Singaporean government has sentenced me for, for criticizing religion and the government! Someone escaped his country to prevent being sent to jail for exercising his free speech and has to spend time in jail in the country that he escaped to that is longer than if he was imprisoned for exercising his free speech from the country he was escaping! If he rescinds his political asylum claim, he is deported back to the country he is trying to escape from and gets permanently banned from coming to the US. 
                      </i></p><p><i>
                      What the fuck? What the fuck?! This is bullshit! This is fucking bullshit! And the worst part is nobody really knows about these kinds of awful immigration policies existed in America. Fortunately, because I have a high profile case, weâ€™re finally highlighting these wretched policies. Tens of thousands of people have already suffered from these policies and we didnâ€™t know about it. What the hell? What the fuck? This is like the premise of some dark comedy novel. And yet, here it is, happening in real life. This needs to end. We have to speak up about this garbage. We can start by demanding my immediate release from American jail. Fuck the oppressive court date. Lawyers who have been passive slaves to the status quo would probably say that speaking against the set court date would be futile. I donâ€™t give two fucks. 
                      </i></p><p><i>
                      After observing these authoritarians (ie. Singapore and USA) for 2 years, the very important lesson Iâ€™ve learned is that no matter how much they make it seem like the people arenâ€™t able to change a law or affect a judge's decision, they do, they just want you to think they donâ€™t in the hope that the people will think their actions are worthless so they wonâ€™t fight against the tyranny of the status quo. Friends, do not be fooled, we must stand together and fight.

              Debt collectors can contact you by phone, letter, email or text message, as long as they follow the rules and disclose that they are debt collectors. It's against the law for a debt collector to pretend to be someone else to harass, threaten or deceive you.
              </p><p>
              
              They may not contact you at inconvenient times or places, such as early in the morning or late at night. And they may not contact you at work if they're told not to.
              </p><p>
              
              Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you, according to the FTC. That includes threats of violence or using obscene language. Federal law also limits the number of calls a debt collector can place.
              </p><p>
              
              Collectors cannot lie to collect a debt, by falsely representing themselves or the amount you owe. And other than trying to obtain information about you, such as a telephone number or whereabouts, a debt collector generally is not permitted to discuss your debt with anyone other than you, your spouse, or your attorney.
