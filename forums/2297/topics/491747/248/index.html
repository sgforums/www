              [Singapore] - Brawl breaks out at People's Park Food Centre after man grabs hand of married woman<p>
              Stomp understands that the dispute was between a trio consisting of two men and one woman, and a larger group of men.
              </p><p>
              Both groups were not acquainted with one another.
              </p><p>
              The dispute is believed to have started when the trio walked past the group of men, who were seated and were having drinks.
              </p><p>
              One of the men from the group had reportedly held onto the woman's hand and asked her to join him for a drink.
              </p><p>
              The woman's husband, who was part of the trio, then confronted the guy.
              </p><p>
              The larger group of men then started assaulting the trio.

              Indonesia prison riot leaves 6 dead (1 inmate and 5 police officers), and several police officers remain as hostages by the prisoners. A female police officer was badly beaten up by the prisoners, and she may or may not be one of the 5 police officers confirmed dead so far.<p>

              A female prison officer shares the following : <p>
                  <i>
                  Compared with the extreme degree of social interaction required to maintain authority over women inmates, working in the booth on this male prisoners wing was a different, and, I thought, better place for me. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  I was slow to catch on. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  The buzzer rang without ceasing. And being a newbie, I always tried to answer. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  â€œWhoâ€™s working today?" theyâ€™d call in from their cells. "Whoâ€™s this?â€�
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Iâ€™d respond: â€œItâ€™s Carter.â€� 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Theyâ€™d make a request. â€œI need (a grievance form/medical form/toilet paper/toothbrush/Advil/etc.) They promised me last shift...â€� 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  â€œIâ€™ll look into it.â€� 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  â€œThank you, Carter. I hear an accent. Where you from?â€�
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  And then, I learned, Iâ€™d have to shut it down, usually with a swift, â€œNone of your business.â€� Because what initially appeared to be harmless conversation often led to an inquiry into my personal life. And sharing anything personal with inmates is one of the first things they teach you not to do. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  I was sharp enough to catch such obvious attempts at manipulation. But I continued to answer the buzzer as often as it rang. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  After a few shifts in Delta, a male officer finally explained to me why the intercom rang so constantly. â€œThey keep buzzing because theyâ€™re masturbating to the sound of your voice,â€� he said. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  I was dumbfounded. I was educated and had the highest score on the state exam of any cadet at that time. But training didnâ€™t prepare me for that moment. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Reading the utter disbelief on my face, the officer proved his point by answering the next few buzzers. Repeat callers would ask, â€œWhereâ€™s Carter?â€� And heâ€™d reply, â€œSheâ€™s out. Itâ€™s me now.â€� 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  In less than ten minutes, the buzzers all went silent. </i>

              Before the election, Mahathir had promised to hand over PMship to Anwar should he be pardoned and released. Now that it's done, when a reporter asked Mahathir if Anwar can now be PM, Mahathir replies to the effect of, "We'll see how it goes."

              Singapore is about to be further infiltrated by even more North Korean and American spies, both sides preparing to react to possible assassination scenarios carried out by the other side. And in the worst case scenario, Singapore might be set up or blamed by both sides. And this is being optimistic. Cautiously.<p><img src="https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/donald-trump-tweet-singapore.jpg"></p><p>

Except for Kim Jong-nam (the guy in the middle), who fled to Singapore to escape North Korean spies, and only managed to reach Malaysia before being assassinated by Vietnamese and Indonesian young women (Kim Jong Un denies any involvement in the assassination, swears he never even met these women), who will both rot away for the rest of their lives in a Malaysia prison.</p><p>

              Malaysia's former leader Najib Razak was hit with a travel ban Saturday as speculation mounted he was about to flee the country following his shock election loss, in a possible bid to avoid prosecution over a multi-billion-dollar 1MBD scandal.
              <p>
              An angry crowd (baying for Najib's blood) had gathered at a Kuala Lumpur airport, shouting at vehicles and seeking to stop them entering, after a purported flight itinerary leaked online showed Najib and his unpopular wife were planning to head to Indonesia.

              Hope is a dangerous thing. But we all need it. If this works out, never mind Singapore (ie. the summit host), the entire world will benefit hugely (if a nuclear war breaks out, Russia and China will have no choice but to be involved as well, then there goes planet Earth), especially the pitiful citizens of North Korea themselves. Kim Jong Un is obviously doing this for self-gain, but in this case, it's also the gain of his citizens and the rest of the world as well. Hopefully neither side screws this up, for the sake of all humanity.<p>

              Obviously an AWOLer. A trained US military soldier (even if he isn't either Special Ops or Special Forces) can kena abducted-and-murdered-missing in safest-country-in-the-world-Singapore? Singapore isn't (insert any other country here). Possible only if it was deliberately carried out as a black ops assassination, eg. by their own CIA.<p>

              In all of Southeast Asia, Myanmar is by far the most ethnically fragmented and domestically problematic. The ideal solution for a lasting peace amongst it's many ethnicities would be to, as LKY did, use English as a universal working national language for everyone (especially in all schools), instead of forcing the many ethnic minorities to learn and use the ethnic majority's Burmese language (at the expense of the minority languages). Though there's no chance Aung San Suu Kyi (not Aung La N Sang) would be wise enough to implement this, nor have the political will and power to do so (on this note, a naÃ¯ve associate remarked that being the POTUS, Trump was the most powerful man on Earth ; that's incredibly naÃ¯ve : Trump is straitjacketed by his role as the POTUS ; in contrast Putin and Xi Jinping are incomparably way more powerful than Trump is, even if the US military remains by far the most powerful amongst all countries on Earth).
