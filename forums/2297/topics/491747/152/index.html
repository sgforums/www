              [Malaysia] - S'porean mum and 18 year old daughter accused of insulting a Malaysian immigration officer (maybe because they offered to bribe him, or perhaps because they *didn't*), so both kena jailed in Malaysian prison for 1 day. Upon their release 24 hours later, the Immigration Department of Malaysia further accused them of shoplifting, so now they're being further imprisoned indefinitely pending investigations and paperwork.

              [Singapore] - Dr Ang Peng Tiam has written several articles in the Straits Times sharing about his experience as an oncologist treating his cancer patients. No doubt he genuinely had his patients' best interests, even if things do not always turn out as hoped. And I totally agree with SMC, even if a doctor genuinely feels treatment A is the best course of action, he still has the responsibility to explain alternative treatments B and C, and let the patient decide. Unfortunately he just took it upon himself to select what he felt was the best treatment without explaining the alternatives, the patient died, and the family lodged a complaint against him. Moving forward, Dr Ang should certainly have more than enough money (savings and investments) to afford to take this 8 months suspension, to do something else with his life for a change.<p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/8984122/16x9/670/377/ae659c0db375870b41a9366542b3c5d5/RD/ang-peng-tiam.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/prominent-oncologist-ang-peng-tiam-suspended-for-professional-8984120">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/prominent-oncologist-ang-peng-tiam-suspended-for-professional-8984120</a>

              Well, just imagine how this female tourist at a jade shop in Yunnan, China, felt when she realised she had broken a 300,000 yuan (around S$61,000) bracelet.
              </p><p>
              According to Shanghaiist, she had tried on the accessory when the shopkeeper informed her of its hefty price tag.
              </p><p>
              Anxious and in a hurry to remove the bracelet, it slipped from the woman's hand and fell on to the ground, where it broke into two pieces.
              </p><p>
              The woman then suffered a panic attack and she fainted into the arms of other customers.

              From international website http://www.economist.com<p>How foreigners misunderstand Singapore</p><p>The city stateâ€™s success offers much to admire but little to emulate</p><p>Excerpt : </p><p>SINGAPORE has never been short of admirers. Many leaders of developing countries respect Lee Kuan Yew, its founding father, for taking his city-state from third- to first-world status while resisting Western calls for greater political liberalisation. Paul Kagame, Rwandaâ€™s iron-fisted president, hopes that his country will become â€œthe Singapore of Africaâ€�. Fans of Rodrigo Duterte compare the Philippine president to Lee: strong-willed and intolerant of crime and corruption.
              </p><p>
              Lately the rich world, too, has begun to look at the island. â€œWant to ditch Obamacare? Letâ€™s copy Singaporeâ€™s health-care miracle,â€� chirped an opinion piece on the website of Fox News, a conservative American broadcaster, soon after the election of Donald Trump. It argued that the â€œmiracleâ€� rested on two features dear to Republican heartsâ€”â€œempowering consumers and fostering competitionâ€�. Some of the more vocal Brexiteers dream of turning Britain into â€œSingapore-on-Thamesâ€�: a low-tax, lightly regulated haven for businesses eager to trade with Europe. Like the proverbial blind men describing an elephant by feeling just one part of the beast, each of these admirers gets something right about Singapore, but all miss the big picture.
              </p><p>
              American conservatives, for their part, are right that Singaporeâ€™s health-care system achieves fine results by emphasising personal responsibility, competition and low public spending. Singaporeans pay for much of their health care out of their own pockets and enjoy among the worldâ€™s highest life expectancies and lowest infant-mortality rates. The country spends just 5% of GDP on health care, of which about 2% of GDP comes from the public purse. America spends much more, 17% and 8% of GDP respectively, yet its population is much less healthy.
              </p><p>
              However, Singaporeâ€™s system also features far more coercion and government intervention than Americans would plausibly accept. Most hospitals are state-run. Most hospices and nursing homes are private but government-funded. The government heavily subsidises acute care. It promotes competition by publishing hospital bills; American health-care providers, by contrast, make their prices as opaque as possible to discourage shopping around. The government compels Singaporeans to divert up to 10.5% of their wages into â€œMedisaveâ€� accounts (employers contribute, too). It also subsidises â€œcost-effective and essentialâ€� drugs; unapproved drugs, if available, can be prohibitively expensive.
              </p><p>
              Both the left and the right will find much to like about Singaporeâ€™s health-care system. But anyone who thought that Michelle Obama urging children to eat more apples was too nannyish will find it hard to stomach. As Kishore Mahbubani of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy puts it: â€œThe ideology guiding Lee Kuan Yew was not Ayn Rand.â€�
              </p><p>
              A similar patternâ€”personal responsibility supported by coercion and a lean but robust safety netâ€”applies across Singaporeâ€™s economy. More than 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes, but most are government-built flats bought at government-set prices, often with government-provided grants. Where Singaporeans can live depends in part on their ethnicity: to avoid racial ghettos, Singapore requires the composition of public-housing blocks to reflect the countryâ€™s racial make-up.
              </p><p>Such social engineering would appal Western voters and be struck down by Western courts. Yet Singaporeans accept it. Paternalism has enforced racial calm. The countryâ€™s Chinese majority has been spared the atrocities visited on the Chinese diaspora in, say, Malaysia and Indonesia. More important, the trade-off that Lee Kuan Yew offered still holds: illiberal politics in exchange for good government and high living standards.
              </p><p>
              Singaporeâ€™s leaders vigorously defend their reputations with defamation suits, and gerrymander constituencies to help preserve the ruling partyâ€™s majority. But they deliver safe streets, first-rate health care, good public transport and a clean, responsive public administration. In distorted form, elections allow voters to affect policy: after the ruling party suffered its worst-ever performance in 2011, winning â€œjustâ€� 60% of the vote, it took a more populist line and won resoundingly four years later.
              </p><p>
              Leeâ€™s bargain is hard to emulate. Both parts have been essential to Singaporeâ€™s success. Yet admirers such as Mr Duterte and Hun Sen, Cambodiaâ€™s strongman, are adept only at the authoritarian bit, without the clean government or wealth creation. Singaporeâ€™s rich-world admirers, meanwhile, lack the tame politics that allow Singaporeâ€™s rulers to set policy without worrying too much about the next electionâ€”or their citizensâ€™ civil liberties.
