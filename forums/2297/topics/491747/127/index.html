              Very cool plot twist. The entire story / game / movie, you're fighting against an alien invasion, killing as many aliens as you can. Only at the end of the story, do you find out you're actually a captured alien invader implanted with false human memories and identity as part of the cunning human war strategy against the alien invasion.

              Director Guy Ritchie felt King Arthur star Charlie Hunnam wasn't muscular enough for the role (he had to lose a lot of weight for the last drama series he acted in), and repeatedly asked him about his weight.<p>
                  Hunnam became impatient with Ritchie, "<i>Bro, do you want to ask me about my size one more time? You know what, stop the camera (it was in the middle of the audition) because I'm starting to lose my temper.</i>"</p><p>Knowing that Cavill (Superman), 34, and Courtney, 31, were both being considered for the role too, he said: <i>"Tell you what, I'll fight them both at the same time for the role and we'll see what's up with the fucking physicality!</i>"</p><p>
                  And Ritchie backed off, "<i>All right, calm down, mate.</i>" and gave Hunnam the role.

A single hammer blow to the head can easily crack open a human skull, let alone 4 blows. The 61 year old perpetrator must have been really weak, fortunately for the woman.

Nonetheless, low dose caffeine is helpful, eg. significantly enhances the anti-headache and anti-migraine effects of panadol and/or aspirin.<p>But caffeine aside, energy drinks are seriously unhealthy, containing dangerously high doses of many questionable ingredients other than caffeine. I recommend you go for isotonic drinks or <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=coconut+juice+brand+reviews+singapore">coconut juice</a> instead of energy drinks, if you're looking for a healthier alternative to soft drinks (which ironically, is still healthier than energy drinks).</p><p>Coca Cola (always go for original flavor, 'less sugar' or 'no sugar' = artificial sweeteners, way unhealthier than sugar) is actually healthier than Mountain Dew, which is somewhere between a soft drink and an energy drink.</p><p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/us-teen-dies-caffeine-overdose-004737947.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/us-teen-dies-caffeine-overdose-004737947.html</a></p></div>

              It's pretty amazing how the Singapore Police solved this case. The knife used was thrown away almost 1km away from the scene of the rape. Yet police dogs were able to sniff it out in the dense forest, and on the knife a fingerprint was retrieved, and thanks to the database of fingerprints of all foreign workers, the suspect was identified. He's now pleading innocence, which is possible only if he was framed using his fingerprints / knife, but he's not even bothering to go down this route of argument. Also, forced oral sex is always risky, if the victim is angry enough, she could bite it off in revenge, unless he kept a knife to her throat throughout.<p>

                      </p><p>More on the Biology, Chemistry and Medicine of HAMLET (Human Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumour cells)</p><p><i>Endogenous human alpha-lactalbumin is complexed with a calcium ion and serves as a cofactor in lactose synthesis, but has no tumoricidal properties. The alpha-lactalbumin must be partially unfolded to allow for release of the calcium ion and replacement with an oleic acid molecule. The partially folded conformation is essential to the cytotoxicity of HAMLET, as mutagenesis studies have shown that completely unfolded alpha-lacalbumin does not retain the functional properties of HAMLET. The oleic acid is necessary for stabilizing this molecule in this partially unfolded state. 
              
              </i></p><p><i>HAMLET carries out independent attacks on many distinct cell organelles, including mitochondria, proteasomes, and histones, and interferes with cell processes such as macroautophagy. It has been shown that HAMLET binds to the cell surface and rapidly invades cells, with tumor cells taking up far more protein than healthy, differentiated cells. The mechanism of its entry is poorly understood, but recent studies indicate that the oleic acid in the HAMLET complex interacts with phosphatidylserine and o-glycosylated mucin on the plasma membrane, both of which are expressed in greater amounts on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, possibly providing for HAMLETâ€™s specificity.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  One of the most prominent targets of HAMLET once inside the cell is the mitochondrion. Electron microscopy has revealed physical damage to the mitochondrial membranes and assays have found cytochrome c release and activation of the caspase cascade, the most notable ones being caspases 2, 3, and 9. It is interesting to note that cell death is not prevented by caspase inhibitors, or by BCL-2 or p53 mutagenesis, indicating that the traditional apoptotic caspase cascade is not the ultimate cause of cell death.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Another target of HAMLET is the proteasome. 26S proteasomes are activated in response to large quantities of unfolded HAMLET protein in the cytoplasm, but degradation of HAMLET by the proteasome is unusually slow. Furthermore, in vitro studies have shown that HAMLET is capable of binding the catalytic 20S subunit of the proteasome and disabling its enzymatic activity, an effect that has never before been demonstrated for any protein. However, proteasome inhibition alone does not seem to be responsible for HAMLET-induced cell death, as proteasome inhibitors have been shown to reduce the cytotoxicity of HAMLET.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  HAMLET also targets the nucleus, where it interacts with histones to interfere with transcriptional processes. Studies have shown that HAMLET is mostly localized to the nucleus within one hour of invading a tumor cell. Hamlet has been shown to bind with high affinity to individual histone proteins, to be specific H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, as well as entire nucleosomal units. This interaction irreversibly blocks transcription and leads to activation of p53. This process has been demonstrated to be similar to histone hyperacetylation and it was found that histone de-acetylase inhibitors potentiated the effects of HAMLET.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  HAMLET cells showed the physiological characteristics of macroautophagy, a process in which cellular components are sequestered in double membrane-bound vesicles that fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Cells also showed decreased levels of mTOR, a known inhibitor of macroautophagy. HAMLET cells and cells under conditions of amino acid starvation (a known initiator of macroautophagy) showed similar expression patterns of autophagocytotic proteins and responded equally well to addition of macroautophagy inhibitors.</i></p><p>
