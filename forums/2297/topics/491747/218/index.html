              [USA] - An innocent and unarmed man was shot dead by police Thursday after a <b><span style="font-size: 18px">"swatting" prank</span></b> led authorities to a home in Kansas, officials say.<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">A feud between two Call of Duty game players sparked the hoax call. </span></b>However, the address given to police led them to the doorstep of 28-year-old Andrew Finch, who was not part of the online gaming community, police say.<br>
              <br>
              "Due to the actions of a prankster, we have an innocent victim," Wichita police Deputy Chief Troy Livingston said during a press conference Friday.<br>
              <br>
              Officers responded to a report of a<b><span style="font-size: 18px"> gunman holding his mother, brother and sister hostage after shooting his father in the head </span></b>Thursday night, Livingston said.<br>
              <br>
              "That was the information we were working off of," he told the Wichita Eagle.<br>
              <br>
              More: Dangerous 'swatting' prank terrorizes gamer's family<br>
              <br>
              Livingston added that authorities "got into position" when they arrived at the home, ready for a hostage situation.<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">The 28-year-old, identified by his family as Andrew Finch,</span></b> went to the door to see what was going on, the Eagle reported.<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">"As he came to the door, one of our officers discharged his weapon," Livingston said.</span></b><br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">Officers had instructed Finch to put his hands up, but he lowered them several times, </span></b>Livingston said. One officer then took a shot because he "feared for officer's safety," Livingston said.<br>
              <br>
              The father of two was taken to a hospital. He later died.<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">Police said he was unarmed.</span></b><br>
              <br>
              Officers soon learned that no one in the house had a gunshot wound and that there wasnâ€™t a hostage situation.<br>
              <br>
              "What gives the cops the right to open fire?" Finch's mother asked the <i>Wichita Eagle</i>. <b><span style="font-size: 18px">â€œWhy didnâ€™t they give him the same warning they gave us? That cop murdered my son over a false report.â€�</span></b><br>
              <br>
              More than a dozen gamers told the <i>Eagle </i>that a feud between two Call of Duty players sparked the swatting call.<br>
              <br>
              The gamers were arguing when one threatened to target the other. The intended target gave the other gamer a "fake" address, according to Twitter posts.<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 18px">"We believe this case is an act of swatting</span></b>," Livingston confirmed Friday.<br>
              <br>
              Several social media users placed blame on one gamer, who tweeted about the incident.<br>
              <br>
              "I DIDNT GET ANYONE KILLED BECAUSE I DIDNT DISCHARGE A WEAPON AND BEING A SWAT MEMBER ISNT MY PROFESSION," the gamer tweeted. The account was suspended overnight.<br>
              <br>
              Finch's family believes whoever made the call should be held accountable.<br>
              <br>
              "The person who made the phone call took my nephew, her son, two kidsâ€™ father," the victimâ€™s aunt, Lorrie Hernandez-Caballero told the <i>Wichita Eagle</i>. "How does it feel to be a murderer? I canâ€™t believe people do this on purpose."<br>
              <br>
              <b><span style="font-size: 22px">Swatting is a prank where someone calls authorities to report a fake emergency â€” often a hostage situation or active shooter â€” with the intent of drawing a "SWAT team" response to a location.</span></b><br>
              <br>
              The dangerous prank has become popular nationwide among gamers, who<b><span style="font-size: 18px"> use caller ID spoofing or other techniques to disguise their phone numbers,</span></b> according to 911.gov.<br>
              <br>
              "Without that false phone call we wouldn't have been there," Livingston said.<br>
              <br>
              The officer who shot and killed Finch was identified as a veteran of more than 7 years with the police department. He was be placed on administrative paid leave pending investigation.<br>
              <br>
              No arrests have been made so far.<br>

              'e' commented : <i>Focus on quality and hygiene? What nonsense is the fat kimchi talking about... One of the border guards that fled to south korea had tons of worms and parasites in his large intestine! And that is from eating worm infested vegetables that lay eggs onto your intestine and brain. Good luck eating those kimchi </i><p>

              PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) â€” Kim Jong Un wants to turn the art of kimchi-making into a science. And the North Korean leader is putting his money where his mouth is.
              </p><p>
              On the outskirts of Pyongyang, surrounded by snow-covered farms and greenhouses, stands one of Kim's latest pet projects, the Ryugyong Kimchi Factory, which produces 4,200 tons of the iconic Korean pickled vegetable dish a year. The shiny new facility replaces an older factory and opened in June last year after getting Kim's final seal of approval, according to manager Paek Mi Hye.
              </p><p>
              The factory is intended to showcase Kim's efforts to boost North Korea's domestic economy and produce more, and better, consumer products. His strategy, known as "byungjin," aims to simultaneously develop the national economy and North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

              North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, during his national New Year's address, warned the United States that the nuclear button is always on his desk.

              "The entire mainland of the USA is within the range of our nuclear weapons and the nuclear button is always on the desk of my office. They should accurately be aware that this is not a threat but a reality," he said, according to a CNN translation of his speech.
              </p><p>
               He also declared that his country is "a responsible nuclear nation that loves peace" and told his citizens that "the US cannot wage a war" against it.
              </p><p>
               "As long as there's no aggression against us, we do not intend to use nuclear powers," Kim added.

              [Medical] - Medical Doctor David Gorski angrily disagrees with Biochemistry Professor Christopher Exley on Whether the Aluminium in Vaccines causes Autism<p>
                  <a href="https://respectfulinsolence.com/2017/11/29/christopher-exley-using-bad-science-to-demonize-aluminum-adjuvants-in-vaccines/">https://respectfulinsolence.com/2017/11/29/christopher-exley-using-bad-science-to-demonize-aluminum-adjuvants-in-vaccines/</a>

                  There is no simple right and wrong. Both make valid points. There is increasing medical evidence that aluminium contributes to brain damage. What Dr David Gorski disagrees with, is whether the aluminium in vaccines is a significant source of aluminium toxicity (since some argue that aluminium exposure from foods and environment, is even worse than from vaccines), and therefore whether the risks of vaccinations outweigh the rewards.
