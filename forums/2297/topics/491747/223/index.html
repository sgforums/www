              Why would anyone want to, or bear to, so excruciatingly permanently ruin his/her own face, using concentrated strong acids? He/she could very easily have become permanently blind. The police may have their reasons for being certain she was lying, but it's still unbelievable anyone could do this to themselves. Suspicious.<p>

              The court heard that on 31 August last year, Tan was at a coffeeshop at Block 418 Yishun Avenue 11 with a male friend. She had earlier been at the State Courts to file a complaint against her former employer for allegedly unfairly terminating her.
              <p>
              At the coffeeshop, Tan slammed a stack of documents she was carrying onto a table, sparking a dispute with a female patron who was also seated there.
              </p><p>
              Later, while Tan was on a phone call, she began to bang the table and shout. The other patrons asked her to keep quiet but she refused.
              </p><p>
              Tanâ€™s friend tried to take her somewhere else to finish her phone call but she shouted at him and refused to comply. More patrons then asked her to leave the coffeeshop.
              </p><p>
                      A patron near Tan then called the police, saying that he saw that Tan had a â€œswordâ€� on the table, and that she was behaving aggressively. When the police arrived, they discovered that the â€œswordâ€� was a toy with LED lights â€“ an item Tan had been planning to sell.
                      </p><p>

                      </p><p>
                      As Tan was attracting a lot of attention at the coffeeshop, the police asked her to go to a void deck at Block 419 Yishun Avenue 11. She was then told that she would be placed under arrest for causing public nuisance.
                      </p><p>
                      Tan became agitated, thinking that she was going to be arrested over a toy sword. She refused to cooperate when the police wanted to handcuff her and put up a violent struggle, prompting officers to wrestle her to the ground in order to arrest her.
                      </p><p>
                      Even after being restrained, Tan refused to follow the officers to their police vehicle. The officers had to carry her by her arms and legs to the vehicle while she screamed and hurled vulgarities at them.
                      </p><p>
                      Tan also refused to enter the vehicle, and dared police officers to break her legs if they wanted to get her inside it. Officers resorted to lifting her by her arms and legs in order to place her in the vehicle. Tan then placed her left leg outside the passenger door of the car to prevent officers from closing it.
                      </p><p>
                      When Sergeant Lim Sui Ling tried to move Tanâ€™s leg into the vehicle, Tan kicked her on her left hand. Tan then tried to manoeuvre herself out of the vehicle and head-butted Sergeant Lim in the process.

              District police chief Abhishek Garg said the dead 15-year-old girl had sustained terrible internal injuries suggesting the attackers had used blunt objects violently inside her during the gang rape.<p>
              Just hours after the grisly discovery, police in Panipat district on Saturday found the body of a 12-year-old girl in a pond. Panipat police chief Rahul Sharma told AFP that two men, both neighbours of the victim, had been arrested over the crime. Both had confessed to luring the girl to their house before raping and killing her, Mr Sharma said.</p><p>
              Apparently, they were hoping to push the blame for their crime, onto the perpetrators of the earlier gang rape and murder, who are still at large. It is even possible they only decided to carry out their crime on their 12-year-old girl neighbour, after hearing news of the earlier gang rape and murder, thinking it would be a fantastic opportunity to carry out the rape and murder, and get away with it.

               nobody give a hoot about pinky or sinking land. Not relevant anymore. Hate to imagine how kee chiu as PM will bring sinking land further down the drain.

              The horrific gang rape of a 15-year-old girl has shocked India after it was revealed she suffered a ruptured liver and lungs as her aggressors took turns raping and mutilating her.
              </p><p>
               The lower-class Dalit child from the northern Indian state of Haryana went missing on Tuesday after she left home for school.
              </p><p>
               She was found dead on Saturday with 19 serious injuries to her body - which police say indicate she was tortured.
              </p><p>
               'At least four men are suspected to be behind the crime,' said district police chief Abhishek Garg.
              </p><p>
               'A massive search is underway to arrest the perpetrators', he added.
              </p><p>
               Her liver and lungs had been ruptured and an object had been jammed into her genitalia, doctors said.
              </p><p>
               The school girl's half-naked body was found near a canal about 100 kilometres away from her home near the city of Kurukshetra.
              </p><p>
               She was discovered wrapped in a torn shirt with wounds on her face, neck, lips and chest.

                  As many as three or four times a week, the serial vomiter or vomiters would hurl at random places, leaving residents reeling from the stench.

              </p><p>
              Authorities said they were alerted after a 17-year-old girl managed to escape the house on Sunday and call police using a mobile phone she had found.
              </p><p>
              She was so emaciated and malnourished that police officers said they initially thought she was just 10 years old.

              The 13 siblings discovered at the house in Perris ranged in age from two to 29, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.
              </p><p>
              Their parents - 57-year-old David Allen Turpin and 49-year-old Louise Anna Turpin - were arrested on torture and child endangerment charges, with bail set at $9 million.
