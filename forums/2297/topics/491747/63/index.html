              <i>Politics yo. These Chinese tycoons are smart enough to know what's good for their own self-survival.</i><p>After Chinese philanthropist Huang Rulun, President Duterte is pleased that Filipino-Chinese businessmen such as Megaworldâ€™s Andrew Tan, Philippine Airlinesâ€™ Lucio Tan and San Miguel Corp.â€™s Ramon Ang have expressed willingness to help the administration in building rehabilitation centers for drug addicts.
              </p><p>
              â€œLet me just mention him in passing because he has my endearing love and gratitude. He was a Chinese guy, Huang Rulun,â€� he said, citing Huangâ€™s contribution to finance the construction of the first Mega-Drug Rehabilitation and Treatment Facility inside Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija.
              </p><p>
              Duterte said the â€œbeautifulâ€� facility turned out to be good for â€œ10,000 people.â€�
              </p><p>
              Other Filipino business tycoons have pledged to build a facility in Mindanao, Duterte said.
              </p><p>
              â€œSo, one after another, Megaworld and the rest of the guys, Chinese Federation and Ramon Ang also promised to put up a P2-billion facility or another one maybe in Mindanao,â€� Duterte said in a speech before volunteers in Angeles City in Pampanga on Thursday.

              <i>FrenchBriefs posted :</i> <p>this guy is a coward,if he truly believe in singapore's democracy and whatnot,and was a true rebel he would be staying on in this country to fight the oppression and those in power with every inch of his will and life,he would be setting himself on fire in front of the istana gates,did martin luther king or ghandi or nelson mandela run away when the persecution and backlash got too serious?nelson mandela endured 7 years of solitary confinement in the worst conditions,nearly going mad and talking to ants.did he give up at any point in time?he simply took the burden square on his shoulders one day at a time,did lim bo seng run away to the safety of america where he could critique and attack the jap from a distance while his brothers and fellow men suffered under the japs and slaughter 80,000 of our fellow singaporean chinks?did he hide in plain sight as a translator like a coward and was later praised and made examplar for it?no he fought the japanese oppression every step of the way till his capture and death.what about che guevara and jose mujica and many of the communist heros?did any of these guys took donation money or war funds and went off gallavating around the world,and using youtube as a medium of attention seeking and personal glorification and finally claimed to be a victim of political persecution in order to shirk his ns liabilities and cried and whine like a baby in his all letters whenever he had to face jail or the police or beg for more funds.</p><p>
              
               no i dont blame him,hes just a kid after all,cowardly and self centered and highly manipulative but not stupid.he represents the sickness of singapore,the hopes and pipedreams of a delusional and powerless and paralyzed people that could do nothing to save themselves not even vote properly in 2015.</p><p>
              
               how is the government actively persecuting him?they are merely responding to what he is doing nothing more,u dont stick ur hand into the wasp's nest and expect not to be stung.for every action theres a equal and opposing reaction,u dont expect the government to simply close one eye and do nothing?oh sure maybe the government has overreacted and mishandled the event....still this is singapore,this is not a place where we can go about saying anything on ur mind and criticise anything as much as we wished it could be.if we allowed people to say whatever they like and criticise any race or religion they like soon the whole country will degenerate into a israeli like situation,singapore will break down into different camps,soon we will be like malaysia where people are allowed to openly discriminate and attack,where people are allowed to don different coloured shirts and march,civil war might even break out and hate crimes flourish and maybe even terror attacks.we live in a fragile peace and compromise,something the americans and europeans and no idea about with their decades of warmongering and racial wars and the fact most of them lived in homogenious cultures for centuries.
              </p><p>
               its alright grant this guy his wish,singapore doesnt need anymore heros that could truly change the course and fate of history like tan kah kee or lim bo seng,just another coward to add to the sea of cowards we already have here.let him have a good life in the land of freedom of speech,just need to tone down the islamic rhetoric abit incase he catches a bullet in the head in another </p><p>

              Skill!!! Although you're not advised to try this yourself, because when both of you fall on your heads, the motorcyclist thief has a helmet to protect his head, while you don't. The hero in the gif has enough martial arts training to fall without cracking his skull (notice he arches his back and stretches out his hands when falling so he doesn't land on his head).<p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ezgif.com-0f64c24374.gif"></p><p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2016/12/chinese-truck-driver-delivers-flying-kick-of-justice-to-mobile-phone-thief-escaping-on-scooter/">http://mothership.sg/2016/12/chinese-truck-driver-delivers-flying-kick-of-justice-to-mobile-phone-thief-escaping-on-scooter/</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Malaysia] - Christmas Eve bus crash kills 14 Malaysians and Singaporeans.<p>I'll tell you whose fault it is. Unethical greedy employers who overwork and underpay their employees. When a driver of any vehicle (eg. plane, bus, etc) is overworked and sleep deprived, his passengers are the innocent victims of the unethical employer's greed, should the vehicle crash as a result of the driver's sleep deprivation, as is with the case of the Muar bus crash.</p><p>If all landlords, bosses and employers were more ethical to their employees, it would benefit all levels of society. Mark Lee once lamented that he can't afford to hire Singaporeans (whose pay includes mandatory CPF contributions by the employer) for his Old Town White Coffee outlets (franchised from Malaysian owners), because his rentals are so steep he struggles just to break even. Same with George Quek (BreadTalk, ToastBox, Food Republic, Din Tai Fung), etc. Unethical greedy REITS, MNCs and bankers ensure the elite rich keep getting richer, while the masses keep gettig poorer.</p><p><a href="http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/vacation-turned-tragedy-family-muar-bus-crash-0">http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/vacation-turned-tragedy-family-muar-bus-crash-0</a></p><p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/christmas-eve-bus-crash-muar-victims-recount-ordeal">http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/christmas-eve-bus-crash-muar-victims-recount-ordeal</a></p><p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/muar-bus-crash-victims-buried-side-side-choa-chu-kang-cemetery">http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/muar-bus-crash-victims-buried-side-side-choa-chu-kang-cemetery</a></p><p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-bus-crash-call-for-mandatory-seat-belt-night-travel-ban/3393918.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-bus-crash-call-for-mandatory-seat-belt-night-travel-ban/3393918.html</a></p></div>
