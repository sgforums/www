              [China] - A tragic story has sparked outrage across the Chinese internet today of a heavily pregnant woman who jumped to her death from a hospital window after her family-in-law repeatedly refused to allow her to have a cesarean section.
              <p>
              
               The 26-year-old woman, surnamed Ma, arrived at the maternity ward of a hospital in Yulin, Shaanxi province last Wednesday, already more than 41 weeks pregnant. According to a statement from the hospital, published by China Business News, doctors examined Ma and found that the fetal head was very large, meaning that a vaginal delivery would likely be risky. Therefore, they recommended a C-section.
              </p><p>
              
               However, Ma's family-in-law insisted on a natural birth, refusing to give their permission for a cesarean. In China, family members must give consent before a patient undergoes surgery, so the doctors' hands were tied. They repeatedly tried to get the family-in-law to grant permission for the operation, but to no avail.
              </p><p>
              
               On Thursday, Ma herself even walked out of the maternity ward two times to plead with her family-in-law members, explaining to them that the pain was becoming just too much for her to bear. Still, the family-in-law refused to relent.
              </p><p>
              
               Then, at around 8 p.m. that night Ma fell from a fifth-floor window of the ward, killing herself and her fetus. Police have ruled that it was a suicide.
              </p><p>
              
               The report fails to explain why Ma's family-in-law was so against her having a cesarean. In the past, China has been criticized for its soaring C-section rates, though a recent study found that rates are lower than previously reported with around 35% of Chinese babies delivered by cesarean rather than vaginal birth, about the same percentage as in the United States.
              </p><p>
              
               On Chinese social media, the story has been widely shared, sparking anger and calls for reform. "Besides the pregnant woman, there's no need to ask anyone else their opinion," reads one Weibo comment with more than 40,000 likes. "A married woman is not some tool for producing babies, how can people still be so ignorant these days!" reads another comment. Meanwhile, others have called for the family-in-law to face punishment for their refusals.

              Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules.
              </p><p>
              But thatâ€™s not what the action that the White House took today is about. This is about young people who grew up in America â€“ kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea theyâ€™re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driverâ€™s license.
              </p><p>
              Over the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people â€“ our young people â€“ that if your parents brought you here as a child, if youâ€™ve been here a certain number of years, and if youâ€™re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then youâ€™ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship. And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill.
              </p><p>
              That bill never came. And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country. We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm. Deportations of criminals went up. Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks. And America grew stronger as a result.
              </p><p>
              But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong â€“ because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating â€“ because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. What if our kidâ€™s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesnâ€™t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?
              </p><p>
              Letâ€™s be clear: the action taken today isnâ€™t required legally. Itâ€™s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldnâ€™t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kidâ€™s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out wonâ€™t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyoneâ€™s taxes, or raise anybodyâ€™s wages.
              </p><p>
              It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today. And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, itâ€™s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future. Iâ€™m heartened by those whoâ€™ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.
              </p><p>
              Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way weâ€™d want our own kids to be treated. Itâ€™s about who we are as a people â€“ and who we want to be.
              </p><p>
               What makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals â€“ that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. Thatâ€™s how America has traveled this far. Thatâ€™s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union.

              Torturing Human Babies In The Name Of Scientific Research
              <p>
              <i>In The Spanish Journal Of Psychology, the researchers described laboratory studies in which infants were subjected to various unpleasant procedures known to elicit different emotional states.
              </i></p><p><i>
              The resulting cries were videotaped and analysed.
              </i></p><p><i>
              To provoke anger from the babies, the investigators pinned down the babies' hands or feet and prevented them from moving.</i></p><p><i>To arouse fear in the babies, the researchers clapped their hands very loudly and suddenly in the babies' faces.</i></p><p><i>A cry of pain followed the "needle vaccinations", according to the study.
              </i></p><p><i>
              Prof Choliz found that angry babies tended to keep their eyes half closed, gazing off to the side as they cried. They steadily amped up the volume of vocalised umbrage. Frightened babies, after an initial hesitation and tensing up of the facial muscles, emitted an explosive cry and kept their eyes open and searching the whole time.
              </i></p><p><i>
              Babies pained by a needle prick cried out immediately, at full force, and squeezed their eyes shut. They maintained that expression and volume for the entire crying bout.
              </i></p><p><i>
              The take-home message for parents: If you happen to drop a heavy object loudly on the floor while the paediatrician is pinning down your struggling baby for a needle shot, your child will be in trauma therapy for life.
              </i></p><p>

              [Singapore] - It's not so much about the girlfriend being materialistic, it's more about the boyfriend lying to her, and thinking that he needed to lie to her over such an issue. While different people will disagree on who is more at fault, what is obvious is that such a relationship cannot survive marriage.
