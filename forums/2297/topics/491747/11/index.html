The overzealous fan was also subdued by security and later arrested by the police. A representative of the production had since shared Crystal's condition, saying that the actress was not injured apart from a few bloody scrapes on her arms and legs. The rep, however, admitted that Crystal was emotionally traumatized by the incident. The Guangxi man reportedly told the production team that he was excited upon seeing Crystal on stage, and he "only wanted to become her friend".<p><a href="https://sg.celebrity.yahoo.com/post/144796172039/overzealous-fan-arrested-for-attacking-crystal-liu">https://sg.celebrity.yahoo.com/post/144796172039/overzealous-fan-arrested-for-attacking-crystal-liu</a></p></div>

              A man who wishes to remain anonymous took a selfie with a Darth Vader display at a Target in Australia; he and his kids love Star Wars. When he took the photo, he spoke to some children nearby and told them what he was doing, according to the Knox Leader. That's when the mother of the children saw the interaction, followed the man outside of the store, took a picture of him, and shared on Facebook what she thought had happened â€” a pedophile inappropriately speaking with her children and taking pictures. 
              <p>
              The Facebook post called the man a "creep" and detailed the actions the mother took to protect her children, including alerting the police and security at the store. Until deletion, the story had been shared over 20,000 times. After being told by his friends about the post and photo, the man went to the police and cleared his name â€” but not before receiving death threats and dealing with repercussions that affected his family and children. The mother, who also wishes to remain anonymous, has since deleted the post and apologized, but is now receiving death threats herself for sparking a mob against the man. </p><p><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/tech/Father-Accused-Being-Pedophile-After-Darth-Vader-Selfie-37458133">http://www.popsugar.com/tech/Father-Accused-Being-Pedophile-After-Darth-Vader-Selfie-37458133</a>

              SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH), National Environment Agency (NEA), Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and Singaporeâ€™s national water agency (PUB) are jointly investigating a surge of patients with gastroenteritis in the Owen Road area, they announced on Tuesday (May 24).
              <p>
               As of May 23, more than 180 cases have been reported, the agencies said in a joint press release. Investigation into the possible source has not concluded; however, as a precautionary measure, NEA will close Pek Kio Market and Food Centre for a thorough cleaning and disinfection from May 25 and 26. The market will re-open on May 27.
               On May 19, MOH was alerted by a general practitioner at Owen Road that the clinic had seen an unusual increase in the number of cases of gastroenteritis since May 16. Further investigations found that other clinics in the area had experienced a similar increase. In all, more than 180 cases had sought medical treatment for symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain in the past week. The cases typically recovered within a few days. There were seven patients who are warded at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for observation. All of them are recovering well, the agencies said.
              </p><p>
               NEA, MOH, AVA and PUB said they had commenced investigations into the cause immediately on May 19, including collecting food and environmental samples from food outlets in the Owen Road area, as well as interviewing affected cases and screening stool samples from the affected cases. Their investigations found that the majority of the cases stayed near or visited the Owen Road area.</p><p>
               Many of them had also patronised the Pek Kio Market and Food Centre, although the investigations did not identify any specific food stall that could be the source of the reported cases.</p><p>
              Stool samples collected from cases tested positive for Rotavirus, which causes gastric flu.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>She's only 36 years old this year, and earned approx $30k per month for the last 15 years. She should easily have enough money to retire for the rest of her life. It's ridiculous (and disrespectful to the majority of Singaporeans who earn an average of $2k a month) that she's feeling depressed now for being unemployed. Many more of such overpaid bankers complaining on Transitioning.org. The dichotomy is disgusting : genuinely dead-broke unemployed Singaporeans with family burdens, alongside undeservedly overpaid rich bankers recently retrenched, both groups crying for help alongside each other on Transitioning.org.<p><a href="http://www.transitioning.org/2016/02/18/36-year-old-banker-who-used-to-earn-300000-to-400000-per-annum-frustrated-at-labour-policies/">http://www.transitioning.org/2016/02/18/36-year-old-banker-who-used-to-earn-300000-to-400000-per-annum-frustrated-at-labour-policies/</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Australian girl shares 10 reasons why she loves to live in Singapore. She correctly points out that Singapore might be the only country in the entire world where you needn't fear for your life when walking alone at night. In fact, she says Singapore is the only country in the world (she's a globe trotter) in which, for the entire duration of her stay in Singapore, she has never once felt her life to be in danger, unlike in every other country in the world that she's been too.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43a1jtwaRHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43a1jtwaRHI</a></p></div>
