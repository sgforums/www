            <div class='col-md body'>Even Obama is totally pissed off at Netanyahu over the Israeli settlements in Palestine. Trump doesn't care about either the Palestinians or the Israelis, he only cares about himself.

              <i>Scroobal posted :</i> <p>Heard that his lawyer is a specialist, well regarded and well connected and she is doing it for free. The NGO is also highly influential in the States. Apparently he was well briefed and told specifically to land in Chicago and interestingly the lawyer is based close to Washington and the NGO in NY with nothing in Chicago. 
              </p><p>
               It is also believed that without Amos' knowledge and for the build of his case and for his own good, the NGO anonymously tipped off the authorities of his arrival. On arrival he was escorted to an interview room and his phone and documents searched. 
              </p><p>
               The reason for the tip-off is based on the notion that Amos in temporary detention helps to drive much needed publicity and to socialise his plight as persecuted victim with the local authorities. He turning up and comfortably accommodated with friends and contact and then applying for asylum does not generate much publicity. Already no less than the NY Times has interviewed Amos and the article is highly favourable to his cause. He has expressed regret for some of his past postings. 
              </p><p>
               I also heard that Melissa Chen and her NGO ( not the NGO that is handling his case) which is an anti-religious body is being used as convenient conduit but has no clue what is happening behind the scenes. 
              </p><p>
               The speculation is that Chicago was chosen as there are favourable contacts whose case roster is known.

               Looks like his chances are much better than the rest of the thousand of cases lodged with the US authorities. </p>

              [Pakistan] - Child brides routinely given away as part of deals between families, the girl has no say in the matter.

They can't be left at home alone for fear of sexual activity â€” or even more unacceptable, if the daughter leaves home with a boyfriend of her own choice. "That would be a shame for the entire family. We would have no honor. No. When they reach puberty quickly, we have to arrange to marry them away," she says. "Daughters are a burden, but the sons, they are the owners of the house."
