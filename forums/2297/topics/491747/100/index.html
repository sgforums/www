              This illustrates why I've often stated that absolute morality (simplistic right vs wrong) doesn't exist, it is but a naÃ¯ve fool's delusion, for there is only ethics, cosmoethics and karma, which exists for all actions without judgement.<p>Today's episode of <a href="http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=456&amp;t=22832&amp;sid=2cc0dd529416e9dcdc97aa8ab498cf89">Madam Secretary Season 1 Episode 6</a> :<br><a href="http://africansuntimes.com/2014/10/cbss-madam-secretary-republic-west-africa-au-african-union/">http://africansuntimes.com/2014/10/cbss-madam-secretary-republic-west-africa-au-african-union/</a></p><p> Today's episode's ethical dilemma (happens every episode, that's what this job, and the job of every president and prime ministers is about), involves a fictitious African country in which the ruling junta government is about to commit mass genocide against a particular (fictitious) ethnic minority known as the 'Beko' (there are thousands of different African ethnic races, even if outsiders callously lump them all as 'Africans' based on their skin color).</p><p>A Beko African Christian Priest (who was once the teacher of Madam Secretary's husband decades ago) uses her husband as an unofficial channel to seek help from Madam Secretary, who informs the President of the matter, who declines to intervene militarily (always costly in more ways than one) in that country's internal affairs, as the US has little vital interests or assets in that country.</p><p>Her ethical dilemma then, is to risk her career (as Secretary of State) and go above the President's head (ie. without his consent) to make an impassioned plea to the United Nations, to take action save the 50,000 Beko Africans who are about to be murdered.</p><p>This works to convince not only some of the other countries in the UN (specifically France, as well as the the African Union a coalition of African countries machiam ASEAN but for Africa, to take military action and send their troops into the country), but even the US President himself (who is now willing to backup the operation with logistical support, but no ground troops).</p><p>But this is only midway through the episode, so of course this isn't the end of the story, and some cockup is gonna manifest promptly. Which turns out to be : the Beko African Christian Priest is revealed to be a drug smuggler, using his Beko refugees to cross borders to smuggle drugs to Europe. This revelation causes the French government to angrily pull out of the rescue operation.</p><p> Madam Secretary's husband angrily confronts the Priest, who defends himself, saying making such smuggling deals with the Drug Lords (who own their own private militaries and control the land routes which the refugees must take), is the only way to save his Beko people, allowing them to safely pass through the Drug Lords' territories.</p><p>Madam Secretary's husband says, "What about the millions of drug abusers around the world who will die from the drug trade?". The Priest says, "They willingly choose to take drugs, but my Beko people have no choice in their genocide."</p><p>In other words, the lesser of two evils, this is the only way to save his people, so even if it's immoral / unethical in some other way, but as far as saving lives, which is the highest moral / ethical priority and importance, and the Priest's holy duty, then all things considered, this is still the correct moral / ethical thing to do, the lesser of 2 evils, cutting deals with the Drug Lords to save lives.</p><p>But that's not all, things take a desperate turn when the CIA informs them the genocidal junta government has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Drug Lords, to use their private militaries to block the African Union troops sent in to protect the Beko people. Madam Secretary instructs the CIA to attempt to bribe the Drug Lords to release the blockade, but the CIA operative's "dead body just turned up on YouTube" (ie. killed by either the Drug Lords or the Junta Govt).</p><p>Madam Secretary and her husband discuss this desperate situation, and her husband reluctantly re-contacts the Priest (they earlier both parted on angry non-speaking terms), telling the Priest the US Govt will unofficially pay millions of dollars to the Drug Lords (and again, there you go, another example of the lesser of 2 evils moral / ethical dilemma, generously funding the evil Drug Cartel bad guys to help you against eviler and badder Genocidal Junta Government guys) through the Priest, to bribe the Drug Lords to release the blockade, to save the 50,000 Beko African people from mass genocide.</p><p>And it works (ie. money works, as always). The 50,000 Beko African people are saved, moved to tears and grateful to be alive, rescued from their extreme near-deaths.</p><p>While this was a fictitious episodal story, but such TV dramas (Madam Secretary is an excellent series, even Dr House featured <a href="http://house.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tyrant">such an episode involving ethical dilemma over whether to intervene in an upcoming mass genocide in Africa</a>, and the <a href="http://house.wikia.com/wiki/James_Earl_Jones">Darth Vader actor</a> was the genocidal president in this episode, and while Dr Cameron was the vocal one speaking out against the genocide and Dr Chase didn't initially want to get involved, in the end she didn't have the guts to assassinate Darth Vader, and it was Dr Chase who, upon realizing the mass genocide was really gonna happen, assassinated Darth Vader, and the KNN coconaden thing is, when Dr Cameron found out Dr Chase carried out the assassination / murder, she couldn't accept it and immediately divorced poor Dr Chase who fell into depression (from both the assassination and the divorce), even though he carried out the assassination / murder for the greater moral / ethical good to save hundreds of thousands of innocent lives, great episode from Dr House) and movies like these, are based on real-life historical accounts of mass genocides and the behind-the-curtains work of courageous people across agencies and countries that the public will never know of.

            <div class='col-md body'>[Animals] - When man's best friend turns foe<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/when-mans-best-friend-turns-foe">http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/when-mans-best-friend-turns-foe</a></p><p>Scientists travelling to the Himalayan highlands, the Gobi Desert and far beyond to study rare animals have returned with reports of dogs chasing and killing wildlife. One dog on the loose in New Zealand killed 500 endangered kiwis in six weeks. In Australia, three dogs killed 80 penguins in one night. And in Bhutan's premier national park, a third of the park's young takins - an elusive and beautiful goat-antelope - were lost to dogs. Globally, dogs have caused about 10 extinctions and continue to threaten another 150 species. In the United States alone, some 78,000 dogs roam habitats close to urban and suburban development. From marine shores and grasslands to woodlands and coniferous forests, dogs chase and attack wild birds and deer and terrorise native predators such as grey foxes and even pumas. Even the scent of a dog is enough to compel wildlife to flee and hide. The presence of dogs accelerates heartbeats in bighorn sheep and causes marmots to be more hesitant to re-emerge from their burrows. Some animals will abandon living in an area altogether if dogs visit frequently, forcing them to give up precious opportunities to feed and travel.</p></div>

              China helps Chinese overseas only when it is in its selfish interest to do so, says Indonesian-Singaporean scholar Leo Suryadinata (proficient in Chinese, Bahasa Indonesia and English) in his study of its policy in his new book. There are many stark examples of such poor form in his book, including the Khmer Rouge's 1975 slaughter of Chinese Cambodians; Vietnam's 1976 oppression of Chinese shopkeepers, which led many to flee the country as boat people; and Indonesia's anti- Chinese riots and mass rapes of thousands of Indonesian Chinese women in 1998.<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/china-blowing-hot-and-cold">http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/china-blowing-hot-and-cold</a>

              [Malaysia] - It's obviously the same group of perpetrators, the 'special forces abduction services for hire' behind Pastor Raymond Koh's abduction. Turns out that 4 months ago, they also abducted (using the exact same special forces modus operandi, 20 men in 5 vehicles intercepting the victim's vehicle in broad daylight) a Malaysian Malay man, Amri Che Mat, who was accused of being a Shia Muslim trying to convert Sunni Muslims to Shia Islam (Pastor Raymond Koh was abducted because he was accused of trying to convert Sunni Muslims to Christianity). Till today both men remain missing, and the Malaysian police say they have no leads and no clues. Amri Che Mat's abduction case, however, might be the breakthrough they need to solve Pastor Raymond Koh's case, because Amri Che Mat's wife say that shortly after the abduction, they heard from a man who claimed that his cousin was behind Amri Che Mat's abduction, and Amri Che Mat's wife did not believe the man until the man revealed the color of Amri Che Mat's slippers (it was an unusual color : orange) worn when he was abducted. The police did not or could not follow up on the mysterious man and/or his cousin, apparently.<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/perlis-social-activist-missing-for-4-months-after-abduction">http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/perlis-social-activist-missing-for-4-months-after-abduction</a></p><p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Amri+Che+Mat">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Amri+Che+Mat</a>
