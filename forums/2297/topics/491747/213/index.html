              Have you seen Xiong JingNan fight? She's no cuddly panda. She is ranked top 3 female MMA fighters in all of China. Next month's strawweight championship will definitely be Tiffany Teo's toughest fight she's ever had in her life.<p>
                  Guess who else is in strawweight? May Ooi.</p><p>
                  Guess who else has indicated she plans to switch category to strawweight soon? Angela Lee.
                  </p><p>
                  If it's Xiong JingNan versus Tiffany Teo versus May Ooi versus Angela Lee, 1 China fighter versus 3 Singapore fighters (of which 2 are Singaporeans), the fight for the strawweight championship would be strongly colored by nationalistic sentiments (if it comes down to China versus Singapore), or with more awkward sentiments and marketing limitations (if it comes down to Singapore versus Singapore).</p><p>As of now, China's Xiong JinNan has a significantly higher number of wins (and experience to go with it) to her name than each of the other 3 Singapore fighters, even if Angela and Tiffany are so far undefeated.</p>

              [Singapore] - Poor girl, she has no idea how dangerous (not to mention illegal) it is going at those high speeds and weaving between the cars on main roads. All it takes is a little bump or rock on the road, and those little wheels are going to be sent flying. Not to mention heavy vehicles with blind spots, cracking open her pretty little head.<p>

              <span style="font-size: 22px"><b>The cigar-shaped asteroid â€˜Oumuamua could be an alien probe with broken engines, top astronomer suggests</b></span><br>
              <br>
              Last year, the internet lit up after an astronomer suggested an â€˜alien megastructureâ€™ could be orbiting a distant star.<br>
              <br>
              Now the stargazer behind this extraordinary theory has put forward an argument which could prove that a <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/21/first-alien-asteroid-to-visit-our-solar-system-from-deep-space-looked-like-a-massive-cigar-astronomers-reveal-7095495/" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">cigar-shaped asteroid called â€˜Oumuamua</a> which zoomed through our solar system at 196,000 miles per hour is a probe sent by an extraterrestrial civilisation.<br>
              <br>
              â€˜Oumuamua is the first object to have been observed in our star system after travelling here through deep space. Itâ€™s about the size of The Gherkin in London, which stands 180 metres tall.<br>
              <br>
              Scientists from Breakthrough Listen, an alien-hunting organisation led by Professor Stephen Hawking, are planning to use the worldâ€™s largest directable radio telescope, at Green Bank in West Virginia, to <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/11/alien-probe-enter-solar-system-asteroid-oumuamua-artificial-extraterrestrial-investigators-suggest-7150610/" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">see if the asteroid is emitting radio waves</a>.<br>
              <br>
              But Jason Wright, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State, said the motion of the strange object could be key to discovering whether it is a piece of alien technology or just a weirdly-shaped asteroid.<br>
              <br>
              Astronomers believe it could be â€˜tumblingâ€™ through space, rather than speeding through space like a rocket or aeroplane.<br>
              <br>
              This claim is remarkable in itself because â€˜Oumuamua would have to be far more rigid than most asteroids to survive this kind of motion for a long time without breaking apart.<br>
              <br>
              Now Wright has made the astonishing suggestion that a spacecraft whose engines have failed would tumble in exactly the way as the interstellar asteroid.<br>
              <br>
              Sadly, the astronomer doesnâ€™t actually believe â€˜Oumuamua is alien in origin, but he <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">set out the following thought experiment on his blog</a>:<br>
              <br>
              â€˜Such derelict craft would, if they are not travelling so fast that they escape the Galaxy, eventually â€˜thermalizeâ€™ with the stars and end up drifting around like any other interstellar comet or asteroid,â€™ he wrote.<br>
              <br>
              â€˜In fact, since they (presumably) no longer have attitude control, one would expect that they would eventually begin to tumble, and if they are very rigid that tumbling might distinguish them from ordinary interstellar asteroidsâ€¦ and in fact, just because their propulsion is broken doesnâ€™t mean that their radio transmitters would be broken.â€™<br>
              <br>
              He went on to describe the theory that aliens might use â€˜Von Neumann probesâ€™ to explore the system.<br>
              <br>
              These are theoretical self-replicating crafts which visit star systems, replicate themselves using the resources they find and then speed off to explore other parts of the universe.<br>
              <br>
              If even one of these spacecraft were discovered, it could mean there were vast numbers out there in space.<br>
              <br>
              Wright added: â€˜Such a discovery would imply that there are lots of these things in the solar system at any given moment (even if they are deliberately targeting the sun, they are hard to spot and weâ€™ll miss most of them), and so lots of opportunities to study them.â€™<br>
              <br>
              Jason Wright achieved global fame after suggesting <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/31/we-might-have-just-explained-that-weird-alien-megastructure-star-and-it-will-dim-again-in-2021-6674389/" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">the mysterious dimming of star KIC 8462852</a> â€“ also known as Tabbyâ€™s Star â€“ could be caused by an alien megastructure called a Dyson Sphere, a theoretical bit of alien tech which surrounds an entire star and harvests its energy.<br>
              <br>
              One of the reasons â€˜Oumuamua has grabbed the worldâ€™s attention is because experts believe an alien spaceship would have a similar shape.<br>
              <br>
              In a blog, Breakthrough Listen wrote: â€˜Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft since this would minimize friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust.<br>
              <br>
              â€˜While a natural origin is more likely, there is currently no consensus on what that origin might have been, and Breakthrough Listen is well positioned to explore the possibility that â€˜Oumuamua could be an artefact.â€™

            <div class='col-md body'>It's no coincidence, how compared to China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japanese, American TV drama serials, South Korean TV dramas are almost inevitably always about how the elite rich &amp; powerful abuse their powers in society solely for their own selfish agendas, callously harming or even killing multiple innocent victims (the poor man-in-the-street) as mere collateral damage not worth batting an eyelid. While this is of course a human condition found in every society, but such abuses of power and increasing societal outrage over such, seem particularly prevalent in South Korean society, and indeed from a karmic perspective this karmic lesson seems to be South Korean society's pedagogical and didactic specialty. Just as every country and society by historical circumstance has its own unique lessons to impart.</div>

              <i>Here's an idea : find a badminton hall nearer to your home! Duh!</i><p>
              
              SINGAPORE â€” A weekly journey on the MRT train from Pioneer at the western side of the island to Tampines at the other end, for a game of badminton with their relatives, turned into a taxing affair on Sunday (Dec 10) morning for Mr Chan Si Yong and his parents.
              </p><p>
               The family, who lives in Jurong West, got up about 45 minutes earlier to try and get to Tampines Safra for their 11am game. The MRT station that they live closest to â€” Pioneer â€” is one of 19 stations along the East-West Line (EWL) and North-South Line which will be closed this and next Sunday, to allow for track maintenance and renewal work.
              </p><p>
               With the stretch of EWL stations between Tuas Link and Tiong Bahru shuttered, Mr Chan, 25, and his parents found themselves having to take an alternative route.
              </p><p>
              <b>From their home, they took SBS Transit service 179 to Boon Lay bus interchange. There, they transferred to service 174 to Beauty World, and took the Downtown Line to Bugis. From there, they got on the EWL to travel to Bedok, where they hopped onto service 28 to reach Tampines Safra. In all, they took around two hours.</b>
              </p><p>
              This was in contrast to their normal route, which takes about 1.5 hours: Taking service 179 to Pioneer MRT station, and then a straight train on the EWL to Bedok, before switching to service 28 to Tampines Safra.
              </p><p>
               The longer, more complicated journey on Sunday took a slight toll on Mr Chanâ€™s parents, Mdm Ho Lay Teen, 51, and retiree Chan Meng Fa, 57.
              </p><p>
              â€œThe journey has become more troublesome because we had to change so many times... and we didnâ€™t get to sit down much. We normally get a seat on the train at Pioneer,â€� said Mdm Ho, an accounts executive.
