              Poor girl, China has so many billionaires, in fact a few days ago Jack Ma earned Sg$30 billion (ie. $30,000,000,000) overnight (yes within a couple hours that he was sleeping!) thanks to tens of thousands of greedy investors hoping to profit from his AliBaba. He thus is in the valued position and has the valuable karmic opportunity to help so many (literally millions!) of poor Chinese people, like this poor girl. But will he? That's his (and all the other hundreds of billionaires and tens of thousands of multi-millionaires within China alone) spiritual test.</p><p><a href="https://video.toggle.sg/en/series/little-maestros/ep1/514614">https://video.toggle.sg/en/series/little-maestros/ep1/514614</a></p>

              China government's updated view of Singapore :<p>
              Singapore may not abandon its flip-flop diplomacy and China needs to be prepared for this. Singapore's diplomatic thinking is hard to change shortly. Lee Hsien Loong is less adept at balancing diplomacy than his father Lee Kuan Yew, and geopolitical competition in Asia nowadays has become more complicated. Therefore, Singapore is confronted with more difficulties. 
              </p><p>
              Singapore is a former a colony of Britain. Its dependence on the US, not so special compared with other ASEAN countries, is driven by pragmatism of safeguarding its own interests. As China grows more powerful, it will naturally readjust the balance between China and the US.
              </p><p>
              China sent a delegation led by a Lieutenant General to this year's Shangri-La Dialogue. We feel that the level of this delegation is still a bit too high, and suggest a lower-level delegation be sent next year. The Shangri-La Dialogue is a platform Singapore built for the US and Japan, and China has no reason to show support to it.
              </p><p>
              In recent years, China sent fewer officials for training in Singapore, another sign of the decreasing influence of Singapore over China.
              </p><p>
              In a nutshell, China needs to take a expected attitude toward Singapore swinging between the US and China.</p><p>

              The issue is : in Singapore, condoms are seen as a practical means for avoiding pregnancies. Ergo, homosexual gays mostly don't bother using condoms (especially for oral sex), thus infecting and transmitting the HIV virus causing AIDS (and not everyone realizes raw oral sex can indeed transmit STDs including the HIV virus, whether homosexual including lesbian oral sex, or heterosexual oral sex). This will be fuel for the anti-LGBT religious groups, to be used as both evidence and cause against the LGBT lifestyle. The LGBT (in particular, male homosexual gay) community needs to realize that not using condoms is self-sabotaging and self-destructive, and also harms the entire Singapore community by also indirectly infecting non-LGBTs just by fact of increasing incidence of HIV infections within Singapore.<p>In fact, the Singapore National Dental Centre just admitted that 72 (accidentally) unsterilized sets of dental instruments were used on Singaporeans recently. There is unfortunately, a real risk of being infected of STDs including HIV causing AIDS, from the use of unsterilized dental instruments.</p><p>

              [Martial Arts] - The only video footage available of a Bruce Lee genuine MMA fight match... it's damn obvious which one is Bruce Lee even though you can't see their faces... Bruce Lee is recognized as the grandfather of MMA, he was one of the first to discard the dogma of fighting only within martial art disciplines, and enjoyed learning, teaching and using a mix of multiple different martial arts.<p>

              [Video] - Poor girl has her hair forcibly cut by some guys, ostensibly because the guys think she (allegedly) cheated on her boyfriend or something. She pleads to be let off and sobs, but they threaten her with worse violence if she doesn't let them cut her hair off. The spoken language sounds like Portuguese to me (closely related to Spanish), so this could be either Brazil or Portugal (only Portuguese speakers can tell the difference between the Brazilian versus Portugal versions of the language). If it's Spanish, it could be anywhere from over 21 countries.<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsijCcqjcco/hqdefault.jpg">

              Poor woman and poor guy, in separate Russian solo space flights, decades before sufficient advances in technology made space flights safe, the woman and the man were both burnt alive screaming to their traumatic deaths as their respective solo ships burnt up upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere. They were deceived by the Russian authorities who didn't reveal to them that they had no chance of surviving the return flight back into Earth's atmosphere, and pitifully had no idea of their doomed fates when they accepted their ill-fated missions.

              Below are samples from only 3 countries, but honor killings continue every single day in many countries across the world. Bear in mind that, like rapes, only 10% of honor killings are actually reported as such. The actual incidence of such atrocities are far higher than reported.
              </p><p>
              In comparison, honor killings are almost non-existent in Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistan, India, Turkey, and the other countries on the list have much to learn from Malaysia and Indonesia in this regard.
              </p><p>
              And honor killings are not merciful painless killing. This is sadistic punishment as hundreds of bystanders watch without helping. Young women are burnt alive to death, or have their arms and legs chopped off while still alive, or buried alive to slowly suffocate, or have sharp rocks thrown at them until they slowly die.
              </p><p>
              Some of the girls do not die, they get their nose or ears chopped off, or get their faces splashed with concentrated acids, not just permanently disfiguring them, but worse, permanently blinding them by destroying their eyes.</p><p>
              Acid attacks get their own article, separate from honor killings : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing</a>

              In one of the most publicized honour killing cases committed in Pakistan, Samia Sarwar was murdered by her family in the Lahore office of well-known human rights activists Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani in April 1999. As Sarwar sought assistance for a divorce from her first cousin, her family arranged her murder after the shame felt in her attempt to marry a man of her choice. The police did not make any arrests or pursue prosecution as Sarwar's family is highly well known in elite, political circles. The 2000 award-winning BBC documentary, "License to Kill," covers Samia's killing in Pakistan.
              </p><p>
              Amnesty International reported that on 27 April 2010, Ayman Udas, a Pashtun singer from the Peshawar area, was shot to death apparently by her two brothers who "viewed her divorce, remarriage and artistic career as damaging to family honour." No one was prosecuted.

              A widely reported case was that of Tasleem Khatoon Solangi, 17, of Hajna Shah village in Khairpur district, which was widely reported after her father, 57-year-old Gul Sher Solangi, publicized the case. He alleged his eight months' pregnant daughter was tortured and killed on March 7, 2008, by members of her village claiming that she had brought dishonour to the tribe. Solangi's father claimed that it was orchestrated by her father-in-law, who accused her of carrying a child conceived out of wedlock, potentially with the added motive of trying to take over the family farm.
              </p><p>
              In August 2008, five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan. The five victims â€“ three teens, and two middle-aged women â€“ were kidnapped, beaten, shot, and then buried alive because they refused the tribal leader's marriage arrangements and wanted to marry men of their own choosing. Local politicians may have been involved in the murders. Syed Iqbal Haider commented that the Pakistani government had been very slow to react. Senator Israr Ullah Zehri defending the killings, stating, "these are centuries-old traditions and I will continue to defend them.'
              </p><p>
              On 27 May 2014 a pregnant woman named Farzana Iqbal (nÃ©e Parveen) was stoned to death by her family in front of a Pakistani High Court for eloping and marrying the man she loved, Muhammad Iqbal. Police investigator Mujahid quoted the father as saying: "I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent, and I have no regret over it." Muhammad Iqbal stated that it had been a prolonged engagement, and Farzana's father had become enraged only after Iqbal refused a demand for more money than the originally agreed amount of the bride price. Muhammad Iqbal strangled his first wife so that he would be free to marry Farzana, and police said he had been released after that murder when a "compromise" was reached with his first wife's family.

              In July 2016, popular Pakistani social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch was strangled by her brother in an act of honour killing in Multan in the province of Punjab. She had reportedly raised controversy by posting controversial pictures of herself on social media, including one alongside a Muslim cleric, and her brothers had asked her to stop. The state was named as complainant in Qandeel's murder case, making it impossible for her family to pardon her killers. Qandeel's brother Waseem was arrested on the charges of murder. He confessed to murdering his sister, saying "she (Qandeel Baloch) was bringing disrepute to our family's honour and I could not tolerate it any further. I killed her around 11:30 p.m. on Friday night when everyone else had gone to bed."

              Honour killing in India</p><p>

              Haryana is notorious for incidents of honor killings, mainly in the upper caste of society, among Rajputs and Jats. Honor killings have been described as "chillingly common in villages of Haryana dominated by the lawless 'khap panchayats' (caste councils of village elders)". In a landmark judgement in March 2010, Karnal district court ordered the execution of five perpetrators of an honor killing in Kaithal, and imprisoning for life the khap (local caste-based council) chief who ordered the killings of Manoj Banwala (aged 23) and Babli (aged 19), a man and woman of the same clan who eloped and married in June 2007. Despite having been given police protection on court orders, they were kidnapped; their mutilated bodies were found a week later in an irrigation canal. In 2013, a young couple who were planning to marry were murdered in Garnauthi village, Haryana, due to having a love affair. The woman, Nidhi, was beaten to death and the man, Dharmender, was dismembered (chopped into pieces while still) alive. People in the village and neighbouring villages approved of the killings.
              </p><p>
              The Indian state of Punjab also has a large number of honor killings. According to data compiled by the Punjab Police, 34 honor killings were reported in the state between 2008 and 2010: 10 in 2008, 20 in 2009, and four in 2010. Bhagalpur in the eastern Indian state of Bihar has also been notorious for honor killings. Recent cases include a 16-year-old girl, Imrana, from Bhojpur who was set on fire inside her house in a case of what the police called 'moral vigilantism'. The victim had screamed for help for about 20 minutes before neighbours arrived, only to find her smouldering body. She was admitted to a local hospital, where she later died from her injuries. In May 2008, Jayvirsingh Bhadodiya shot his daughter Vandana Bhadodiya and struck her on the head with an axe. Honor killings occur even in Delhi.
              </p><p>
              Honor killings take place in Rajasthan, too. In June 2012, a man chopped off his 20-year-old daughter's head with a sword in Rajasthan after learning that she was dating men. According to police officer, "Omkar Singh told the police that his daughter Manju had relations with several men. He had asked her to mend her ways several times in the past. However, she did not pay heed. Out of pure rage, he chopped off her head with the sword".
              </p><p>
              In 1990 the National Commission for Women set up a statutory body in order to address the issues of honor killings among some ethnic groups in North India. This body reviewed constitutional, legal and other provisions as well as challenges women face. The NCW's activism has contributed significantly towards the reduction of honor killings in rural areas of North India. According to Pakistani activists Hina Jilani and Eman M Ahmed, Indian women are considerably better protected against honor killings by Indian law and government than Pakistani women, and they have suggested that governments of countries affected by honor killings use Indian law as a model in order to prevent honor killings in their respective societies.
              </p><p>
              In June 2010, scrutinising the increasing number of honor killings, the Supreme Court of India demanded responses about honor killing prevention from the federal government and the state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

              Honour killing in Turkey</p><p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#Turkey">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#Turkey</a></p><p>
              </p><p>
              A report by UNFPA identified the following situations as being common triggers for honor killings: a married woman having an extra-marital relationship; a married woman running away with a man; a married woman getting separated or divorced; a divorced woman having a relationship with another man; a young unmarried girl having a relationship; a young unmarried girl running away with a man; a woman (married or unmarried) being kidnapped and/or raped.
              </p><p>
              In 2010 a 16-year-old girl was buried alive by relatives for being friendly with boys in Southeast Turkey; her corpse was found 40 days after she went missing. 
              </p><p>
              Honor killings continue to receive some support in the conservative regions of Turkey. In 2005, A small survey in Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.
              </p><p>A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the Southeastern Anatolia Region, the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing.
              </p><p>There are well documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing. The most recent was on 13 January 2009, where a Turkish Court sentenced five members of the same Kurdish family to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Naile Erdas, a 16-year-old girl who got pregnant as a result of rape.</p>
