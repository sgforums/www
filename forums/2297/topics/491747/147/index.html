              Nearly US$30 million of funds stolen from 1MDB was used to buy jewelry for the prime minister's wife, including a rare 22-carat pink diamond set in a necklace, according to the latest filings by the U.S. Justice Department in a civil lawsuit.
              </p><p>
              The filings lodged at the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday did not identify Prime Minister Najib Razak or his wife Rosmah Mansor by name, but said the jewelry purchases were for the wife of "Malaysian Official 1."
              </p><p>
              Malaysian and U.S. government sources have previously confirmed that "Malaysian Official 1" refers to Najib.
              </p><p>
              The diamond necklace set alone cost US$27.3 million, according to the latest filings in a lawsuit that was launched last July.

Rumour has it that the son of the horrible man cast a racial slur on Dhana over the Indian's marriage to a Chinese woman. Dhana's instinctive reaction was to counter that LHL's sister was also married to an Indian. The slap was then delivered with the admonishment to "leave my family out of this". Just goes to show the character of the son."</i>

              Technically the Old Fart is right to say his daughter stayed unmarried her entire life. LWL and the Indian doctor never got married.
              </i></p><p><i>
               What actually happened goes something like this. When the Old Fart objected to their relationship, LWL ran away with the Indian doctor to UK. The Old Fart got so angry that in a fit of rage, he instructed our immigration authority to put LWL on the blacklist and to refuse her entry at any checkpoint. In other words, the Old Fart actually banned his own daughter from coming back to Singapore.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Nothing happened for a few years as LWL never had any intention to return to Singapore, thinking that she will be with the Indian doctor in UK for rest of her life. But her relationship with that Indian doctor went down the drain and so she headed back here. But she was shocked when the immigration refused her entry at Changi Airport. She demanded to know why but did not get any answers. So she called her mother Kwa Geok Choo as she was then not on speaking terms with her dad. Kwa Geok Choo was just as shocked as she did not expect her husband would actually instruct the immigration authority as such. Kwa told the immigration to let her daughter in and she would bear all responsibility. Father and daughter reconciled upon the latter's return and the Old Fart was pretty satisfied that the relationship ended in misery.
              </i></p><p><i>
               But what the Old Fart didn't count on is her daughter lost all interest in relationships and in the process couldn't even be bothered with how she looked anymore. In fact, some believed that she deliberately made herself ugly. LWL never really recovered from this incident and the emotional trauma led to a very serious physical illness. This illness requires her to take steroids regularly and that is why she's now looking more like a monster than a human being.</i></p>

              <i>At that moment, Kimura seized his arm and executed gyaku-ude-garami. HÃ©lio did not surrender, and Kimura rotated the arm until it broke. As Gracie still refused to give up, Masahiko twisted the arm further and broke it again. Finally, when the judoka was about to twist it a third time, Gracie's corner threw the towel, and Kimura was declared winner.

              Now that the US Dept of Justice is putting the squeeze on Jho Low, hence indirectly on Najib, this is a good time to recap "The Wolf of Wall Street" movie about greed and corruption, partially funded by money stolen from 1MDB. Right now Najib probably feels like swearing like all the guys do in this movie.

              The self-defeating personality disorder is actually far more common (especially in Singapore) than most people realize, but suffers from little public awareness or understanding. In fact, most people afflicted with this disorder are usually in denial about it. Karmically, there is certainly a deeper story behind such deep-seated psychological disorders : often across multiple lifetimes, with the original traumatic trigger event many lifetimes back, and repeated reinforcing events in intervening lifetimes up to the present.<p>
                  Self-defeating personality disorder</p><p>A pervasive pattern of self-defeating behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts. The person may often avoid or undermine pleasurable experiences, be drawn to situations or relationships in which they will suffer, and prevent others from helping them, as indicated by at least five of the following:</p><p>1.chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment, failure, or mistreatment even when better options are clearly available</p><p>
                  2.rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help them</p><p>
                  3.following positive personal events (e.g., new achievement), responds with depression, guilt, or a behavior that produces pain (e.g., an accident)</p><p>
                  4.incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then feels hurt, defeated, or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in public, provoking an angry retort, then feels devastated)</p><p>
                  5.rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to acknowledge enjoying themselves (despite having adequate social skills and the capacity for pleasure)</p><p>
                  6.fails to accomplish tasks crucial to their personal objectives despite having demonstrated ability to do so, e.g., helps fellow students write papers, but is unable to write their own</p><p>
                  7.is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat them well</p><p>
                  8.engages in excessive self-sacrifice that is unsolicited by the intended recipients of the sacrifice

Gecko then had Dr Wong thrown into and locked in a room for days to punish her for talking back at her. Dr Wong then took her own life by overdosing on pills.

              Interesting, the mutually beneficial cooperation between the US Military and the producers of Transformers movies. Other than paying the US Military millions to use their military hardware (including the participation of hundreds of US military personnel, actual US aircraft carriers and a multitude of US air force planes, etc), they get cultural soft-power propaganda advertisement being featured favorably in the movies. Of course, Transformers isn't the only movie to do so, but is one of the most prolific movie series to do so.<p>

            <div class='col-md body'><i>The late diplomat James Lilley, who was ambassador to China and my colleague and mentor, liked to recall a lecture about Taiwan given by an American professor. The speaker became increasingly heated, declaring that unless Washington yielded immediately to Beijing's demands about Taiwan, a nuclear war was unavoidable. A People's Liberation Army (China) general in attendance was at first puzzled, and then annoyed. He turned to the ambassador to whisper a question: "Who is this idiot? Does he think we Chinese are idiots?" In other words, come whatever, "we Chinese" are intelligent enough to realise that war - let alone nuclear war - with the US is an insane action that would destroy all that China has achieved in the years since Mao Zedong's death in 1976.</i><p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/there-is-no-thucydides-trap">http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/there-is-no-thucydides-trap</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's 5.30am in the morning right now, and I just thought of a case in India several years ago. A man kena sliced in 2 at the torso by a train. Incredibly, the man didn't immediately die, but was naturally in incredible agony and remained fully conscious as he (using his hands) dragged himself (the upper half of the body) on the ground, intestines spilling out and trailing on the ground. The incident occurred at the boundary of 2 states in India. Soon, policemen from both states arrived. But instead of helping the half-sliced-away man on the ground screaming in pain, the 2 groups of policemen were busy arguing with each other : each side saying, "This case isn't our problem, you guys should handle it! You guys should call ambulances from your state to send him to a hospital in your state!". The argument went on and on and escalated in tension and anger. Meanwhile, with nobody helping him (there was a crowd of onlookers, but what could they to help a man sliced into 2 with his intestines all splayed out? even if medical doctors were present, let alone trained medics, let alone untrained laymen, there's really not much to be done in a non-hospital setting), the man soon died while the 2 groups of policemen continued arguing with each other. Truth be told, the man would probably have died anyway, but that's not quite the point.</div>
