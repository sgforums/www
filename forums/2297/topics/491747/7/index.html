                  MANILA: At least 10 people died across the Philippines in election day violence on Monday (May 9), as <b>gunmen attacked polling stations, ambushed vehicles and stole vote counting machines,</b> police said.<br>
                  <br>
                  However authorities described the violence as isolated incidents and that the overall conduct of the elections - which will see tens of millions of people cast their votes for president and 18,000 other positions - was peaceful.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the worst attack, seven people were shot dead in an ambush before dawn in Rosario, a town just outside of Manila known for political violence, Chief Inspector Jonathan del Rosario, spokesman for a national police election monitoring task force, told AFP.<br>
                  <br>
                  In Guindulungan, a small impoverished town in the strife-torn southern Philippine province of Maguindanao, where <b>warlord-politicians have their own private armies, a voter was shot dead inside a polling station, </b>police said.<br>
                  <br>
                  A bystander was also killed when a grenade was launched at a market in Cotabato, a major city in the south that neighbours Maguindanao, as people were casting their votes, police said.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the nearby town of Sultan Kudarat, a stronghold of the nation's biggest Muslim rebel group, 20 men forced their way into a voting centre and carted away voting machines, police chief Senior Inspector Esmael Madin said.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>In the northern province of Abra, infamous for politicians killing each other, armed supporters of rival mayoral candidates shot at each other, leaving one person dead and two wounded,</b> provincial police spokeswoman Marcy Grace Marron told AFP by telephone.<br>
                  <br>
                  Police arrested two men and two women with guns after the fighting in the mountainous town of Lagayan, 350 kilometres (217 miles) north of Manila, Marron added.<br>
                  <br>
                  Still, elections commissioner Rowena Guanzon said the violence would not impact the result, noting they had taken place in known "hot spots" where extra security forces were in place.<br>
                  <br>
                  Military spokesman Colonel Noel Detoyato also voiced little alarm.<br>
                  <br>
                  "There are isolated incidents. (They) had minimal effect on the conduct of the elections," he told AFP.<br>
                  <br>
                  Fifteen people had been confirmed killed in pre-election violence since the start of the year, according to the national police poll monitoring taskforce.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Political violence is a longstanding problem in the Philippines, fuelled by lax gun laws, corrupt security forces and political dynasties that often have their private armies or security forces.<br></b><br>
                  Rodrigo Duterte, the tough-talking mayor of southern Davao city, is the favourite to win the presidential elections after campaigning on a platform of killing thousands of criminals that critics say will incite more violence.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/10-dead-in-philippine/2769130.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/10-dead-in-philippine/2769130.html</a></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>With allies like Pakistan, who needs enemies? Pakistan is the most striking example of an ungrateful ally. The US has poured tens of billions of dollars into the Pakistani military for over half a century. But that has only allowed Pakistan to divert resources towards the production of nuclear weapons, as well as subsequently engaging in the sale of nuclear technology to other nations, most of which are US enemies. Pakistan has also harboured militant groups that were responsible for at least a chunk of the 2,300 US soldiers killed in Afghanistan since the Sept 11 terrorist attacks of 2001. To add insult to injury, Pakistani politicians brazenly deny all these accusations, notwithstanding the fact that the intelligence services of all major global powers have plenty of evidence that they are true. And Pakistan's immediate reaction after the US discovered that it sheltered Osama bin Laden was not to apologise; instead, the Pakistanis arrested and imprisoned Shakil Afridi, the doctor who cooperated with US intelligence in capturing the Al-Qaeda leader.<p><b>US hits back at 'ungrateful' allies</b><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/us-hits-back-at-ungrateful-allies">http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/us-hits-back-at-ungrateful-allies</a></p></div>

              Episode 16 of "Bones" (Season 9) titled "The Source in the Sludge" is particularly interesting for highlighting the interactive dynamics between the FBI, CIA, US Dept of Justice, and the US Military. The FBI initially suspects and investigates the CIA for the episode's murder, but subsequently collaborate to identify the murderer, but the US Dept of Justice makes a deal with the murderer that allows him to go scot free in return for terrorism info, until the FBI &amp; CIA find a loophole to get the US Military (with prosecutorial powers separate from the US Dept of Justice) to court martial and sentence the murderer to death for treason.<p><a href="http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bones-recap-31014-season-9-episode-16-the-source-in-the-sludge/">http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bones-recap-31014-season-9-episode-16-the-source-in-the-sludge/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.poweredbyosteons.org/2014/03/bones-season-9-episode-16-review.html">http://www.poweredbyosteons.org/2014/03/bones-season-9-episode-16-review.html</a></p><p><img src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/eB1BnZIi7lxeruooMnp5wQ417094/GW743H558"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)</a></p><p>Opening sequence music : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLu60M3aGlQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLu60M3aGlQ</a><br>

              When in other countries, many China tourists pretend to be Singaporeans or Taiwanese or Hong Kongers, etc. In Australia, a China woman changed her baby's diaper in the seating area of a Macdonald's restaurant and when scolded by the local Aussies, she replied, "Sorry, I from Singapore, we don't speak English."

               She made the comments about the highly sensitive Chinese state visit on the same day that Prime Minister David Cameron was also filmed telling her that Nigeria and Afghanistan were "fantastically corrupt countries." 
               The Queen was introduced to Commander Lucy D'Orsi, who was commander of the policing operation for the Chinese state visit last October, during the monarch's first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace. 
               She commiserated with Commander Lucy D'Orsi that it was "bad luck" to be the senior commander during the state visit.
               She was overheard telling Commander D'Orsi that the Chinese delegation was "very rude" to the British ambassador to China, Barbara Woodward.
               Commander D'Orsi agreed and said that the Chinese delegation walked out on her and Ambassador Woodward which she described as "very rude and undiplomatic".
               Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan visited the United Kingdom in October 2015.
               At the time the Queen described the first state visit by a Chinese premier for 10 years as â€œa milestone in the unprecedented year of co-operation and friendship between the United Kingdom and China.â€�
              The state visit has so far been perceived as highly successful both in China and in the UK. 
               David Cameron was praised for taking a different path from Chinaâ€™s rivals, a strategy that according to the Global Times would help Beijing improve ties with the West.
               The Prime Minister, however, has been less than praised for being caught on camera telling the Queen about an anti-corruption summit he is hosting in London on Thursday which will see â€œleaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain.â€�
              The PM then went on: â€œNigeria and Afghanistan - possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world.â€� 
              Mr Cameronâ€™s comments threatened to become a diplomatic incident, when Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari said his government was deeply "shocked and embarrassed" by the comments. </p><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/11/queen-caught-on-camera-making-unguarded-comments-about-rude-chin/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/11/queen-caught-on-camera-making-unguarded-comments-about-rude-chin/</a></p>
