                      "<i>I spoke to two people this morning, one black and the other Muslim. Both of them said that, when they heard about this awful shooting in Las Vegas, they immediately began desperately hoping that the shooter was not black or Muslim. Why? Because they knew that the blowback on all African-Americans or Muslims would be violently fierce if the shooter hailed from one of those communities.</i></p><p><i>Something is deeply wrong when people feel a sense of relief that the shooter is white because they know that means they wonâ€™t suffer as a result. White people, on the other hand, had no such feeling (ie. fearful of being persecuted or discriminated as a consequence of the massacre) this morning, because 400 years of American history tells them that no such consequences will exist for them today as a result of Paddockâ€™s actions.

              Apart from the main victim Kim Wall, the police also found dozens of real snuff films in her murderer Peter Madsen's hard disk, in which dozens of unidentified women were abducted (for real), tortured (for real), and decapitated alive (for real). These unidentified women victims of these snuff films, may have been unrelated victims of unrelated perpetrators around the world, or some of these women victims could have been abducted, tortured and decapitated by the same criminal syndicates (probably not Peter Madsen himself, but in watching these snuff films Peter Madsen became obsessed with the idea of torturing and snuffing out Kim Wall, as evidenced by the autopsy report of multiple stab wounds to her genitalia and her decapitation). The snuff films aside, police suspect Peter Madsen to be responsible for at least one other murder (ie. other than Kim Wall), which is the murder of a 22 year old Japanese woman over a decade ago, who went missing and only some of her body parts were found.<p>

              Every soul is responsible for him/herself and his/her own actions. To (erroneously and fallaciously) blame his parents for his actions is disrespecting him, and maligning his parents. Only the naÃ¯ve think children are innocent, and that it must always be their parents' fault that he misbehaves. Have you not heard of free will? Self-responsibility? And another thing, there's no such thing as 'moral values' (morality is an illusion), the more correct term is 'ethical values' (ethics exists, morality does not).<p><img src="http://images.allsingaporestuff.com/styles/big_within_article/s3/field/image/Student_Throws_Bike_On_Floor_0.jpg">

              It has been the most difficult week in my life.
              </p><p>
              After my Facebook posts have gone viral, my face was plastered all over various local news outlets and sketchy online forums. The online comments referring to my body parts and face were very graphic and disgusting. I hid in my room and did not want to come outside. 
              </p><p>
              When I gathered enough courage and went into the office yesterday, there were whispers. My close colleagues confided in me that some colleagues were blaming me for not being able to "take jokes." Some of my closest colleagues suddenly started avoiding me. I would like to think they probably did not know how to console me. Still, it was very painful. 
              </p><p>
              
              I don't regret that I spoke up-- although it probably left some mud in my reputation and future job prospect. I spoke up because I cannot justify my job if i cannot even speak up for myself. 
              </p><p>
              I am happy that Mediacorp is acknowledging *additional allegations* brought forth by five other producers and hope they will be fully investigated in the near future. And I hope this incident prompts more open culture and dialogue within the company. I think this is very important because I was repeatedly discouraged from going to HR with my past complaints. And that should not happen anymore. Everyone deserves to feel safe and respected at work-- regardless of their age, gender, sexuality or ethnicity. 
              </p><p>
              I had a wonderful time in Singapore. I made everlasting friends such as Noreen and Claire . I've learned so much in Channel News Asia from wonderful colleagues who've supported me and encouraged me. I am especially grateful for Dawn Karen Tan and my direct boss Fred. They were so supportive and caring. I am forever grateful. 
              </p><p>
              During past two weeks, I've received many messages from Singaporeans I do not know-- even from Houston, Texas! Sorry I cannot respond individually but thank you so much for your messages. It gave me strength.
              </p></i><p><i>
              I will be leaving Singapore soon as I am now a tourist smile emoticon:) Thank you Singapore.</i>

              [USA] - 22-year-old female undergraduate (who was studying to be a lawyer to help people, her father says) got drunk on her birthday and (presumably accidentally) drove into a police officer, and the other police officer present reacted by shooting her dead. There may be accusations of racism (on both sides), as she was black and both police officers involved are white.<p>

              [Malaysia] - Jakim officer Zamihan Mat Zin under investigation by the police, the Home Ministry and Jakim (Islamic Development Department), for criticizing Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar's speaking out against Muslim-only launderettes (and not because Zamihan Mat Zin made racist remarks against the Chinese, which he did).<p>

                                          At the lecture, Zamihan also claimed that the Chinese are "<i>unhygienic</i>" and alleged that they do not wash up after urinating and defecating. "<i>And what about menstrual blood on their underpants? Or if they had hugged a dog, or spilled alcohol or food containing pork? If you (Chinese) want to enter a laundry, then just go to a normal one.</i>" he told the religious congregation.

              Pple who say "money is the root of all evil" do not realize that money is simply a tool that provides people with the opportunity to demonstrate their ethical behavior, or lack thereof.
