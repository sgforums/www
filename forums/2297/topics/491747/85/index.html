                          HELSINKI (AP) â€” Swedes have been scratching their heads and ridiculing President Donald Trump's remarks that suggested a major incident had happened in the Scandinavian country.
                          </p><p>
                          During a rally in Florida on Saturday, Trump said "look what's happening last night in Sweden" as he alluded to past terror attacks in Europe. It wasn't clear what he was referring to and there were no high-profile situations reported in Sweden on Friday night.
                          </p><p>
                          The comment prompted a barrage of social media reaction on Sunday, with hundreds of tweets, and a local newspaper published a list of events that happened on Friday that appeared to have no connections to any terror-like activity.
                          </p><p>
                          Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said that the government wasn't aware of any "terror-linked major incidents." Sweden's Security Police said it had no reason to change the terror threat level.
                          </p><p>
                          "Nothing has occurred which would cause us to raise that level," agency spokesman Karl Melin said.
                          </p><p>
                          Former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt tweeted , "Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?"
                          </p><p>
                          The Aftonbladet tabloid addressed Trump in an article Sunday, "This happened in Sweden Friday night, Mr President," and listed in English some events that had happened in Sweden, including a man being treated for severe burns, an avalanche warning and police chasing a drunken driver.

              <i>The (increasingly frequent) Malaysian gun shootings are terrible, compared to in lawful Singapore (where gun shootings are extremely rare). But its still nothing, compared to USA, where thousands of Americans (including innocent women and children) are killed in gang shootings every single day. Obama once lamented that gun shootings kill thousands of times more Americans than any terrorist attacks, and wished that USA could have the same strict gun controls as Singapore. But once the guns are already out there (in USA, that's tens of millions of guns) among the public, there's no taking them back.</i><p>

              AMOS YEE THREW INTO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AFTER INSULTING MUSLIMS IN US JAIL <p><img src="http://images.allsingaporestuff.com/styles/big_within_article/s3/field/image/amosyee_solitary_confinement_insulting_islam_muslim.jpg"></p><p>Amos is presently in solitary confinement for criticizing Muslims &amp; Islam during their Muslim Studies in jail. He is feeling terrible. "He attended a Muslim Studies class, in order to "disagree". There was a "Muslim pastor" from outside (not a prisoner) and about 18 Muslim prisoners in attendance. Amos called Allah a "sky wizard". He said that if the religion is 5,000 years old then it's "complete fucking garbage". (He said "fuck" a lot). The pastor said Amos was disturbing the peace or something and got Sergeant R.Henson to sign a form putting him in solitary. Amos is certain that he is in solitary confinement for punitive reasons, not for his own protection.</p><p>He has been in solitary for 3 days. He doesn't know how long he will be there. They don't let him write, don't give him paper. They let him out for one hour per day. <b>Amos was kicking, screaming, and banging the door yelling "LET ME OUT!!!", other prisoners heard him, the prison guards came, opened his door, took a look, and left.</b></p><p>Amos wants us to "tell his story" on Facebook, share with the global secular human rights movement, get on CNN and the Rubin Report. He wants the Rubin Report to interview me and Melissa to tell Amos's story. "These people don't know what they're messing with. We gotta destroy them." "MAKE IT BIG". "This is a free speech issue and everyone will be on my side".
