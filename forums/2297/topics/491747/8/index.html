It noted that there are new senses of common English words like "blur", meaning "slow in understanding; unaware, ignorant, confused"; as well as loanwords from Hokkien, like "ang moh" ("a light-skinned person, esp. of Western origin or descent; a Caucasian") and Malay, like "shiok" ("cool, great; delicious, superb"). Food and drink featured prominently among the new entries, including "teh tarik", "char siu", "chilli crab" and "sotong" - referring not only to cuttlefish but also "a stereotypically stupid, clumsy, or ignorant person". "Hawker centre" and "HDB" also made it to the OED's lexicon - presumably as places where one can "lepak" ("to loiter aimlessly or idly; to loaf, relax, hang out").<p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wah-now-can-act-blur-and/2776828.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wah-now-can-act-blur-and/2776828.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More than 50 years after her American solider father left South Korea, Jang Yeon-hee still longs to meet the parent who she has never known. "Whenever I take the subway I see a lot of foreign tourists en route to Incheon International Airport," Jang said in an interview with The Korea Herald. "When I see such visitors I'd break down in tears. There are so many people coming in and out of this country, and yet the person who gave me my life left before I was even born and never bothered to visit again to see me." The father left her Korean mother when she was pregnant with Jang in 1964.Jang is one of some 40,000 mixed-race Koreans born in South Korea from 1955-1969, many of whom were born to American soldiers who were temporarily stationed here. Many of the Korean women who gave birth to such mixed-race children were those who were trafficked by Korean brokers to work as prostitutes for the US military. Many fathers simply went back to the US and never returned. Mothers relinquished their children, as many of them had no financial means to raise them, while suffering from severe social stigmatization for being sex workers. Most of the children were adopted into American families. For those who remained in Korea, like Jang, life was filled with a sense of alienation, racist attacks and longing for her birth parent. <p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/koreans-born-us-soldiers-lead-hard-lives">http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/koreans-born-us-soldiers-lead-hard-lives</a></p></div>

Another strand of evidence is just as relevant, however. When folate intakes are relatively high, and the folate comes from food, we see a more consistent and stronger picture of cancer-protective effects, with none of the apparent risks associated with synthetic folic acid.</i></p><p><i>In the case of folate, synthetic folic acid represents its most oxidised state.  If we consume this form, it needs to be converted to the forms usable by the body through the action of enzymes.  The relative amount of the active form, notably 5â€™-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), and the synthetic form is down to such factors as how much you take, how quickly it gets converted and how much is being used.  This is a very variable and unpredictable process, and thereâ€™s a further complication: many people have defects in specific genes that are responsible for the enzymes required to convert folate into its primary active form, 5-MTHF.  Among the many enzymes involved are dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).</i></p><p><i>Thereâ€™s also increasing evidence that an excess of unmetabolised folic acid (UMFA) in the bloodstream may be central to the potentially harmful effects of high-dose synthetic folic acid supplementation.</i></p></div>

Unfortunately the problem with Singapore employers mistreating migrant workers has been around for years, and MOM seems completely ineffectual. These are the key areas of abuse that have been identified:</p><p>(a) Migrant workers often pay substantial sum to a middle man just to get a job here and then spend months working off the debt. This is a cross jurisdiction problem as the middle man ripping them off is sometimes not Singaporean. Employers also get kickbacks and they are part of the problem. It is a system of modern day slavery.</p><p>(b) Substandard living conditions which are often unhygienic and cramped. This is well documented at TOC. The Govt has tried to address this but what is the progress on this front?</p><p>(c) Abuse by employers who cheat workers of their pay, make them do OT without compensation, overworking them, etc. HOME has a whole stack of very well documented cases.</p><p>(d) Forced repatriations when relationship between worker and employer go south. Often involves hiring third parties who use gangster-like tactics to intimidate workers not to seek help or mediation from the authorities, coupled with threats of being blacklisted.</p><p>As a people, Singaporeans have often confused the two very distinct issues of migrant workers being exploited/abused and white collar foreign workers (PMETs) stealing away jobs that could easily have been taken by a local. To a large extent, the govt has been responsible for conflating the two issues in Singaporeans' minds and that is how insidious they are. Its crucial people make the distinction and call the G out when the G tries to be funny and avoid addressing real issues faced by local PMETs by hiding behind this conflation. </p></div>
