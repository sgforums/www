There are so many posts.  I had no idea until a friend let me know.  So many people are wondering what happened and guessing different things.  You are heart felt about the sadness around what has happened with Kenny. He has not been found and I feel that he probably will not be found for many,  many months, if ever. I want to share what I know and feel about what happened, so that you might bring some closure and understanding in your own lives. Kenny absolutely loved hiking in the desert. It was his very, very favorite thing to do.  We hiked and camped together all over the Nevada desert.... sometimes 9 hours in a day. We found many abandoned mining towns, usually referred to as "ghost towns" by Nevada hikers.  We explored many caves and mine shafts. We were always careful how we explored them, but Kenny was a bit more daring than I was. We wore snake guards, sun protected clothing, used walking sticks, brought enough water and food for the hiking hours and had extra water/food in the car. (He rarely drank all his water.)   We took wonderful pictures of all sorts of things we saw... rusted cars, old falling down buildings, cemeteries,  mines, wild animals, tarantulas, scorpions, trees, cactus and flowers.  Our deserts are beautiful, if you have a love for deserts. They are not "spooky" scary but you do have to be careful of the terrain and of course bring enough water and food.  We always were excited when we saw desert wild life, like the big horn sheep in the video.  They are stunningly beautiful to see in person in our desert. We would stand quietly still to watch them as long as possible. I was so very excited to see the one he filmed in his video. I want you to know that I do not think Kenny had an accident.  I believe he committed suicide. He battled depression for many years and would not take medication or see a doctor.  He quit his job a little more than a year before he disappeared.  He wanted to see if he could sell his inventions and do what he called "Cowboy Interior Design" for homes. He bought his first home five years ago and had an amazing ability of decorating in this style.  He was not successful in getting a business going and was running out of money after a year of not working.  He no longer wanted to work in a "job" for someone else and as his money decreased he became more and more depressed. He really did not look for another job.   In early Oct, with seeing his depression increase, I said to him, "You aren't going to pull a Robin Williams on me are you"?  This is when he opened up more about his depression and his  thoughts  much of his life about suicide.  His father committed suicide when Kenny was in his early 20's.  When I asked him the question he answered me with "If I decide to do it, you will be OK because you are good at the Law of Allowing."  He asked me what I would think of him if he did it. He also said if he decided to do it "No one will ever find me."  It would be easy to do something like this in our desert with the number of natural caves and mines. He could hike many miles in a day so there is no telling where or how far he could have hiked  during his 3 day 2 night solo hike.  When he did not call me after the 3rd day of being gone I called missing persons.  The search for him was started within a couple days of my call. Over 30 search and rescue team members searched 3 different times on foot.  One helicopter fly over was done and there was no trace of Kenny or any of his camping things. They found his car in the area I told them it would be.  They did find his cell phone by the mine shaft in the video.  The mine shaft was only about a 4 hour hike from his car.  It is my feeling he left it behind so that he could not be tracked form the GPS in it.  He also did not take his video camera with him on this solo hike.  It was left in his home.  So, he had no intention of filming anything. </p><p>I share this with you for two reasons.  First, so that you have more of an understanding who Kenny was and to bring some peace or understanding to the situation.  Secondly, if any of you do decide to go out into our desert to look for him or the M Cave,  be careful and bring enough water and food.  Walking sticks are a good idea and not doing a solo hike. Bring a GPS and make sure that you have let family or friends know that you are heading out for the hike and where and when you will be returning.  A search really can't be on a one day hike.  You would be repeating much of the same hike....just getting up the mountain and then be left with not many hours in the day to do the search. You would need 2 or 3 days at a time and in the summer, or even late spring, this can not be done because of the heat of our desert.  You would not be able to carry enough water.  So, please, please be careful.   I had many wonderful experience with Kenny and will always remember them and have a place of love in my heart for him and the wonderful things we did together.  I am healing from my loss and look forward to new experiences with desert hiking, camping and taking beautiful  pictures of our desert.   Enjoy your adventures of life and thank you for the kind loving comments sent my way. </p><p>Much Love,   Sheryon  :)</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfdrY-2sROQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfdrY-2sROQ</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among the list of countless unsolved missing persons, there are 2 well-known cases (while not the most mysterious or almost definitely do not involve any supernatural elements) that have gained public attention due to media attention, but still remain unsolved to this day.<p>Tara Leigh Calico : <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Tara+Leigh+Calico">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Tara+Leigh+Calico</a></p><p>Amy Lynn Bradley : <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Amy+Lynn+Bradley">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Amy+Lynn+Bradley</a></p><p>Both cases often make the list of videos such as this one (see 2:50 Tara and 8:07 Amy) : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVyQnfBHK6M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVyQnfBHK6M</a></p><p>Cases of missing women, often abducted and smuggled internationally into a lifetime of slavery are far more common than many people suspect.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/US_Special_Operations_Command.png"><p>Posted by Christopher Charles, officer of the United States Marine Corps</p><p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-various-famous-elite-units-in-the-U-S-Military-from-one-another">https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-various-famous-elite-units-in-the-U-S-Military-from-one-another</a><br><br><br>The Army Rangers (75th Ranger Regiment), Army Special Forces (Green Berets), 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta, the Navy SEALs, and DEVGRU (aka Seal Team 6, it stands for Naval Special Warfare Development Group) are all part of US. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM conducts covert and clandestine missions, such as unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, anti-terrorism, war on drugs, and other direct action missions. There are other units that fall under Special Operations Command, but the above units are generally considered as the prototypical/standard units. As America's elite operatives, members of these units all receive special training and have access to special equipment and gear that the rest of the military doesn't have access to.</p><p>USSOCOM generally and unofficially divides its various units into a "Tier 1" group and a "Tier 2" group. The Rangers, Green Berets, and "normal" SEALs fall under Tier 2. These are the more conventional of SOCOM's forces.</p><p>The SEALs are the Navy's primary Special Operations unit. They are the most "seafaring" of the bunch. SEAL training consists of extensive time in the water, both in the pool and in the ocean near Coronado, CA. Most of the SEALs' missions involve infiltrating and ex-filtrating via the water. They do this either by dropping into the ocean a few miles offshore and swimming to their objective or by using small Zodiac boats to speed from ship to shore. From there they can move inland, accomplish their mission, and then swim back out into the ocean where they can safely and clandestinely be picked up by friendly forces. SEALs are also able to dive underwater and plant explosives on the hulls of enemy ships or set up explosives on water defense systems in anticipation of an amphibious landing. For example, the precursors to the SEALs (called "Frogmen") swam ashore ahead of D-Day and cleared some of the obstacles on the beaches. This does not mean that all SEAL missions involve water or swimming, just that they are experts in that field. SEALs are identifiable on the battlefield by their sand-colored helmets.</p><p>The term Special Forces (SF) refers to the Green Berets. A common mistake people make is calling other groups such as the SEALs "Special Forces". The Rangers and SEALs, are "Special Operations". SF are the Army's primary unconventional warfare and foreign defense experts. They are usually tasked with working closely with foreign military forces in joint operations and in a training role. You might even call them the "teachers" of the Spec. Ops. community since they train a lot of foreign forces. For example, the Green Berets are currently deployed across Northern Africa to help train the Algerian military how to conduct anti-terrorism operations and defeat al-Qaeda's presence in the Sahara. The Green Berets can also work closely with their foreign allies to conduct missions deep in enemy territory. For example, shortly after 9/11, the Green Berets were tasked with going into Afghanistan and developing relationships with various warlords in the hopes of recruiting them and their men in the fight against the Taliban. To blend in, they grew beards and rode on horseback to move from camp to camp. SF are fully capable of performing other types of special operations missions, such as assassinations, hostage rescue, etc..., but their primary task, and what sets them apart, is their ability to work closely with America's military allies to train them and assist them in missions.</p><p>The Rangers are different from the Special Forces in that they don't go out and work hand in hand with foreign military forces. A common misconception is that anybody who wears the "Ranger" tab on their shoulder is a Ranger. Soldiers can apply for and receive Ranger training at Ranger School, but graduating doesn't mean that the soldier is a Ranger. To be fully considered a Ranger and fall under USSOCOM, a soldier has to actually be a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment. The Rangers are what are termed "High Speed, Low Drag" units, meaning that they come in fast, hit the enemy hard, then quickly get out before the enemy can reorganize. Think of the Rangers as the Army's version of the SEALs -- they are all around specialists who are all about killing the enemy. As the Army is a more land-based entity, the Rangers don't have the same intensive water-based training that the SEALs get. The Rangers, however, are experts in navigating land terrain such as mountains, jungles, and dense forests. For example, the USSOCOM mission in Somalia in 1993 (Black Hawk Down incident) was primarily composed of Army Rangers, with a small mix of other units. </p><p>One last point. The SEALs and Rangers are unique in the SOCOM community in that they accept recruits straight out of basic training. A qualified civilian can enlist in the Army or Navy with a contract that guarantees them a slot in either a Ranger unit (with a high likelhood of a Ranger School slot) or SEAL training, respectively. As soon as that man (women cannot join any of these units due to their intense physical requirements as well as the fact that they frequently operate behind enemy lines) graduates basic training, they will be sent to either BUD/s (SEALs) or to a Ranger unit to prepare for Ranger School. This is unlike the Army Special Forces, who will only accept soldiers with prior service into the Q course. What this means is that the Special Forces are seeking the top 1% of soldiers to train into Green Berets, while the Rangers and SEALs are looking for highly motivated individuals to complete hellish training, regardless of prior service or accomplishments. </p><p>Tier 1</p><p> "Tier 1" refers to those units that are the elite of the elite; those that perform the most sensitive and unconventional of missions. Delta and DEVGRU are considered "Tier 1" units. For example, DEVGRU was chosen to undertake the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. Delta was tasked with the rescue of Pvt. Jessica Lynch in 2003. Delta Operators are selected from the ranks of the Green Berets and Rangers, while DEVGRU operators are recruited from the SEAL ranks. What this means is that each unit is taking the top 1% of their respective branches and further weaning that number down until they find around the top 10% of that 1%. Truly the Best of the Best. </p><p>Tier 1 units fall under a special subdivision of USSOCOM known as Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Delta and DEVGRU are so elite that they typically don't wear military uniforms at all in order to remain completely anonymous. They are expected to NOT have military haircuts and oftentimes grow mustaches and beards in order to conceal the fact that they are in the military. When they went into Afghanistan post-9/11, they wore traditional Afghan clothes and sported long beards in order to pass unnoticed among the populace. It is useless to talk about Delta and DEVGRU separately because they do the same missions and work very closely together. Their primary mission is to track down, find, and kill or capture High Value Targets (HVTs). They push far ahead of conventional forces in order to conduct deep reconnaissance. </p><p>For example, before the Battle of Shah-i-Kot, in Afghanistan in early 2002, members of Delta performed extensive reconnaissance, finding the location of hundreds of enemy in the mountains. They then crept into elevated positions in and around the enemy's camp, and marked the locations of enemy defense networks and anti-aircraft weapons. After members of the Army's 10th Mountain battalion assaulted the enemy, Delta operators, remaining concealed, helped call in targets for air assets flying above, helping obliterate the entrenched enemy.</p><p>Bottom line: Tier 1 are essentially spies/soldiers, discarding their military uniforms and haircuts in order to achieve missions deep behind enemy lines, usually in teams of no more than 3 or 4. However, when they do operate in a more conventional military setting (such as in Somalia in 1993), they do wear military uniforms. In such instances, Delta are recognizable by their black helmets, while DEVGRU will wear the SEALs' standard sand colored helmets.</p><p>I hope that this serves as a thorough answer to the question at hand. This simple question has a complicated answer. Keep in mind that this is only a synopsis. It is the tip of the iceberg. The CIA's Special Activities Division (SAD) recruits those that excel in Delta or DEVGRU (basically, the top 10% of the top 10% of the top 1% of the US Military) to perform covert or black ops paramilitary operations.<br></p><p><br>Posted by Christopher Charles, officer of the United States Marine Corps :</p><p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-various-famous-elite-units-in-the-U-S-Military-from-one-another">https://www.quora.com/What-distinguishes-the-various-famous-elite-units-in-the-U-S-Military-from-one-another</a></p></div>

              "The end result is that Trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger, a 'zhilaohu' â€“ someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challenge."

              The police were called, he was charged and hopefully he won't do this again. It was my first true experience with racism towards me in Singapore. I have lived here almost five years and love it very much and am proud to call it home.
