              So-called 'recreational fishing' is bad karma, causing wholly unnecessary pain and suffering to the fish (the sharp metal hook pierces through the top of the mouth after the poor fish innocently bites the bait, imagine how it feels if it happened to you). If you're an ethical person (ethics &gt; morality), you would only catch fish (using nets, less suffering involved than using hooks) that you would eat, or sell as food. If you're not going to eat the animal, don't kill it.<p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2017/01/mother-otter-from-bishan-pack-seen-with-fish-hook-stuck-in-body-%f0%9f%98%a0/">http://mothership.sg/2017/01/mother-otter-from-bishan-pack-seen-with-fish-hook-stuck-in-body-%f0%9f%98%a0/</a>

               I cant seem to find an active topic on shop lifting. Asking on behalf, my friend has 2 previous shop theft records. 1st she was let off with a warning in 2006. 2nd time in 2010 she was fined ard 1k plus. She got caught again recently. She offered to settle but the shop still wanted to pursue the case. She has to meet the IO on 17 Jan 2017. In her statement, the IO included her 2nd offence in 2010.</i></p><p><i>
               She is unemployed since May 2016 and was unsuccessful in getting jobs. She stole because she was desperate to feed her 7yr old daughter. Husband was also retrenched in March and was unsuccessful in getting jobs. Any advice is deeply appreciated. Serious ones please thank you.

              [Medical Science] - An adenovirus causes obesity in humans and animals<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/12/mysterious-virus-cause-obesity/">https://www.wired.com/2016/12/mysterious-virus-cause-obesity/</a> </p><p><i>In the visitors comment below the article, Mindbreaker posted :</i></p><p>
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                There is too much money in treating chronic conditions. DARPA funded something that can cure all sorts of viruses, but it just disappeared into a black hole never to be seen again. It was called DRACO (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizer) and it killed every virus thrown at it.
                                                </p><p>
                                                This adenovirus causing obesity is not a new revelation. This has been known for years. The first tip-off was that the obesity epidemic acted exactly like a spreading infection through the population. It followed the same geographic patterns. There is almost nothing else it could have been. There are at least 3 adeoviruses that likely cause or at least contribute to obesity, adenoviruses #5, #36, and #37. And possible several more that are more difficult to study. And Firmicutes have also been implicated.
                                                </p><p>
                                                It is not just obesity, lots of conditions have been linked to infections. The Wikipedia page that listed them was removed. Fact is, the big pharmaceutical companies have lost billions when it is discovered that a bacteria causes something they were earning billions to treat. Perhaps you have heard that they discovered that ulcers are caused by a bacteria? That woke up the pharmaceutical industry. That hurt them. Then it was discovered that a bacteria causes lower back pain and damage. After that, amazingly it became very hard to get antibiotics. Doctors are getting in trouble for prescribing antibiotics for anything that is not proven to be caused by bacteria...they don't want another accidental cure. They say it is to stop the development of supper bugs. But most of the antibiotics used in the US are used on millions and millions of animals everyday...just to make them grow faster...nothing to do with illness. If there are super bugs being born that is likely where they are coming from. The reality is that they can develop new antibiotics very easily. They avoid it. And there were things that killed bacteria before antibiotics that still work on "super bugs", but you never hear about them.
                                                </p><p>
                                                The evidence for staph bacteria causing diabetes has not been followed up even though the evidence was more than trivial. They gave staph infections to rabbits and they got diabetes. Coincidence? I doubt it. You can have a staph infection and not even know it. Infections can be invisible. 
                                                </p><p>
                                                Most of the chronic conditions we have are because of these infections be they viral, bacterial, fungus or other. Did you know human cytomegalovirus (HCMG) causes more cases of serious birth defects than Down Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Spina Bifida, or HIV/AIDS? But I bet you have never heard of it. Why? Because the thing is everywhere. They can't isolate the infected from the uninfected. And they don't bother to create a cure because it is likely the condition slowly kills you...very slowly, that means lots of symptoms to treat for decades. 60%-70% of us are infected, and the older you are the more likely that someone will infect you. Hard to separate the affects of old age from the effects of infections the immune system is just loosing the long battle against. HCMG is a herpes virus. They never get eliminated, they just do damage for decades (without vigorous treatment). And it is spreading fast. Rates have gone up dramatically since the 1970s. I don't think it is an accident that Americans' life expectancy is starting to move downward despite really impressive progress against cancer. Doctors know many cancers are caused by viruses. They call them oncoviruses. They currently acknowledge that they cause 17.8% of human cancers, but it probably is a far larger proportion. Perhaps 50% or more. I find it interesting that the success they have had recently is due to revving up the immune system. Coincidence that that might be a way to fight tough viruses in your body? I don't think so.
                                                </p><p>
                                                We are all carrying around dozens of infections. If they do not kill quickly, or produce clear identifiable symptoms, doctors say it is "normal". Well, it isn't. Before people could go all over the planet and things were not spread all over, the average person almost certainly had far fewer infections cruising around in their bodies. I bet you do not even know that sweets do not cause cavities; that it is a bacteria, just one of over 100 types of bacteria in your mouth. And there are tribes who don't have this highly contagious infection. No, it is not "normal" it is an infection that has gone everywhere and infected almost everyone on the planet, but was probably very rare and limited to one small area in the past. But with nothing done about it...its everywhere. Believe it or not, but they have a cure. But so many ridiculous barriers were erected that it never got enough funding to survive the tests. The FDA asked them to do ridiculous things like test only on adults with no teeth. I don't know about you, but if I was down to 2 or 3 teeth I would not give up those last few. Who then would have no teeth? And did you know that tooth problems are linked with heart disease. Those plaques in your arteries are just like that bacterial plaque on your teeth. The bacteria that causes dental carries is a different one than the one that causes gum disease, rots your jaw and infects your arteries and your pancreas.</p><p>
                                                The biggest impediment to recognizing the cause of disease in our day is the "weakness" stigma. The, "well just control yourself", "use good hygiene"...sort of blame stuff. I think virtually all mental illnesses are caused by infections including anxiety and depression. And much of the rest caused by heavy metals, other toxins and nutritional deficiencies. I believe genetics has been greatly exaggerated...just one more "weakness" story to make others feel superior and invulnerable.
                                                </p><p>
                                                In the Southern US people got the reputation for being lazy. But it was hookworm. Just sucks the energy out of you. Fortunately people finally saw the light and made the changes necessary to infrastructure and cured the infections, and that lousy thing is gone. Still in Africa and other places infecting half a billion people. People who no doubt are still looked down on as lazy, and worthless.
                                                </p><p>
                                                It is entertaining to think it is a conspiracy, that pharmaceutical companies prefer treating chronic people to curing people and obstruct the development of cures. But it probably is not. It is probably just a defect with the way medicine is developed in the US, the economics of it. Turf protection, and barriers to market entry do exist, how much that has played into policy and harmed the pubic is an open question.

              â€œI saw some girls running away from men on motorbikes,â€� Ms. Shreedharan said. â€œThey ran toward the cops. I think it was temporary respite, because the minute the cops were even a few meters away, the men returned to hound the women.â€�
