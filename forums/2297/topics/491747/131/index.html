              The rich keep getting richer (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/retail-slump-one-raffles-place-is-latest-to-suffer">in Singapore, just look at the evil REITS raising cost of living for all Singaporeans</a>), the poor keep on struggling just to survive, of course the anger mounts and society teeters towards self-destruction.
              <p>David Brooks says it like it is. Took the words right outta my mouth.</p><p><i>The presidential campaign of 2016 was an education in the deep problems facing America. Angry voters made a few things abundantly clear: that modern democratic capitalism is not working for them; that basic institutions like the family and communities are falling apart; that we have a college educated elite that has found ingenious ways to make everybody else feel invisible, that has managed to transfer wealth upward to itself, that crashes the hammer of political correctness down on anybody who does not have faculty lounge views.</i></p><p><i>As Robert W. Merry put it recently in The American Conservative, â€œWhen a man as uncouth and reckless as Trump becomes president by running against the nationâ€™s elites, itâ€™s a strong signal that the elites are the problem.â€�
              </i></p><p>
              David Brooks continues to analyze why Trump's nationalistic, alienating approach is destabilizing and endangering the entire world :</p><p>
              <i>
              The last four months, on the other hand, have been an education in the shortcomings in populism. Itâ€™s not only that Donald Trump is a bad president. Itâ€™s that movements fueled by alienation are bound to fail.</i></p><p><i>Alienation, the sociologist Robert Nisbet wrote, is a â€œstate of mind that can find a social order remote, incomprehensible or fraudulent; beyond real hope or desire; inviting apathy, boredom, or even hostility.â€�</i></p><p><i>
              The alienated long for something that will smash the system or change their situation, but they have no actual plan or any means to deliver it. The alienated are a hodgepodge of disparate groups. They have no positive agenda beyond the sort of fake shiny objects Trump ran on (Build a Wall!). They offer up no governing class competent enough to get things done.
              </i></p><p><i>As Yuval Levin argues in a brilliant essay in Modern Age, â€œAlienation can sometimes make for a powerful organizing principle for an <b>electoral</b> coalition. â€¦ But it does not make for a natural organizing principle for a <b>governing</b> coalition.â€�
              </i></p><p>

              If your marriage is failing, that's because of issues between you and your wife / husband. It's pathetic to round up your gang to beat up the mistress / male-mistress, because you project your anger of your failed marriage onto the 3rd party, when the problem is really between you and your wife / husband.<p>

              [Malaysia] - Pastor Raymond Koh's wife says the Malaysian police chief is trying to get off the hook from this politically troublesome investigation into his abduction, by choosing to investigate the pastor himself for allegedly trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, instead of investigating his abduction, and deliberately making it public opinion that the pastor deserved to be abducted so no need to investigate his abduction further. The Malaysian police chief says it's not his decision, his hands are tied, because recently a lot of unidentified people have been making police reports against the pastor (together with several other unnamed individuals as well, more arrests on the way) for allegedly trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, so the police chief says he's just doing his job. Just a few hours ago, the police chief says, "<i>Last week we picked up a suspect in northern Malaysia who we believe can help us in our investigations and the investigation continues.</i>"<p>

              [South Korea] - A South Korean female naval officer apparently killed herself after being allegedly raped by a senior colleague, a defence ministry spokesman said Thursday.
              <p>
              The victim, a lieutenant, was found dead in her single-room apartment on Wednesday, where a message was found reading: "Tomorrow, I won't be in this world any longer."
              </p><p>
              "The lieutenant appeared to have committed suicide," a military spokesman told AFP.
              </p><p>
              She had reportedly told her boyfriend that she had been raped.
              </p><p>
              Military police have arrested a navy captain as a suspect. He admitted to having sex with her but denied the rape allegation, the spokesman said.

This is one of the few covers which could arguably be even better than the original in some ways (doesn't mean Xu Haixing is a necessarily a better singer than Coco Lee for all songs, but for this song specifically, Xu Haixing did an incredible cover).<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_2wNWRTItY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_2wNWRTItY</a></p></div>

              For comparison, here is one of Coco Lee's best songs, æˆ‘ä¾�ç„¶æ˜¯ä½ çš„æƒ…äºº. Coco (an American-Taiwanese) once seriously considered immigrating to Singapore (around the time Gong Li and Jet Li took up Singapore citizenship... but you won't see Jet Li in a hawker center anytime soon, he's never around in Singapore anyway, in fact it's possible Donnie Yen visits Singapore more often).<p>Coco Lee's æˆ‘ä¾�ç„¶æ˜¯ä½ çš„æƒ…äºº</p><p>

              I love ethical dilemmas like this one (on tonight's Lethal Weapon), which illustrate my point that morality is an illusion, and there is no naÃ¯ve 'right' vs 'wrong', only legality, ethics, cosmoethics, karma and consequences.<p>The sheriff head is blackmailing the police head over a case many years ago, where a child rapist killer was going to walk free because a corrupt cop had secretly compromised the DNA evidence, and the current police head (then the detective in charge of the case) had to secretly re-compromise the evidence to 'frame' the (actually guilty) child rapist killer, to prevent him from walking free.</p><p>Although technically committing a crime by tampering with evidence, but his selfless-yet-illegal actions (arguably an act of self-sacrifice, or at least self-risk) arguably saved many potential children victims.</p><p>This illustrates my point that legality, morality, ethics, cosmoethics are all separate and not always necessarily in agreement, it's case-by-case, and only the pitifully naÃ¯ve moral absolutists / objectivists think there is always a simplistic 'right' vs 'wrong'.

              While the guy who did the comparison could very well have smoked his way through (and none would be the wiser), but if this is the real deal, then it's pretty impressive (if not the skill, then at the very least the effort, as no other Singaporean would bother doing this).<p>
