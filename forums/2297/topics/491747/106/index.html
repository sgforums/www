Instead of paying $30k/year to lock her up for the next 50 years, they'll be getting 70 million US dollars of forfeited bail money doing nothing! The US Govt should secretly arrange for her to flee the country.</i>"</p>

              <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sfynl5F2ASQ/maxresdefault.jpg"><p>MANILA - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered the occupation of uninhabited islands and shoals it claims in the disputed South China Sea, asserting Philippine sovereignty in an apparent change of tack likely to anger China.
              </p><p>
               The firebrand leader, who on the campaign trail joked that he would jet ski to a Chinese man-made island in the South China Sea to reinforce Manila's claim, also said he may visit a Philippine-controlled island to raise the national flag.
              </p><p>
               "The unoccupied, which are ours, let's live on it," Duterte told reporters during a visit to a military base in Palawan, near the disputed waters.
              </p><p>
               "It looks like everyone is making a grab for the islands there. So we better live on those that are still unoccupied. What's ours now, we claim it and make a strong point from there."
              </p><p>
               Duterte's plan is unlikely to sit well with China, which lays claim to almost all the South China Sea, especially as it comes amid a fast-warming relationship in recent months.

              [Afghanistan] - MMA fight between Pashtun fighter and Tajik fighter had to be personally cancelled by the country's President, because it would have destroyed Afghanistan if it were allowed to proceed, a symptom of deep-seated hateful ethnic-racism between the Pashtuns and Tajiks. No matter who wins, the country would be uttery destroyed by widespread racial riots between the Pashtuns and Tajiks. Ethnicity-racism is a nuclear flashpoint in Afghanistan, home to Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks and about a dozen other ethnic minorities, all of whom deeply distrust each other.<p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trump's firing of 59 missiles into Syria's Assad, is to hint a warning to North Korea (directly) and Russia (semi-directly) and China (indirectly). It has raised public and international perception of Trump, from incompetent buffoon, to don't-mess-with-me macho man. Be that as it may, when the unstoppable meets the unmovable, it's bad news for everyone. Kim Jong Un is a madman, and may decide that if Trump is going to take him down and he's gonna die one way or the other anyway, then might as well fire and use up all of North Korea's nuclear arsenal while he's still breathing. And if that happens, with USA caught in a nuclear war, Russia and China will likely have little choice but to join in the nuclear farewell party, and the entire world will be mostly destroyed. So Trump is playing Russian Roulette here with North Korea, and the entire world is at stake. That's not to say it's all Trump's fault, because when you've a nuclear-armed psychopath like Kim Jong Un around, there's not much wiggle room for Trump to maneuver in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the launch of the 59 missiles, suddenly the whole world changes from Trump haters to Trump lovers. Trump transforms from incompetent buffoon to strong macho man. But strong macho men could still destroy the world, and even sooner.<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-media-critics-praise-syria-strikes-154025787.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-media-critics-praise-syria-strikes-154025787.html</a></p></div>

              So it turns out that the Americans forewarned the Russians before firing the 59 missiles into Syria-Assad (coz the Americans and even Trump knows that if any Russian soldiers are killed in the US strike, Putin will be forced by domestic pressure to declare World War 3 on the US), and the Russians forewarned their Syrian-Assad allies, who had enough time to move away manpower and important military equipment before the strike. The Americans are not stupid, they knew the Russians would do this. Hence, the US$59mil spent on the 59 missiles, is nothing more than a symbolic political gesture (hinting to Syria-Assad, to NorthKorea-KimJongUn, to Russia-Putin, and to China-XiJinping), to show that big mean nasty Trump isn't to be messed with. I'm sure the millions of starving homeless African children will totally agree that this US$59mil is totally worth spending.<p>Edited to add : it's possible (but not definite) that Assad deliberately chose not to warn the civilians in the area, allowing them (including 4 children) to be killed, to put the blame on Trump.</p><p>

Pit bulls are genetically bred for violence, it's in their genes, you can't blame them for being violent, it is human responsibility not to allow pit bulls to be bred as pets and/or allowed out in public, in the first place.

              A judge who offered to pay court fine for teenager who stabbed her 56 year old paedophile rapist was found guilty of misconduct, for offering to pay her fine for her.    <p>
                          Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC made the offer after hearing the Bradford girlâ€™s stabbing case (not her being raped case, which was completed earlier).
                          </p><p>
                          The teenager, then aged 14, had stabbed her 56 year old paedophile rapist six years after <b>he walked free from court</b>, despite raping her when she was only 8 years old.
                          </p><p>
                          The teenage girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with attempted murder, but prosecutors eventually accepted a lighter charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
                          </p><p>
                          Judge Hall sentenced the teenager to a two-year youth rehabilitation order and told her not to pay the mandatory victim surcharge, adding: â€œ<i>If anyone tries to force you to pay the fine, I will pay it for you myself.</i>â€�
                          </p><p>
                          The decision prompted an investigation by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which found his comments amounted to misconduct.
