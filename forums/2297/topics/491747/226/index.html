              <i>You've *got* to read the entire article on the Straits Times website. Truth is even more intensely insane than fiction.</i><p> 
                      <img src="https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/articles/2018/01/21/st_20180121_sttonyforces_36985172.jpg"></p><p>
                      Events began unrolling in January 1968, when a band of 31 highly trained fighters, sworn to suicide if necessary, set out from their camp high in the North Korean mountains and began a 60km march to the centre of downtown Seoul and the Blue House, as South Koreans of the Republic of Korea (ROK) call their presidential palace. The men, all in their 20s, were from an assault team of the North Korean army's 124th Unit.
                      </p><p>
                      The unit's recruits were ordered to use South Korean accents and slang. Training was exceptionally rigorous. They were expected to be marathon runners, sprinting for miles over icy terrain while carrying about 30kg of gear. They had to climb a 1,000m mountain in a snowstorm. To toughen them for the ghastliness of combat, they were forced to sleep on corpses.
                      </p><p>
                      For their final, week-long pre-mission exercise, a provincial headquarters building had served as the "Blue House". Combat realism was not lacking: some 500 militiamen pretended to be ROK defenders in hand-to-hand fighting that became progressively more violent. About 30 of them were hospitalised.
                      </p><p>
                      Just ahead of the commandos' departure, the North Korean Public Security Ministry's chief intelligence officer, Lieutenant-General Kim Chung Tae, gathered them for a final meeting and issued a brief, blunt order: "Go to Seoul and cut off South Korean President Park's head!"
                      </p><p>
                      ( <i>Read on to find out what happened to their suicide mission, and how many people from both sides died from this mission. <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-assassination-squads-of-korea">http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-assassination-squads-of-korea</a></i> )
                      </p><p>
                      Subsequently, South Korean President Park Chung Hee hatched his own revenge plan on April 1968 to send a similar special force (named Unit 684 for that date) to Pyongyang to avenge the Blue House attack eye-for-eye, throat-for-throat.
                      </p><p>
                      As former drill sergeant Kim Shin Jo, who had helped train the South Korean commandos for the mission, has put it: "Their goal was to blast into Kim Il Sung's palace in Pyongyang and chop off his head."
                      </p><p>
                      The South Korean army did not detail its elite commandos for the mission, unlike the North Koreans. Instead, as the training team's surviving members tell it, they recruited ex-cons and gangsters  off the streets, telling them they would receive a lot of money and the chance of an honourable relaunch of their lives if they accepted the onerous mission.
                      </p><p>The South Korean army gathered it's most feared monstrous military instructors to put Unit 684 through unimaginably brutal training. Seven of the young conscripts died within the first few days.
                      </p><p>
                      In October 1968, after brutal military exercises that killed three more conscripts from the unit, P (for Pyongyang)-Day was declared. The order came from Seoul to set out in rubber boats for North Korea.
                      </p><p>

                   September 19, 2017<br>
                  Hajer, a 25-year-old British woman, hit the Islamist Islamic State (ISIS) in 2014 because she likes to abuse people. She said her favorite abuse of women, especially in front of the victim's father or husband, would make her particularly thrilled. In addition, she also loved using torture instruments so as to "make her suffer from having children," and was very perverted!<br>
                  <br>
                  According to the Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper, Hayeir, who is now a deserter, recently disclosed her personal experience during the IS interview. In 2014, she went to Syria to join the "Pure Women" picket team "Al- Khansa Brigade), specifically to abuse women against ISIS. Haye said ISIS was determined to join the picket squad because she was able to get her involved in combat and to satisfy her abusive hobbies and to take advantage of her promotion opportunities.<br>
                  <br>
                  Hayeh said the members of the women's picket squat would be subjected to abuse in the face of resistance or disobedience; at that time, they would abuse women with a torture instrument called "biter". She said that "bites" are similar to animal clamps, with sharp metal clamps that bite into the victim's flesh. Haye said the degree of pain was "more horrible than having babies," and Haye thought I can not help but get excited, "I enjoy it! I enjoy the abuse of Syrian women, especially in front of their father or husband!"<br>
                  <br>
                  Hayyer recalled, "Karsha Brigade" in addition to her, there are other British female soldiers, their means the most cruel, no one will abuse the enemy than they are. She had seen British warriors mistreat a captured Jordanian pilot, and the cruel sight that still remains in her head is "it was the most cruel torture I ever had," and was later certified by ISIS in 2015 Burning alive, fragments shocked the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  After reading the news, the netizens said angrily: "ISIS is basically a large collection of pure criminals under the banner of religion. They love looting, love sex, love destruction, and love to kill. These people shout jihad every day and then Do your favorite bad thing. "," Relying on religion to commit crimes.

                  **ALL BLOGGERS BANNED FROM OUR BUSINESS**
                  </p><p>
                  Following the backlash received after asking an unidentified blogger to pay for a hotel room, I have taken the decision to ban all bloggers from our hotel and cafe. 
                  </p><p>
                  The sense of entitlement is just too strong in the blogging community and the nastiness, hissy fits and general hate displayed after one of your members was not granted her request for a freebie is giving your whole industry a bad name. I never thought we would be inundated with negative reviews for the simple reason that somebody was required to pay for goods received or services rendered. 
                  </p><p>
                  The girl in question was never identified in my original post, but she herself went on to create a video explaining how she was â€œexposedâ€� with â€œmalicious intentâ€� for asking for a freebie. This kind of victimization is very prevalent in the blogging industry, and is in keeping with their general modus operandi of wanting everything for nothing. 
                  </p><p>
                  If any of you attempt to enter our premises from now on, you will be ejected.

                  P.S. Perhaps if you went out and got real jobs youâ€™d be able to pay for goods and services like everybody else. Just a thought!

              The father of a track and field trainee who was allegedly molested by her coach had told his daughter to forgive the perpetrator if the incident was â€œone-offâ€�.
              </p><p>
              He was testifying on the first day of trial into the alleged offence committed by Singapore Athletics Vice President, Loh Chan Pew, 72, in the State Courts on Monday (22 January).
              </p><p>
              The father, who cannot be named, said his daughter, an 18-year-old trainee then, tearfully recounted the incident to him that her coach had molested her to the point of â€œorgasmâ€�.
              </p><p>
              Loh is accused of using criminal force and rubbing the genitals of the teenager on two occasions. The first was said to have occurred between January 2013 and 17 March 2013 on a bench in Tampines Stadium. The second incident allegedly took place on 17 March 2013 on a massage bed in an equipment room in the same stadium.

              In ancient cultures, particularly ancient China and ancient Rome (and no doubt in many other ancient civilizations as well), the Emperors, Kings and other powerful elites, would for political strategic bribery purposes, actually give each other (eg. from one King to another) women (sometimes up to hundreds of women) as sex slaves.<p>Imagine if you were born as one of them. Terrible. Just terrible. Hopefully humanity has progressed far beyond such dark ages, and never revisit them ever again.

              What a dumb, perverse idea. All it takes is for a violent Ah Beng present on either side, or worse, both sides (ie. wait staff and customer), for a fight to break out. Good luck to the owners of this dumb cafÃ©.<p>Customer : <i>Excuse me, waiter...</i><br>Waiter : (violently kicking over your table and shouting) : <b>WTF U WANT?!?</b> <i>*hokkien expletives*</i></p><p>

              [Psychology / Literature / Film] - 'The Film Theorists' YouTube channel psychoanalyzes using the relevant social psychology precepts (actual references to actual psychology studies) and Film/Literature precepts, to explain why <i>Star Wars : The Last Jedi</i> had the largest discrepancy between critics' (who watched with open-minds) reviews and audiences' (who watched with prejudicial ideas) reviews in the history of Film/Literature (including correctly pointing out those of the alt-right disapproving of non-white and non-male main characters who thus gave the movie the thumbs down, as well as the role of YouTube channels such as his own in propagating theories that the movie as it turned out spurned, thereby disappointing theory-obsessed fans who thus gave the movie the thumbs down).

              [Germany] - A male nurse who felt bored, decided to inject hospital patients under his care with poisons that cause heart failure or circulatory collapse so he could then try to revive them and, when successful, shine as a saviour before his medical peers and superiors. Over a hundred of his victims died. He has been charged for 6 murders, and is now being charged for 97 more murders.<p>
