            <div class='col-md body'>It's a psychological fact that many vehemently anti-gay people are themselves gay, it's because they were judged, rejected and traumatized for their gay tendencies, that they continue to harshly judge and reject themselves, projecting and manifesting this self-hatred as an outward hatred towards other gays. It's an open secret that the most vehemently anti-gay religious preachers (including in Singapore, you know who they are) are themselves closet gays (often marrying women in a desperate bid to suppress their own gay tendencies), and the more desperately they struggle and reject their inner-gayness, the more vehemently they outwardly preach sin and hellfire against homosexuality. It doesn't help that religion condemns rather than understand homosexuality, resulting in a religion vs LGBT polemic dichotomy, with many LGBT torn apart between accepting their own sexuality and their religion. If you know any such person with such inner conflict in need of counseling, you can get them to PM me for counsel and advice, from a non-judgemental, understanding, spiritual perspective (that you'll never get from any religion).<p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-orlando-nightclub-shooter-visited-222620444.html">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-orlando-nightclub-shooter-visited-222620444.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/orlando-shooter-reported-pulse-club-regular-patrons-article-1.2672445">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/orlando-shooter-reported-pulse-club-regular-patrons-article-1.2672445</a></p></div>

              <a href="http://ahmadintaiwan.blogspot.sg/2007/05/how-long-more-can-starlight-still-shine.html">http://ahmadintaiwan.blogspot.sg/2007/05/how-long-more-can-starlight-still-shine.html</a><p>The Taiwanese military fighter accident that killed two Singapore servicemen who were training in Taiwan, has forced Singapore to officially acknowledge for the first time the existence of the "Starlight program". This accident may not necessarily affect the continued existence of the "Starlight program", but Taiwan-Singapore relations, which has gone increasingly downhill these past few years, is really the question worth noting.</p><p>Due to Singapore's limited geographical size, there is no space large enough for military exercises, hence the need for co-operation with allied countries for training agreements. Thanks to the close friendship between former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the late Taiwan President Chiang Ching-kuo, both countries signed the agreement for the Starlight program in 1975, after which Singapore began to dispatch servicemen to Taiwan for training.</p><p>Military training agreements are different from normal bilateral cooperation, because national defense is the lifeline of a country's survival, and troop equipment, engagement plans and operational capability are of the utmost national security and obviously cannot be leaked. Allowing foreign troops to train with local forces exposes much of the internal workings to them, and this cannot be achieved without a certain degree of mutual trust. As a result, the Starlight program remains the best testimony of the relationship between Taiwan and Singapore.</p><p>Bilateral ties were really quite good in the past, as Lee Kuan Yew enjoyed the scenery of the Sun Moon Lake and A-Li Shan, and visited Taiwan on vacation every year, often in the company of Chiang Ching-kuo. After observing Lee Kuan Yew chatting with the locals in Hokkien, Chiang lamented his own inability to talk to converse with the locals, with Lee even exclaiming "I'm also a Taiwanese".</p><p>After Lee Teng-hui succeeded as president, he originally continued friendly relations with Lee Kuan Yew, making his first official foreign visit to Singapore. But due to Lee Teng-hui's criticism of Lee Kuan Yew's "Asian-style democracy" , leaving Lee Kuan Yew frothing at the mouth, the rift between the two Lees being to widen from that point on, with Lee Kuan Yew not returning to Taiwan on vacation for several years. But from a wider perspective, the two Lees represented two different models of Confucian cultural development. Lee Teng-hui professed to have founded democratic reform Taiwan, and Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore is the successful example of the patriarchal model. Lee Teng-hui felt that the significance of his democratic achievements surpassed that of Lee Kuan Yew, but of course Lee Kuan Yew begged to differ.</p><p>Once the seeds of discord were sown, ties were difficult to mend, especially when the "two Lees" were known for their temperament and pride. Afterwards to make matters worse, Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US ignited cross-strait tensions with China, which Lee Kuan Yew criticized repeatedly on Taiwan's actions. Of course, Lee Teng-hui was not known for accepting such face-on criticism, and this led to a further deterioration of ties.</p><p>The foreign media eloquently described Lee Kuan Yew as "a fish too big for its pond". Indeed, to a big fish like Lee Kuan Yew, a small pond like Singapore was not big enough to contain his political aspirations. Hence he hoped to play a bigger role in the international arena, including cross-strait relations and China's development.</p><p>He focused on the practical side, and felt that China's rise cannot be taken lightly, and cross-straits peace must be maintained. As a result, he disagreed with Taiwan taking a radical stance and standing for independence in defiance of the Chinese Communist Party, which obviously fell on deaf ears with the Taiwanese government.</p><p>The national interests of Taiwan and Singapore are certainly different, and it is difficult for the outsider to understand the long-term suppression of pride, the indignity and fear of security constantly being threatened. But Taiwan's reading and handling of the international situation is still at odds with international society, causing the country to distance itself with the rest of the world.</p><p>But Taiwan is still a very suitable military training location, and therefore although Singapore continues to sign training agreements with other countries, Taiwan-Singapore ties continue to turn cold, but the Starlight program still manages to hang on. The thing is, it may be quite impossible for the time being for Taiwan and Singapore to recover their former close relationship.

              <i>The first is that I am born this way and I should have the right to love another man who feels the same. Not the right to coerce, pressure or even forcibly rape. Not the right to sexually abuse a child, nor have carnal intercourse with an animal, which to me is simply abhorrent not just as a gay man but as a human being. I do not believe that my sexual orientation equals the viewing of all males as potential sex partners, much less my own brother. I simply believe that I am capable of a deep, abiding and committed love with another man. Whether it should be consecrated by God does not matter to me. I was born gay. I did not choose to be gay. I can choose a religion. I cannot choose on a whim which gender I love.</i><p><i>My second belief - that you have the right to your own beliefs and the way to lead your life as you deem fit. But my belief seemed to be at odds with yours because from my perspective, you seem to be influencing and imposing your beliefs onto mine. To my way of thinking, you cannot believe that I have the right to lead my own life, free from discrimination, prejudice and fear if you support the very law that sentences me to a criminal status simply because of my sexuality. Your belief seems to encroach onto a secular space, my world that has no intersection with yours. I do not ascribe to your beliefs but I do not mind, nor care because it is your space, your personal relationship with God. However your championing of the retention of S377A is prohibiting me from fully living my life in a secular country.</i></p><p><a href="http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/06/open-letter-pastor-lawrence-khong-fcbc/">http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/06/open-letter-pastor-lawrence-khong-fcbc/</a></p><p>Also read the visitor comments below the article.
