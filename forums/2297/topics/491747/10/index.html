            <div class='col-md body'>A popular nightlife venue in Singaporeâ€™s centre was evacuated last Saturday night after an unpleasant discovery was made on the dance floor. According to a report by a local Singaporean media outlet, clubbers at the venue were horrified to find that fecal matter had been deposited on the centre of the crowded dance floor, sometime around 2:00 AM.<p> The shocking discovery of a fresh turd was confirmed by a statement on social media from an account believed to be linked to the venueâ€™s management. â€œFollowing analysis of the sample, which was found in pristine condition, we conclude the perpetrator is likely female â€“ or a male who was wearing a skirt.â€� Management went on to note â€œ[the offenderâ€™s] diet appears to be relatively unhealthy, including a lot of fatty, fried foods.â€� CCTV footage of the club did not reveal any clues about the identity of the culprit, but there was one female customer seen leaving the dance floor and rushing to the bathroom shortly before the discovery was made. â€œInspection of the toilets revealed a further two samples that matched the dance floor deposit.â€� One further sample was later discovered in an unclaimed purse inside the cloakroom, which has since been destroyed. â€œIt was an expensive purse, but there was no way youâ€™d be able to get the smell out of it.â€�</p><p>The social media post attracted hundreds of comments from users in neighbouring countries, with the responses ranging from disgust (one reader from Malaysia commented: â€œThis is absolutely filthy! People must not go to nightclub if they are not toilet trained!â€�) to understanding (an Indonesian netizen wrote: â€œSometimes when youâ€™re caught up in the music and the dance, you lose your inhibitionsâ€�). Others speculated that the phantom pooper may have simply been the victim of over-consumption of alcohol, and not been able to pass through the crowded dance floor in a timely manner to reach the bathroom.</p></div>

              Medically speaking, hyperventilation can help to reduce the intracranial pressure of a stroke victim up to a certain point, beyond which more harm than good (to the brain) may result.<p>Papsmearer posted on another forum on 19 May 2016 : </p><p><i>I have been busy and had not had the time to post my take on this aspect of Ah Heng's stroke during a cabinet meeting. I base my observations on the description of events by Gay Loong himself during the incident. The whole incident indicates to me a shocking lack of critical thinking and lack of leadership on the part of Gay Loong. I will post the article in which Gay loong mentions all the items I observed. </i></p><p><i>
              
               1)Gay Loong describes how Janil was already administering first aid to Ah Heng when the SCDF response team arrived. Now, although Janil is a medical Dr., he has been in the senior consultative role in Pediatric medicine at KK. Gay Loong must know that unless Janil has been moonlighting as an ER doctor, his duties are principally that of a Minister, and a politician. As well, his CPR skills could not have been applied that often by him in his field of pediatrics. If Gay Loong had properly assessed the situation, he would have realized that the SCDF first response team are in every way far more experienced then Janil in performing CPR and dealing with adult stroke victims. They do this all the time, this is the only thing they do, this is their full time job. We cannot say this of Janil. The moment the SCDF team showed up, Janil should have given way to them. Obviously he did not, and the SCDF team ended up "supported" him and "performed other tasks". WTF is this? 
              </i></p><p><i>
               Gay Loong should have judged that the best people in the room to help Ah Heng was not Janil and it was the SCDF team. Big fail on his part. He should quietly tell Janil to step aside and let the SCDF team take over. He failed to do this and in the article, he is trying to say how great janil was, and put him on a pedestal and say he was doing fine and he was so much better then the SCDF team that they were only fit to "support" him. This is very poor judgement on the part of Gay Loong. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               2) While "supporting" Janil, the SCDF team leader SSG Janice Lee made a comment that he was deviating from SOP and bagging too fast. For some reason, this telling comment DID NOT REGISTER with Gay loong. In essence, if Janil was not at the meeting, then the SCDF team would have been the ones doing the CPR when they arrived, and what SSG Lee is saying is they would have done it a different way. This comment alone should have made Gay Loong take notice right off the bat and realized that what ever Janil was doing was the Janil Method of CPR and not the SCDF SOP for CPR, the SOP that is applied to every other patient in Singapore. he should have investigated SSG Lee's comment further and ask her to explain why she said that. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               Instead, Janil gave a rebuttal and explained his reasons for doing his method. Gay Loong simply accepted Janil's explanation without asking for the other side of the story from SSG Janice. SSG Janice should have been invited by Gay Loong to explain why the SCDF SOP is different from Janil's, and he should then make the call as to who should do the CPR. But this is nothing real with the PAP. They only listen to people that they know are their cronies and they do not consider anything coming from the peasants. this is evident over and over again in all their policies. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               3) Gay Loong then said that SSG Lee was satisfied with janil's explanation and continued to support him. Is his social IQ really that low? If a Minister already rebutted you, and you are just a lowly SCDF SSG, what are you supposed to do? Of course, you have to tiam tiam and accept the explanation. Is Gay Loong so stupid as to not recognize that SSG Lee is stuck between a rock and a hard place? If she adamantly continues to tell Janil that he is not doing the CPR the right way, she can see that Gay Loong already is on the side of janil, and despite being the expert in the room, she could be in big trouble for not giving face to a Minister. Gay Loong has already recognized that the SCDF team "asserted" itself. But does not seem to think that it is very unusual for the SCDF team to even have to assert itself in the first place. For them to "assert" themselves would indicate me that they thought something amiss was happening. If Janil was doing everything right and according to SOP, then the team would not have to assert it self and SSG Lee would not be making any such comments. The significance of this exchange between SSG Lee and Janil seem to have just flown over Gay Loong's head. How can such a poor ready of body language and tone of voice be negotiating treaties for this country? 
              </i></p><p><i>
               So, to summarize. gay Loong demonstrated:
              </i></p><p><i>
               a) Inability to control his Minister or an avoidance of conflict by not telling Janil to stop his shit and let the SCDF team take over.</i></p><p><i>
               b) Failed to recognize who the real talents in the room are for CPR and stuck with a Minister who might not even carry CPR certification anymore.</i></p><p><i>
               c) Failed to process inputs from other participants in the room, i.e. the comments from SSG Lee regarding deviating from SOP.
              </i></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bones Season 9 Episode 24 (Season Finale) is insanely awesome. The team investigates a mystery man so powerful within the US Govt that he/she controls the FBI, federal judges and almost all other government agencies, and has the power to send a Delta Force assassin squad to kill FBI agent Booth on US soil. But FBI agent Booth being an ex-US Ranger himself, will sure as hell go down fighting tooth &amp; nail. 1 US Ranger versus 3 US Delta Force soldiers, special forces versus special forces. Booth (the Ranger) manages to kill 2 of the Delta Force assassins, before (almost) being killed by the last one.<p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Bones+season+9+EPisode+24">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Bones+season+9+EPisode+24</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Recluse+in+the+Recliner">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Recluse+in+the+Recliner</a></p></div>
