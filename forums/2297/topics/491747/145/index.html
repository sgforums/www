              [Martial Arts] - UFC's Joe Carr is being a prick. Although most people (especially UFC fans) would agree that he's stating the obvious, but his disrespectful and dismissive attitude toward Angela and One Championship smacks of low EQ and terrible PR. Then again, this is a zero-sum sport of combative violence, and Joe thinks (somewhat correctly) that whipping up emotions through bragging will be good for his business. One Championship's Chatri (Thai martial artist and businessman billionaire owner of One Championship and Evolve MMA) kena suckered into taking this personally and getting all worked up, and challenging UFC to accept a match between Angela and JJ. From a business perspective, it makes sense for the owners of UFC and ONE to keep up a bragging shouting match, but both sides have too much to lose to agree to an actual match between Angela and JJ. Should JJ win (which is what most people will expect and bet on, admittedly even most fans of Angela and ONE), that's really bad publicity for ONE, and would ruin Angela's career. Should Angela win (which would be unexpected, but then again, nobody expected Ronda Rousey to lose), that would unbelievably humiliating for the entire UFC, and they have too much to lose to risk that, even if they're mostly confident JJ would win.<p>UFC's Carr says Lee no match for their best fighters</p><p><img src="http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/rl780/public/articles/2017/06/16/NP_20170616_JLANGELA16_1573696.jpg"></p><p>

              No shit, Sherlock. LHY should have done an (Malaysian) Alvin "U jelly, bro?" Tan, to make those accusations *after* he flees from Singapore. While he might be thinking it's a worthy calculated gamble by daring LHL to take action against him and LWL, which would draw international condemnation and further his cause, but still, is your family worth taking that risk (not that LHL would be as psychopathic as Fatty Kim to pull off a manipulate 2 foreign chio bu to assassinate your half-bro at a Malaysian airport), especially when you (all 3 siblings and even extended family) are already a multi-millionaire (possibly billionaire, including hidden assets). Btw, HC gets paid a lot more as head of Temasek than LHL earns as PM.<p>

              Asked if he had been in touch with PM Lee since the joint statement was issued, or whether he planned to get in touch with him, Hsien Yang replied emphatically, â€œNo.â€�
              <p>
              When asked whether there was any hope of reconciliation with his brother, Hsien Yang did not answer directly but recounted the dispute over the status of the house and PM Leeâ€™s promise to recuse himself.
              </p><p>
              â€œAnd yet now, he goes to the cabinet committee and says â€˜Oh, my father wasnâ€™t quite so unwavering in his wish. You know, he would have accepted that the government has a right to do what it doesâ€™. What is all this sophistry? What, are you quibbling and trying to play with words, to try and say that it might be all right?â€�
              </p><p>
              In their joint statement, the Lee siblings had claimed that they felt threatened and that â€œorgans of the stateâ€� would be used against them. In this regard, Hsien Yang planned to leave Singapore â€œfor the foreseeable futureâ€�.
              </p><p>
              <b>Asked to elaborate, he said that some of his friends had suffered â€œserious repercussionsâ€�, adding, â€œThey donâ€™t want to be identified and they donâ€™t want the issue to be raised. But there have beenâ€¦a number of incidents which have caused hurt and pain to people.â€�</b>
              </p><p>
              The father of three clarified that while the decision to leave had been â€œrelatively recentâ€�, he had not yet decided where to go. He added that it depended on the authorities and his personal circumstances whether he would retain his position as chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>aurvandil posted :<p><i>Letter from LWL is suggestive that LKY was deeply hurt and disappointed by LHL before his passing. It says a lot when a person has to change his will to guard against what his own son might do. It says even more when a son openly disregards his father's dying wish. The unspoken story of why LHY and LWL would take this action is likely to be more than just a dispute over an old house. It is likely to be because of how much LHL hurt their father in his last days and how they see this as the final straw. Also recall that article LWL wrote about how LKY wanted euthanasia in his final years. The latest revelations provide the background narrative for why LKY was so sad and depressed. </i></p><p><i>At the same time, the picture which emerges from the emails between LWL and LSF is also incredibly sad. A daughter who forces her aged dying father to "capitulate" to her will. A daughter in law who rejoices at her "victory" of forcing a dying old man. LKY's birthday celebrations reluctantly attended out of obligation rather than out of love. </i></p><p><i>Poor LKY.</i></p></div>
