              There are unethical assholes everywhere, including in Singapore. I myself kena before several years ago. Some asshole placed several thumbtacks (sharp side up) on the floor outside the entrance of Parkway Parade. I stepped on one, resulting in a sharp pain on the sole of my foot. Thankfully, I always only wear boots, the soles of which were thick enough such that the thumbtack only pierced the flesh of my foot, but didn't pierce through the bone of my feet. If someone else wearing footwear with thinner soles, his/her feet bones might have been pierced. I promptly disposed of the several thumbtacks (sharp side up) around that area. Bad karma for that asshole perpetrator.<p>

              If the materials used are completely non-toxic, it's all good. Problem is, since well over a decade ago, clandestine organizations (sneer if you will, but is it still a conspiracy theory if it's true?) had carried out such 'sunlight blocking' projects without informing and admitting this to the public, using reflective metallic dust particles or nanoparticles in chemtrials (different chemtrials contain different compounds to advance different agendas by different groups) released by plane exhausts, which are biochemically hazardous when inhaled by humans. While some of these clandestine projects are well-intended (the goal being to reduce global warming), who takes responsibility when unforeseen harmful consequences (eg. to human health) occurs?<p>Scientists dim sunlight, suck up carbon dioxide to cool planet

              N. Korea vows â€˜merciless blow with nuclear hammerâ€™ if US attempts to topple Fatty Kim<p><img src="https://cdn.rt.com/files/2017.07/original/597808a7fc7e93c4408b4567.jpg"></p><p>
              Meanwhile, there have been reports from US military sources indicating that North Korea could be bracing for another missile launch to be carried out as soon as this week.
              </p><p>
               An unidentified Pentagon official told AFP on Tuesday that Washington believes North Korea may launch an intermediate-range missile or Hwasong-14 type of an inter-continental ballistic missile on July 27, ironically, to mark the date of signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953.
              </p><p>
               Earlier, North Korea claimed it had successfully test-fired a Hwasong-14 missile on July 4, saying that the rocket flew 933 kilometers and reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometers. Pyongyang alleged the launch was its first ever successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. However, this data was disputed by South Korean and Russian military experts. Following the launch, South Koreaâ€™s intelligence service said that it was unlikely the North had succeeded in â€œsecuring the technology,â€� pointing out that the pariah state lacks the appropriate testing facilities and casting doubt over whether the missile reentered the atmosphere.
              </p><p>
               The Russian Defense Ministry called into question Pyongyangâ€™s assertions that the missile was in effect an ICBM. Citing its own estimates, the ministry said the missile flew just about 535km and reached an altitude of 510km.
              </p><p>
               Nevertheless, the launch was followed by days of lavish celebrations in North Korea, including a dazzling fireworks display, pop concerts with high-ranking North Korean officials in attendance, as well as Kim Jong-un himself.

              <i>On another forum, "Papsmearer" posted :</i><p>U have to ask above all, why is Whore and The Gay One having such a hard on to install one or both sons into the Prime Minister's seat down the road? Is it money? I don't think so. The Familee have more money then they can spend in a 100 lifetimes. Is it power? Can't be either. They have so much money and that buys power. Even if one of the kids don't get the PMship, Papa is Chairman of the PAP and controls the cadres and Ministerial appointments, Mummy is head of Temasek, Uncles and cousins ranging from the surname of Kwa, Lee, and Ho all hold prominent and powerful positions in various govt agencies and GLCs. Grand Uncle is President, though not for much longer. Papa will be put into a MM position when he relinquishes his PMship, and that is still a powerful post. So, the power is still there.
              </p><p>
               My bet is that they cannot find a loyal dog as obedient as Wooden. When Wooden stood up in ParLeement to defend Gay Loong recently, I realized that he has had their backs for decades now. I wonder what leverage they have on him. He obediently gave up his PM seat to the Gay One when demanded of him. He obediently did not whack Familee over Scott 28 and Nassim jade, where they should have been arrested for corruption. I am guessing they cannot find a trustworthy replacement for Wooden. If they put in another person to be PeeM, this new person (be it Tharm, Teo, KeeChiu, etc) cannot be counted to keep things the way they are. What if the new guy wants to put his own wife in to run Temasek and ousts the Whore in the process. What if the new guy threatens to expose their skeletons in their closet in exchange for hush money. Whore probably knows they have so much dirty shit going on that if they cannot put their son in to at least keep a lid on things and control it, they will be in deep trouble. He does not have to run the country, they have bureaucrats for that. But he has to protect and manage the familee assets and cloak of secrecy, which can be best done from the PMship. Maybe that is why they need someone in there.

              ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani police have arrested 25 members of an informal village council accused of ordering the rape of a 16-year-old girl (which was carried out) as revenge for her brother's alleged sexual assault of another girl.
              <p>
              The Supreme Court also requested a report on the case, which echoed a notorious case from 2002 in which another teenager was gang-raped on a local council's order. 
              </p><p>
              "A total of 29 people were involved in this ghastly crime, and we have 25 of them in our custody," Multan City Police Officer Ahsan Younus told Reuters by telephone on Thursday.
              </p><p>
              Earlier this month, a local council in the southern city of Multan was called after a family accused a 16-year-old boy of raping a 13-year-old neighbour.
              </p><p>
              The council ruled that the sister of the boy should be handed over to the victim's brother to be raped. The punishment was carried out on July 17 after her family handed the girl over.
              </p><p>
              The case came to light when both families filed criminal charges with police accusing the other family's son of rape.
              </p><p>
              Questioning both sides in the cases, however, soon revealed the role of the informal village council, Younus said.
              </p><p>
              "All the village council elders who ordered the revenge rape have been arrested," he said.
