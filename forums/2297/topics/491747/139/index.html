              Ahh full details finally revealed. It's not a road-rage case afterall. It's a case of a Grab driver taking 2 whole days to return a lost handphone (to be fair to the Grab driver, he said he was busy, but that the owner could drop by his place anytime to pick it up). The angry owner used a hammer to whack the Grab driver and his car when they met up 2 days later. The hammered Grab driver has made a police report. Fortunately for the police and the Grab driver, unknown to both the Grab driver and handphone owner, a kaypoh... I mean, concerned Singaporean citizen filmed the entire incident on his handphone. The proliferation of camera handphones and social media is actually a good thing, because without camera handphones and social media, most crimes would not even be made known to the public, let alone used as evidence. Eg. <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=video+of+wife+stripping+beating+up+mistress">wife beating up mistress in public</a>, etc.

              That's one of the best traits of the PAP Govt, they aren't complacent. And like it or not, the PAP is right that unlike most other countries, the dominance and continuity of the PAP Govt allows for more effective long term planning and implementation.

              Malaysian woman Loris Ng assaulted in Australia<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158738496775632">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158738496775632</a></p><p>
              Assaulted in Melbourne CBD
              </p><p>
               Two Fridays ago, around 1.00am , my husband and I got assaulted in Melbourne near Swanston Street. It was Little Lonsdale St between QV building and the State Library - a popular street right in the heart of Melbourne CBD. My husband and I had just parted ways with our friends at Swanston and Little Lonsdale, as our friends made their way back to their hotel accommodation along Swanston Street towards Bourke Street, we made our way up Little Lonsdale where we had parked our car.
              </p><p>
               We had just walked into Little Lonsdale when we could hear a couple quarrelling rather loudly and angrily by the wall of the state library. My husband also said to me in mandarin, don't look, keep walking. As the walkway was a little narrow I walked in front of my husband, soon after I could hear footsteps , approaching behind, the girl asked could i have a cigarette , my husband said , "sorry he doesn't have any", then she ran up to me, pulled my shoulder and said "what you looking at", before I had time to react or say anything she punched me on my mouth, I was stunned, then she threw me another punch, next thing I knew I was on the ground on my side and she was going crazy kicking and stamping on my head, I remember saying "why why are u doing this? What did we do?" And she just went on stamping and kicking with all her might.
              </p><p>
               When she threw the first punch before I fell to the ground, my husband was shocked and ask the male who had just caught up, "what's wrong with ur Girlfriend?" (thinking that the guy was normal) and the guy punched my husband in the nose, and started hitting my husband, my husband defended himself and tried to pull the crazy girl off me. 
              </p><p>
               I somehow managed to scramble up and ran across the small lane to QV side , and started screaming, help us please someone help us, a dump truck worker was slowly cautiously towards my husband and the couple , unsure as to what was going on, but seeing blood on my husband and my face. 
               Upon hearing my screams my husband turned and and saw the dump truck guy and ran towards him away from the couple. 
              </p><p>
               My husband and I called our friends that we had just splitted ways with and they came running, the kind dump truck guy, my husband and I then saw QV security guards and waved for them to come over, the guards say they can't do anything because it wasn't on QV property, but they stood with us and helped us call the police. They said that there were a lot of these African youngsters that hang out in outside the State Library, and a lot of this sort of cases that have been happening over the pass 6 months. The kind dump truck guy got us to take him number and name , and told us to contact him if we needed any help in verification etc he then left, 
              </p><p>
               After waiting for an hour and still no police, we went down to the QV toilet to wash the blood off, when we came out of the toilet, we bumped into a middle eastern couple, who had blood stains on her white shirt. They said they were assaulted by a bunch of African youngsters, outside Unilodge on Swanston St, they just started hitting her and then stole her phone after. They said there were apparently 20 of them going around the city assaulting and attacking people. 
              </p><p>
               But the weird thing about the couple that had attacked my husband and I, it didn't seem like they wanted to rob us at all, it just seemed to me like they were on drugs and crazy with anger. 
              </p><p>
               After waiting 90 min for the police to arrive, my husband and I were separated to give our statements individually, i gave mine to the policeman, my husband to the policewoman, after hearing our stories, they said the likelihood of catching the couple was slim, even if they caught them they would have to let them go because they weren't using weapons, I found that absurd, since I was on the ground defenceless, yet the girl was still going at me stamping and kicking my head at full force. 
              </p><p>
               The police did not seem very keen on us making a report, maybe there's too many of the same cases happening, we still asked for a report in case we needed to claim insurance for medical checks etc, and they assured us to email that to us by that night itself. Till today, neither my husband nor myself ever received that email for our separate statements from the police. 
              </p><p>
               I had previously lived in Melbourne for 9 years, I have always felt safe walking around Melbourne City up till this last trip. I wanted to share this story with friends and family that live or may visit Melbourne to please be careful, if need to walk at night, try to walk through shopping centres or QV building where there's security and cameras instead of on the street, or places with more people.

            <div class='col-md body'>[Lethal Weapon] - Martin Riggs, choosing to go to Mexico to try to assassinate the head of a drug cartel, to take revenge for his wife's death, is expected. What's moving, is Roger Murtaugh's decision to back Martin up, leaving his own family and children, to go to Mexico to help Martin, when he knows there's a 90% chance that he will die in doing so. Now while many will dismissively say, "This is just fiction lah!", but truth is always greater than fiction. Roger's self-sacrificing act of friendship and brotherhood, while fictional, pays tribute to real-life self-sacrificing acts of all forms and types in the real world, such as the heroes in WW2 who saved the lives of countless strangers at great risk of their own torture and death.</div>

              <i>nayr69sg, a Singaporean medical doctor now practicing in Canada, made the following posts on another forum, discussing about medical doctors suffering from depression.</i>
                  
                  <p>
                  I take Cipralex (escitalopram) and Wellbutrin (Bupropion) daily and Ativan (lorazepam) prn. I also see my counselor at least once a month. It is covered under the Physician and Family Support Program(PFSP) provided with my Alberta Medical Association Membership. I will continue to do so as long as I work as a Family Physician. Dealing with all kinds of different people almost daily with all kinds of self perceived ideas, paranoias and beliefs definitely gets one depressed.
                  </p><p>
                   There is no stigma here in Alberta. In fact I would say that if you have an existing mental illness it is advantageous as people have to be more supportive and understanding of you make mistakes. 
                  </p><p>
                   Singapore Medical Association membership basically gives nothing. Maybe the UOB Visa Card that's about it. 
                  </p><p>
                   Alberta Medical Association membership covers 80% of my malpractice insurance, CME benefits (includes buying of electronics eg laptops computers hand phones printers etc) up to $3000+, maternity or paternity benefits etc 
                  </p><p>
                   Definitely way better than crappy SMA. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                  Many Singaporeans hate doctors. This is why medical profession is favourite punching bag profession for straits times reporters. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Singaporeans also look down on teachers. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Basically if you are in a vocation likely they look down on you. Doctors cos they still paid pretty ok in Singapore they hate them.
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Singaporeans respect $$$. Lawyer, banker, rich businessman, accountant, CEO you know lah that list of top earners Ministars peg their pay on. Doctors are not on that list. 
                  
                  </p><p>
                  Leongsam : <i>I thought Lorazepam had been phased out and replaced with a newer generation of drugs such as Zopiclone which has fewer side effects. </i>
                  </p><p>
                  
                  
                  Zopiclone is used as a sleep aid for insomnia. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Lorazepam is used more as a short acting anxiolytic. Eg for people with panic attacks, phobias, alcohol withdrawal or sudden rage it is used sublingually (at least here in Canada) and works fast and has a shorter half life. It is not used as a sleep aid. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Nevertheless it is still a benzodiazepine (BDZ) and has risk of tolerance and dependence. I prescribe BDZs very carefully. And never for insomnia eg Valium (diazepam). 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Even Zopiclone can have risk of tolerance and dependence. Use of it less than 4 times a week lessens that risk.

                   In Canada prescribing of BDZs and Zopiclone is pretty liberal. Same with opioids like Oxycodone. They prescribe Oxycodone for things like toothache and simple headache! Canada is world number 2 in use of Opioids. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  I have to say though that prior to seeking help myself and going on SSRIs I also had bias against mental health and did not believe in the medications. Part of Singapore culture.
                  </p><p>
                  
                   But after taking Cipralex I found that it made me less reactive and I did not dwell on unpleasant encounters as much as I used to. So it does work. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   It is a hazard of the job. There are many doctors with mental health problems. You can read about it. Well studied. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Usually people seek help when things get really really really bad. Same with drug addicts. When you are still functioning well no one will seek help. For things to get better with mental health usually things first have to get a lot worse . 
                  </p><p>
                  
                  Previous editor of NEJM also tried to debunk SSRIs. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   But from personal experience the results I had is the same as what my patients on the same meds have. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   So now I think there is some benefit. Medication alone cannot do it all though. Exercise is important. I have a Concept 2 rower at home which I use daily. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Counselling is good as well. Having a totally non biased person to talk to. 
                  </p><p>
                  Leongsam : <i>I have been doing some reading on anti depressants and was surprised to find that Bupropion is actually a sex enhancer! 
                  
                   Sounds too good to be true. SSRIs are notorious for killing libido but this pill seems to have the opposite effect!
                  
                   It is currently being prescribed to smokers in NZ (under the trade name Zyban) to help them quit the habit and is being advertised regularly for this purpose. 
                  
                   NZ aims to become a smoke free nation by 2025 and the publicity is being funded by the tax payer. The drug is subsidized too.
                  </i></p><p><i>The old folks featured are the ones that ended up in hospital via A &amp; E. They've usually had a fall, a stroke or a heart attack and are connected to a myriad of wires, probes and drips but of course it is all to no avail.
                  
                   It is very unlikely they will be discharged alive and well. They usually leave in a box.
                   </i>
                  </p><p>
                  
                  No lah. Nowadays with technology we tend to keep them alive much longer. Fall....fix the fracture and get them to rehab units. Stroke, stabilize and rehab. heart attack - if they don't die in the first 24h they usually live with a stent. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   These cases are not the depressing ones. Those dying of cancer who keep going to A&amp;E are the ones more depressing. They are going to die. A matter of when. But keep going to ED when there is nothing much anyone can do. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Also the ones with dementia who the family have abandoned. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   Or in Singapore where the family wants to go on holiday and cannot find someone to take care of bedridden grandpa, so cook up some story send to ED and then go off on holiday nobody contactable for 2 weeks. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                   It is also depressing for health care professionals because in the training/school phase they are taught all these ideals of the profession. What is "right" and what is "wrong". Only to find that in the real practice we basically should just do whatever the patient deems is "right". Many take a while to grapple with this. If they get there faster they adapt better. If they hold out to the principles and ideals they suffer more. So I blame the stupid academicians.

              Obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder (OCD) is often confused with the separate condition obsessiveâ€“compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).
                  <p>OCD is egodystonic, meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept. Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is egosyntonicâ€”marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their self-image, or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.
                  </p><p>
                  As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them. By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.</p><p>
              Some (but not all) studies have found high comorbidity rates between OCD and OCPD. In psychiatry, psychology and mental health counseling, comorbidity refers to the presence of more than one diagnosis occurring in an individual at the same time. However, in psychiatric classification, comorbidity does not necessarily imply the presence of multiple diseases, but instead can reflect our current inability to supply a single diagnosis that accounts for all symptoms.

            <div class='col-md body'>A failure of an advertisement. No explanation on what exactly is the biochemical mechanism behind their supposed breakthrough 'deep cleanse' formula, or at least what the active ingredients are.

              Applying Occam's razor to the vast body of evidence, it's far more probable (and scientifically plausible) that extraterrestrial aliens have interacted with humanity both past and present, than to disingenuously pretend all of the vast body of evidence are all mere hoaxes (mathematically improbable, incredibly naÃ¯ve).

              The Myanmar plane carrying 160 people disappeared over the Andaman Sea, which is also where a Malaysian woman spotted a huge plane underwater on the day MH370 went missing (she only realized the next day when she heard the news that it must have been MH370 that she saw).
