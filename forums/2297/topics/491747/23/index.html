              UltimaOnline's comments : The photo (posted on FB) does indeed show the consciousness residing incarnated energy body departing the physical body upon physical death. If, as is common in cases of violent or sudden death, especially if psychological trauma was involved, the consciousness is unaware that he/she has already died, and/or is in a state of psychological upset or disturbance, he/she is known as a psychotic post-mortem (ie. psychologically unstable after death), and may be 'earthbound' for some time (the duration depending on individual cases, from several days to centuries in extreme cases). Due to vibrational mismatch, the extraphysical guides &amp; helpers may not be able to directly contact and assist the psychotic post-mortem directly, and may require assistance from intraphysicals, ie. psychically attuned people who are still alive, to act as a 'bridge' for contact and communication. The 'tunnel of light' often reported, is a trans-dimensional portal mechanism created to facilitate the journey of the post-mortem consciousness ready to move on beyond the physical, back to his/her higher vibrational extraphysical 'hometown' in the extraphysical so-called 'spirit world', where he/she rests and heals, reconnects with loved ones (from across all his/her lifetimes), prepares for his/her life review, and plans for his/her future physical incarnations or lifetimes. The duration of the intermissive period varies from a few weeks, to centuries, depending on many factors (including availability of physical body with suitable genetics and biochemistry and with suitable family and societal karmic links for the next upcoming physical incarnation or lifetime), but basically take as long as you/he/she needs. Some of you reading this (yes right here on this SgForums thread), may have a faint memory of the aha! moment, when in some of your past lives after you died, you remained unaware for some time that you've died (it can be bewildering and frustrating, when the living people around you can't seem to see or hear you, and you can't seem to get through to them), but when you finally realize you're dead, it clicks and the realization hits you powerfully, and you begin to make sense of things and take it all into your broadened perspective with clearer awareness, and begin your readiness to move on.<p>Here's the photo posted on Facebook :<br><a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/07/14/haunting-photo-from-fatal-crash-appears-to-show-man-spirit-leaving-body/">http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/07/14/haunting-photo-from-fatal-crash-appears-to-show-man-spirit-leaving-body/</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>ddstantleralive commented : <p>Okay going by the pic here either her and her husband have fairly decent jobs and don't live in the hood where such things happen to begin with, or he is one heck of a drug dealer. Ideally I would love to convey to this woman of the times to which I was treated with racism just for being white . Just for driving a coworker home, who happened to be black and lived in an all black apartment projects area. Had my life threatened just for being white and being in the wrong part of town. Once my co-worker stepped up and told them the who's, why's and such they backed off. Yet it wasn't the first nor the last time such an occasion happened. I've been pulled over by both Black and White police officers in such neighborhoods for no reason then because I wasn't in the parking lot long I must have been buying drugs. Try getting them to believe you were simply dropping off a co-worker. Ultimately the racist thing goes many directions effects many people in many different ways. Showing your children how to act properly is still the best way of teaching them. Knowing where your children are ensures they are only around that which you desire them to be. Want your kids to have the best chance at being and being treated decent,,,,, show them. </p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/gma/mom-asks-happen-her-toddler-son-becomes-grown-174139124--abc-news-lifestyle.html">https://www.yahoo.com/gma/mom-asks-happen-her-toddler-son-becomes-grown-174139124--abc-news-lifestyle.html</a></p></div>
