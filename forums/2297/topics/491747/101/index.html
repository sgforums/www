              As thousands of Australians seek shelter from a "monster" cyclone battering the country's northern coast, the Tokyo-based engineer believes that his bladeless wind turbine can not only stand up to the raw force of these destructive storms, but also harness that power to generate electricity.

              Shimizu's egg-beater shaped creation -- it has three cylinders and a central rod -- responds to wind coming from any direction and doesn't use a propeller to spin.

              Instead it takes advantage of the Magnus effect, a force that sees air curve when passing by a spinning object, such as a football.

              The victims included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya">Kenyan</a> African woman who was pulled from a rickshaw on Wednesday morning and beaten up by a group of men just because she was African. In Bangalore, a 21-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania">Tanzanian</a> African woman was stripped naked and assaulted by a mob in retaliation for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan">Sudanese</a> African student accidentally running over a local Indian woman. A 29-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo">Congolese</a> African man was stoned to death by a mob in south Delhi, reportedly after arguing with a group of locals over a rickshaw. In a recent mob violence in Noida, several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigerian</a> African men were attacked by a violent mob, including Amalcima Amarawa and his brother Endurance, who fled into a shopping centre to escape. A group of at least 10 people found them hiding inside the mall and savagely beat the pair to near death in an attack that was recorded on a smartphone, broadcast and shared across India on Tuesday.</p><p>

              That's why Mr Trump's infamous bragging lewd comments (eg. <i>"grab them by the pussy!"</i>) about his sexual misconduct with women weren't actually a liability at all. The people those comments offended weren't going to vote for him in the first place, and the people most drawn to Mr Trump liked him because he's an unrepentant male chauvinist, not in spite of it.</p><p>For liberal women, this latest all-male photo is a visualisation of our worst fears realised. For all the white male supremacist Trump supporters who voted him in, it's evidence of a promise fulfilled.</p><p>

              Poor coal mine work laborer in China marries beautiful Russian woman
              <p>
              In the second half of 2016, Chen, a poor coal mine laborer, met Sophia through a friend and managed to work up the courage to ask her for her WeChat. Afterwards, whenever Chen was done with work he would spend all of his time chatting with Sophia. Since he didn't live downtown, he entrusted his friends and family to give her flowers. Soon, he asked her out and their romance quickly blossomed.
              </p><p>
               Sophia said that it was love at first sight. After one week of dating, she asked off from work to go visit Chen at the coal mine. Soon, she decided to quit her job altogether to pursue their relationship. For two months, she lived in shabby mining housing with outdoor toilets and baths, and frogs and rats running amok. She said that while that may have been the hardest time of her life, it was also the happiest.
              </p><p>
               After dating for half of a year, Chen proposed marriage, and Sophia said yes. Currently, the couple has no flat, no car and no savings, but Sophia told reporters that they have something much more precious. "I believe that love is the most important thing. We just need to work hard, and I'm sure that we'll soon be able to buy a home and car," she said.
