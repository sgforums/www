              Either privately retake your O levels and get an L1R5 score better than TPJC's 2017 predicted cut-off point, then reapply. Or get all A grades for all your MI year end exams, then reapply to TPJC on that basis.<p>Finally, depending on which Uni course you wanna go and that Uni's requirements, you can also consider taking as a private A level candidate, which if the MI environment is so terrible for you, might be better than remaining in MI, if you're still unable to get into TPJC. But you'll have to ask the NUS / NTU / etc admissions officer on how to deal with your lack of Project Work as a private candidate. And of course, choose your subjects carefully (Eg. H2 Chem is compulsory to apply for Medicine).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Malaysia] - Gang syndicates often hire ex-policemen and ex-military soldiers as assassins.<p>At about 3.30pm, four men on two motorcycles, carrying two very likely fully-loaded firearms, rode up to Kandasamyâ€™s silver Honda Accord.</p><p>Jumping off their bikes and peppering the car from both sides with 18 bullets, the seemingly rehearsed move was done and dusted in less than 10 seconds.</p><p>Police later confirmed Kandasamyâ€™s affiliation to the notorious Satu Hati (SH) gang.</p><p>According to a police source, the organisation was formed in the early 1980s by a man who was only known as YB Solo. Its foundations were built on a creed which denounced involvement in drug deals and prostitution.</p><p>The gang justified to themselves that staying away from these activities would in some way maintain some sort of integrity.</p><p>â€œNot long after they were formed, some members started going against the creed and became involved in activities considered forbidden to the organisation,â€� the source said.</p><p>This caused rivalry among gang members, and the organisation failed to reach a unanimous decision and resulted in a split.</p><p>â€œSome of them remained in SH, while others who left formed the Three-Six (TS) gang,â€� the source said. Members who defected into TS started encroaching into the territories formerly controlled by SH.</p><p>â€œWhen the turf clashes started, one by one members from either side of the groups were killed over the years leading into the 1990s,â€� he said.</p><p>According to the source, these turf wars intensified over the last 10 years, with brutal consequences.</p><p>When a gang considers a certain area as part of its turf, the members would demand money from all businesses in the area in exchange for, what they prefer to call, protection.</p><p>Ranging from small to big business franchises, the thugs would demand a protection fee, threatening violence if the owners do anything less than cooperate.</p><p>â€œThe upper echelons of the gang in a particular area would approach the manager of the construction sites, restaurants and pubs to demand a protection fee,â€� the source said.</p><p>In this case, failing to comply would mean the site constantly harassed by these gangsters.</p><p>People interested to join these gangs were subjected to a process of initiation, while some considered it more of an orientation process. Initiation rituals among gangs varied, according to the source, with some involving self-mutilation.</p><p>â€œThe SH gang does not have many initiation ceremonies, but pledging loyalty to the gang sometimes meant getting tattoos of specific logos at specific areas on the body. Anything less would not be recognised as a symbol of allegiance,â€� the source said.</p><p>Once in the gang, the members most of the time earned their money through the aforementioned means.</p><p>â€œOnly several members who gained the trust of the higher ranking thugs would be given bigger responsibilities such as debt collecting. Only the brazen ones end up pulling triggers against a rival,â€� he said.</p><p>While not all members would be trusted to handle a firearm, according to the source, these gangs have resorted to acquiring gunmen trained in handling the weapon.</p><p>â€œSome former police and military personnel who were discharged for various disciplinary faults sometimes found themselves pulling the trigger for the same thugs whom they tried to take down while in the force,â€� the source said.</p><p>The use of former police and army personnel as assassins has become the preferred choice of many gangs, the source said.</p><p> Contact with the thugs would have been established when these officers were tasked to take down their organisations.</p><p>The moment of desperation hits when their steady pay cheque while working in the force is abruptly choked and the funds start becoming tight.</p><p>â€œSuddenly, you find yourself broke, but you are very well-trained in handling firearms. What else can they do to utilise that rare ability?â€� the source said.</p><p>In reference to last Wednesdayâ€™s shooting, the source said the shooters seemed like professional hitmen who managed to do the job while shooting in each otherâ€™s direction.</p><p>â€œIt is very likely the gunmen were very experienced and had tailed the suspect for a period of time before the execution,â€� he said.</p><p>Tracing back the culprits of the shooting would send police on a whirlwind as they tried to establish leads into the case.</p><p>The source said this was because of smaller splinter cells that formed within the rival gangs.</p><p>â€œThese smaller cells that share a similar code of conduct with the parent gang could end up locking horns with rivals over trivial matters that were not necessarily agreed upon by the gang leaders,â€� he said.</p><p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/gangsters-mean-streets-230100436.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/gangsters-mean-streets-230100436.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Singapore] - Imagine you had an workplace accident and your finger had to be amputated, and the doctor just gave you 1 day MC. Sure you'll like to show him your middle finger, except that you can't, coz you just lost it. The majority of lowly-paid, hard-labour, foreign workers in Singapore who get seriously injured in workplace accidents (including the true case of losing a finger), only get 1 or 2 days MC, because if the doctor gives an MC of 3 days or more, the workplace accident needs to be reported to the Ministry of Manpower. So the unethical employer orders the unethical doctor to just give 1 or 2 days MC, so the employer gets to keep his safety record clean and also avoid higher insurance premiums in the future. If the doctor hesitates to comply, the employer will threaten to send his foreign workers to other doctors in future, and the doctor loses customers. And it is the abused, lowly-paid, hard-labour foreign worker who suffers in rich prosperous Singapore.<p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/worker-crushed-finger-gets-just-1-day">http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/worker-crushed-finger-gets-just-1-day</a></p></div>
