              This Singaporean couple lost their baby daughter to a rare disease. They couldn't save her, but they've started a foundation to save other babies. Also, they mentioned in an interview with the Straits Times, that they "would like to believe she's in a better place now". Rest assured, she is.<p>

              It's only ethically acceptable (provided no additional cruelty beyond what is necessary) to hunt animals (including fish) for only food, it's common sense that unnecessary hunting for fun (so-called sports hunting) is just bad karma.

Chuck Norris would have fainted hearing about this.<p>

              If the teacher and the police officer weren't accomplices, then there right there, is his most impressive profiling skill (and he would be invaluable to spy agencies). The blonde girl thinking of a memory involving the name "Miller", that's no profiling skill, she's either an accomplice or he's genuinely psychic. As for his audience color / animal / name leading to the kitten in the box (bit of animal cruelty there) trick is by comparison ho-hum lame, and I've already figured how he did that. Of course, it's not a simplistic binary; it's entirely possible that he's using a mixture of genuine profiling skill, genuine psychic ability, and deceitful mentalist tricks (definitely involving the last category, eg. his relatively lame audience color / animal / name trick).<p>

              Jia lat. If the male staff truly didn't do so deliberately, he is really cock to do what he did to get himself into trouble. He could have used smart common-sense to hit on the curtains (why aren't solid doors used? why curtains?) at the same time he asks, "Excuse me, anyone inside?" (which he claimed he did, but she didn't hear him).<p>Also, note that the woman customer / victim is equally pissed off at the rest of the staff and management, for not apologizing or showing care and concern to her.</p><p>

              On a related note :</p><p>
              The excitement of moving to a foreign country can quickly fade as what was strange becomes mundane, what was surprising becomes routine, as your senses settle in to a new life.
               But remembering that magic of the first impressions helps me to appreciate what it is to live in the tropics.
               The sounds of Singapore are so evocative and one of the first things that strike - or wake - you. The first was the cicadas. The high-pitched crescendo of one of these little fellas seemed almost comical. How could it make so much noise? It sounded like it was going to explode from the effort. I wonder at how it has become a background sound although I am still trying to spot one of these noisemakers.
               The next sound was the 5am wake-up call from what I referred to as a 'whohoo bird' - I now know, thanks to my visiting parents' curiosity, that this is a koel. I started a war with this unwelcome alarm when I threw a tennis ball in the rough direction of its perch. I feel it decided to strike back when I was on Skype with my family with the window open, and every time I started to speak, this bird began a series of 'whohoos' - a cause for much hilarity for those on the other end of the call. The result - I am out of tennis balls but I can now sleep through the koel's calls.
               Then there is the low buzz of enormous carpenter bees. These big black monsters will send me skittering for cover - give me snakes or spiders, but my room is filled with bees. In my first few weeks here, a horrified taxi driver looked on as I jettisoned my laptop onto the concrete pavement because one of these beasts did a fly-by.
               The chirp of geckos took a while to place. Falling asleep I would hear this chattering noise and it took a few months to figure out that geckos, not curtain dwelling bats or birds, were the origin.
               Then there are the frogs (or toads) which use the drains as amplifiers for their midnight conversations.
               Not all sounds are from nature, however. Ceaseless construction work puts paid to many weekend lie-ins, and always in the background, there is a low roar of the city, like a never-breaking wave. But unlike other cities I have lived in, it is not punctuated by sirens from emergency services or the toots of impatient horns.
               The trees at first sight are gigantic compared to my native temperate England. From the rain trees which line the roads to the crazy mess of banyan trees, they are stunning. My favourites are covered in a beard of grass or the plain weird cannon ball trees with flowers as big as your face and trunks bobbled with cannon-ball shaped fruits.
               One of the major smells of Singapore was at first a mystery. I couldn't figure out what the strange smell was in supermarkets until I realised it was the packages of custard-coloured segments of durian.
               Mangos and pineapples have a sweeter flavour here than those shipped in containers to Britain. My taste buds struggled to place the rambutan, mangosteen, chiku, dragon fruit and jackfruit sold at the super convenient fruit stalls - another difference from home. 
              Coming from a country with a great tea-drinking tradition, I still find it strange to see take-away plastic bags filled with the beverage.
               The first thunderstorm I experienced in the Central Business District was electric. I yelped at the sound of the sky falling down as the wind tore my umbrella inside out and caught up my skirt exposing my thankfully comprehensive underwear to unsuspecting passers- by. I ducked at the sight of forked lightning and learnt never to leave home without an umbrella even if the sky is blue.
               After nearly three years here, senses can be dulled to what was once so exotic. But sometimes when the whohoo bird gets going just as the thunder cracks overhead and the air is thick enough to taste, I can feel those first days in Singapore once more.

              Taiwanese should, nationalistic-separatist pride notwithstanding, standardize their spelling to hanyupingyin in line with the rest of the Chinese speaking world, for practical purposes. Lee Hom doesn't make sense phonetically, it should be Li Hong. Similarly, Tsai (eg. Jolin) should be Cai, otherwise, the English speaking world will pronounce Tsai as Sai, not as Cai.<p>

              PCness notwithstanding, on a truthful blunt note, it doth also depend on exactly how 'fat' and also on the type of 'love' (because what you sense as love for someone, is in reality a unique psychological-biochemical-neurological-emotional-spiritual-karmic mixture of many different types of love energies, indeed a unique composition of various love energy types and intensity combinations, for each and every loved one), although there is of course, always a large variation or standard deviation between human individuals on tolerance or conditional requirements.</p><p>
