(Canadian investigators put it at over 1000 girls and young women raped, but only a few hundred of his victims came forward, and they managed to convict him for only over 30 cases of rape... "only" 30 cases...)<p>And now that his 24 year jail sentence in Canada is over, and he's a free man on the loose in Malaysia, what would you say are the chances of him re-offending in Malaysia? Malaysian Police say, "nothing we can do, he's a free man". Fine. Bookies are gonna call huge odds on this one.</p><p>Obviously his brain genetical biochemistry and soul karma is severely warped into irreversible and incorrigible sexual psychopathy. Not only do extreme serial rapists like him not want to repent, they couldn't repent even if they wanted to. To think otherwise would be a naÃ¯ve delusion, at the expense of all the innocent girls and young women he'll soon claim as his new victims.</p><p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/no-restrictions-serial-rapist-rights-penang-police-072500893.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/no-restrictions-serial-rapist-rights-penang-police-072500893.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding recent news reports and revelations of assaults on children committed by members of a certain religious institution in a certain country (not Singapore, thankfully)... Isn't it obvious to them? Or perhaps they refuse to see the truth, either because of actual naivety, or stubborn self-delusion, or both. Either way, harmful, to themselves and to the innocent victims. Artificially enforced abstinence goes against human nature, and thus God's nature, and is biologically and psychologically (and in fact, most definitely spiritually as well) unnatural and thus damaging and thus actually becomes a perversion of nature. It is well-documented, plus quite frankly, it's obvious common sense, that with (artificially enforced) deprivation of any important natural biological and psychological function (of any sort, not limited to sexual) inevitably comes the (backlash of) depravation, and consequently and accordingly, the assaults on the poor children (who are the easiest target for these deprived-thus-depraved perpetrators, tragically). Cause and effect. When you artificially enforce an (biological, psychological, spiritual) unhealthy imbalance (eg. of abstinence), how can you claim to not expect the natural consequent backlash to occur, as everything desperately seeks to be in healthy balance according to God's laws of nature? Naivety or self-delusion? Whatever the case, open your/their eyes and see the obvious truth. When you/they do not, future generations of innocent children will continue to suffer tragically for it.</div>

              They're all missing the point. Burning incense or joss papers is highly carcinogenic and unethical. And no religious god, deity, LaoZi or Buddha ever instructed their followers to burn incense or joss papers. The idea of burning incense or joss papers is a completely human creation fallaciously ascribed to 'religion' (indeed in the first place religion isn't actual spirituality as it claims to be, and all religions have been so problematic on so many levels in so many ways for so many people who suffered, and still suffer, and will continue to suffer, from religion in some form or other). Ironically, the karma for burning incense or joss papers and inflicting carcinogenic harm on others, is the carcinogenic harm inflicted on self. There are always ways to improve one's practices to make it more ethical, helpful and healthy for others, it only takes the open-mindedness and willingness to do so.<p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/religious-harmony.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2017/02/this-mans-post-on-his-neighbours-considerate-request-is-another-proud-moment-of-religious-harmony-in-singapore/">http://mothership.sg/2017/02/this-mans-post-on-his-neighbours-considerate-request-is-another-proud-moment-of-religious-harmony-in-singapore/</a>

This rule is set by SEA countries to maintain the faith and prevent dilution of faith (i may be wrong but that was what I was taught).</a></i>".</p><p>See, this here, is what I was talking about : with so many 'religious traditions &amp; rules' set by human communities or institutions for their own reasons, agendas and purposes, the line is inexorably blurred between what 'God says is right and necessary' and what 'humans say is right and necessary', all being lumped together under 'religion'. Religious scholars (of any and all religions) routinely and will always disagree with each other on too many aspects. So if the human community (eg. in a particular country) insists on a certain 'tradition' for instance, under threat of punishment or worse, can you still deny that it then becomes part of the 'religion' (at least for pple in that particular country)?</p><p>If you've understood this post, you'll know that it isn't directed at any 1 religion in particular, but rather towards religion in general : merely pointing out the truth about the human condition which few people realize, understand and acknowledge, or are willing to realize, understand and acknowledge.
