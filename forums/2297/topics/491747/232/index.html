              [Medical] - Cancer survivors age faster and die sooner, scientific study suggests<p>
              <img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2017/12/08/TELEMMGLPICT000102204769_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg"></p><p>
              
              Cancer survivors age faster and are far more likely to die sooner than people who have never had the disease, a major study has shown.
              </p><p>
              A review into more than 1,200 published articles found that the average life expectancy of childhood cancer survivors is 30 per cent lower than the general population.
              </p><p>
              It means that a youngster who suffered cancer is likely to die in their 50s rather than 80s.
               </p><p>
              In general, cancer survivors are also more likely to develop long term conditions, such as heart problems, lung scarring, secondary cancers and frailty. They will also get age-associated illnesses sooner than the general population, the analysis suggests.
              </p><p>
              The researchers also found that cancer survivors had shorter telomeres - the protective caps on the end of chromosomes which are a marker of ageing - suggesting they have grown older than their actual years.
              </p><p>
              The researchers say much of the illness and accelerated ageing is down to harsh treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which damage the bodyâ€™s ability to fight back from illness and repair itself.
              </p><p>
              Dr Shahrukh Hashmi of the Cancer Center at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who led the study said: â€œWhile ageing prematurely is a better alternative to dying prematurely, a better understanding of what drives this process presents an opportunity for improvement.
              </p><p>
              "We believe that cancer survivors deserve long-term follow-up for the mitigation of the late effects."
              </p><p>
              Around 52 per cent of people diagnosed with cancer in Britain will survive for at least five years.
              </p><p>
              But the analysis found that childhood cancer survivors are up to six times more likely to develop a secondary cancer, compared with the general population. The risk of frailty among bone marrow transplant recipients is around eight times as high as that of their siblings.
              </p><p>
              Likewise people given steroid treatments, are at higher risk of cataracts, osteoporosis, nerve damage, skin thinning, infection and impaired wound healing.
              </p><p>
              Some cancer drugs were also found to be associated with hearing loss, reduced thyroid gland activity, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, muscular weakness, arthritis, kidney and liver diseases, chronic constipation, and infertility.
              </p><p>
              Radiotherapy was associated with dementia, memory loss, carotid artery hardening, and secondary bone marrow cell and blood cancers.
              </p><p>

              [Medicine] - Stanford University's revolutionary approach of using the body's own immune system against the cancer, works â€œstartlingly wellâ€�, where all other methods (eg. chemotherapy, radiation therapy) have failed.<p>Scientists at Stanford University in the US found that injecting tiny amounts of two drugs directly into a tumour not only kills the original cancer, but also triggers an â€œamazing body-wideâ€� reaction which destroys distant cancer cells and all other tumours throughout the entire body.</p><p>90% of advanced-stage cancer-ridden mice were completely cured of cancer after a single injection, and 100% of the mice were completely cured of cancer after a 2nd injection. With this approach, finally the cure for cancer is closer within reach than ever before.</p><p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Officially, all the Arab nations hate Israel and pledge themselves to the Palestinian cause. Unofficially however, all the Arab nations are now secretly allying with Israel, because they need Israel's help and military prowess in the ongoing struggle against common enemies such as ISIS, Iran, and the many militant terrorist groups associated with either or both. That's realpolitik for you.</div>

              The problem with some self-professed animal lovers, is that they develop an  imbalanced extremist bias, willing to hurt innocent humans to show (in their misguided minds) their love for animals.<p>

                  Pregnant mother sought help to re-home her problematic pet dog in Sâ€™pore, kena rudely scolded (by a Dog NGO director) and told to throw away her baby instead of the dog</p><p>

                  Note : </p><p>Jason Ong is naÃ¯ve in his statement, "<i>There are no bad dogs, only bad owners.</i>". Aside from the fact that this case isn't about the dog being 'bad' (Jason is putting words into Joyce's mouth) but rather simply unsuited to share the home with a vulnerable newborn human baby, it is akin to the similarly misguided statements, "<i>There are no bad students, only bad teachers.</i>" and "<i>There are no bad children, only bad parents.</i>", which is incredibly naÃ¯ve.</p><p>
                  There is free will, and while parents, teachers and the environment do indeed contribute to one's experience, opportunities and hence character development, not to mention the overwhelmingly powerful influence of biochemistry and genetics of the physical body the human soul is incarnated into, but the most important factor, remains the free will of the soul, as well as the karma of the soul, which includes all experiences and choices of the soul's past lives and existences, which are ultimately still tied into the soul's own free will, whether applied in this physical lifetime or in past lives, ultimately all consequences are still of the soul's free will, personal choice, and consequences.</p><p>
                  As such, the student, the child, every individual, must take ultimate responsibility for his choices and actions (even if the individual is born into trying or testing circumstances, including a physical body with overwhelmingly powerful genetic influences, his/her soul chose, either directly or indirectly, either consciously or unconsciously, either willingly or unwillingly, for the purpose of opportunities for experiences and free will execution for his/her own personal karmic growth, learning and soul evolution).
                  </p><p>
                  As such, just as every human individual is unique (taking into consideration all the permutations and combinations of all the complex of factors described in preceding paragraphs), likewise for individual animals, especially ones which are more individualized and emotionally &amp; intellectually developed, such as dogs. They have their own individual souls with individual free-will as well, and hence individual self-responsibility as well, quite separate from the karmic responsibility of the pet owners, or teachers, or parents, or society in general to care for the less fortunate, etc. All are valid simultaneously.

              Chemical in McDonaldâ€™s fries may be the cure for baldness, study finds<p>

              For decades, McDonalds has been quietly adding a chemical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydimethylsiloxane">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</a> into the oil used for cooking French fries, simply because PDMS reduces oil splattering at high temperatures, making French fries easier to cook.</p><p>Now, a research team from Japan have found that PDMS helps hair grow on mice, and they expect the findings to be applicable to human beings as well. </p><p>
              Who knows what else McDonalds or other giant F&amp;B brands, have been adding to our foods too all these years without a full understanding of their biochemical effects, eh?</p><p>

              In 2015, 3 American tourists who took down (MMA style) an armed terrorist gunman on a train in France, while all other passengers were frozen in fear, get to act as themselves in a movie (now screening in Singapore cinemas) based on this real-life incident. Even the victim who got shot in the neck by the gunman and almost died, gets to play himself and re-experience the trauma (without the pain), most certainly a cathartic opportunity. The terrorist gunman though, is still in jail, and won't get to play himself (even if the guns are loaded with blanks). He won't even be paid licensing fees for the movie, but the gunshot victim will be paid (actor's fees), and of course, especially well-compensated will be the 3 American tourists themselves (who will earn actors' fees together with copyright licensing fees). A rare happy case in which being the hero, does pay.

              If the Malaysian 100-member-strong team of police officers, park rangers, firemen and civilian volunteers hadn't found them when they did, the Singaporean couple would be in danger of losing their lives, with their water supply having run out and lost in the dense forests.<p>

              [Singapore] - Multi-millionaire who earned $20k+ monthly salary for 2 decades, and now still owns several fully paid up properties now being rented out (ie. he's still earning over $10k monthly passive income), complains he's now feeling depressed and suicidal because he's out of a job and nobody wants to hire him. Wtf.<p>
