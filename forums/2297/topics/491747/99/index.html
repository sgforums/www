                  Not only that, the trolls took the time to study planes flying over the flag, and cross-referred it to flight-tracking services.

                  These users also studied the constellation patterns behind the flag at night, in order to triangulate the location.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Having narrowed down the area, one user also left the comforts of his home to drive around the suspected location while honking his car horn, which was eventually heard on the livestream.</i>

              <i>On the 25th March, today at 1.55pm, my sister was assaulted by a GrabTaxi driver while coming back home together with my mother &amp; grandmother from Joo Chiat Complex. 
                  
                   My sister booked GrabTaxi driver, Txx Sxxx Hxxx, Transcab Renault (SHC5433R) at 1.27pm. Throughout the trip the driver didn't talk, but started to show signs of temper when they got stuck at a traffic jam nearby Bedok Reservoir Road. 
                  
                   He began to hurl vulgarities at my family telling them he is in a rush and all my sister asked him was, if he was in a rush why did he accept their booking (Grab can choose and accept riders by their destination), that agitated him and he punched my sister on her right neck and arm, grabbing her hand tight asking her to pay &amp; get off this taxi. 
                  
                   At this moment the taxi was just 1 bustop away from reaching my house. As all were ladies in the taxi, my mother got worried and paid the driver $15 (fare was $13.23) without receiving any change. They managed to walk home and later made a police report. Grab are now assisting us with this issue as well and suspended the driver's account for now. 
                  
                   I'm extremely frustrated over this issue that happened to my family. I hope all my FB friends can share this post to alert others of this driver as he still can pick up passengers because it's a taxi. We didn't manage to get through Transcab.</i><p><img src="https://scontent-sin6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17523066_1407438849276316_7929585007132729801_n.jpg?oh=80a84b373b859af53e16aaac1736b31d&amp;oe=596137BB"></p><p><img src="https://scontent-sin6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17522923_1407438829276318_375527980235786030_n.jpg?oh=3295ecf438287b83422d9d7dbd65db95&amp;oe=595D72D7"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>[USA] - Gangster abducts 8 women to pimp them out as his sex slaves in various strip clubs, but may not be convicted, as his lawyer claims in his <a href="http://writingexplained.org/defence-vs-defense-difference">defence/defense</a>, "<i>If they weren't willing, why didn't the women run away?</i>" Ans : because he threatened to get his gang to kill them if they didn't do as he demanded (and besides, one did eventually run away, or at least call 911). This gangster's highly risky (to himself) modus operandi differs from most sex slave trafficking gangs who keep their sex slaves locked up on their own premises for customers to use on-the-spot. It's no wonder one of the girls managed to call 911 for help.

              Indonesian girl howls through circumcision as debate heats up<br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-girl-howls-circumcision-debate-heats-033425774.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-girl-howls-circumcision-debate-heats-033425774.html</a><p>
                      
                      This is problematic in many ways. If a particular traditional act (religious or otherwise) is clearly unethical and no longer appropriate (due to advancing medical knowledge about the negative consequences, unknown centuries ago), then it becomes a fallacy to use the name of religion, any religion, to continue justifying the act. Furthermore, and more to the point, different Islamic authorities have opposing views on the matter, which is to say, it's fallacious to insist, "<i>my religion requires it</i>", because that isn't true. The problem is that cultural traditions and religious requirements are too often erroneously mixed up together.</p><p>
                      <i>There is no requirement for FGM in the Qur'an. There is no consensus whether the hadiths support or forbid FGM. Different schools of Islamic jurisprudence have expressed different views on FGM. Fatwas in favor of FGM have been issued in many Islamic countries, while some fatwas forbid FGM, and some ambivalent fatwas have also been issued that leave the choice to the parents.</i> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation</a></p><p>
                       
                      On the adverse medical consequences and psychological trauma of FGM :</p><p>
                      <i>When the pain subsides, it is far from all better. The girls in the classroom don't know that removing part of their clitoris not only endangers their health but reflects deep-rooted archaic attitudes that women do not have the right to control their own sexuality. The physical risks alone include infection, haemorrhage, scarring, urinary and reproductive problems, and death. When Yarsi University researchers interviewed girls aged 15-18 for their 2010 study, they found many were emotionally traumatised when they learned their genitals had been cut during childhood. They experienced problems such as depression, self-loathing, loss of interest in sex and a compulsive need to urinate.</i> - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/18/female-genital-mutilation-circumcision-indonesia">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/18/female-genital-mutilation-circumcision-Indonesia</a>
                      </p><p><i>Debate within Indonesia has been heating up in recent times, with activists and even a major Muslim organisation arguing against female circumcision, saying it violates a woman's right to do as she wishes with her body. "There are no verses in the Koran that require or allow female circumcision," Khorirah Ali, a member of the government-backed national commission on violence against women, told AFP. The country's second-biggest Muslim organisation, Muhammadiyah, discourages its followers from partaking in circumcision but the largest, Nahdlatul Ulama, and the country's top Islamic authority the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) are still in favour. The issue is a hot potato and the government has flip-flopped in recent years. In 2006, the health ministry banned doctors from carrying out female circumcision, saying there was no medical benefit -- but the MUI hit back with a fatwa saying that women who undergo the procedure would be considered 'noble'. - </i><br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-girl-howls-circumcision-debate-heats-033425774.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/indonesian-girl-howls-circumcision-debate-heats-033425774.html</a></p>
