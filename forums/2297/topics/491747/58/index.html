Just knowing English and Chinese / Malay / etc, already opens you up to 2 vast cultural worlds. Imagine the vast cultural enrichment you would experience if you put the effort to learn a 3rd language (not dialect), such as a Romance language (eg. Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc).</p><p>Polyglots open up multiple cultural worlds for themselves, which is why learning an additional language is not only the most useful skill to take up, but also works and enhances your brain power like no other skill can.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=polyglots">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=polyglots</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stephen Hawking got this right.<p><i>The internet and the platforms that it makes possible allow very small groups of individuals to make enormous profits while employing very few people (eg. Facebook, Google, etc). This is inevitable, it is technological progress, but it is also socially destructive.</i></p><p><i>We need to put this alongside the financial crash, which brought home to people that a very few individuals working in the financial sector (eg. Wall Street bankers) can accrue huge rewards and that the rest of us underwrite that success and pick up the bill when their greed leads us astray.</i></p><p><i>So taken together we are living in a world of widening, not diminishing, financial inequality (ie. worsening Gini coefficient), in which many people can see not just their standard of living, but their ability to earn a living at all, disappearing. It is no wonder then that they are searching for a new deal, which Trump and Brexit might have appeared to represent.  </i></p><p><a href="https://www.unlimited.world/unlimited/this-is-the-most-dangerous-time-for-our-planet">https://www.unlimited.world/unlimited/this-is-the-most-dangerous-time-for-our-planet</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An American stuntman has died after being beaten up by Singaporean gangsters. Here's the thing : if you read the full story, you'll realize that this involves a series of 3 violent altercations (mostly between Ang Mohs and local Malays), and the American stuntman who died just happened to be a passerby (ie. he wasn't even a direct participant in the 3 fights). Over 20 people (including women from both sides) directly involved in the 3 fights didn't die, but this American stuntman passerby died, wrong place at wrong time.<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fatal-row-rioter-gets-30-months-and-six-strokes">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fatal-row-rioter-gets-30-months-and-six-strokes</a></p></div>

"Rogue 1", "Assassin's Creed" and "Passengers", here are 2 more noteworthy movies that you can consider watching : a serious (critics say depressing) Singaporean movie "Yellow Bird" about a local Indian man and a China girl, both facing racial discrimination in Singaporean society, who find an unlikely friendship with each other, and "Museum", a Japanese detective movie featuring gory murders.<p>Yellow Bird<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgvnWtWEsCY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgvnWtWEsCY</a><br><a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5871/cinema/114">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5871/cinema/114</a></p><p>Museum<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Km8WTRsnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Km8WTRsnw</a><br><a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/3397/cinema/60">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/3397/cinema/60</a></p><p>Rogue 1<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC9abcLLQpI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC9abcLLQpI</a><br><a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5841">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5841</a></p><p>Assassin's Creed<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haJD6W136c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4haJD6W136c</a><br><a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5842">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5842</a></p><p>Passengers<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BWWWQzTpNU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BWWWQzTpNU</a><br><a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5844">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/5844</a>
