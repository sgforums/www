              [Singapore] - The Myanmar maid was working for an Indian family (no mention of whether local or expat India nationals) at the Interlace condo. In her suicide note, she said her meals usually only consisted of 2 slices of bread and plain water.<p>

              India needs to learn racial and religious harmony from Singapore. Hindu extremists and vigilantes have violently attacked (and in some cases even killed) Muslims and other religious minorities for eating beef. And if you research this matter deeper, you'll find that many ancient Hindu saints themselves ate beef. The beef with beef is in fact really about political manipulation by unethical politicians exploiting this beef issue to win more votes, not unlike the pro-bumiputra racist policies of Malaysia by UMNO.<p> 
                  </p><p>In the latest incident, 4 government officials (who were likely themselves Hindu) from Tamil Nadu that were transporting cattle for a breeding program were intercepted and violently attacked by a gang of 50+ vigilantes who thought the cattle were being transported for slaughter. The government officials would have been killed had the police not arrived in time.</p><p>

              PTADER posted, in reference to Chee Soon Juan's SDP post on Lee vs Lee :</p><p><i>
              Chee needs to realise a few things:
              
              </i></p><p><i>
              1. He is held with the same (if not even more) contempt, by these Lee siblings than the contempt these Lee siblings have for each other. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               2. The two siblings are in a way better position to fuck up their brother than he.
              </i></p><p><i>
               3. He will come across as an opportunist seeking to capitalize on a he-said-she-said "private" family feud.
              </i></p><p><i>
               4. Lastly but most importantly, he needs to get this into his head, i.e. blood is thicker than water.
              </i></p><p><i>
               What he needs to do is to shut up, let the dueling be drawn out which will allow for more damaging shit to emerge instead of allowing the shit to subside or go underground each time he opens his mouth thinking he can score some political points of this saga. </i></p>

              Malaysia still in denial, and/or still trying to cover up. The US Justice Department has evidence that more than US$4.5 billion has been stolen from 1MDB, but Malaysia still insists not a single cent was stolen from 1MDB (because it would be problematic for Najib to admit otherwise).

               There was a story of racing rivalry of Au Boon Haw and Sultan Ibrahim of Johore. Sultan Ibrahim was a sportsman and hunter. The incident took place when the Sultan, enraged at being overtaken by Aw Boon Haw in his famous Tiger Car. Sultan Ibrahim fired his loaded pistol at the Tiger Car on Bukit Timah Road. It was considered lese-majestÃ© to overtake royalty even on foreign roads. Consequently, the British colonial administration forbade the Sultan thereafter from visiting Singapore ever again except for purpose of going to and from the Singapore airport, then located at Kallang.

              Nassim Jade &amp; Scotts 88 are the only 2 that made the public eye. And that was because the shareholders of the development company HPL went to complain. after all, they would also like such discounts and felt that as shareholders they should be getting it instead of some politicians and their families. Also, the developer and shareholders were alarmed when the Lee and Kwa family started "piling on". They only offered the discount originally to Gecko, but she brought in so many other family members. Developer cannot make her lose face so lan lan got to give the discounts to her friends and family too. All that is eating into their profit margin.

               The Lees/Kwas buy property every single year, but the other companies don't open their mouths and admit it. You can be assured that the Lee/Kwa Family and the PAP elites are collectively the largest private property owners in Singapore. Before they announced the MRT line extension to Marina Bay, no one wanted to buy the condos that were being build in that area. I hate many PAP elites were the main buyers for as cheap as $700/sq ft. Once they announced the MRT will run there, the prices shot up $1500 per sq ft or more. This is actually insider info, You think there is no corruption in singapore? </i></p>
