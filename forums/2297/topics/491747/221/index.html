              A judgmental ex-associate of mine suffered from cognitive dissonance when he found out that Yanni was charged with assaulting his girlfriend, "<i>But how can such a great musician composing such beautiful music be an evil violent wife-beater?</i>". The philosophical fallacy resulting in cognitive dissonance was the fault of this judgmental ex-associate of mine, and not with Yanni.<p>

              <i>In 1989, McLaren and composer Yanni arranged the "Flower Duet" into a work called "Aria on Air". The "Flower Duet" theme, taken from the French opera LakmÃ© by LÃ©o Delibes, had already been used by composer Howard Blake to accompany British Airways commercials since 1984. However, from 1989 McLaren and Yanni further arranged the "Flower Duet" and it featured in BA's "World's Favourite Airline" global advertising campaign of the 1980s and 1990s.</i> - Wikipedia<p>

                              <i>Yanniâ€™s version of â€œAriaâ€� are derived from two previous recordings, both featuring lead vocals by Monalisa.  First, the award-winning British Airways Commercial was recorded, then the hit  â€œOperaa House / Aria On Air" by Malcom McLarenâ€™s World Famous Supreme Team with the same vocals. Yanni liked the song so much, he asked Monalisa to re-record it again, this time for his Grammy Nominated "Dare To Dream" album. The vocal from the single originally used on the British Airways Commercial earned Monalisa the Clio Award for her performance.
                              
                              This song was inspired by a 19th century French opera called Lakme (â€œThe Flower Duetâ€�) by Leo Delibes. The versions recorded by Yannii and Malcom McLarenâ€™s â€œWorld's Famous Supreme Teamâ€� both feature lead vocals by Monalisa Young.  Monalisaâ€™s vocals were
                              re-recorded for Yanniâ€™s â€œDare To Dreamâ€� album.

              Philip Queree, a 37-year-old medical student, was convicted of indecent assault for his handling of a womanâ€™s breasts during intercourse â€“ people on the internet had a field day. The conviction last year was seen as the pinnacle of political correctness gone mad, and everyone seemed to be having a good scoff at the idea that grabbing someoneâ€™s breasts during sex might be classed as assault. </p><p>But, during this mass furore, the nuances of the case are being ignored. Mr Queree was not accused of â€œtouchingâ€� his accuserâ€™s breasts, rather, the woman (who remains anonymous) claimed that he used â€œexcessive forceâ€� after she had asked him to stop. During the trial, she said: â€œI was in a lot of pain. I felt he had been rough with me. I had never experienced anything like this in my life.â€�</p><p>
              Mr Queree wasnâ€™t accused of causing accidental damage. He was accused of continuing to cause harm to a sexual partner in the knowledge she wanted him to stop what he was doing. Of course, thereâ€™s an innate ludicrousness to the idea that touching someoneâ€™s breasts during sex might equate to â€œindecent assaultâ€�, but people seem to be using this case as an excuse to turn the broadening conversation about sexual consent into some sort of farce. 
              </p><p> 
              No oneâ€™s suggesting that grabbing someoneâ€™s breasts during sex is always a predatory move. But so many of us have experienced that uncomfortable territory, within the context of consensual sex, where things go further than weâ€™d like, or are rougher than we enjoy, or start going down a route we havenâ€™t agreed to. And just because the breasts are considered to be, sexually speaking, â€œfair gameâ€�, it doesnâ€™t mean we have to put up with people treating them like play putty.

They dragged her into their car on NH 91, just near the girl's village of Chandpur. Then they gang-raped and strangled her to death.

              As he was about to cross the road towards the floating platform, Muhammad Shahdam Junabi saw a group of people walking past him. Tan Chun Ming, Mohamed Nazrin Mohamed Bari and Muhammad Nurshahid Ahmad were part of the group.</p><p>
              Shahdam said to the group â€œ<i>Peace be upon you</i>â€� in Arabic but they did not respond to his greeting. He then commented, â€œ<i>This one confirmed not Islam, just donâ€™t mess with the wrong person and take care you guys, goodbye</i>,â€� in Malay.</p><p>
              Angered by the comment, Nazrin, Tan and Nurshahid confronted Shahdam. Tan started the assault by first punching Shahdam in the stomach. Nazrin then punched Shahdam in the face and pulled him to the ground. The group then continued punching and kicking him.
              </p><p>
              The trioâ€™s friends intervened and told Nazrin and Tan to stop attacking Shahdam. Nurshahid pulled Shahdam up and told him to leave. Shahdam then made a comment that angered Nurshahid, and Nurshahid punched him in the mouth.

              [Malaysia] - There was a bizarre case where a 51-year-old man lodged a police report in Negri Sembilan on Dec 19, alleging that a female relative had used witchcraft to make him ejaculate all of a sudden.<p>

                  The same man lodged another report on Dec 31, alleging that the witchcraft had affected him badly as he ejaculated at odd places.

              LKY wrote : <p><i>â€œA newspaper called the Eastern Sun was launched in 1966 by Aw Kow, the son of one of the Tiger Balm Aw brothers, known more as a playboy than a serious newspaper baron. After secret negotiations with high-ranking officials of an agency of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China based in Hong Kong, they lent him S$3 million. It was repayable over 5 years, with interest at the ludicrous rate of 0.1 per cent per annum. The undeclared condition was that the newspaper would not oppose the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China on major issues and would remain neutral on minor ones. The Eastern Sun incurred heavy losses because of poor management. In 1968 it received a further subvention of S$600,000. In 1971 we exposed this â€œblack operationâ€� funding by a foreign power. Aw Kow admitted it was true. His outraged and humiliated editorial staff resigned, and the paper closed down.â€�</i></p><p>
