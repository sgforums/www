              [SINGAPORE] - A 25 year old man is on trial for repeatedly raping a teenage girl between November 2013 and January the following year. 
              
              Koh Rong Guang, believed to be the leader of a local gang, also forced the victim, then 13, to strip in public, before taking a picture of her in the nude.

                      Malaysia does not want a return to the era of â€œconfrontational diplomacyâ€� and â€œbarbed rhetoricâ€� between itself and Singapore, said Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Tuesday (16 January).
                      </p><p>
                      In an apparent dig at former premier Mahathir Mohamad, who was recently picked by Malaysiaâ€™s opposition alliance as its prime ministerial candidate for the upcoming general election, Najib added, â€œIt was an era that we want to forget. We certainly do not want to come back to that era.â€�
                      </p><p>
                      Najib added that he did not expect the Malaysian election to change the nature of relations with Singapore, to which Lee added to laughter, â€œBecause you have confidence in the election result!â€�

                      Colleagues of Katarina Chlebikova, working at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), said that the 26-year-old Slovakian had been troubled over work and relationship issues before her death.
                      
                      In response to media queries, the police said that they were alerted to the case at 10.44am on Tuesday. Her body was found on the eighth storey of 61 Biopolis Drive, where the institute is located. â€œA 26-year-old woman was found motionless and was pronounced dead by paramedics at scene. Police are investigating the unnatural death,â€� they added.
                      
                      TODAY understands that Chlebikova left behind a note suggesting that she killed herself via nitrogen poisoning.
                      </i></p><p>
                      <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/astar-scholar-found-dead-lab">http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/astar-scholar-found-dead-lab</a></p><p>
                      
                      BedokFunland JC's comments on the chemistry involved :</p><p>Nitrogen gas itself is physiologically inert and non-toxic, unlike carbon monoxide. However, deliberately pumping into a room excess nitrogen gas, displaces all other gases from the room, including oxygen. This results in asphyxiation and death from oxygen deprivation, as would occur with carbon monoxide poisoning.</p><p>
                      That this method can be used, and has been used, to carry out covert assassinations, is known to agents of intelligence agencies such as the CIA, Mossad, MI6, KGB, etc. In the case of the 26-year-old Slovakian young woman in Singapore, she used this method for committing suicide.
                      </p><p>
                  Spiritually and karmically, the state of emotional and psychological distress that drove her to commit suicide, will accompany her into the afterlife, and will pose some difficulty in releasing her consciousness from her post-mortem emotional pain and psychosis, and she may need some time to herself before willing to accept and experience love and forgiveness, for sufficient healing of her psychological trauma to occur, before she can move forward vibrationally, onto the intermissive period proper, where further healing, life review and preparation for her next physical incarnation can occur. She will be supported by her guides &amp; helpers at every step of the way, even if she may not be aware of it through her emotional pain. Rest in peace now, Miss Katarina Chlebikova.

              According to media reports, a female student from the United World College (UWC) South East Asia campus at Dover Road was approached on the afternoon of 11 January by a man driving a van and who asked her to get in his vehicle.
              </p><p>
              The student ignored the man, walked away and informed an adult of what happened. The girl and her family later filed a police report.
              </p><p>
              Similarly, a female student from Tanglin Trust School at Portsdown Road was walking to school on 16 January when a white van stopped near her and two people tried to persuade her to enter the vehicle.
              </p><p>
              The girl ignored them and quickly continued on her way.

              <i>
              What does a ten-dollar note mean to you? An uber ride? 3 cups of bubble tea? 3 plates of chicken rice? Well, to a foreign worker, it could mean a monthâ€™s school fees for his child back in his hometown and a day of toiling in the hot sun. Would you give up such a precious piece of paper without receiving anything in return? Not many people would. We have met people who would not even give it up in return for a cute calendar filled with cute pictures and heartwarming stories of our doggies. Yet, during one of our regular stray feeding sessions last Saturday, one of the foreign workers from a factory that we visit every week actually approached us to beg us to accept his ten-dollar note. He hoped that we could use that sum of money to buy food for the doggies on his behalf. 
              </i></p><p><i>
              
              We initially refused his kind gesture and asked him to keep his money as we felt really bad to take his hard-earned money. Usually, workers approach us for canned food, kibbles or medication for the doggies. This was the first time that a worker had approached us to offer us money. However, the worker was adamant that we take his money and was choking and tearing as he spoke to us. We simply could not bring ourselves to reject him further. He told us that he felt guilty that he could not do more for the dogs at the factory as he could only go to the factory once a week. He badly wanted us to accept his money and feed the doggies on his behalf. As he spoke, tears began welling up in his eyes. We also started sniffing and tearing when we saw that, so we accepted his scrunched up ten-dollar note with much gratitude. Each fold in the ten-dollar note seemed to represent each day of guilt that went by for the worker when he could not visit the doggies to feed them personally. We were touched beyond words. Kindness writ large in the workerâ€™s little gesture.
              </i></p><p><i>
              Thank you kind man (he did not wish to tell us his name) for loving the doggies and touching our hearts. Thank you for reminding us of the existence of kindness in this sometimes harsh and cruel world. Kind deeds and kind people like yourself keep our faith in the human race alive and spur us on in our work for the doggies. May you and the doggies be blessed with more kindness and happiness. Mark Twain once wrote that â€œkindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can seeâ€�. To that, let us add that it is a language that the non-verbal sentient beings feel and reciprocate.

              A gay couple is suing a printing company for sending them pamphlets about weakness of the flesh and the â€œsin of temptationâ€� instead of the colorful customized wedding programs they ordered.
              <p>
              On the eve of their wedding day, Stephen Heasley and Andrew Borg, an Australian couple who were married last year in Pennsylvania, opened a package from Vistaprint and were horrified to find 80 copies of a pamphlet entitled, â€œ<i>Understanding Temptation: Fight the good fight of the faith.</i>â€�
              </p><p>
              â€œ<i>Satan entices your flesh with evil desires, and sin is the result of your failure to resist the temptation,</i>â€� the pamphlet read. â€œ<i>It is an act of rebellion against Godâ€™s holiness.</i>â€�

              Possibly the most brilliant video compilation on YouTube... that said, the guy who compiled this, didn't credit the dozens of other sources (YouTube or otherwise) he used for his compilation... but turns out it's common practice on YouTube, with many other similar channels making advertising money doing the same, without crediting the original sources. Just check out this 'Nopsclips' account, probably a syndicate behind this and other similar accounts. Video editing of this standard is extremely time-consuming, and with the frequency of videos churned out, unlikely to be a single person behind this account.<p>
