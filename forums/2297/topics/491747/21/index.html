              <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=luigi+vendittelli">Luigi Vendittelli</a> is a respected researcher in the field of UFOs, ET contact and abductions. In the video, he relates an account by the woman abductee, Lisa, who telepathically observes 2 aliens arguing with each other on how to process her. "She's not ready", while the other insisted, "Yes, she is". Exactly like how 2 human scientist colleagues in a research lab might disagree on how to process an animal specimen being experimented on. You can imagine the poor woman abductee pleading distraughtly to the aliens, "Hellooo guys, I'm right here and I can hear you! Don't I get some say on this?", and the aliens shooting her an annoyed look, "Be quiet, specimen." or "The opinion of the specimen is irrelevant to the objectives of the experiment."<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpPmPYWN8aw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpPmPYWN8aw</a>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Philadelphia Experiment.<p>According to certain accounts, the actual results of the experiment involve occurrences far stranger than anyone could possibly imagine. The tests being conducted were an attempt to render a ship invisible to enemy radar. This was to be accomplished by wrapping an electromagnetic 'bottle' around the ship in question, absorbing or deflecting radar waves. The bottle was created by two (or four - accounts differ) massive Tesla coils which acted as electromagnetic generators; one was mounted forward and one was mounted aft. Other accounts state that a series of magnetic generators, called degaussers, were used. When activated, the electromagnetic field would extend out from the ship and divert radar waves around the ship, making the Eldridge invisible to radar receivers.</p><p>When the actual test was put into motion, a number of unexpected and bizarre side effects occurred. As the electromagnetic field increased in strength, it began to extend as far as 100 yards out from the ship in all directions, forming a large sphere. Within this field, the ship became fuzzy and indistinct, and a greenish haze formed around the vessel, obscuring it from view. Eventually, the only visible object was the outline of the hull of the Eldridge where it entered the water. Then, to the amazement of onlookers, the entire ship vanished from view.</p><p>It was at this point (the vanishing of the Eldridge) that the true power of the electromagnetic field that had been created was revealed. The Eldridge had not only vanished from the view of observers in Philadelphia, it had vanished from Philadelphia all together! The ship had been instantly transported several hundred miles - from Philadelphia to Norfolk, Virginia. After a few minutes, the ship once again vanished, to return to Philadelphia.</p><p>To the Navy, the test had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Not only had they rendered a ship invisible to radar, they had made it optically invisible as well, not to mention causing the vessel to teleport hundreds of miles in a matter of minutes. For the crew, however, the trip had been a nightmare.</p><p>The test had managed to render the entire ship 'out of phase' with the surrounding universe, which is why it was able to travel from Philadelphia to Norfolk instantly. This phasing effect had drastic effects on the crew members. During the experiment, crew members found they could walk through solid objects, and when the field was shut off, men were found embedded in the bulkheads, decks and railings of the ship. The results were gruesome enough that some men went mad. Afterwards, several crew members simply vanished. A few disappeared into thin air; one, eating dinner with his family, rose, walked through a wall and was never seen again. Some men entered into what was called the 'Freeze'. This is where a man faded from view; unable to move, speak or otherwise affect his surroundings. Interestingly enough, invisible crewmen were still visible to other sailors who had survived the original experiment.</p><p>Seeing the horrible after effects of the experiment, the Navy discontinued all further research into radar and optical invisibility. The surviving crewmen were discharged as mentally unfit for duty and many were placed in insane asylums.</p><p><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/montauk/rainbow/philadelphia_experiment.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/montauk/rainbow/philadelphia_experiment.htm</a></p></div>
