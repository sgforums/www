              Poor pitiful girls (both the Vietnamese and the Indonesian), young women who were innocently and enthusiastically looking forward to their life chock full of dreams and aspirations before them; they must have cried countless times, knowing that certain death awaits them : they'll soon be sentenced to death (you think the Malaysian govt will allow the courts to find them not guilty?). North Korea's despicable tactic of using innocent civilians to take the rap, while the guilty perpetrators (the North Korean spy operatives who silently observed the assassination several meters away) expeditiously flee back to North Korea before the police can figure out what happened.

I didn't vote either way on his comment, because I see both sides all too painfully... this is 1 damn hell of a planet humanity has made Earth out to become.</p><p>
                  nate posted : <i>Afrlca is giving nothing to anyone . . . apart from EBOLA!
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  No. lt wiII not do. Even as we see Afrlcan states refusing to take action to restore something resembIing civiIisation in Zimbabwe, the begging bowI for EthIopia is being passed around to us, yet again. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  lt is nearIy 25 years since Ethiopia's (and Bob GeIdof's) famous Feed The WorId campaign, and in that time Ethlopia's popuIation has grown from 33.5 miIIion to 78 miIIion today. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  So why on earth should l do anything to encourage further catastrophic demographic growth in that country? Where is the Iogic? There is none. To be sure, there are two things saying that Iogic doesn't count. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  One is my consclence, and the other is the picture, yet again, of another wide-eyed chiId, yet again, gazing, yet again, at the camera, which yet again, captures the tragedy of . . . 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Sorry. My conscience has toured this territory on foot and financiaIIy. UnIike most of you, l have been to Ethlopia; Iike most of you, l have stumped up the Ioot to charities to stop starvation there. The wide-eyed boy-chiId we saved, 20 years or so ago, is now a priapic, KaIashnikov-bearing hearty, siring chiIdren whenever the whim takes him. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  There is, no doubt a good argument why we shouId proIong this predatory and dysfunctionaI economic, sociaI and sexuaI system; but l do not know what it is. There is, on the other hand, every reason not to write a coIumn like this.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  lt wiII win no friends, and wiII provoke the seIf-righteous wrath of, weII, the seIf-righteous.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  AIas, that wretched country [Ethiopia] is not aIone in its madness. Somewhere, over the rainbow, Iies SomaIia, another fine Iand of vioIent, KaIashnikov-toting, khat-chewing, girI-circumcising, permanentIy tumescent Iayabouts. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  lndeed, we now have aImost an entire continent of sexuaIIy hyperactive indlgents, with tens of miIIions of peopIe who onIy survive because of heIp from the outside worId. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  This dependency has not stimuIated poIiticaI prudence or commonsense. lndeed, voodoo idiocy seems to be in the ascendant, with the next president of South Africa being a firm beIiever in the efficacy of a IittIe tap water on the post-coitaI penls as a sure preventative against infection. NeedIess to say, poverty, hunger and societaI meItdown have not prevented idiotic wars invoIving Tigre, Uganda, Congo, Sudan, SomaIia, Eritrea etcetera. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  Broad brush-strokes, to be sure. But broad brush-strokes are often the way that history paints its gaudier, if more decisive, chapters. Japan, China, Russia, Korea, PoIand, Germany, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in the 20th century have endured worse broad brush-strokes than aImost any part of Africa. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  They are now -- one way or another -- virtuaIIy aII giving aid to or investing in Africa, whereas Africa, with its vast savannahs and its Iush pastures, is giving aImost nothing to anyone, apart from AlDS. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  MeanwhiIe, Africa's peopIes are outstripping their resources, and causing catastrophic ecoIogicaI degradation. By 2050, the popuIation of Ethlopia wiII be ;77 miIIion: The equivaIent of France, Germany and BeneIux today, but Iocated on the parched and increasingIy protein-free wasteIands of the Great Rift VaIIey. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  So, how much sense does it make for us activeIy to increase the aduIt popuIation of what is aIready a vastIy over-popuIated, environmentaIIy devastated and economicaIIy dependent country? 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  How much moraIity is there in saving an Ethlopian chiId from starvation today, for it to survive to a Iife of brutaI circumcision, poverty, hunger, vioIence and sexuaI abuse, resuIting in another haIf-dozen such wide-eyed chiIdren, with comparabIy joIIy IittIe Iives ahead of them? Of course, it might make you feel better, which is a prime reason for so much charity. But that is not good enough. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  For seIf-serving generosity has been one of the curses of Africa. lt has sustained poIiticaI systems which wouId otherwise have coIIapsed. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  lt proIonged the Eritrean-Ethlopian war by nearIy a decade. lt is inspiring BiII Gates' programme to rid the continent of maIaria, when, in the aImost compIete absence of personaI seIf-discipIine, that disease is one of the most efficacious forms of popuIation-controI now operating. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                  lf his programme is successfuI, tens of miIIions of chiIdren who wouId otherwise have died in infancy wiII survive to aduIthood, he boasts. Oh good: then what? l know. Let them aII come here. Yes, that's an idea.

              He could have saved over Sg$100 million expenditure on this trip if he came incognito, but instead decided he needed his huge personal army to come holiday with him. Indonesia needs his money and his business, so they'll pull out all the stops, no problem. In the USA however, disrupting public life, locations and accessibilities, including deploying thousands of US military and US police personnel just for a elite super-rich foreigner to come have a private holiday, would only highlight the atrocious rich-poor divide in the world, and no way the American people would accept that without angry, violent protests.

              <i>Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal gives the most refreshingly insightful analysis of Donald Trump ever written. He took the words right outta my mouth. He's 100% on the bull's eye about Trump and how he works.</i><p><a href="http://time.com/4675860/donald-trump-fake-news-attacks/">http://time.com/4675860/donald-trump-fake-news-attacks/</a></p><p>
                                  Consider this recent exchange he had with Bill Oâ€™Reilly. Oâ€™Reilly asks:
                                  </p><p>
                                  <i>"Is there any validity to the criticism of you that you say things that you canâ€™t back up factually, and as the President you say there are three million illegal aliens who voted and you donâ€™t have the data to back that up, some people are going to say that itâ€™s irresponsible for the President to say that."</i>
                                  </p><p>
                                  
                                  
                                  
                                  To which Trump only replies:
                                  </p><p>
                                  <i>"Many people have come out and said Iâ€™m right!"</i>
                                  </p><p>
                                  Now many people also say Barack Obama was born in Kenya, or that the Earth is flat. â€œMany people sayâ€� is whatâ€™s known as an argumentum ad populum. If we were a nation of intelligent logicians, we would dismiss the argument as dumb and invalid.
                                  </p><p>
                                  But we are not a nation of intelligent logicians.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Itâ€™s important not to dismiss the presidentâ€™s reply simply as dumb, dumb though it may be. In fact, itâ€™s darkly brilliant â€” if not in intention then certainly in effect (ie. Trump is not smart enough to be consciously aware of this to be deliberately doing this, but he inadvertently ends up employing cunningly deceitful tactics without realizing it) : Trump is responding to a claim of fact, not by denying the fact, but by denying the claim that facts are relevant or supposed to have on an argument.
                                  </p><p>
                                  He isnâ€™t telling Oâ€™Reilly that heâ€™s got his facts wrong. Heâ€™s saying that, as far as he is concerned, facts, as most people understand the term, donâ€™t matter : That they are indistinguishable from, and interchangeable with, opinion; and that statements of fact neednâ€™t have any purchase against a man who is either sufficiently powerful to ignore them or sufficiently shameless to deny them â€” or, in his case, both.
                                  </p><p>
                                  If a public figure tells a whopping lie or outrageously offensive comment just once in his life, itâ€™ll ruin his career and haunt him into his grave. If he lies and offends morning, noon and night, it will become almost impossible to remember any one particular lie or offence. Outrage will fall victim to its own ubiquity. Itâ€™s the same truth contained in Stalinâ€™s famous remark that the death of one man is a tragedy but the death of a million is a statistic.
                                  </p><p>
                                  One of the most interesting phenomena during the presidential campaign was waiting for Trump to say that one thing that would surely break the back of his candidacy.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Would it be his slander against Mexican immigrants? Or his slur about John McCainâ€™s record as a POW? Or his lie about New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11? Or his sexist attacks on Megyn Kelly (Trump deduces she disagreed with him because she must be menstruating), or mocking a physically disabled New York Times reporter for being disabled? Would it be him tweeting quotations from Benito Mussolini, or his sly overtures to David Duke and the alt-right? Would it be his unwavering praise of Vladimir Putin? Would it be his refusal to release his tax returns, or the sham that seems to been perpetrated on the saps who signed up for his Trump U courses? Would it be the tape of him with Billy Bush?
                                  </p><p>
                                  Not only has none of these hurt him, on the contrary, it helped him lots. Some people became desensitized by the never-ending assaults on what was once quaintly known as â€œhuman decency.â€� Others seemed to positively admire the comments as refreshing examples of personal authenticity and political incorrectness.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Shameless rhetoric will always find a receptive audience with shameless people. Donald Trumpâ€™s was the greatest political strip-tease act in U.S. political history: the dirtier he got, the more skin he showed, the more his supporters loved it.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Abraham Lincoln, in his first inaugural address, called on Americans to summon â€œthe better angels of our nature.â€� Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy, and so far his presidency, has been Lincolnâ€™s exhortation in reverse.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Hereâ€™s a simple truth about a politics of dishonesty, insult and scandal : Itâ€™s hugely entertaining. Politics as weâ€™ve had it for most of my life has, with just a few exceptions, been distant and dull.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Now itâ€™s all we can talk about. If you like Trump, his presence in the White House is a daily extravaganza of sticking it to pompous elites and querulous reporters. If you hate Trump, you wake up every day with some fresh outrage to turn over in your head and text your friends about.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Whichever way, itâ€™s exhilarating. Havenâ€™t all of us noticed that everything feels speeded up, more vivid, more intense and consequential? One of the benefits of an alternative-facts administration is that fiction can take you anywhere.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Earlier today, at his press conference, the president claimed his administration is running like a â€œfine-tuned machine.â€� In actual fact, he just lost his Labor Secretary nominee, his National Security Adviser was forced out in disgrace, and the Intelligence Community is refusing to fully brief the president for fear he might compromise sources and methods.
                                  </p><p>
                                  But who cares? Since when in Washington has there been a presidential press conference like that? Since when has the denial of reality been taken to such a bald-faced extreme?
                                  </p><p>
                                  At some point, it becomes increasingly easy for people to mistake the reality of the performance for reality itself. If Trump can get through a press conference like that without showing a hint of embarrassment, remorse or misgivingâ€”well, then, that becomes a new basis on which the president can now be judged.
                                  </p><p>
                                  To tell a lie is wrong. But to tell a lie with brass takes skill. Ultimately, Trumpâ€™s press conference will be judged not on some kind of Olympic point system, but on whether he â€œwonâ€�â€”which is to say, whether he brazened his way through it. And the answer to that is almost certainly yes.
                                  </p><p>
                                  So far, Iâ€™ve offered you three ideas about how it is that we have come to accept the presidentâ€™s behavior.
                                  </p><p>
                                  The first is that we normalize it, simply by becoming inured to constant repetition of the same bad behavior.
                                  </p><p>
                                  The second is that at some level it excites and entertains us. By putting aside our usual moral filtersâ€”the ones that tell us that truth matters, that upright conduct matters, that things ought to be done in a certain wayâ€”we have been given tickets to a spectacle, in which all you want to do is watch.
                                  </p><p>
                                  And the third is that we adopt new metrics of judgment, in which politics becomes more about perceptions than performanceâ€”of how a given action is perceived as being perceived. If a reporter for the New York Times says that Trumpâ€™s press conference probably plays well in Peoria, then that increases the chances that it will play well in Peoria.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Let me add a fourth point here: people's tendency to rationalize in service of their own political agendas.
                                  </p><p>
                                  One of the more fascinating aspects of last yearâ€™s presidential campaign was the rise of a class of pundits I call the â€œTrumpXplainers.â€� For instance, Trump would often give an unprepared, illogical and outright dumb speech or reply.
                                  </p><p>
                                  But rather than quote Trump, or point out that what he had said was grammatically and logically nonsensical, the TrumpXplainers would tell us what he had allegedly meant to say. They became our political semioticians, ascribing pattern and meaning to the illogical, nonsensical and incomprehensible rune-stones of Trumpâ€™s mind.
                                  </p><p>
                                  If Trump said heâ€™d get Mexico to pay for his wall, a ridiculously illogical idea that he isn't smart enough to carry out on his own, you could count on someone, a supporter or staff, to provide a complex tariff scheme to make good on the promise. If Trump said that we should not have gone into Iraq but that, once there, we should have â€œtaken the oil,â€� weâ€™d have a similarly high-flown explanation from a supporter or staff as to how we could engineer this impossible theft.
                                  </p><p>
                                  A year ago, when he was trying to explain his idea of a foreign policy to the New York Timesâ€™s David Sanger, the reporter asked him whether it didnâ€™t amount to a kind of â€œAmerica First policyâ€�â€”a reference to the isolationist and anti-Semitic America First Committee that tried to prevent U.S. entry into World War II. Trump clearly had never heard of the group, but he liked the phrase and made it his own. And thatâ€™s how we got the return of America First.
                                  </p><p>
                                  More recently, I came across this headline in the conservative Washington Times: â€œHow Trumpâ€™s â€˜disarrayâ€™ may be merely a strategy,â€� by Wesley Pruden, the paperâ€™s former editor-in-chief. In his view, the presidentâ€™s first disastrous month in office is, in fact, evidence of a refreshing openness to dissent, reminiscent of Washington and Lincolnâ€™s cabinet of rivals. Sure.
                                  </p><p>
                                  Overall, the process is one in which explanation becomes rationalization, which in turn becomes justification. Trump says X. What he really means is Y. And while you might not like it, heâ€™s giving voice to the angers and anxieties of Z. Who, by the way, youâ€™re not allowed to question or criticize, because anxiety and anger are their own justifications these days.
                                  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bodybuilder vs Brazilian JiuJitsuer : if both were approximately equal in body mass, the BJJer would definitely win (unless the bodybuilder cunningly drenched himself in oil or Vaseline), because while bodybuilding focuses on building body mass, martial arts (of any type) focuses on the skills to take down an opponent in combat.<p>However, as the following video illustrates and reminds, brute muscle strength is still important and should not be neglected or dismissed. While the BJJer eventually won (by the skin of his teeth), it's a terribly close fight because in this match, the bodybuilder is significantly stronger, heavier and more muscular than the BJJer.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVeD6k_xHTM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVeD6k_xHTM</a></p></div>

              Marvel Trivia : the X-Men comic book that Wolverine reads in the Logan movie, isn't a real-life Marvel comic book, but instead was created just for the movie, by an actual Marvel comic book artist, Dan Panosian.<p>No doubt if Marvel ever published limited copies this fiction-within-fiction comic book in real-life, it would be a valuable collector's edition, for obvious meta reasons.</p><p>Here's a look into a few pages from the non-existent X-Men comic book.
