            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently, a Singaporean car driver drove over a motorcyclist's foot, then gave the middle finger and shouted at the motorcyclists, then challenged them to a fight, then started fighting with 2 or 3 motorcyclists (who may or may not be Singaporean). In the video, you can clearly see a ponytail girl involved in the fight, and she may or may not be the motorcyclist whose foot the car driver ran over.<p><img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/causeway-helmet-fight.jpg"></p><p><a href="http://mothership.sg/2017/07/driver-mcyclists-in-helmet-fight-on-causeway-after-spore-car-allegedly-ran-over-someones-foot/">http://mothership.sg/2017/07/driver-mcyclists-in-helmet-fight-on-causeway-after-spore-car-allegedly-ran-over-someones-foot/</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The headline sounds gay. But seriously, Duterte and everyone reading this, go easy on the salt. While sodium chloride is a biochemically essential nutrient, 99% of Singaporeans consume excessive salt (worse, some of the salt you consume from various foods may not even be NaCl salt, but aluminium salts like what Macdonald uses, which causes brain damage), resulting in high blood pressure and kidney failure. Do you know, Singapore has the highest rates of high blood pressure and kidney failure in the world? In addition to highest rates of diabetes, heart disease and many cancers. Another contributing factor for this is that 99% of Singaporeans are chronically sleep deprived (why do you think being an MOE teacher is one of the most health-hazardous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designation_of_workers_by_collar_color">white/pink-collar jobs</a> in Singapore?).

And there's more: There is evidence that United States government knew of her whereabouts and did nothing to rescue her and instead covered it up, according to the film, hosted by former FBI Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry.

              The anti-yellow culture movement or Fan Huang Wen Hua Yun Dong came about from the events of unsolved murder-rape cases of Cheong Gok Tin and two other girls before her, which were believed to be a result of society becoming more â€œyellowâ€�, a word that represented the perverse,  due to the spread of pornography and striptease shows.
              </p><p>
              Later on, the Peopleâ€™s Action Party launched their own anti-yellow culture campaign in June 1959, which <b>targeted decadent activities, such as gambling</b>, opium smoking and prostitution.
              </p><p>
              Therefore, the irony â€“ Chua Mia Tee's emotionally-charged artwork, which represented these students pushing to change society from its â€œyellowâ€� and colonial ways, is now featured on the <b>lottery tickets and advertisements for a nationwide lottery</b>.
              </p><p>
              Also, the draw is also called the National Day Draw, no less, with the top prize set at $5 million.</p><p>
              Renowned translator and linguist Tan Dan Feng, who noticed this, wrote a Facebook post about the ironic advertisement, highlighting the unfortunate placement of a painting that encapsulates such a rich history.</p><p>

              <i>The owner of Pasta J is spot on. The vast majority of Singaporeans have woefully little empathy and sympathy for SME restaurant owners (and in general, all SME business owners), and don't care that unlike MNCs, SMEs are struggling to survive just to fatten the coffers of REITS and greedy landlords. I've reproduced one part of Pasta J owner's post, click on the link to read the full post.</i><p>
              <img src="http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pasta-j-featured.jpg">
              </p><p>
              Guys, in the nearly four years I have been operating Pasta J, we have had the privilege of serving many, many great customers. 
              </p><p>
              But there are those who have really made life hard for us too unfortunately. These customers make us feel taken advantage of, abused and disrespected.
              </p><p>
              Some of these cases I will mention later but I would like to frame it as some learning points on how to be a fair to businesses. As will be listed below, each and every point is a result of actual experiences.
              </p><p>
              Again, the following points are the hard truths of running a very high cost business like a restaurant.
              </p><p>
              I have been putting off writing about this but recently things have been really bad.I am far from the only restaurant owner facing this but I guess, we all try not to rock the boat.
              </p><p>
              1. Waiver of Corkage: We pay rent, renovations, furniture, staff and amenities and utilities to earn a living (I have also continually reinvested to make improvements). Why should we then let customers bring their own wines, provide expensive, easily breakable wine glasses and serve them their wine for free?
              </p><p>
              Who will pay if the wine glass breaks? Why should we be paying staff to serve that for free? There is a cost for everything and we pay for it. And this being Singapore, we pay a lot for it.
              </p><p>
              I have had customers get indignant for charging corkage. I am afraid I don't get it. 
              </p><p>
              2. No Shows: A reservation is a commitment taken too lightly by some. Often, the no shows don't even pick up the phone when we contact them to see if they're coming.
              </p><p>
              We lose customers this way because we either have to put others outdoors (often disliked) or we have to turn them away.
              </p><p>
              How would customers like it if we don't honour their reservation?
              </p><p>
              For big reservations, we make special arrangements like getting more staff, preparing ingredients and if they don't show, we feel kinda of let down.
              </p><p>
              3. Having less guests than reserved: This happens for too often than I can tell you. Again, we lose customers this way and it really hurts when the customer treats it like nothing. I have lost many,many customers this way.
              </p><p>
              2 such cases are particularly bad. 1 was a reservation for 22pax by a group of army personnel in 30mins. We hustled. At the end, only 7 turned up and the entire group of 7 acted as if nothing happened and didn't tell us the rest were not turning up despite seeing all the other tables joined to theirs with the menus laid out.
              </p><p>
              Wow.
              </p><p>
              The 2nd was recent. Despite telling the customer that we will be making special arrangements to cater for his reservation for 24pax, he had 8 less turn up, didn't bother telling me until I asked upon which he admitted to reserving for more just in case.
              </p><p>
              Well, I certainly felt stupid to cancel my own lunch off and for calling back another staff who was also off.
              </p><p>
              No apologies for both and other other cases.
              </p><p>
              4. Late arrival n/or partially very late arrivals: This happens all the time for big groups. Sometimes, the entire party can be seated only 1.5 hours later. We will then have hold empty seats for that long.
              </p><p>
              5. Changing the recipe: The way I see it, you come to a restaurant to enjoy the restaurant's dishes, not to enjoy your own recipe, which logically, you would have to cook yourself. Why insist on changing it? Especially to remove the main ingredient? We have even been asked to remove the clams from Clammy Addiction! 
              </p><p>
              6. We have been trying to educate customers that it is wrong to add cheese to every pasta or other dishes. We work very hard to craft and produce our dishes, so forgive us pls if we refuse. 
              </p><p>
              From experience, adding cheese to everything is a practice allowed and done mainly at places where the food is bland and the standards are low. We believe our customers know better because logically, cheese doesn't go with everything.
              </p><p>
              7. Ordering too little and Non - Eaters: going to a restaurant should be an experience and restaurant owners like myself put in a lot of resources to make it a good experience. It hurts us when customers make use of us for meetings, to hang out or just to socialise without being fair to us.
              </p><p>
              We had cases where customers come in and order just for a fraction of their group size and then have friends join them and worse still expect us to serve everyone. I have even had 8pax come in and ordering 3 main courses and that's it. Then they ask for sharing plates for everyone.
              </p><p>
              Some think that since we are not full anyway, they are actually doing us a favour by filling up the seats. I have had this said to me to my face. But when we allow it once when we are not busy, can we refuse when it is busy?
              </p><p>
              Frankly, we don't mind occasionally serving such customers but it has been happening too often. Case in point above.
              </p><p>
              8. Not complaining then giving a bad review: Actually, we are grateful for opportunities to improve but I believe your dining experience is more important than a opportunity to give a bad review. 
              </p><p>
              It is probably more of a Singaporean thing to not confront issues head-on but this doesn't help the customers. If we were wrong, I insist on making up for it and you would then still have a great experience. If you complain only after, nothing can be done about your time with us.
              </p><p>
              9. Hogging tables: On busy times, we need to be able to turn the tables because that is mainly when we can make money and make up for slower times.
              </p><p>
              Other customers also want a chance to dine too.
              </p><p>
              It is really not right to expect to have the table to yourself for the whole meal service. There is no such thing as unlimited service.
              </p><p>
              10. Don't abuse the staff: I have found that when I am not around, my staff sometimes get bullied. Someone criticised us for not asking for the doneness of our pork chops and when told that pork chops don't come in doneness, he got angry and then picked on something else. At the end, he threw his receipt into our menu basket in front of our staff in a fit of anger. Don't do that......
              </p><p>
              11. Pls take care when using our amenities: For example, pls don't mark our sofa or let your children damage anything. We had a case just now but the customer was very responsible to inform us and offered to do something about it. I really appreciated that and thanked him for it. Just please do try to prevent it in future.

              Again, I hope everyone reading this understands that I am not trying to be personal. What I have written about is what we have been facing since the beginning and I have put off publicising it.
              </p><p>
              They're only basic considerations, basic manners and only what is fair. 
              </p><p>
              Everything costs us and restaurants are famously a high cost operation. We are not a cafe. Our main business is selling food, not just coffee, desserts or soft drinks. The bulk of our business is done during peak hours, they are thus very precious. 
              </p><p>
              On the whole, we have been blessed with a growing business and probably more than our fair share of great customers.
              </p><p>
              Basically, we hope to keep it simple. We want to serve food, really good food and provide great service to customers who will be fair to us because after all, we are running a business. 
              </p><p>
              Hope you all understand.
