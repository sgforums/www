              [Singapore / Video] - Dec 2016 Ang Moh fights local Chinese man<p>
              
              Driver's version of Orchard Rd drama.</p><p>
              "I am the person that was videoed using a stick to "attack" the ang mor at orchard road. Please also upload a video that i will send you, which shows the ang mor being aggressive to me while i just keep backing off."</p><p>
              "I was in the right most lane in heavy traffic, my lane was moving slowly forward. I then saw this man at the side of the road using a large bag to hit passing cars in my lane. When it came to "my turn" to get hit, I tried to outmaneuver this dimwit by moving to the left away from him. He still managed to hit the front windscreen of my car, and I hit the brakes because of the impact. After I stopped, he went completely nuts, hitting my drivers side window with his bag repeatedly. I sat in my car for a good long while, not knowing what to do. He continued hitting my windows, moving from the front to the back, then back to the front windows. I could not move the car without causing injury to him, either by running over his feet or hitting him with my side mirror. I noticed the impacts were so hard that the glass started to flex and wobble with each hit, so I tried to put a stop to it by getting out of the car and shouting at him to stop his nonsense."</p><p>
              "He then hit me in the face with his large bag. He hit me so hard that my spectacles flew off my face. I pushed him to defend myself. I retrieved a stick from the boot of my car to fend him off. As the video shows, he continued advancing towards me so I hit him. After I finally incapacitated the attacker, I got on the ground and searched for my spectacles, after which I called the police to report that I was assaulted. While waiting for the police, the drunk man got up and started trying to attack me again. I ran around, monkeying my way around his pushes and drunken punches. I think he managed to hit me one time as my spectacles flew off my face again. I calmly picked up my spectacles and backed away from him. He still kept trying to attack me, until i deflected one of his pushes and threw him to the ground, and finally a member of the public came to calm the drunk man. (As you can see, he stopped physically attacking me but continued verbally attacking me)."</p><p>
              "When I saw the police car drive by i flagged them down and told them the story. The police told me that his offence was "voluntarily causing hurt". I told them I did not want to pursue the matter, as I was not hurt. My car sustained some scratches and dents, some deep enough to expose the bare metal, but i felt that claiming damages would be more headache than what the repair was worth. When I went to the nearby police station to give a statement, a kind couple came in and handed this video in as evidence. Apparently they saw this drunk guy hitting cars earlier, and when they parked and walked out to the road, they saw this commotion and took a video to make a complaint about the drunk man to the police".

It was Lu Zhi who, in 194 B.C., wreaked revenge on a concubine rival by gouging out her eyes, amputating her arms and legs, and forcing acid down her throat to destroy her vocal chords. The mute and limbless concubine was then tossed into a cesspit in the palace with the wild boars.</i></p><p>

              My comments on the topic of the Yahoo article (linked below) : The true nature of the phenomenon known as Deja Vu isn't quite exactly as is commonly thought to be : often said to be the result of misfiring of neurons in the brain, creating the false perception of a time-lag or time-loop.<p>What has been called, Deja Vu, is actually several distinct phenomena. What the Yahoo article visitors (posting comments below the article) Shaun, HAPPY and patsy are describing, are mostly the result of past life memories, or more rarely, memories of an extraphysical being or entity or consciousness (or 'spirit' or 'ghost', but these terms are misleading), that is psychically intruding or telepathically shared with the physical incarnate person experiencing the phenomenon.</p><p>However, the actual phenomenon more correctly ascribed to Deja Vu, is a far more striking one, in which everything about the scene, including your own thoughts and feelings at that exact moment, is exactly the same as you had experienced before, the sensation being extremely distinct and strikingly unmistakable. It is difficult (actually impossible) to explain the cause of this phenomenon in limited human concepts and words, but suffice to say it can be considered a manner or modality of the consciousness time-travelling (not the physical body time-travelling, but rather your consciousness, which works with but isn't limited to, your physical brain). This is the actual Deja Vu phenomenon the Yahoo article visitors t, Steve and AGR are describing.</p><p>Yahoo article on Deja Vu : <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/heres-whats-really-happening-d-000000240.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/heres-whats-really-happening-d-000000240.html</a>

Clayderman, an unknown young pianist at the time, auditioned and was selected out of 20 candidates to perform the song. They were hoping for 10,000 copies of the song to be sold, but to their amazement it went on to sell 22,000,000 copies, and made Clayderman a world famous pianist.<p>Richard Clayderman - Ballade Pour Adeline</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCCan3TFPoc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCCan3TFPoc</a></p></div>
