              <p>Hi Mr Gilbert,</p>
              <p>I was wondering if you are still giving a helping hand to people in need.</p>
              <p>Currently I am in quite a bad shape. I know you have helped me before for a few months and I have finally settled down in life.</p>
              <p>But now after giving birth to twins my husband and I are facing a tough time financially.</p>
              <p>We don’t have any family support.</p>
              <p>My husband has to left work to take care of my kids and me during the confinement period as I went through Caesarian delivery for my twin pregnancy.</p>
              <p>It was tough on us even after receiving the baby bonus cash which lasted us for 5 months.</p>
              <p>With babiesâ€™ formula milk and diaper on the rise we really have to tightly jungle our daily expenses.</p>
              <p>My husband only works daily rated paying job as it isn’t easy for him to get employed with his basic educational background.</p>
              <p>He would be called up for work if they require manpower.</p>
              <p>He is paid only $80 a day.</p>
              <p>Its hard on us as we won’t know how long the pay can last us till his next call up.</p>
              <p>With the rate of the babies milk finishing within the next 5 days its quite depressing.</p>
              <p>We have been loaning here and there till no one wants to help us anymore.</p>
              <p>Can I seek financial aid from you?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>This criminal violation is cruel not only because the doctor deliberately deceived the victim with a false diagnosis as a pretext to deceitfully harvest her human eggs, and not only because the victim was forcibly immobilized against her will, placed under general anaesthetic and operated on without her consent, but also because a woman's eggs are limited, and this doctor's cruel violation could have potentially made her permanently sterile. And this case also implies that this corrupt doctor, and many others like him, have been covertly and deceitfully harvesting human eggs from many women victims throughout the years without them even knowing what had happened.<p><i>"Women are born with all the eggs they are ever going to have, and they donâ€™t make any new eggs during their lifetime. Women are born with approximately two million eggs in their ovaries, but about eleven thousand of them die every month prior to puberty. As a teenager, a woman has only three hundred thousand to four hundred thousand remaining eggs, and from that point on, approximately one thousand eggs are destined to die each month. This phenomenon is completely independent of any hormone production, birth control pills, pregnancies, nutritional supplements, or even health or lifestyle. Nothing stops this inexorable death of approximately one thousand eggs every month regardless of ovulation, ovarian inhibition, or stimulation. Whenever the woman runs out of her supply of eggs, the ovaries cease to make estrogen, and she goes through menopause."</i> - <a href="http://www.infertile.com/beating-biological/">http://www.infertile.com/beating-biological/</a></p><p>_______________________________________</p><p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/world/europe/pioneering-italian-fertility-doctor-suspected-stealing-patients-eggs">http://www.todayonline.com/world/europe/pioneering-italian-fertility-doctor-suspected-stealing-patients-eggs</a></p><p><b>An Italian gynaecologist has been arrested on suspicion of removing eggs from a patient without her consent. Dr Severino Antinori, 70, was arrested at Romeâ€™s Fiumicino airport on Friday (13 May 2016) following a complaint filed by a 24-year-old Spanish woman victim. Prosecutors allege that Dr Antinori, who had met the young woman victim by chance, set up the job interview and subsequently diagnosed the ovarian cyst with the sole intention of harvesting her eggs without her knowledge. The woman says she had her mobile phone taken off her before being forcibly immobilized against her will, placed under anaesthetic and operated on without her consent. She believed she was only going to be treated by injection for the cyst, according to her lawyer. The investigation was triggered by the woman calling emergency services from a payphone in the clinic after she came round from the surgery.</b></p></div>

I'm sorry that i'll never get to hold you in my arms or be able to tell you how much i love you. I won't get to wrap you up with the quilt that my mother poured her heart into making for you. I won't get to feel you inside me anymore and i won't get to feel the joy of having you in my life.</p><p>I'm sorry that you kick and move around so innocently and yet you don't know that you'll be going back into the arms of God soon.</p><p>Maybe its idiotic for me to feel so upset over you since i'm only 18 and in other's eyes i might be the disgusting and disgraceful one for getting myself into this in the first place. But they do not know the joys of being your mother. They do not understand the happiness and comfort you bring me with each little kick. They will not care that in a few days, i have to take away the one person that has kept me going for the past 5 months of hell. It has been your kicks that has gotten me through the hard nights after an argument because ultimately, if it is for you, any amount of physical pain is worth it. Perhaps it is stupid that i refer to you as if you're alive and you can read this but i don't know how or where else i can express my grief.</p><p>I'm sorry that daddy doesn't want to take responsibility because i've made too many mistakes and caused him too much hurt that he cannot bring himself to raise you with me.</p><p>I'm sorry that i let him hit and kick you so many times while you were still growing. I should have been more careful. I should have used contraception or gone for the morning after pill and never had let this happen in the first place and it is my fault to begin with. I can't bring myself to give you up to another family and leave you with thoughts like 'why didn't mummy want me' or 'why didn't mummy love me' ; the same thoughts and questions i had to grow up with. The fact is that I do love you very much, more than anything else in this world but i'll never be able to tell you and it kills me.</p><p>I can't bring you up as a single mother either, you'd wonder the same things about your father. You would wonder why all your friends in school have a daddy but not you. How would i face you and say that the reason Leon didn't want you is because of me?</p><p>While your daddy walks away with no scars or pain and without a care in the world, only eager to find a new woman, i want you to know that after i wake up from the operation i'll pick up the broken pieces on my own. The sleepless nights filled with regret and endless tears seems like the minimal punishment for taking away your life.<br>You, who's only "mistake" was growing and existing.</p><p>Please know that this is the hardest decision i've had to make and i hate myself for it.</p><p>Believe me, I want to go with you as well, So so badly.</p><p>People say you're going to a better place and it is easy to get over my loss since you aren't "really alive".</p><p>How can that be when I feel you kick and move every night before i sleep.</p><p>How do i live with the fact that after i wake from the operation, there'll be no more kicks, no more movement. How do i cope with missing those kicks and little movements? All that will be left is silence and cruel emptiness and I will long day and night to feel you once again.</p><p>I'm going to miss you so much and i wish there was another way, you don't deserve any of this. You deserve to live and to be loved.</p><p>Please know that it had come to a point where i was given no choice. My only options from your father and his family was to raise you on my own, or give you up for adoption.</p><p>Perhaps raising a child alone or seperately is considered normal to his family and therefore i should have no qualms about it. His mother might feel nothing towards killing a baby, her grandchild, since she's done it 5 times herself but i cannot bring myself to say with a clear conscience that this is the right thing to do. There is no right choice.<br>The correct and fair option would be for both your father and i to take responsibility, but that is out of the question and i am to be blamed. I'm sorry i didn't fight or try harder.<br>Forgive me for i have failed you in all aspects as a mother and i am so sorry. I should have protected you. I am a monster and i should be the one to go, not you. I will cherish our last few days together with all my being. I will miss you with all my heart and soul and not a day will go by where i don't think of you. My biggest fear is not being able to get over the anger and self loathing. I'm so afraid of letting go and what comes afterwards. Despite the criticism and judgement, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me and i will learn from losing you.</p><p>You will always be precious to me, so know that you hold a special place in my heart and that you are, now and to the very end of time, my very first little girl. I can only pray and hope that you, my little angel will find peace and somehow forgive me.</p><p>I love you so very much. I wish there was another way.</p><p>And Leon Lee E, i hope you get to see this. I wish you all the best in NUS and i pray you won't do this to any other girl. You can choose to twist the story and place all the blame on me, i do not mind, I was horrible to you after all. I abused you physically and emotionally during our first month together all because of my own selfish 'issues'. Alas, that is no excuse. I lied about changing time and time again and when i finally woke up, it was too late for you. I still feel that if we are being entirely honest, we are both at fault whether you want to admit it or not. We both hurt each other, we left each other scars.</p><p>Although you tried to physically induce an abortion countless times, i hope you won't forget your baby Ashe. She is and always will be your very first daughter. Do not ever forget her. Do not ever forget the sound of her heartbeat or how she moved around so much during our gynae visits. I am thankful that despite your attempts at her life, she turned out perfect. I remember your face when you first saw her and when you saw her again just last Wednesday. You can choose to deny it but deep down you didn't hate her, you hated me. My only regret between the two of us now is that she wont get a proper goodbye from you. Our relationship was never easy and it was hard the whole way through. We were both upset and unhappy for the few months we were together. The single happiest moment was not even on my birthday but when i saw our baby girl for the first time.</p><p>That is how much she means to me. For 5 months i never gave up on you. I never stopped doting on you or treating you like you were a prince. I took your beatings and verbal abuse because i thought that maybe just maybe, if i let you have your way and i let you do what you want, you'd forgive me for taking you for granted and we could love again. I am and i will never not be sorry for spending your money and taking away your freedom. I see now that i was wrong to keep hoping and looking for the best in you. I was wrong for trying desperately to make this work for her sake.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm sorry for the first month where i pushed you physically and psychologically to the point where you no longer loved me and we stayed together purely out of my will to let the baby have a proper family. I hope the subsequent months of bloodshed and abuse you inflicted on me in return will one day be enough for you to forgive me. I have never blamed you for anything you've done to me, remember that. I was a horrible girlfriend and partner and for that, i really am sorry. I hope you will learn and mature from this incident. I pray the next time if it were to happen again, you will man up and do the right thing.</p><p>My biggest regret is believing you could change and that you would keep your promise and be responsible for your child. You've made countless promises about taking care of us and ultimately you kept none. From day one you wanted to abort and i convinced you to give her a chance, you agreed. After that you promised time and time again that you would keep to your word. While you walk away from this without any sadness or guilt, which i completely understand since you cant really feel her, i will be here. I will miss our good memories, no one can deny that we were very compatible.</p><p>Ultimately, i am sorry if i forced you to do the right thing. If only you had the spine to make that decision on your own.</p><p>Remember how you cursed death upon her and i countless times? You would constantly remind me how you wish that i'd die during labour along with her or that i'd fall and she would die. Well, I hope you are happy.</p><p>You're finally getting what you wished for. Let this be a lesson to you and every girl out there, one night of enjoyment and neglect isn't worth a life time of regret or the life of an innocent child. I've clearly had to learn that the hard way. Thank you for the first two months of happiness.</p><p><a href="http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/girl-forced-abort-baby-after-young-father-refused-take-responsibility">http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/girl-forced-abort-baby-after-young-father-refused-take-responsibility</a></p></div>
