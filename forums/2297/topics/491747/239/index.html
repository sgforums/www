              Sekali this is the local Singapore version of <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=the+hum+mystery">The Mysterious Hum</a> that's been heard worldwide but never explained... supernatural siol.<p>
                  
                  <i>#47526:  Dear OSA, do you want some sincere feedback on hostel experience? Actually I have given a few times before but nothing changes, so I decided to post it here. In the daytime, PGPR is a residence. At night, it is hell. There is this constant noise in the PGP-KEVII area that keeps going on forever. You suggest I should find earplugs? This morning I wake up very early despite sleeping very late last night (thanks to what, you guess), with both earplugs tightly on, being horrified by the sound that seemed to be amplified more than ever. I cannot count how many nights I have spent wishing my ears to be poked to deaf so that I never have to hear it again. I keep telling myself that I have to be thankful that I'm provided a safe place to lay my head on, that I should not pay attention at the sound. But it's still haunting me everyday. I am learning to accept my fate. That there's nothing else I could do about it. That neither can I afford nor am I deserve a more peaceful place. But today these questions come to me. What is that machine used for? What kind of machine is needed when everybody is sleeping? To generate a loud never-ending sound that cover such a huge area and can be heard clearly everywhere, it must be very powerful right? How could a machine operate and by itself? There must be a human-being who press the on button right? What kind of thoughts does that person have when he/she decide to do that? Is the purpose so great and important that it worths to sacrifice the sanity of hundreds of residents? Or is the machine faulty and you cannot stop it? Why not just destroy it or move it away? Is it very heavy? Do you need a helping hand I can volunteer myself? Is there a facility manager? If there is, how is it possible that there is a monster that keeps screaming hours after hours, nights after nights, months after months, years after years, among thousands of people, and yet no one does anything about it? I am sincerely sorry if that machine is not from PGP but from elsewhere. Other than that noise, I appreciate everything about residential life. But this is just so torturous, so traumatic that everytime I hear words like "hostel", "NUS", "Singapore",... this sound woud be unconsciously related (and replayed) in my head.</i>

My boyfriend kept moaning during sex and kept saying some words so even though I enjoy him during sex, the moaning or words im hearing is turning me off. How can I stop him? Like to ask him to keep quiet or something? And also, he seems really anxious about his work that during our sexy time he was still thinking of work. So how can I get him to relax?</i>

              Malaysian woman saw the missing MH370 in the water near Andaman Islands on day it disappeared<p>
                  <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/21/article-2586013-1C77B11A00000578-449_634x414.jpg"></p><p>
              Mrs Latife Dalelah, 53, insisted she saw a silver object in the shape of an aircraft on the water as she was flying from Jeddah to Kuala Lumpur. It was about an hour after her aircraft had flown past the southern Indian city of Chennai.
              </p><p>
              'Throughout the journey I was staring out of the window of the aircraft as I couldn't sleep during the flight,' she told the New Straits Times.
              </p><p>
              
              The in-flight monitor showed that her plane was crossing the Indian Ocean and she had seen several shipping liners and islands - before she saw the silvery object.
              </p><p>
              
              'I took a closer look and was shocked to see what looked like the tail and wing of an aircraft on the water,' she said.
              
              </p><p>
              'I woke my friends on the flight but they laughed me off,' she added.
              </p><p>
              Mrs Dalelah insisted to the paper: 'I know what I saw. I am convinced that I saw the aircraft. I will not lie. I had just returned from my pilgrimage.'
              
              </p><p>
              A large part of what she thought was an aircraft was submerged, she said. When she tried to tell an air stewardess what she had seen, she was told to get some sleep.
              </p><p>
              
              When her plane landed at Kuala Lumpur at about 4pm on that Saturday she told her children what she had seen. 'That is when they told me that MH370 had gone missing,' she told the paper.

              <i>As a diver, Duncan MacDonald was sent down to investigate a ship that had sunk in the Caledonian Canal entrance at Fort Augustus. Not long after, he sent urgent signals on his line to be immediately brought back to the surface. Shaking and ashen faced, he refused to say what he had seen for several days. When he had sufficiently composed himself days later, he told the tale of how he had seen a â€œvery odd looking beastie ... like a gigantic frogâ€� lying on the rock ledge where the wreck was lodged as he examined its hull. He refused to ever dive into the Loch Ness again.</i>

              Lim Boon Seng says he "cannot understand". Let me explain it simply : landed property owners are all multi-millionaires. <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=the+asshole+effect">#TheAssholeEffect</a><p>
              
              <i>Private home owners often place their rubbish bins and other items right outside their houses to reserve spaces for parking.
              </i></p><p><i>
              Once, when I removed a rubbish bin placed outside a house, the owner came out and started hurling abusive language at me.
              </i></p><p><i>
              How did owners of private houses come to the conclusion that they have exclusive rights to the space on the public road outside their houses?
              </i></p><p><i>
              I live in a Housing Board flat and I have to pay more that $100 a month to park my car in an HDB carpark. Not only do I have to walk more than 500m to the designated carpark, I am also not guaranteed a parking space every time I need to park.
              </i></p><p><i>
              Hence, I cannot understand how some landed property residents can lay claim to public roads.

              Just like the previous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbhFdjiPe6w">"MMA vs TaiJi" fiasco</a>, this latest "MMA vs Wing Chun" is a fallacy. MMA isn't a martial art, it's a mixture of multiple martial arts. Obviously an MMA martial artist who knows TaiJi + Wing Chun, will have a significant advantage over a martial artist who only knows only TaiJi or Wing Chun, let alone the fact that almost all professional MMA martial artists these days are also proficient in BJJ (the ultimate 1-on-1 martial art, but useless 1-vs-many, which is why MMA is the right way to go, to reduce over-reliance on any 1 martial art).

              [Singapore] - A video showing a series of fights outside a nightclub at Jalan Besar has been circulating on WhatsApp.
                  <p>
                  The video begins with a group of men raining blows on a man lying on the road. 
                  </p><p>
                  The videographer comments on the brutality of the beating, adding:
                  </p><p>
                  â€œThe way they beat him up, he'll die.â€�
                  </p><p>
                  
                  
                  
                  His female companion adds that the victim is the nightclub ownerâ€™s son. 
                  </p><p>
                  The videographer continues:
                  </p><p>
                  â€œThey step on his head like that. Wonâ€™t he die?â€�
                  </p><p>
                  He singles out a powerful 'fat man in white' from the group. 
                  </p><p>
                  
                  <img src="http://img.stomp.com.sg/s3fs-public/images/2018/03/gang12_0.jpg"></p><p>
              </p><p>
              Meanwhile, another fight breaks out simultaneously not far from the victim lying unconscious on the road. 
              </p><p>
              Two men start shouting and hurling vulgarities at each other. 
              </p><p>
              A man wearing a long-sleeved shirt is restrained by several others, while he continues shouting aggressively at another man in black.

              The two continue quarrelling, and the man in white suddenly walks up and delivers a punch to the man in the long-sleeved shirt. 
              </p><p>
              He is held back by his companions, while the man in a long-sleeved shirt is also restrained by his.

              The two groups then go their separate ways.

              President Xi Jinping vowed Tuesday to protect â€œevery inchâ€� of Chinaâ€™s territory, improve the lives of its people and promote the resurgence of Chinese culture and creativity as he kicked off his second term, poised to rule indefinitely.
              <p>
               Xi, Chinaâ€™s most powerful leader in decades, sounded a stark warning clearly directed at the government of self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, and advocates of independence in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong.
              </p><p>
              â€œEvery inch of our great motherland absolutely cannot and absolutely will not be separated from China,â€� Xi declared in his speech before the nearly 3,000 members of the National Peopleâ€™s Congress.
              </p><p>
              â€œAll evil acts to split the motherland are doomed to failure and will be condemned by the people and punished by history!â€� he said.
              </p><p>
               Xi is set to shape the countryâ€™s future for the coming decades after the historic legislative session that closed Tuesday abolished presidential term limits to allow him to rule for as long as he wants.
              </p><p>
              As an indication of what is to come, Xi stressed the absolute leadership of the ruling Communist Party â€” of which he is head â€” in all aspects of Chinese life. That authority is central to Xiâ€™s vision of a confident, rising China with him at the helm to tackle thorny challenges that include slowing growth, risky excessive borrowing, a possible trade war, tensions with rival Taiwan and other challenges.
                  </p><p>
                   Xi said the mainland would continue to promote â€œpeaceful unificationâ€� with Taiwan. The islandâ€™s 23 million residents are strongly in favor of maintaining their de-facto independent status but Xi has previously warned a Taiwanese envoy that the issue of unification cannot be put off indefinitely.
                  </p><p>
                   Now that he has made it possible to be president-for-life, Xi seems determined to bring Taiwan under Beijingâ€™s control during his time in office, something that would place him in the history books alongside Mao Zedong, said Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
                  </p><p>
                   That increases the potential for provocative, dangerous actions, he said, possibly drawing in the U.S. which is legally bound to respond to threats against Taiwan.
                  </p><p>
                  â€œXi is consumed by hubris,â€� he said. â€œNow that heâ€™s made himself emperor-for-life, he might be feeling impregnable on the foreign policy front and this is very dangerous.â€�
