              A further problem is, racism begets racism. As pushback against the China government's video, visitor comments (on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, new websites, forums, etc) mostly from India are spewing hateful racist comments on all Chinese (in the first place, it's just the China government, even the China Chinese are mostly innocent, let alone Chinese people from other countries, which are attacked together in the anti-China visitor comments), which only causes further hate and anger on the internet from all sides.

              There's a twist in the China vs Bhutan vs India plot. Turns out that India isn't acting selflessly for Bhutan, and that Bhutan never asked or wanted India's military intervention against China (so at least that part of Dier Wang's video is true, the Bhutanese officials did indeed inform China they didn't ask for India's help). Right now, the people of Bhutan are equally angry at both China (who as usual, arrogantly claims all disputed territories as their own "undisputed" territory) and also at India (who unilaterally initiated intervention for their own selfish agenda over the Chicken's Neck, as they fear China may seize it and hence cut off some Indian states, but India manipulatively claims it is just selflessly defending Bhutan from being bullied by China, which is but an excuse), and they fear for their lives, because should war really break out between nuclear armed China and nuclear armed India, Bhutan (which has no military of it's own) is a sitting lame duck that will be collaterally slaughtered.

She died of severe multiple injuries in hospital only 50 agonizing minutes after her fall. Poor girl, may she receive all the healing she needs now in the afterlife.<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/teen-jumped-from-7th-floor-flat-to-meet-friends-and-died-in-tragic">http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/teen-jumped-from-7th-floor-flat-to-meet-friends-and-died-in-tragic</a></p></div>

              Singaporean young man with cerebral palsy has suffered all his life from horrific parental abuse (forced to undergo a surgical procedure that his angry abusive parents had hoped would enable him to walk normally, he ended up completely losing the ability to walk ; where he had once been able to manage a few steps prior to the procedure, he now found himself completely unable to walk ; his parents, frustrated that their son became an even bigger burden to them after the procedure, subjected him to even worse violent physical and psychological emotional abuse ; and he attempted suicide not once, not twice, but 4 times), has been permanently unemployed his entire life because of his debilitating medical condition, and he spent 5 years writing a book about his life (he had to painstakingly type out letter by letter using his toes), which he hopes to raise money for his living expenses through the sale of his books, but unfortunately nobody is buying his book due to lack of publicity. A friend once said to him in encouragement, 'Without the night, you cannot enjoy the stars.''<p><img src="https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/coverimagewesleywee.jpg"></p><p><a href="https://mothership.sg/2017/08/sporean-with-cerebral-palsy-has-a-heartbreaking-life-story-to-tell-he-spent-5-years-writing-a-book-about-it/">https://mothership.sg/2017/08/sporean-with-cerebral-palsy-has-a-heartbreaking-life-story-to-tell-he-spent-5-years-writing-a-book-about-it/</a></p><p>

                  </p><p>
                  In the message intended for Malaysians, the owner explained â€œthat shower rooms were meant for cleansing the body and that they should not defecate in itâ€�. The owner also suggested that such an incident was third committed by Malaysians.
                  </p><p>
                  
                  The message also told Malaysians to be polite to reflect their countryâ€™s image.

                  â€œI have already banned Koreans and Chinese from staying in our lodge and guesthouse, and from now on we ban Malaysians too,â€� the owner said.

                  The lodge is well-known among Malaysians for its affordable rate and halal food.

                  The case has raised questions on whether it was due flaws in the Malaysian education system or family upbringing.

              Mainland China concert organisers delaying payment to Hong Kong performers is not a new issue, as it has occurred before with other artistes as well. However, record labels would usually choose to boycott the show until payment is made. 
              
               However, unlike most singers, Leon decided to do the show instead for the sake of his fans, with sources saying that the singer didn't want to disappoint fans from Guangzhou and nearby areas who have already bought tickets to the show.

              [MMA] - Malaysian Ann Osman had bad blood with Singaporean Sherilyn Lim, who quit MMA after failing to make the weight, Ann never forgave Sherilyn for that. 2 days ago in KL, Ann Osman submitted to Singaporean May Ooi's rear naked choke, stunning the Malaysian home crowd into despair. If May Ooi (who owns her own Capoeira school and represents it in her fights) continues to be victorious in her next few ONE Championship fights, she may yet get a shot at Angela Lee. Singapore vs Singapore (even if Angela Lee is technically not Singaporean).<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jUaC4oVTqeM/hqdefault.jpg">

              U.S. warship collision exposes Singapore-Malaysia sea territorial dispute<p>

              A collision between a U.S. warship and an oil tanker near the Straits of Malacca on Monday has shone a light on a territorial dispute that has simmered between neighbours Singapore and Malaysia for nearly 40 years.
              
              The guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with merchant vessel Alnic MC to the east of Singapore, while heading to the city-state for a routine port call. 
              
              Ten U.S. sailors are missing and five were injured in the collision, which resulted in significant damage to the hull of the U.S. vessel and the flooding of some of its compartments.
              
              Singapore and Malaysia both insisted the incident took place in their territorial waters, as the warship and oil tanker collided near the rocky outcrop of Pedra Branca, an area that has long been contested by both countries.
