              <i>The extremist ideological version of both the Republicans and Democrats, are of course, both oversimplified and erroneous. In reality, a man isn't born either good or evil, rather he's born with free will (together with karma from past lives, genetic influences from parents, etc). But of course, most people (American or otherwise) do not simple mindedly subscribe to either the extremist ideological version of either the Republicans and Democrats, but somewhere in between, with an inclination either way on varying issues. Life is a spectrum of colors, not simplistically black and white, good or evil, right or wrong. Thankfully so.</i>
              <p>
              â€œThe difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good,â€� said Mr. Watts, who was in the area to campaign for Senator Rand Paul. â€œWe are born bad,â€� he said and added that children did not need to be taught to behave badly â€” they are born knowing how to do that.
              </p><p>
              â€œWe teach them how to be good,â€� he said. â€œWe become good by being reborn â€” born again.â€�
              </p><p>
              He continued: â€œDemocrats believe that we are born good, that we create God, not that he created us. If we are our own God, as the Democrats say, then we need to look at something else to blame when things go wrong â€” not us.â€�
              </p><p>
              Mr. Watts talked about the 2015 movie theater shooting in Lafayette, La., in which two people were killed. Mr. Watts said that Republicans knew that the gunman was a bad man, doing a bad thing. Democrats, he added, â€œwould look for other causes â€” that the man was basically good, but that it was the guns, society or some other place where the blame lies and then they will want to control the guns, or something else â€” not the man.â€� Republicans, he said, donâ€™t need to look anywhere else for the blame.
              </p><p>
              Hearing Mr. Watts was an epiphany for me. For the first time I had a glimpse of where many of my conservative friends and neighbors were coming from. I thought, no wonder Republicans and Democrats canâ€™t agree on things like gun control, regulations or the value of social programs. We live in different philosophical worlds, with different foundational principles.

              [USA] - Sara Packer and Jacob Sullivan face charges including criminal homicide, rape, kidnapping and abuse of a corpse over the July death of 14-year-old Grace Packer, online court documents show.
                  <p>
                  On the morning of July 8, Grace, who had been adopted by Sara Packer, was taken to the attic of a house the couple rented, where she was beaten and then raped by Sullivan as her mother watched, an affidavit said. She was then poisoned, bound and gagged and left for dead.
                  </p><p>
                  When the couple returned hours later, they discovered Grace was still alive, so Sullivan tried several times to choke her to death. Sullivan told police it took much longer than he expected to strangle her, and she died a slow, painful death.

            <div class='col-md body'>If Trump decides to rebut every criticism he gets from famous people and Hollywood celebrities, as he's doing now, he'll be too busy to do anything else during his presidency. And also, Meryl Streep thinks MMA is just violence and bad karma, and she's right, actually. I've always admired and respected the tremendous skills and wits involved in high level applied martial arts, but at the same time abhorred and despised the hateful dark violence and unnecessary pain &amp; suffering that came with it. Ah well, dammit. You can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs, you can't swim without getting wet, etc. Welcome to physical incarnation eh.<p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-denounces-streep-overrated-clinton-flunky-193754817.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-denounces-streep-overrated-clinton-flunky-193754817.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While some of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alien+body+found">alien bodies found</a> are indeed fakes, some are in fact genuine. Also, (eg. government investigators) declaring cases as fakes, and even getting someone to claim they're behind the fakes, makes for easy cover ups. People who prejudicially denounce every possible case as fake and mock the open-minded as naÃ¯ve, are actually the naÃ¯ve ones. <p>DNA analysis has revealed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Atacama+skeleton">Atacama skeleton</a> to be a hybrid of human and non-human DNA.

              Similar to the case of innocent Japanese workers being attacked in China several years ago over government to government problems, innocent Myanmar workers have been hacked to death by angry (and misguided by manipulative politics) Malaysians over the Rohingya issue. These Myanmar civilians who traveled to Malaysia to earn an honest living to feed their families back in Myanmar, are not the Myanmar soldiers who raped, tortured and murdered the Rohingyas in Myanmar. It's like you (as a Singaporean) being beaten up or killed by an angry mob in China over South China Sea government to government problems. Just like the China mob misguidedly take it personally that you (as an individual) are violating their sovereign territorial rights and decide to kill you for it, the angry Malaysian mob misguidedly take it personally that the Myanmar civilians they hacked to death, are imagined to be the same men who raped, tortured and murdered their fellow Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar, without actually considering that their victims are personally innocent, and guilt by association is an prejudicial fallacy, ironically one that victimizes Muslims around the world as well.<p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=myanmar+workers+killed+in+malaysia">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=myanmar+workers+killed+in+malaysia</a>
