            <div class='col-md body'>I feel terribly sorry for these twin girls (and many other young people like them, including many undergoing cosmetic surgery and paying exorbitant fees for entertainment industry schools preparing them to be pop idols that almost all of them will never be), who are wasting away their lives, living in a deluded fantasy of a future successful showbiz career. They have no idea that the showbiz entertainment industry (especially in Korea and Asia) is a cruelly exploitative and unethical one (including sexually exploitative for young females), in which almost all the money is pocketed by the producers, directors and executives, and while the (starting out) singers, actors and actresses make peanuts, despite them doing most of the hard work.<p><a href="http://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/12230">http://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/12230</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See how unethical and exploitative the modern society and world of finance and economics is? Every human on the planet is alive because of the hardworking farmers around the world (since every human needs to eat to live, and the base of all food chains are agricultural crops). And yet, instead of being highly paid, these farmers (especially the poorer countries in Asia including India, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, China, etc) are among the most lowly paid (while the CEOs, top executives and board members of countless ultra-rich MNCs, who do nothing get paid tens of millions a year contributing absolutely nothing useful to society and humanity), with the unethical, exploitative industry middle-men (including loan-shark gangsters in many poorer countries) such as the wholesalers and retailers, and the landowners (either exploitative rich corporations and/or gangster landowners who only rent out the farmland to owners at exorbitant rental rates ala REITS, keeping ownership permanently for themselves, and greedily demanding the majority of the profits). As an illustration, out of every $1000 worth of agricultural crops sold to consumers at the supermarket, the farmers (ie. the ones who work the hardest and actually produce the crops) earn only $1, with the rest going to the multitudes of exploitative middle-man in the industry (including across countries, including exporters and importers, rich corporations) who profit disproportionately and unethically.<p>[India] - Due to poor crop yield and accumulating debts, 9 farmers commit suicide daily in Maharashtra, and over 3228 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra in 2015 alone. And this is just one of many agricultural regions in India. The total number of farmers killing themselves every year throughout the rest of India, the rest of Asia (including India, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, China, etc) and the world, are hundreds of times this number.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=9+farmers+commit+suicide+every+day">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=9+farmers+commit+suicide+every+day</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Chernobyl] - On the edge of Belarus' Chernobyl exclusion zone, down the road from the signs warning "Stop! Radiation," a dairy farmer eagerly offers his visitors a glass of freshly drawn milk. Associated Press reporters politely decline the drink but secretly pass on a bottled sample to a laboratory, which confirms it contains levels of a radioactive isotope at levels 10 times higher than the nation's food safety limits. That finding today (2016) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident indicates how fallout from the April 26, 1986, explosion at the plant in neighboring Ukraine continues to haunt life in Belarus.<p><a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ap-exclusive-test-finds-chernobyl-residue-belarus-milk-072214670.html">https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ap-exclusive-test-finds-chernobyl-residue-belarus-milk-072214670.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do they not realize that some of the toxins will invariably remain in the body tissues and have far-reaching pathogenic, biochemical and carcinogenic consequences years down the road in the long-term? When you're that desperate to survive, you don't bother to think of long-term consequences. This illustrates how worsening Gini coefficients, wealth inequalities and the rich-poor gap, ie. poverty, unravels the social fabric of society and forces the poor into criminal acts.<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PRfR5c9.jpg"> </p></div>

Dharmendran prove that he was tortured by police officers while being interrogated, the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC) said today.</p><p>
              
              EAIC chairman Datuk Yaacob Md Sam also rubbished the policeâ€™s claim that the staples had ended up on Dharmendranâ€™s ears in the process of wrapping up and transferring his body after he died.
              </p><p>
              â€œThis is a totally illogical, unreasonable explanation,â€� Yaacob said of the policeâ€™s theory of how the victimâ€™s ears had staples embedded in them during a press conference at the EAIC headquarters today.
              </p><p>
              Yaacob explained that the pathologist report found that both his right and left ears which were stapled had blood stains on them, making it impossible for it to have occurred after Dharmendranâ€™s death.
              </p><p>
              â€œThis shows that his ears were stapled when he was alive. It rules out that the staples were made after his death or at the mortuary,â€� he said.
              </p><p>
              While conceding that the stapling of the victimâ€™s ears was not the cause of death, Yaacob said that the injury on top of the other 52 bruises from blunt force trauma inflicted by the police eventually led to his death.
              </p><p>
              â€œA total of 52 bruises on the deceased caused by a blunt force object (blunt force trauma) causing acute massive loss of blood into the tissues causing hypovolemic shock,â€� he said, referencing the pathologist report from the Hospital Kuala Lumpurâ€™s Forensic Department.

              KUALA LUMPUR, April 28 â€• Despite admitting to being either racist or selectively racist, the majority Malaysia's young population say they reject race-based policies and believe in meritocracy, a survey by Centre for Better Tomorrow (Cenbet) revealed.
              <p>
              The group said of the 1,056 peninsular Malaysians surveyed, those in the 18-25 years age bracket were the highest to say no to race-based policies, with about 88 per cent surveyed saying they favoured merits-based dealings over race.
              </p><p>
              The survey also found that ethnic Malays were split equally when it comes to wanting pro-Malay policies, with 42 per cent saying â€œnoâ€� and the same number of respondents saying â€œyesâ€�.
