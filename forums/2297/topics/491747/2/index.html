            <div class='col-md body'>There's a fine line between courage and foolhardiness. Ah Fa (with bare fists) dared to take on Dog Bro (armed with a knife) for 10 full minutes, while getting slashed and stabbed multiple times per minute? Ah Fa was clearly both (courageous and full hardy), and (to his credit) knew how to handle himself (likely has martial arts background and/or gang violence experience), evidenced by the fact that he's still alive (how many unarmed men can remain alive after being slashed and stabbed for 10 minutes?). By the end of the 10 minutes (in which Dog Bro was persuaded by others who intervened to leave), Ah Fa's white shirt and pants had become completely red, covered with his blood.<p><a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/ktv-dispute-allegedly-leads-to-bloody-fight-at-new-upper-changi-rd-kopitiam">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/ktv-dispute-allegedly-leads-to-bloody-fight-at-new-upper-changi-rd-kopitiam</a></p></div>

              On another forum, someone posted : <p>Attention to all vietnamese ladies:
               My sister gets to know this guy thought wechat. They had spoken to each other many times, he mentioned that he is a Singaporean at the age of 40 years old and he searching for a wife, and if both felt right for each other then he will marry immediately.
               After 2 months of talking to each other, he decided to go to vietnam and visit her. He stayed in the hotel for 20 days and the cost of the hotel was 400.000Vnd per day. During the time he was staying in Vietnam, he said that he have to save money to buy house for marriage and most of the times when going out with my sister, she had to paid for the food and everything else. I tried to prevent my sister from doing all these but she said that they are going to marry soon anyway, thus who pay also doesn't matter. After 20 days when he was preparing to go back to Singapore, he pretended to go to the bank and draw money and of course, he said that the money can't be drawn, then he asked my sister to help him to pay for the hotel and many other stuffs he had bought for bringing it back to Singapore, which he wanted to give to his friends and family in Singapore. He promised that he will return the money when he is back in Singapore, but after he got back Singapore, he blocked all her contact and deleted all the photos they took together.  After she told me all the story, I used my facebook account to searched for him, to my shock, I saw photos of him with other girl, which was exactly the same he did to my sister previously. Prior to meeting each other, he always asked my sister to sent him photos of herself and posted it on facebook and viber saying that she is his love. Money lost is not the issue, but currently my sister is pregnant with his baby and it's about 2 weeks. Now she is very worried and shocked, she is crying everyday. She thought that she had already found the love of her life and it turned out it was hell. He is now doing the same to other girls.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Bravo">Eddie Bravo</a> (born Edgar Cano on May 15, 1970) is an American practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu who holds a third degree black belt under Jean-Jacques Machado of the Machado family lineage. He is most famous for his win against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royler_Gracie">Royler Gracie</a> by triangle choke in the 2003 Abu Dhabi Submission Wrestling championships while still only a brown belt. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Bravo">Eddie Bravo</a> had a highly anticipated rematch against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royler_Gracie">Royler Gracie</a> on March 29, 2014 at Metamoris III in a submission only jiu-jitsu competition format. The match ended as a draw after the 20 minutes ran out due to the no points rule. Despite the official result of a draw, many media outlets praised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Bravo">Eddie Bravo</a>'s use of constant pressure, sweeps, and submission attempts in controlling the match and almost ending it at the end with a combination calf slicer and toe lock that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Bravo">Eddie Bravo</a> calls the "Vaporizer."
