              In the forum thread, nayr69sg posted :</p><p>
              <i>My father used to be a senior civil servant. He has often given me insights into the workings of the civil service. He has worked with Mr Howe Yoon Chong before. While a very bad tempered and fierce person, Mr Howe generally made good decisions for the good of the public.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Back then, the salary of Ministers was not that much higher than the civil servants. Hence they worked together closely. Ideas were shared. Civil servants were often told their job was to serve the people, save the country money, never overspend and make the best decisions for the overall good.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Things changed after LHL and his gang of SAF people started coming in. 
              </i></p><p><i>
               Of course we know about the massive increase in salaries of the Ministers which made them feel way more superior and "smarter" than the civil servants. Health benefits of the civil servants were taken away by LHL too. LHL's SAF cronies were placed into more positions in the senior civil service ranks.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Over the years they have raised the salaries of senior civil servants as well. It is to reward the cronies and further establish obedience. If you have lots to risk and give up (ie you know you command salary way higher than what you are worth in the private sector) then you are more likely to be a yes man and be a cheerleader for the boss's ideas and opinions. Makes the boss's job easy.
              </i></p><p><i>
               In the old days, civil servants worked because they really wanted to build Singapore. It was not for the money because their salaries were pretty crappy anyway. They did have pensions which were another reason to stay on for. But these days there is no pension either. So clearly those civil servants who stay are because they know they cannot do better anywhere else.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Personally, my experience with MOH and internal Singhealth and NHG admin is the same. Nobody really wants any "new ideas". 
              </i></p><p><i>
               Why?
              </i></p><p><i>
               When there is a meeting and the boss asks "Is there anything we need to improve on? Are there any problems?"
              </i></p><p><i>
               This is a bait/trap question. The one who answers "Yes there is XYZ problem. Can we try to do ABC? It will improve XYZ. Right now XYZ is causing LMNOP problems" is either a very stupid henta kaki fellow or a very newbie. When the boss asks such a question, if you answer that way, he/she will view you as incompetent. Boss will think "why this stupid fellow cannot solve the problem himself/herself? Why must tell me? Then want me to solve the problem? Useless bugger"
              </i></p><p><i>
               Boss wants to hear "everything is going well Sir/Madam!" Then there will be a bit of a pause. Everyone keeps quiet and then Boss says how about A Department look into improving Q issue? I have identified XYZ problem and think Q needs to be improved"
              </i></p><p><i>
               The smart officers will say "That is an excellent idea boss! I think it is very good. We should look at improving that. I will look into it right away and come up with some proposals"
              </i></p><p><i>
               In other words never be the one to bring up any suggestions because if you do, you also are implying there is a problem. And that problem may not be what boss thinks is worth his/her time to look into.
              </i></p><p><i>
               Let the boss direct what needs to be done.
              </i></p><p><i>
               I learnt this the hard way myself because my father worked in a time when the civil servants were really asked to sit at the table almost of equal standing with their bosses. Remember Philip Yeo? Another example. And this worked well for Singapore of course. See the massive improvement and growth prior to LHL coming into the fold.
              </i></p><p><i>
               After LHL......it is all a pile of feces. Officers who do well in Civil service now are ones who are good at implementing the boss's directives and very good at apple polishing. 
              </i>
              </p><p>
              To which numero uno replied :</p><p><i>you got to be joking when you mentioned philip yeo" Remember Philip Yeo? Another example. And this worked well for Singapore of course. See the massive improvement and growth prior to LHL coming into the fold....".
               this guy is the classic example of a pompous bureaucrat who knows nuts. all his project from suzhou to A star and biopolis were great flops and a waste of billions tax payer money. I still remember the ST quoting him as saying he knows all about genetics after reading a small primer on it overnight!!!! As you can see Astar and biopolis were great flops. 20 years and not a single achievements at all. this guy thought you can replicate overnight the academic aura of esteemed insituitions just by employing all these dead wood. I still remember I almost fell off my chair when shitty times reported in thier front page about singapore being able to teach USSR about science and technology!!!! how pompous can you get!!!!! they have send man into space and here we are talking c@ck. The old man LKY read it and was so embarrassed that he ordered a clarification/retraction on the news the next day. philip typifies these arrogant people. all the nobel laureates they hired were flash in the pan coming here for their million dollar salary and running away after getting their fill. please don't insult all the businessmen, scientists and doctors in singapore by quotng philip yeo as a good example. suzhou is a classic example of how an arrogant obnoxious guy was brought to his knees by overseas people in their backyard. </i></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another example of how a country's self-affirmative (eg. Malaysia) or self-protectionist (eg. Trump) policies can end up backfiring or self-sabotaging. The "Make In India" policy was Modi's idea of supporting India's domestic policies. An example of how it is going wrong : imports of many items are now banned (naively to support India's own manufacturing industry instead of other countries' manufacturers), but many business owners still need specific items that are not currently avaialble in India, but now are unable to import them in because of the new "Make In India" policies and laws, end up aborting or compromising the projects, and/or spending much more (ie. self-sabotaging the economy), to pay criminal syndicates to illegally smuggle the items in, and/or bribe civil servants and government officials across many departments and levels.<p><a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/red-tape-and-taxes-put-brakes-on-make-in-india-push/articleshow/58667138.cms">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/red-tape-and-taxes-put-brakes-on-make-in-india-push/articleshow/58667138.cms</a></p></div>

              [Physics / Chemistry / Biology / Medicine] - Global warming is causing disease epidemics through complex mechanisms humans never suspected possible.<p>
              <i>Haley remembered, it had not been very cold that year. There was only one night of hard frost; everyone had talked about it, grateful they did not have to dash out to wrap plants and turn off hose taps while thermometers plunged. The investigators downloaded federal weather data for each year since West Nile first arrived in Texas and plotted the metrics against the case counts. The epidemic year was an outlier on every measure, with the warmest winter, the warmest spring and the heaviest early rainfall in 10 years. As it turns out, the climate changes such as heavier rainfall resulted in greater breeding numbers, allowed more mosquitoes to survive the warmer and shorter winters, causing them to wake sooner, spill out earlier from their winter hiding places, and bite more people than in any other previous year, transmitting so many deadly viruses that killed an unprecedented number of victims.</i></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/why-the-menace-of-mosquitoes-will-only-get-worse.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/magazine/why-the-menace-of-mosquitoes-will-only-get-worse.html?_r=0</a></p><p>Global warming is also now melting permafrost and ice that have been frozen for thousands or even millions of years, slowly releasing long-dormant bacteria and viruses that could potentially wipe out humanity.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com.sg/#q=global+warming+viruses+frozen">https://www.google.com.sg/#q=global+warming+viruses+frozen</a></p>
