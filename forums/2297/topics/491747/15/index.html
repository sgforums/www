            <div class='col-md body'>Stanton and Layard hypothesized in 1977â€“78 that toxicity of fibrous materials (particularly asbestos) is not initiated by chemical effects; they hypothesized that the effects of asbestos must be physical and that mechanical damage might disrupt normal cell activityâ€”especially mitosis. There is experimental evidence that the very slim fibers (less than 60 nm, less than 0.06 Î¼m in breadth) do tangle destructively with chromosomes (being of comparable size). This is likely to cause the sort of mitosis disruption expected in cancer.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos</a></p></div>

              Geee, I wonder which Singaporean they're referring to...<p>KUALA LUMPUR, June 7 â€” Five NGOs today handed a memorandum to the Singapore High Commission here condemning the act of a Singaporean smearing the Quran in a social media video. 
              </p><p>
               There are Ikatan Rakyat Insan Muslim Malaysia (IRIMM), Pertubuhan Martabat Jalinan Muhibbah (MJMM), Ikatan Usahawan Kecil dan Sederhana Malaysia (Ikhlas), Gerakan Refomis Rakyat Malaysia (Reformis) and Akhlak Rahsia Cekal (ARC). 
              </p><p>
               A spokesman for the NGOs, IRIMM president Amir Amsaa Alla Pitchay, said they strongly demanded that the Government of Singapore take the necessary action against the culprit. 
              </p><p>
               The 47-second video clip shows a person humiliating the Quran by licking and tearing it and using it as sex material on a website. The clip had gone viral on the Internet. 
              </p><p>
               The memorandum was handed over to a security guard at the Singapore mission in Kuala Lumpur. â€” Bernama </p>

The only effective treatment (which works mainly as a preventive measure, meaning you have to take action the moment you hear news of a radioactive leak in your area) is to spam high doses of non-radioactive iodine (not as elemental iodine, which is readily reduced to iodide and is thus an oxidizing agent and thereby corrosive, but as an iodide or iodate salt), which works not as some magical bullet, but simply because of competitive inhibition, ie. the thyroid gland will have little propensity to absorb any of the radioactive iodine, if it is already saturated with non-radioactive iodide.<p>Woman breaks silence among Fukushima thyroid cancer patients :<br><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/woman-breaks-silence-among-fukushima-thyroid-cancer-patients-070035067.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/woman-breaks-silence-among-fukushima-thyroid-cancer-patients-070035067.html</a></p></div>

              I love this review! Lol! ;Ãž<p>
              Catalyst serves as a prequel to the 2008 game. Players step once more into the padded parkour slippers of Faith, a hotheaded young woman who works as an off-the-grid courier in the corporate-controlled utopian megacity of Glass. You will be shocked to read this, but something is rotten beneath the cityâ€™s glossy exterior, and Faith just may hold the key to blowing this thing wide open. If that sort of dystopian cyber-clichÃ© sounds like your cup of dystopian cyber-tea, well, youâ€™re in luck.</p><p>At no point does Catalystâ€™s narrative stray from its megacorp-approved checklist of megacity megatropes. You may have guessed that, as a child, Faith lost her family in a violent incident that motivated her to rebel against the system. Surely you will do a spit-take upon learning that her allies include a socially awkward hacker teen, a weary father-figure, a cocky young recruit with a lot to learn, an inscrutable Asian organized crime boss, and a dangerous loose-cannon â€œends justify the meansâ€� rebel leader. Your amazement will deepen upon learning that Faith is up against a megalomaniacal corporate bigwig who believes in sacrificing personal liberty in the name of the greater good. He travels with a mysterious, deadly henchwoman. Thereâ€™s a mission called â€œenemy of my enemy.â€� You get the idea.</p><p>The characters are dull and largely unlikable, and most of them seem pissed off. (I guess I would be too, if I had to live in Glass.) I appreciate that Catalyst bucks convention by making most of the storyâ€™s major players women, but itâ€™s a shame that the characters themselves are such a drag. Faith is still a cool-looking, snappily dressed future-ninja, but mostly mumbles her way through her own story. Her most likable ally, a young tech savant named Plastic, is only charming fifty percent of the time and only in comparison with her fellow cast members. The rest of the cast is made up of gruff scowlers. One particularly shitheaded questgiver kept badgering me over the radio until my partner told me to â€œjust ignore her.â€� Never a good sign when even the NPCs canâ€™t stand one another.</p><p>Everything in Glass is referred to by some sort of doofy proper name: â€œDataTap,â€� â€œKrugerSec,â€� â€œHiCaste,â€� â€œOmniStat,â€� â€œGridNode,â€� â€œBeatLink,â€� or my favorite, â€œFoodDome.â€� The intent was likely to illustrate the branded vapidity of Glassâ€™ corporate overlords, but it goes past that and winds up making every character who speaks these terms aloudâ€”mostly sympathetic rebel-typesâ€”seem just as dorky and vapid as whoever coined them. Welcome to your Dystopian Future-Cityâ„¢, weâ€™re your designated Scrappy Underground Resistanceâ„¢!</p><p><a href="http://kotaku.com/mirrors-edge-catalyst-the-kotaku-review-1781085684">http://kotaku.com/mirrors-edge-catalyst-the-kotaku-review-1781085684</a></p>
