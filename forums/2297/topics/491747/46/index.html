            <div class='col-md body'>It continues to baffle me why Clinton never refreshes her complaints against Trump. The guy gives her fresh potential material literally every day, and sheâ€™s still droning on about Trumpâ€™s Mexican-American judge insult, and his attack on â€œa Gold Star family.â€� This night, she made two Celebrity Apprentice digs too many. As Trump said at a different moment, â€œWeâ€™ve heard this before, Hillary.â€� On television, to be compelling, you have to present something new each time you take command of the camera, something Clinton fails at, and at which Trump excels. But then, Clinton excels at answering the question asked of her, whereas Trump only talks about what is occurring to his mind at that moment.<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tv/final-debate-review-youre-the-puppet-034707121.html">https://www.yahoo.com/tv/final-debate-review-youre-the-puppet-034707121.html</a></p></div>

              "I win my second Academy Award, and the next couple of movies later, I get offered a movie, but the male actor hadn't had any kind of critical success but had been in a movie where he was hot," Swank recalled of being offered the role after winning an Oscar for the 2005 boxing drama, Million Dollar Baby.

              "And he got offered $10 million, and I got offered $500,000," she said.

              In the end, Swank turned down the role and filmmakers turned to a lesser-known actress who was willing to take an even smaller cut.

              "They went and found a newcomer actress who did it for $50,000," Swank continued. "They made a savings of $450,000, probably to give the guy his bonuses."

              </p><p>
               A CRUISE ship worker who raped and tried to kill a passenger after hiding in her cabin has been jailed more than 30 years for the violent attack.
              </p><p>
               Ketut Pujayasa, 31, from Indonesia, pleaded guilty to brutally raping and beating an American female guest and trying to throw her overboard a nude Nieuw Amsterdam cruise from Port Everglades, Florida, US.

               Pujayasa, who worked as a room service attendant, confessed to the horrific crime, saying he was punishing the 32-year-old woman because he believed she had insulted him and his mother.
              </p><p>
               He told police she allegedly said â€œWait a minute! Son of a bitch!" when he knocked on her door with her breakfast.
              </p><p> Investigators said Pujayasa entered her cabin with a master key and used a telephone cord and cord to her curling iron to strangle the woman.
              </p><p>
               The unnamed victim fought for her life as she was savagely beaten and raped
              </p><p>
               During the savage attack, which lasted up to an hour, Pujayasa battered her with various objects inside the room and knocked her unconscious before raping her.
              </p><p>
               After the assault, he tried to throw her overboard from the balcony but thanks to her training as an acrobat and gym instructor, she was able to hold on and escape.
              </p><p>
               Pujayasa then left the room by jumping from balcony to balcony and told a colleague what he had done.
              </p><p>
               The colleague reported him to a superior and was held by security until they reached a USA port.
              </p><p>
               According to the lawsuit: â€œPujayasa beat her head and face so hard that she experienced shifting of her teeth. All of the trauma to her head produced a traumatic brain injury.â€�
              </p><p>
               Photographs of the victimâ€™s injuries were shown to a Miami court which included fractures to her spine, skull and face.
              </p><p>
              
               Police reports described the woman, who cannot be named, emerging from the room partially naked and â€œpainted with bloodâ€� from head to toe.</p><p>
              
               She also had bites to the hands, swelling, bruising and lacerations to the face, scalp, head, neck, back, front of torso, arms, and legs and abrasions on both arms.</p><p>
              
              
               Her teeth were knocked out of place and her face was covered with broken blood vessels from Pujayasaâ€™s repeated attempts to strangle her.
              </p><p>
              
               She now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and cannot be left alone for more than a few minutes.
              </p><p>
              
              
              â€œHe has changed the way I live forever,â€� the victim wrote. â€œHe took my dreams, he took my independence, he took my self-esteem. He has ruined my life.â€�
              </p><p>
              
              
              Ketut Pujayasa pleaded guilty charges of aggravated sexual assault and attempted murder and was sentenced to 30 years and five months in a Texas federal prison.
              </p><p>
              
              
               Pujayasa is expected to be deported to his native Indonesia after serving his sentence. </p><p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2014433/nudist-cruise-ship-worker-raped-female-guest-and-threw-her-overboard-but-she-survived-by-clinging-to-railings-thanks-to-acrobat-training/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2014433/nudist-cruise-ship-worker-raped-female-guest-and-threw-her-overboard-but-she-survived-by-clinging-to-railings-thanks-to-acrobat-training/</a></p>

              PAPsmear-er posted :<p><i>A little bird told me this is the reason for the rift between the sister Lee Wei Ling on the one hand and Lee Hsien Loong and wife Ho Ching on the other hand. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                   After Old man died in March 2015, it was discovered that he had brought back many govt papers, some of which were potentially of a sensitive nature, and as well, among his private papers were matters relating to his assets in relation to his estates. Because no one could trusted to go through all the paper work and documents other then a family member, it was decided at the funeral that Ho Ching would take a 3 month sabbatical to go through all of it. Wei Ling was too busy with her practice and Hsien Yang was not too interested, so it came down to Ho Ching. That is why Ho Ching's sabbatical started in April 2015.
                  </i></p><p><i>
                   During the search of Old Man's documents, Ho Ching discovered the transcripts of Old Man's interviews and without consulting anyone assumed that they were state documents, among the many other state documents that were at the house. She handed the transcripts over to the cabinet secretary Tan Kee Yong, as his office is also located in the PMO. And he was some one she was familiar with as she sees him where ever she goes to the PMO. The transcripts were then turn over to the govt's care by Mr Tan and so she thought that was the end of it. It was only later when she mentioned that she had turned in the transcripts, that she was informed by Lee Wei Ling that those transcripts were the property of the Estate and not the govt. Ho Ching had a different opinion, and that is that since those interviews were made in LKY's capacity as PM, they cannot belong to him privately and has to belong to the state. While serving as Prime Minister, anything he says formally as in the interviews, should and has to be on public record. Nothing that a govt official puts into an official transcript can belong to that govt official. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                   As such, Ho Ching refused to retrieve the transcripts from Tan Kee Yong, and in fact on principal, it was determined by her that they were state property. As a result, LHL was put in a hard position. His sister wanted him to order the transcripts returned to the estate. But his wife told him that they belong to the state and hence, should not be returned. What was he supposed to do, caught between a rock and a hard place? In the end, he had no choice but to side with the wife or face matrimonial discord. 
                  </i></p><p><i>
                   As a result, Lee Wei Ling, who had by this time pressured a reluctant LHY to back her up, launched the lawsuit against the state to get the transcripts back. The unnamed family member in the lawsuit that turn over the transcripts is Ho Ching. Of course, the judge already knew how it was going to play out and denied their legal action. Hence, the war of words erupted between LWL and Ho Ching and LHY. You have the monkey with the middle finger instagram by Madam Ho, and remarks such as "dishonourable son" by LWL. I think the rift is possibly irreparable now between LWL and LHL / Ho Ching. </i></p><p><i>Its quite likely, that LWL, being like the bull in the china shop barged into Ho Ching and berated her for giving the transcripts to the govt. Its a simple procedure to get Hsien Loong to get it back. But after the scolding from LWL, I think Ho Ching just simply decided to screw her and told the husband not to give the transcripts back. And hence, the state of the relationship is where it is today. </i></p>
