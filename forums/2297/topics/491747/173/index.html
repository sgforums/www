              <i>On another forum, Papsmearer commented : </i><p>Singapore is now caught in the middle of a dangerous game of one upmanship by the US and China. I refer to the recent reports that China wants to loan to Malaysia a battery of mobile rocket launcher system, a powerful weapon that can fire 8-10 rounds of rocket equipped with up to 250lb warheads within 60 seconds, then scoot off and hide some where to reload an appear and fire again. As you can imagine, such a system is very hard to defeat. By the time you locate the source of the rocket firing, the whole system on an all wheel drive platform would have moved on to another location or gone into hiding. In the hands of a good crew and battery commander, they are very difficult to locate and destroy. During the First Gulf war when Iraq fired an older system known as Scud at Israel, the Coalition spend much resources and air craft to seek and destroy them. They were hard enough to find in a flat featureless desert environment, they must be that much harder to find in our type of terrain. 
              
              </p><p>
               This is an outright provocation, there is no other way to interpret this. China has long been sore about the accommodations the PAP has made for the US Navy at Changi Naval Base, as well as the aircraft repair and maintenance facilities at Paya Lebar for the USAF, as well as Singapore being a port of call and liberty port for the US pacific Fleet. Bearing in mind that both China and US are rachetting up the sabre rattling and preparing for a conflict in the south china seas. And Knowing that Singapore is a major logistics base for the US Navy and with substantial ability to repair US Naval vessels and aircraft, what better way to negate and threaten this then by basing the aforementioned rockets in the backyard of Singapore. 
              
              </p><p>
               These Chinese rockets, the AR 3 MLRS (Multiple Launch rocket system) can in within seconds, destroy the Changi Naval base, destroy hangers and repair depots at Paya Lebar and elsewhere, crater runways and possibly even sink several US Naval ships in port. The 280 km radius also puts all US naval assets under threat as they transit through the Straits of Malacca and as they approach Singapore and its surrounding areas. While true that US Naval vessels have very good anti missile defence systems such as the 20 mm Gatling gun type Phalanx Close in Weapons System (CIWS), and Sea Sparrow anti missile missiles, what makes the AR 3 system so deadly is that it can be fitted not only with conventional unguided warheads but also be fitted with guided missile warheads, and when fired in salvos with as many as 30 missiles going for one target, makes it very difficult to defend against. Anti missile defences on ships are designed to defeat the one or 2 missiles fired at a time from a single aircraft or even from a flight of aircraft. But 30 missiles at a time is an altogether different prospect. This in effect will turn the AR 3 into a mini ballistic inter theatre missile system. A very frightening prospect is this.
              
              </p><p>
               The fact that the Chinese are so eager to have this missile battery installed in Southern Malaysia, across the causeway from Singapore, in the state of Johor is not lost on the Americans and the PAP. How eager are they? They are so eager, they are prepared to give the Malaysians the AR 3 for free, on a 50 year loan, saving the Malaysians the cost of buying them outright. Wow, what a deal. Why couldnâ€™t the RSAF get its F-16s and F-15 on a 50 year loan too? The loan is set up as a purchase to own type of deal where, I suppose the Malaysians will pay on installment over 50 years. I wonder how agreeable the Chinese will be to forgiving the loan down the road, I am sure they will be. The Chinese will â€œloanâ€� the Malaysians 12 MLRS system, good for 4 batteries. One battery targeting the Changi Naval Base, One battery targeting Paya Lebar, One targeting Tengah Air Base, and one targeting the oil storage and tank farm facilities on Jurong Island, would decapitate singaporeâ€™s abilities in a 60 second salvo. 
              </p><p>
              
               But who will man these MLRS when and if they arrive? I am sure that Chinese advisors and technicians must be on hand to help operate and maintain them. You can be sure that since these are still technically Chinese property, until paid in full, the Chinese will try to keep them operational at 100%. This would be in stark contrast to other weapons systems operated by the Malaysian armed forces and air forces where weapon availability is somewhat less then 100%. But who will actually control them? The Chinese or the Malaysians? Even if this report is untrue, this would set an interesting future precedent. What if China offers to loan Malaysia 3 squadrons of Chengdu J-20 Stealth Fighters? Or 3 battalions of Type 99 MBT? They would then have the ability to point dagger at the US base of operations in Singapore.
              
              </p><p>
               If this gets hot, and the Chinese MLRS are fired from Malaysia into Singapore, what can the PAP do? They have just put Singaporeans in the way of these missiles. We are just like puppets being manipulated by the US and China. Thanks to our close affiliation with the Jewish State, and the US, I expect all our muslim neighbours to hate us. But I never bargain that even far away countries like China could potentially also be our enemies one day. I bet the PAP never saw this coming. I wonder if we can request to be a colony of the UK again, and let Whitehall handle our foreign relations? Because, as far as I can see, the PAP is just not cutting it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not a bad movie lah, for a China patriotic propagandish movie. In it, Wu Jing represents the elite China military, and takes a smirking dig at the US Military, as he single-handedly massacres hundreds of African soldiers and evil Ang Moh mercenaries. But martial arts fans may be disappointed, as the movie is only 10% martial arts, 90% military war movie. The unlikely and/or hidden strength of this movie, lies in brutally exposing the international audience to the harsh realities of living in perpetually war-torn Africa (a continent of 54 countries, majority of which suffer from incessant attacks from militant groups and warlords). Singaporeans should appreciate the taken-for-granted near-miraculous safety of Singapore a lot more.<p><img src="https://www.gv.com.sg/media/imagesresize/img3449.jpg"></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warriors_2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warriors_2</a></p><p>Golden Village : <a href="https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/3449/cinema/114">https://www.gv.com.sg/GVMovieDetails#/movie/3449/cinema/114</a></p><p>Trailer on YouTube : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Wolf+Warrior+II+%E6%88%98%E7%8B%BCII">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Wolf+Warrior+II+%E6%88%98%E7%8B%BCII</a></p><p>Btw, Wu Jing wrote the script and directed the entire movie. Directing and coordinating with hundreds of staff and crew is way tougher work than acting. In this portfolio regard, Wu Jing clearly owns his contemporaries Donnie Yen and (Singaporean) Jet Li. And with the multiple-record breaking success of this movie, Wu Jing's financial net worth has overtaken both Donnie Yen and Jet Li.

              A Malaysian man has been charged with more than 600 sex assaults against his daughter, and could face a jail term of over 12,000 years if found guilty, officials said Thursday.
              </p><p>
              Court officials took two days to read out all 626 charges against the 36-year-old divorcee, and finished Thursday afternoon. 
              </p><p>
              They included 599 charges of sodomy against the 15-year-old girl, as well as counts of incest, rape and other sex crimes.

              "China should also make clear that if North Korea launches missiles that threaten U.S. soil first and the U.S. retaliates with military force, China will stay neutral," the Global Times, which is widely read but does not represent government policy, said in an editorial.

              "If the U.S. and South Korea carry out military strikes and try to overthrow the North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean Peninsula, China will use military force to stop them from doing so," it said.

Months later, while testifying against the man who tried to kill him, he called it the best $30 he ever spent. Here's the footage, captured by Smith, that helped convict Malcolm Antwan Orr, 29, of attempted murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.

              Dear Singapore, as you celebrate your annual â€œWeâ€™re so glad weâ€™re not part of Malaysiaâ€� celebration, letâ€™s see what we can be thankful for. If you were part of Malaysia your 100 dollars will be in ringgit and will have shrunk to a third of its value to $35.45. Your national airline SIA is world renowned and rated for many years as #1 in the world as compared to MAS which is bankrupt and can even lose its plane. Your prime minister is smart and can even find time to program a sudoku solver in his spare time whereas Najib is making a fool of himself on the world stage. Your police and government pride itself as being corruption free, whereas the Malaysian Anti-Corruption officers have no recourse but to pray to God to protect them from the police. As you watch the fireworks tonight let every spark represent one of the 2.6 billion reasons why you should be glad youâ€™re not part of Malaysia. Happy Jubilee Singapore. May you prosper for many more years to come.
