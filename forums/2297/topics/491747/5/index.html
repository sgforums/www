            <div class='col-md body'>[USA] - Man in a full-body panda suit shot by police. The man had "displayed something that appeared to be wires and some other things inside his jacket that appeared to be some kind of explosive device." The device turned out to be composed of harmless materials, including chocolate candy bars wrapped in tin foil, he said. Three Baltimore police officers opened fire on the man as he ignored police orders to take his hands out of his pockets, police spokesman T.J. Smith told a news conference. A bomb robot was then dispatched to scan the man (lying on the floor after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds) for an hour before officers approached to remove his clothing, picked him up and carried him to an armored police vehicle. The suspect is now in serious but stable condition at a hospital.<p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/fox-tv-station-baltimore-evacuated-bomb-threat-191156916--finance.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/fox-tv-station-baltimore-evacuated-bomb-threat-191156916--finance.html</a></p></div>

Himmler agreed and Clauberg moved to Auschwitz concentration camp in December 1942. Part of the Block number 10 in the main camp became his laboratory. Clauberg looked for an easy and cheap way to forcibly sterilize women. He injected formaldehyde poison into their cervixes, uteruses and fallopian tubes while they were conscious without anesthetics. His test subjects were healthy young Jewish and Tzigani women all of whom suffered permanent damage to their sexual organs. Many of the women died in agony because of the tests. Estimates of those who survived but were permanently sterilized against their will, are around 700 women.</p></div>
