              <div><strong>National Day Message by Mr Ng Chee Meng</strong></div>
              <div><strong>Acting Minister (Schools) for Education,</strong></div>
              <div><strong>at the National Day Observance Ceremony</strong></div>
              <div><strong>in Secondary Schools / Junior Colleges / Centralised Institute</strong></div>
              <div><strong>on Monday, 8 August 2016</strong></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Principals, Teachers and Students</p>
              <p>1. ‘We, the citizens of Singapore...’ It must have been a special 
              feeling for the group of students, who first recited our National Pledge in 
              August 1966.  The first time they wholeheartedly declared themselves as 
              citizens of Singapore!  ‘We’ - such a short word, but so fraught with 
              meaning.</p>
              <p>2. Our forefathers came from different lands, spoke different 
              languages, believed in different religions and were of different ethnicities.  
              Yet, Singapore welcomed everyone and they became the pillars on 
              which Singapore was built.</p>
              <p>3. Many things threatened to pull us apart in our early years. We 
              were struggling to establish our own Armed Forces, which became 
              crucial when the British announced plans in 1968 to withdraw their 
              military troops. We had many economic uncertainties. Would we have 
              jobs?  Would we have a future?  Who would invest in a tiny island with 
              no natural resources?  How would we create jobs for a people with little 
              education? There were many questions and few answers.</p>
              <p>4. We overcame those early challenges and Singapore progressed.  
              We celebrated our 50th birthday as a nation last year.  We showed that 
              Singaporeans had what it took to overcome the odds.  We had never 
              been prouder reciting our pledge and singing our anthem, never more 
              moved in seeing how our pioneers worked hard and laid the foundations 
              for us.  If 50 years showed us something, it was that no matter how full 
              of uncertainties life can be, we can do it – when we put our mind to it 
              and work together towards our future.</p>
              <p>5. Singapore is 51 years old this year. What will the future bring? 
              There are still many uncertainties. The world is changing rapidly. Jobs 
              will look very different in the years to come. Around the world and closer 
              to home, terrorism and unpredictable weather and global markets are 
              making us increasingly concerned for our safety and security. Today, 
              just as in the past, we have many questions, and few ready answers.</p>
              <p>6. How can we respond to these challenges?   We must remain a 
              tightly knit ‘We’, pledging everyday as ‘one united people, regardless of 
              race, language, or religion’, to build a society guided by the principles ‘of 
              justice and equality’, so that we may ‘achieve happiness, prosperity and 
              progress’ for our nation.</p>
              <p>7. All of you are part of the new generation of Singaporeans who will 
              write the next chapter of our Singapore story. 'We' means working hard 
              together for our families, our communities and for Singapore, just as our 
              pioneers did.  We have to use the opportunities in schools to learn and 
              to grow.  We have to pick up values, knowledge and skills needed for 
              the future.  We need to make friends and build deep and meaningful 
              relationships with each other. In your own special way, use opportunities 
              and learning activities in and out of the classrooms such as, Values in 
              Action projects, CCAs, and student leadership programmes to make a 
              difference in our community. You can play an important part in our 
              Singapore story.</p>
              <p>8. ‘We’, the citizens of Singapore have indeed come a long way. We 
              are a nation strong and free, and we will continue to achieve great things 
              as we work, hand-in-hand, to build our Singapore of Tomorrow.</p>
              <p>9. I wish all of you a Happy National Day.</p>

              <i>What is the funniest incident that happened while you were on stage?</i><p>
              
              It happened during Shuxiang's graduation recital at the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music. He is a very expressive musician, so he likes to move a lot on stage.
              </p><p>
              I remember being immersed in the music we were playing.
              </p><p>
              As I was closing my eyes, I felt something ram violently into the right side of my head. It turns out he was moving on stage so much that his violin hit my head.
              </p><p>
              I lost consciousness out for a few seconds and we both missed a few notes. We could hear snickering and giggling from the audience, but we quickly recovered and continued playing.</p><p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/pianist-li-churen-goes-for-big-meals-before-a-performance">http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/pianist-li-churen-goes-for-big-meals-before-a-performance</a></p>
