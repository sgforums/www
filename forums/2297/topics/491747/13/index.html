              The trickiest challenge for self-driving cars -- which may still take decades to hone -- is getting computers to process unpredictable situations as quickly and effectively as a human being can. At the MIT conference, Leonard showed some dashcam video footage of his own car navigating Boston traffic, which highlighted powers of the human brain computers canâ€™t yet match. In one scene, the car approaches an intersection where the traffic light is red but a police officer is waving cars through. A couple blocks later, the opposite occurs: the traffic light is green but a police officer is signaling cars to stop.<p>Most people know intuitively that the police officer trumps the traffic light, and theyâ€™ll do what the cop directs them to do. Thatâ€™s very hard to build into a computer algorithm, which would basically follow the general rule of doing what the traffic light says. Police presence can be programmed into the algo, but itâ€™s still hard for software to tell if somebody waving their arms at an intersection is a law-enforcement officer or a stupid idiot.</p><p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/google-tesla-self-driving-cars-human-drivers-171042031.html">https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/google-tesla-self-driving-cars-human-drivers-171042031.html</a>

              [Singapore] - Singaporean elderly woman loses life savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars to scammers from China.<p>
              She was told not to tell anyone this investigation. Otherwise, she would be guilty of divulging China's state secrets and imprisoned for 15 years. There were multiple people who, along the way, noticed something amiss and asked her if something was wrong. Yet she managed to fob them off. One of them was the bank teller at the first bank where she withdrew the initial sum. (The teller asked her if she was being intimidated. She said no, our of fear. She even yelled at the bank teller that "this is my money! why cant I take it out!"). Another was the bank teller at the second bank where she withdrew the second sum of money. (That bank teller said that they would need to inform the other joint account holder of the withdrawal, as the entire account balance was being withdrawn. She warned them not to do so, and that this was all her money and not his anyway.) Even the staff at 2 of the 3 remittance companies she went to at People's Park Complex to remit the monies to the scammers asked her if she was under duress.</p><p><a href="http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/elderly-grandma-lost-entire-life-savings-foreign-dhl-parcel-scammers">http://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/elderly-grandma-lost-entire-life-savings-foreign-dhl-parcel-scammers</a></p>

               The doctors are happy too. But they have advised Swee Keat not to receive visitors yet, so that he can get as much rest as possible.
               I told him we had made arrangements to look after his residents in Tampines while he recuperates. He gave me two thumbs up. 
               Swee Keat wants to thank everyone for their support. He especially sends his greetings and best wishes to his Tampines residents and volunteers, who have been asking after him. - LHL <p><img src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13344519_10153496920068414_6951811227987684505_n.jpg?oh=4775975a7d6c36876c4b05f84671e8fb&amp;oe=57E111E0"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Logicked features Amos Yee in his latest YouTube video. Clearly, Amos Yee gives Singapore a bad reputation in more ways than one. Because followers of Logicked's videos are mostly pro-free speech and atheists, they feel Amos Yee (who professes to be pro-free speech, anti-religion and anti-government) is therefore one of them, and so they feel obligated to 'attack' Singapore in their visitor comments. A minority of the visitors, though, are indeed able to see through Amos' real nature and intentions. On a side-note, Logicked remains commendably more balanced, restrained and polite, compared to say, either Amos Yee or Dusty Smith.<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKZhtdZ5gp0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKZhtdZ5gp0</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ironically, the country that begins military conflict with China over the South China Seas, may not even be a claimant to the South China Seas. Indonesia doesn't give anyone face (even Malaysia hates Indonesia, and user 'dragonden' notes that <i>From real life case of Malaysian fishermen told to me : the Indonesian coast guard towed their fishing boat from international waters into Indonesian waters, then declared them illegal fishing in their waters and arrested them</i>), and at the same time, China is really going overboard with their South China Sea 'expansions' and riskily antagonizing every other country around them.<p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/china-angry-indonesia-detains-fishing-boat-103430704.html">https://sg.news.yahoo.com/china-angry-indonesia-detains-fishing-boat-103430704.html</a></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[Singapore] - A 14 year old girl simultaneously has ongoing sexual relations with 2 boyfriends, a 14 year old boy and an 18 year old teen (who incidentally cheated with his 19 year old ex-girlfriend to be with this 14 year old girl). 14 year old boy demands to meet 18 year old teen, who brings along his gangster dad. The 3 of them start fighting. The 18 year old teen's 19 year old ex-girlfriend's 28 year old male friend, also present at the scene, tried to break up the fight. Both sides mistook the 28 year old man as belonging to the other side, and so he was beaten up by both sides, and ended up being hospitalized with the most severe injuries among all of them.<p><a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/teenage-love-affair-ends-bloody-mess-teck-whye-badminton-court">http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/teenage-love-affair-ends-bloody-mess-teck-whye-badminton-court</a></p></div>
