              Congrats to Mei, good fight, Jenny. Jenny must be feeling disappointed, she was clearly hoping that her last fight with Angela would be her only single loss of her career. Looks like Mei might soon be re-challenging Angela for the belt soon.<p>
              But for the final event, Bigdash vs N Sang, it should clearly have been a draw. Not to say the judges were corrupt and/or threatened by any Myanmar gang syndicate, but it's frankly bullshit for the judges to (unanimously, no less) rule the Myanmese a winner, when the fight was so obviously an overall draw (on their feet, the Myanmese slightly dominated; on the ground, the Russian slightly dominated). The Russian visibly feels the judges have been unfair to him, and that he doesn't deserve this only loss in his career.

              Did you know... Singapore has a few other undefeated female MMA fighters, even if they're not as famous or have as impressive an undefeated victory string as Angela's. One of them, Sherilyn Lim, has an unfortunate blemish on her professional career (one that almost killed her, and damaged her professional reputation), even if she remains undefeated on record. How so? Read on for the full story.<p>

                      <i>"In September 1993, Bas Rutten had his debut in Pancrase MMA against the heavier Ryushi Yanagisawa, knocking him out with palms and knee strikes in only 48 seconds into the 1st round. The KO was so brutal that Yanagisawa was carried from the ring and spent 2 days in a hospital, with Bas himself fearing for Yanagisawa's life." - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPhrjaznJRU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPhrjaznJRU</a></i>

                                          </p><p>And not just MMA inside the cage, Bas is a true mixed martial artist and unrivalled street fighter, including being a Krav Maga expert. His legendary exploits include disarming then beating up a bouncer who pointed a loaded ready-to-fire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47">AK-47 assault rifle</a> at him, as well as (in a separate incident) fighting and beating up several bouncers all at the same time. He is famous for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_shot">liver shot</a>, ie. striking with extreme force directly at the opponent's liver, which instantly incapacitates the victim with excruciating pain and nausea / vomiting, an instant TKO.</p><p>Other than his MMA career, which he has since retired from, Bas has been teaching martial arts both offline and online, and his highly educational *and* entertaining YouTube videos can be viewed for free on his channel here... he even uploaded every single one of his 32 MMA fights to his YouTube channel, with his own personal commentary added in : </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialBasRutten">https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialBasRutten</a></p><p>

                                  </p><p>Liver shots are even more excruciatingly painful than kicks to the groin / balls, and in addition to the excruciating agony, comes with instant devastating nausea and uncontrollable vomiting. Personally, I think it should be illegal in MMA, but the reason why it hasn't been made illegal, is that fighters can always claim the shot was accidental, since unlike kicks to the groin, which are more obviously deliberate, liver shots can indeed be accidental, since the liver is located between the chest and abdomen of the body.

              One of the greatest fights in all of MMA history...<p>
                              <i>At Pancrase 1996 Anniversary Show, Masakatsu challenged King of Pancrase Bas Rutten in what is considered to be one of the greatest fights in Pancrase MMA history. The Japanese wrestler came near finishing the match earlier with an ankle lock, but Rutten miraculously escaped and went defensive. Funaki made a wide usage of the knee-on-stomach and mount position to initiate leglock attacks, but the Dutch countered every time and eventually pushed Masakatsu away of him, moment in which the Japanese threw an illegal kick to Rutten, who was on his knees. The Dutch fighter proceeded to knock Funaki down with a palm strike, and then broke completely his nose with a second palm strike to a supine Funaki. The stunned Japanese tried to stand up with Rutten, only for Bas to capitalize with his famed striking game. Rutten knocked him down twice with palms and knees, and then landed a lengthy, unanswered string of strikes, until a knee to the face finally downed Funaki.</i> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masakatsu_Funaki">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masakatsu_Funaki</a></p><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dhR3KArkvkA/hqdefault.jpg"></p><p>

                  </p><p>Bas Rutten on this fight : <i>"Before the fight when he came to me, he made that thumb over the neck, throat slashing motion like I was going to go down. I turned to my manager and said, "Okay, now I'm going to kill this guy, you watch". My game plan was to keep the fight going for 15 minutes...Funaki had never fought above 15 minutes. But then, like 12 minutes into it, while I'm still on my knees he kicks me in the head. I block, but for me that was an illegal thing to do. So right away I start, BANG, BANG, BANG, and he goes down. From that moment on, I totally destroyed him. You got to see the fight; it was a massacre. My palms were black from hitting him so hard. He had the gods on his side or something, because he stood up every time. I hit his face back on the mat and you hear it slam into the mat. His nose is all the way to the side, broke, they have to straighten it out. I go, "Oh my God, this guy can take a shot!" I kneed him so hard in the head. He went down four times. But the last knee I gave to him was like everything I had. I grabbed him by the head and kneed him. It was really like a Rocky movie. I'm standing there and I fall backwards, and I'm totally out of breath. I get up and the referee holds my hand up. Then he lets my hand go and I drop again, BOOM! I was exhausted, I gave everything I had; I really wanted to destroy him. I broke his cheekbones and broke his nose, just because he said he was going to kill me. Oh, I was so angry at him. But afterwards, friends again...what a crazy sport this is, huh?"</i>
