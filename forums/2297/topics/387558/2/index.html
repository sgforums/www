              Hey. You are from Riverside Sec?? I knew a bio teacher thr Ms Tang, you know her?? She was my Bio teacher when I was in sec sch. lol. regarding ur L1R5, I agree w deathmaster, YJC is not bad a choice if u stay in the north. You got CCA points also, could minus 1 or 2 from ur L1R5. with ur result, u might have the chance to science stream, and I hope u didnt perform well in o lvl solely becos of ur injury, becos JC science is really tough. You nd a lot of concentration and dertermination. btw, if you fail to get into a science stream, do appeal to ur JC, w reasons like you have always been doing well for sciences in sec sch(w prove btr, like mid year exam result), o lvl didnt perform well becos of the injury.
              
              All the best~

              <p>Once you are in there, do all your tutorial questions and ask your tutor whenever in doubt. Attempt all the tougher questions when you feel comfortable with your competency level. If you have any other tougher questions, you can feel free to post them here. The forummers would be glad to help out. And if you really need a tuition teacher, please engage one. I remember wee_ws being an excellent tutor for Math. For a subject like Math, all I can say is practice makes perfect. Work hard! =D</p>
