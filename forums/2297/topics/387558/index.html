              <p>Hi, i am a student and i am waiting for my Os results. I am getting nervous as 11th jan draws nearer and i really need views and suggestions.</p>
              <p>I was in a slightly above average neighbourhood school, with the following subjects:English, Chinese, EM, AM, His/ss and the 3 pure sciences.</p>
              <p>I am very nervous at the moment as i knew i had not prepared myself well for my Os.</p>
              <p>I was in the hospital due an accident and was in and out of the hospital.My injures and emotions after the accident had taken a toll on me and has affected my progess on my studies dastically.</p>
              <p>I really wish to get into a science stream in JC, the following suggests how well i had been doing before Os and i wish to know my chances.</p>
              <p>English - B4 and C5           Chinese - Currently holding on a B3 O level</p>
              <p>EM - A1                                Am - been failing</p>
              <p>His/ss - A2/Bs                     Biology - A2/B3</p>
              <p>Physic - Cs                          Chemistry - Bs</p>
              <p>So i had been getting 18 to 20 for my L1R5s.</p>
              <p>I have prepared myself for the worse and since I have a strong passion for the subject Biology, i have checked on related courses and i am quite confused.</p>
              <p>Biomedical science, Biomedical engineering etc...They all seem quite close??</p>
              <p>So i actually need views on my chances in getting into a science stream in JC with perhaps a L1R5 of  17 to 20 and information on the courses related to my interest.</p>
              <p>Thank you for spending time reading, please help me. T.T</p>

              <p>wait up ur idea. 17-20 pt can barely allow u to make it to the arts stream in jc if ur lucky.</p>
              <p>if u r desperate to do science stream A levels, i think you can try MI.</p>
              <p>either u retake ur O's</p>
              <p>or u take a poly course, and excel in it to go uni</p>

              <p>Like what deathmaster stated, it's rather hard to get into JC with L1R5 of 17 to 20. I would rather you get into poly than into MI if you failed to get into JC.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who went to MI and pretty much regretted it. He told me the study environment and teachers in MI ain't good at all. Besides, I heard from him 2 years ago that A-level failure rate was 60% (he told me heard it from the sch/teacher itself) if I remember it correctly which means 40% passed A-level and the passing rate of 40% does not means 40% gets into a university in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Then again, wait for your result to be out before you decides on anything. Any path you decides to take now maybe irrelevant later since anything can happen (for the better or worst) when your result is out. Who knows, you might score better than you expected.</p>

              <p>Since when did MOE promise us, students, a place in anything? Whether a JC accepts you depends on how the students fare in that year. Do you seriously think those so-called bottom ranking JC will accept TS if there are ton of students who also applied for it and scored better than TS's 20 point?</p>
              <p>There is no 100% guaranteed placing. Therefore, right back to you - "You anyhow say one".</p>
              <p>Yup, I have a friend who scored 18 points, went into PJC, couldn't make pass the first year and went to poly instead. The result? Wasted 1 year of life.</p>
              <p>Look at what Junyang900 said which is also another example. Like what people says, if your head cannot wear a hat that big, don't force yourself to wear it.</p>
              <p>For your info, even popular courses in poly is hard to get in. It's all thanks to people who can make it to good JCs but still choose to get into poly. Take my course for example, a few who scored less than 10 points for O-level. Seriously spoil market and makes average people with average result having harder time getting into local universities.</p>

              <p>MOE is able to make the promise because the grades are moderated by MOE so MOE can know how many students will be eligible for JC. So, there is no such thing as "tons of students to apply for JC" hor.</p>
              <p>If you do not believe it , you can call up the MOE or find a Singaporean student with L1R5 of 20 points or less and a c6 in english and a d7 in 2nd lang that is rejected or not admitted to a JC. But the choice of the JC is not up to the student ie MOE will assign a place in a JC to the student.</p>
              <p>So, you are still not anyhow say meh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>BUT, MOE did not say that all JC students who meet the minimum requirements to apply for the 3 local universities will be given a place.</p>

              <p>There are enough JC vs Poly discussions on every Sg based forum on the internet already. Those interested can google them out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suffice to say both JC and Poly can be equally good choices, depending on what the individual student wants for him/herself.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/263176">Jenri619june</a> wrote :<br>"I really wish to get into a science stream in JC."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this is really the case (so let's look into the scenario of you getting into JC, not poly), but you're afraid your "injures and emotions after the accident" prevented you from doing your best, and you might not do well enough to get into a good JC, then :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#1 - If JC is where you're sure you wanna go, then instead of 'giving up' and going to a poly reluctantly (never do this. Go to a poly only if you're sure you know what you're doing. Half of all poly students regret their course of study, not properly understanding that the career for the rest of their lives will be determined based on their particular poly course / diploma), then it may be better for you to #2 or #3 instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#2 - If your L1R5 not good enough for a JC, go MI. The figures stated about MI by <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/206176">furb</a> are true, but that doesn't mean MI is good for nothing. Just as there have been spectacular failures from MI, there have also been spectacular successess from MI (those going on to study at prestigous universities around the world, or at local Unis NUS NTU SMU). It's all up to the individual student, how self-motivated you are. For some students, being in MI is a bonus, akin to how it may be more self-affirming to be the "best of the worst" rather than be the "worst of the best".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>#3 - Retake your 'O' levels as a private candidate in 2010. Your Physics, Chemistry, Biology results have been quite ok so far. But your 'A' maths needs more work. You need good A Maths results to go into Sci stream in JC, as A Maths is a prerequisite for H2 Maths, which is in turn, a prerequisite for most Science based Uni courses (eg. medicine, engineering, etc). You may want to consider engaging one or more Math tuition teachers eg. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/239626">wee_ws</a> and <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/7461">eagle</a>. You're only as strong as your weakest link, and your weakest link is A Maths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the meantime, however, do read up more carefully on the various Poly courses (don't shut out the possibility of going to Poly). I advise against going Poly if you don't know what you want, or which course is appropriate for you, so it is for your own sake to read up more carefully on every single Poly course that may interest you. Many poly course sound similar, eg. biomedical vs bioengineering, but you end up with two completely different careers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I made a post recently here regarding Ngee Ann Polytechnic's new Veterinary Bioscience course :</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/386821">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/386821</a></p>
              <p><br>Some pple who love animals and pets think it their dream course. It's actually their nightmare course. Pple who graduate from this course are technicians involved in (what pet lovers would call "cruel") animal testing and handling in drug research labs. Such as deliberately inducing cancer into the animal to test the efficacy of new anti-cancer drugs.</p>
              <p><br>So read carefully, and be sure you know what you're getting into.</p>

              <p>In reply to Poignant I was from Riverside Secondary at Woodlands, went in with a Tscore of 243.</p>
              <p>Can anyone explain the differences in the following poly courses?</p>
              <p>Biomedical science</p>
              <p>Biotechnology</p>
              <p>Bioengineering</p>
              <p>Although its apparent that the courses are popular in the order i listed (infer from cutoffs), i cannot actually tell the difference between them.</p>
              <p>And i am aware that i have just missed the open house for various polys.T.T</p>

              <p>Ultima kinda answered the question really well already.</p>
              <p>Also, let's not forget YJC has fixed their cut-off points at 20, and are very flexible about their students' choice of subjects in both streams.</p>

              <p>since u study at woodlands, i assume you stay somewhere up north?</p>
              <p>can try YJC, since they have a more lenient admission requirement.</p>
              <p>but you must work really hard there.</p>

              <p>just some little advice for those who are planning to go JC. the route of A level aint easy and it requires alot of academic commitment n resistance towards temptation. there are many camps and events happening in JCs every year. make sure dont dwell into too much of such activities but rather focus on ur subjects. afterall u go to a JC to study not to have fun. It might be easy to pass A levels, but it aint easy to excel in A levels. Remember, u either make it or break it. Excel in As and get to uni of ur choice, or scrap through and end up no where. To put it bluntly, JC is just a stepping stone towards university entry. But u also cant live without this important stepping stone.</p>
              <p>This further bring me to <a href="/users/263176">Jenri619june</a> comment on completing 30% of AM paper but stil can pass. why is this so? As most of us know there is this thing call moderation. and moderation plays a major role in national level exams. your L1R5 points might be not be a good reflection of your actual academic performance. Do bear in mind that with the introduction of IP programmes, students from Top end school are not taking part in the O levels, the abscence of this group of students plays a great part in affecting the moderation of the O level result. BUT do bear in mind, they are competing in the A levels with you guys 2 years down the road which means very tough competition. In short, do know your aim and your objective of entering a JC. Dont wait till last minute then start to panic. Its too late. Best of luck n cheers!</p>

              <p><br>Yes, good choice. (MI is a godsend to many who will do better in the 'A' level route, but whose L1R5 doesn't make the 20 points cut).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your intention is to do Science in the University, take H2 Chem, H2 Physics, H2 Maths. Contrasting subject (being a H1) doesn't matter so much (eg. most Science students take Econs).</p>
