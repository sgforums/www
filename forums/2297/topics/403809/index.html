              <p>Hi erm guys, as said before, im a jc student and im only in jc1, yet i'm feeling so stressed already. School is 1 hr away from home, lessons end very late, ccas ending later in the night like 9pm, with project work and schoolwork to do, this is simply too much for me. Firstly, after my cca, i would reach home at 10, and i will be too tired by then to study,( This will be 2 times a week for now, and then 3 times a week for the start of next year) school ends at 3.50 for me on tues and 5.30 on thurs, the rest are cca days. Then, just thinking about the travelling already makes me kind of stressed up.</p>
              <p>However after thinking further, i realise that pw is a major factor. As im the leader, there are many things i must do, and with 1 slacker in the group, and another rather angsty one, i find it very difficult to control them, and sometimes it just goes out of hand. Also, i dont want to waste my time here, i really want to get into medicine school, and somehow the thought of me not getting into med sch just made me even more stressed.If i want to last another 1.5 years of these, i am really gonna need advice, otherwise....otherwise i may not be able to take it anymre. </p>
              <p>SO PLEASE HELPPP</p>

But what really boosts your portfolio is leadership. You join a slack slack club, be the P, though u might still have quite a bit to cope with, but it's a much better achievement IMO. </p></div>

              <p><br>Sudying as a medical student, working as a medical doctor, will be many, many, many times more stressful than your JC life now. You already cannot tahan JC student life, what more a medical student's life, or a career doctor's working life?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You might like to reevaluate your goals in life, or at least the routes leading to them. There are always multiple routes that may be taken to reach the same goal (whether it be a career in medicine, or what you think a career in medicine means to you).</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Many JC students aspire to be doctors.</p>
              <p>They know that to be a doctor, they need to get the perfect score ie distinctions in 3H2 subjects, GP, PW and one contrasting H1 subject and to enhance their chances, many students know that they need to excel in their CCAs too and to do voluntary works with leadership positions and distinctions in H3 subjects eg Biology, Chemistry.</p>
              <p>Most top JCs students scored A in their project works as there are the experienced lecturers who will ensure that the project works submitted by the students are of A grade standard before these works are submitted to the MOE. Not A grade standard works will be thrown back to the students and the students will need to redo and redo until they are of A grade standard.</p>
              <p>So, you just work hard, your experienced lecturers in the JC will help you and seek their help whenever you have any problems with your project work or the team members.</p>
              <p>However, it must be noted that not all students who aspire to be doctors will become doctors. There are also other interesting careers that one can consider.</p>

              <p>ic, ok</p>
              <p>Just fyi on doctors and why I do not aspire to become one after hearing what my uncle (who is a specialist doctor) and some career seminar in my JC last time.</p>
              <p>Doctors have to make big sacrifices, especially in terms of time. The workload is super heavy and you cannot afford to any single mistake for it could possibly cost a patient's life.</p>
              <p>As a doctor, you have to study 5 years (with minimal breaks, sufficiently only for guys to go reservist) and undergo 1 year of housemanship. In total, 6 years. For most other degrees, it's only 4 years, so the graduates of other degrees will have 2 years advantage, and from a mathematical viewpoint, the differences in monetary terms is huge. Indeed, a doctor is not about $$.</p>
              <p>You will also be bonded to the govt for 5 years (I think is 5) and you won't be able to quit without forking out lots of $$ (again) if you find that you detest the job.</p>
              <p>The barrier to exit is also very high; not many other jobs will take you in. Basically, you are almost stuck forever in this field.</p>
              <p>Any major mistake and your licence to practise will be cancelled. Then how?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my friends who are in... it appears that there's quite a bit of politics within the student cohort in the medicine faculty.</p>
              <p>And in case anyone thinks doctors are paid well... at the very start, the basic pay is $3k. You will need to work lots of overnight OT, and you get about $200 for every night OT. On average, per month, you do 10 overnight OTs, so your salary will be about $5k.</p>
              <p>Of course, the longer you stay and the higher you climb in this sector, the better you will be compensated. But do bear in mind that this is a very well established sector with many seniors in front of you who are young, energetic, and sitting in the higher echelons, leaving you with not much room to climb further.</p>
              <p>Most doctors also marry within themselves because they have simply not much time to go out and find and know other people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Above basically sums up why I don't want to be a doctor. But if you are extremely passionate about serving people's medical needs at the expense of personal time sacrifice, go ahead. As for me, I prefer to serve society in my own other ways <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif">.</p>

              <p>travel:</p>
              <p>1 hr to school is very normal for Singapore once you get to sec school stage and beyond. you were 'pampered' by the SG govt for your primary school indirectly thru the 1km entry requirement. so you just need to accept the fact and work around it.</p>
              <p>cca:</p>
              <p>cca is oso not a big deal. every student has a cca. and most ppl will choose an active cca, except for those who cannot do it (too fat or sick)</p>
              <p>med school:</p>
              <p>pls lah, med school is years away. do your current studies well first then talk about it.</p>
              <p>your real problem:</p>
              <p>it's typical adjustment problem everyone experience to some degree whenever u change your environment (primary to sec, sec to JC, JC to NS, NS to uni, uni to working life)</p>
              <p>if you really cannot handle the 'normal' load you are given now, you should talk to your teachers and parents to work something out. something has to give. and it could well be a switch of cca, maybe even school if its that bad for you to travel the relatively normal 1 hr journey.</p>
              <p>at every stage of your life, it is the challenges that make you grow up a bit more, learn to manage your own life. of course, if you bite off more than you can handle, back off. however, i hope you dont need to do anything drastic and just carry on and adjust over time.</p>

              <p>Time management is at the heart of your issues.</p>
              <p>You have not described how much time you spend on social/ play activities.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you can cut down in some areas?</p>
              <p>When the going gets tough, it is the tough who get going. Great that you have the loftyy aspiration to become a doctor. But the life as a professional is much tougher than than what you are going through now........</p>
              <p>So if you cannot even handle the difficlties now, you may need to readjust your ambitions.</p>
              <p>it's been said that you cannot have your cake and eat it.</p>
              <p>Your life may bwe tough right now. It's not like you are not up to it and faring poorly. You just want your lot easier. If your career aspiration means a lot to you, you should just bite the bullet and tough these couple of years out. You owe it to yourself to prove that you have what it takes to conquer all these difficulties to reach your goal......</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>obviously not everyone can be a doctor. you need to be straight As to enter the programme. you also need to study very hard for the 5 years course and after you graduated, the workload is extremely tough. those who enter the course is highly intelligent and exceptional. ask yourself if you are one first. if you are just a mediocre or above average student, this course is not for you, not that you will qualify for the course anyway.</p></div>
