              <p>You still don't seem to get it.</p>
              <p>Do <strong>not</strong> go into an industry <strong>just because</strong> it has a large demand for workers. That is the surest way for you to regret your choice.</p>
              <p>If you think you want to do precision engineering or oil and gas engineering, do your research into these fields. Find out what it is all about and ask yourself whether or not you would be interested in them. Use Wikipedia if you have to.</p>
              <p>If you're interested in those fields, then go and find out what courses would be relevant for you to pursue a career in them.</p>

              <p> the market does not actually have a "market" that is having a shortage of man power.</p>
              <p>look at recruitment ads. some actually post requirements like diploma from any engineering discipline. the more specialised ones actually require years of experience in the field or a degree/master with years of experience.</p>
              <p>bottom line. pursue ur interest period. in my 3 years there are many dry but essential modules that I have to learn.. if you don't have interest what you might take at the end of the sem would be little or no knowledge.. coupled with bad grades of course</p>

              <p>The reason why your parents are not supportive is because the market for creation of computer games is not that huge in Singapore (read: really pathetically small), as compared to countries such as US, Japan and South Korea.</p>
              <p>If you want to really enter this field, you may want to consider going overseas to US to study (unless you want to start learning Japanese or Korean), and look for a related job after you have finished a related diploma course locally. </p>
              <p>Note that even if you have a degree in the US, companies may not want you as there are a lot of applicants.</p>
              <p>In the end, you may have to save up, get some friends, and come up with your own project. A lot of people (even the creator of pokemon) came up with their own projects, even if it means that they have to stick to 2 meals a day (and by meal, I mean instant noodles). Thus, if you are really want to enter this field, you will need to be really passionate and willing to sacrifice a lot of things.</p>

              <p>You're defining your interests far too narrowly.</p>
              <p>If you're interested in computer gaming, then you might want to be a computer programmer or a computer engineer. Go find out more about these fields and what a career in them is like. If you're interested, then go and find out what courses are relevant for a career in such a field. After all, how did you think Electronic Arts or Blizzard came up with all those games? They were the work of computer specialists.</p>
              <p>Likewise, if you like to search for 'amazing' news (whatever that may be), then you may want to go into journalism or mass communications. Go find out what a career in such a field is like, and what courses are relevant for them.</p>
              <p>Take your time to figure out your interests, and remember not to think in such narrow terms. Don't close the door to other options while you're at it.</p>

              <p>Let me share with you what I have choosen. 5 years ago, I wanted to be tutor so I began teaching students while I was studying Biomed. 2 years ago, I realised the how IT can help benefit students, and I started learning IT. The marriage between IT and Education is simply wonderful!</p>
