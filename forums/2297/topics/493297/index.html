Pupils who wish to opt out can also do so.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>MOE said most schools offer Higher Chinese from Primary 5.</p>

A pupil not offered Higher Chinese in lower primary can still take it later.</p>
              <p style='box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; background-color: #f3f3f3;'>MOE said it was up to schools to decide on selection criteria: "There is flexibility... for a child to take up or drop Higher Chinese Language at different levels.</p>

              Similarly, it's tragic and unfair that getting straight As in all subjects for A levels only gives a JC student a 20% chance of getting into Medicine in Singapore.<p>It's ridiculous and outrageous that many such straight As JC students are able to get into SMC recognized Medical schools in more prestigious Universities in UK, USA, Australia, etc, after being rejected by NUS and NTU, simply because of lack of available places.</p><p>Every year, many loving parents sell their HDBs and get into serious debt, just to support their son or daughter's medical doctor ambitions and send them to overseas Medical schools, after being rejected by NUS and NTU, despite getting straight As.</p><p>At the same time, Singapore is being flooded by medical doctors from overseas (coz the Govt says Sg not enough doctors, so must import more foreign doctors), whose Medical schools are of lower admission standards than NUS and NTU, simply because of the larger number of available places in these foreign Unis.</p><p>This is unfair to Singapore JC students, whose scores indicate they're actually more qualified to study Medicine, than the many foreign medical doctors imported into Singapore every year.</p><p>NUS and NTU should continue to increase their Medical school intake every year, to be fair to Singapore JC students, and to meet the increasing demand for medical doctors for Singapore's aging population.

              <p>The thing is, it is only at primary 1. Do you think the majority of cohort will score more than 97 at pre-university level? I highly doubt that can happen, and it isnt happening in even the most prestigious JC in Singapore. </p>
              <p>I once scored 100 marks for A-math in secondary school. Not because I was very smart, but because the paper was extremely easy. It is the school's fault that so many people can score more than 97 marks. The school should have set a much tougher paper to avoid grade inflation. It really boils down to supply/demand to explain why your kids dont qualify after scoring 97. </p>
