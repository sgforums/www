              <p>DDSN visited our sch recently. Though I was not in the dialogue with her, my colleagues said that she implicitly (but clearly) implied that if you are not happy with the teaching job, then quit.<br>-<br>One teacher spoke up about the avalanche of initiatives, and everyone was so worried that he might offend the DDSN.

              <p>In most countries, when workers go on strike or complain about poor working conditions, they get promises of better pay and working conditions.<br>-<br>In our MOE, this is what they have done to teachers<br>1) remove pension scheme. Your CONNECT plan pays much less than pension scheme, by at least 67%<br>+<br>2) if you complain, they tell you to quit. There is no talk about improving the lot of teachers.<br>+<br>3) you complain, they load you with even more initiatives. They totally are thinking of putting up a bigger opera show. Most of them only promote because of all these show, and not because they did something concrete<br>=<br>Just do your job, collect your pay and spend time with your kids. The ‘D’ grade is that big deal?? Then I suggest you manage your finances better, so that you can’t be so easily threatened. If the principal realize that you are not scared of ‘D’, she will be scared of you.<br>She try to be funny with you, you tell her off. ‘D’ grade big deal ah?

              <p>I threw in the towel after yrs of teaching in a sec sch. My husband is still teaching. I remembered when we were still in the profession together, we would wake at 5am, leave the house at 6am and be home after 6pm, only to eat our dinner in silence. Reason? We were simply too tired to engage in any conversation after a long day of teaching, meetings, admin etc. We would then proceed to the study room to complete markings, prepare lessons and needless to say, more admin which could now be accessed from home. (School-related emails used to be only accessible from school’s network) Whoever finished the work first would hit the sack. It was not an uncommon sight to see our lights still on at 2am. Couple time had to be created. To make things easier, we would sit down and do our respective markings together. This help to create little windows for us to make casual remarks every now and then. Having children was placed on hold because we were both doing very well. Don’t get me wrong, we love our jobs. The joy from spending time with students in the classroom is irreplaceable. It is true that we are often overwhelmed by long meetings, courses and admin work such as collecting money, giro forms etc but we held onto the little joys we get from our students to keep us going.</p>
              <p>When we finally have kids, I found it difficult to juggle the long hours and minding the kids. My parents and parents-in-law are getting old and finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with the children. I tried the different schemes that MOE has put in place, half-load, 3/4 load, flexi-adjunct, but principals have a lot of control over how they want to ‘operate’ the schemes. A lot of my friends, and myself included, ended up getting the full load but half the pay. Some of my luckier friends get a lot of support from their principals and they find it a lot easier to manage work and family. As a result, they are happier and more willing to commit at work.</p>
              <p>Guess after more so many years in teaching, something just had to go as we made the decision to focus on the children. I quitted my job. My husband was very supportive as he, too, is a victim of the system. I find it easier to support him in his career because I have been through the path. Should he come home late and had to shut himself in the study room, I would make sure the kids do not disturb him. We would discuss his students and the best approach to help them achieve their potential. I must admit that if I had been in another profession, we would probably have countless arguments because of his long hours.</p>

              <p>I once tried to join teaching as a profession in 2004.</p>
              <p>The salary they offered me then was only $1900/mth. (Hey I was a NUS science graduate and worked in the society for 3 years already! My previous job pay was $2500!)</p>
              <p>Ok, pay aside, it’s the passion for the children right? So i still tried for 6 months.</p>
              <p>AND WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I HAD.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the school’s HOD asked me to plan what I was going to teach for the next week, right down to details such as textbook pg no, and workbook pg no, which example, which questions and on which day and time.</p>
              <p>Then I have to look after at least 1 CCA – badminton (which I’m not even good at) after school.</p>
              <p>And throughout the 6 months, I have to deal with 3Ps – PARENTS, PRINCIPLE, &amp; PEERS (or fellow colleagues)… one teacher told me that I was not allowed to wear OPEN TOES shoe to school and my skirt has to touch the knee… the principle said that I was not allowed to shout or scold the pupils, no matter how naughty they are… and the parents sided their kids when their kids were touting money from their classmates…</p>
              <p>After 6 mths, I quit.</p>
              <p>Passion? I leave it to another passionate person to take over me.</p>
              <p>I subsequently joined an MNC whose pay was $3500. There was still stress at work but it was not as much as being a teacher with a low meagre pay of $1900!</p>

              <p>@ Pay ain’t everything: i agree. to some teachers, its all about passion. my little sis is a teacher. she was so passionate about teaching and before she joined, she told me about her dream and stuff. now sometimes she cried to me, teaching is really tough. and she cant wait for the bond to end. not only her, many of her friends as well.</p>

              <p>From my teaching internship experience: Teaching is one of the dumbest jobs i have tried out and i will never fall into that trap ever again. Politics, Stupid no-brain ruffian kids (teenage boys), endless worksheets to prepare (just so kids have something to do), and the damn politics.. n waking up at 5am and leaving at 5pm, expectated to do remedial, cca n all that crap. Waste of time. If youi have the brains, go do something better. Make full use of your talent in raking in the $ instead of getting sucked into the teaching hole!</p>

              <p>As what is said, I believe that Singapore wants the best for its nation especially in terms of education. But somehow down the years, the passion became incredibly lesser. As a teacher in SPECIAL SCHOOL a non -profitable organisation , for more than a decade, we can feel this too. The school takes lots of good initiative to enhance the learning in benefiting its pupils. But the initiatives, projects and administrative work throughout on going one after another through each year makes us feel exhausted.</p>
              <p>As you know that in special school patience and passion must be in build in each of us in order to teach in this line. We had to customised individual needs of the pupils and intervene behavioral problem and some instances can be occupational hazard during work.<br>We do spent our own pocket money and getting things for the kids for rewards and promote encouragement in learning.<br>Mentally and physically we are tired after the half day work.</p>
              <p>MOE initiaves to special school has also contributed additional administrative work . We understand our P postion and nothing much we can say much but to comply.</p>
              <p>For those with family, at times there is conflict between spouse as what we called after work time or quality time on weekends is taken up by school work. We can also see the trend of teacher getting sick is more and this create difficulty for the P to get relief teachers to cover the class of SPECIAL STUDENTS.</p>
              <p>I know that in special school, we that we are less priveleges than MOE school, but we contribute because of passion in teaching special children which is very challenging. It is sad if the stressload overcome the passion in teaching.<br>Many good dedicated teachers will say GOODBYE to teaching.</p>

              <p>With the world class expectations from the government and parents, the system that teachers are facing now will not change. MOE refuses to recognose the real reasons behind the high attrition rates of teachers, especially for those who completed their bond. And it is this bond that made teachers stay for 3 years. Otherwise, most would have left much earlier.</p>
              <p>New policies and initiatives are pushed down every now and then. Teachers are struggling to cope with new things while having existing heavy workload to handle.</p>
              <p>Does MOE care? Not really it seems. Perhaps we are waiting for a Foxconn to happen here??</p>
              <p>Does MOE really care about the teachers’ well-being? Guess not</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>I think something is seriously wrong if trained teachers are leaving because their passion for teaching has been killed from having too many chores unrelated to teaching. It is one thing to leave for a better opportunity, but so many teachers leaving the profession because of unhappiness is a simply a big waste of resources.</p>
              <p>I believe teaching is a profession where one gets better at with time. MOE must look at this issue without delay, because more motivated teachers (not necessarily financially) usually mean better students.</p>
              <p>There will always be job related unhappiness for any profession. Instead of telling teachers to stop complaining, offer kindness instead. If you are not a teacher and feel that you are also unappreciated and unhappy at work, maybe you could start a separate discussion in the forum somewhere and vent.</p>

              <p>Alot of people thinks the teachers are paid well but that is just a facade put up by MOE. Teachers are still civil servants so they do not get to enjoy anything near to the private corps. School holidays are truly for students, not for teachers. If you are not family of a teacher, you will never understand. I am urging my hubby to leave this job as soon as his bond is up. We dare not even think about having kids now. No time! No Money!</p>

              <p>Teachers are generally under-appreciated in many countries and are often overworked. Like safety of teachers in UK sometimes face threats from students, apart from the work?</p>
              <p>As for suggestions… I’m not a teacher but I’ve friends who are teachers and I find it odd that a lecturer in a university can concentrate on teaching while leaving administrative work to the administrators but a teacher in a primary or secondary school have to manage most things by themselves. Surely the government can afford to spend more on education? Like getting assistants or more admin staff for the teachers to do the administrative work? Part-time teachers to handle the remedial classes so the full-time teachers can concentrate on their own load? If this keeps up, there won’t be anymore quality teachers in Singapore because those who are good are overloaded, drained to the point that to survive, they have to quit for the sake of their health and own lives. Teachers aren’t martyrs, so don’t treat them like one. Anyway, if teachers are able to have better worklife balance and time to rest and recharge, doesn’t it work more to the students’ benefit and thus benefit the country as well? It becomes a cycle really, so I think it makes sense to have this worked out as severely overloaded teachers is already a long standing issue. Better have this solved sooner before there aren’t any experienced teachers left cos’ those remaining are all freshmen. This is not helpful in the long run. No offense meant to fresh teachers.</p>

              <p>NO one in this forum mentioned that being a nurse is an easy job. We are talking about teachers issue in this forum. If you ask for aprreciation and sympathy from other people, maybe you can first offer appreciation and sympathy to teachers first. I do believe teachers will have emphathy towards people from other fields. As everyone else has said, this is not a problem in the teaching field only. But that doesn't mean teachers don't deserve help with their problems.</p>

              <p>Can’t those people (who dismiss the plight of teachers) tell that this forum is about teachers who are overworked and stressed? The teachers DID NOT tell the whole world that they have the lousiest job in the world! They just want to share their problems with others in this forum. From this forum I can tell that those outside the teaching field really have no idea what teachers go through. Once I was also one of them. The NIE training thing is like a “American Dream” to me and my husband. So he applied for NIE, and bond for THREE years. There is no way out for a financially strapped teacher when you are bonded. Teachers are not asking for pity in this forum, they are asking for emphathy. BUt I understand that in 21st century, people don’t practice that kind of virtue anymore.</p>

If not how does one become a genuinely good teacher that inspires students and makes a difference to their lives? Here, we must teach 40students X 6classes (2 core subjects) on average in MOE schools.</p>

              <p>Yes, teachers are very, very overworked. I have come to know this and be mentally well-prepared before I joined the teaching profession but I still overwhelmed with the markings, lesson preparations, CCA admin work, bringing students to competitions, committee works, camps, remedials etc. My weekends are burnt by markings. I don’t have social life at all before Jun &amp; Dec school holidays. In between, 1-2 school holidays are for me to catch up my markings. Not because I cannot manage my time well, it’s because there are too much markings! Sat and Sun are not even enough!</p>
              <p>I did indicate in the annual surveys that I had no work-life balance but I do not think it works. If you make too much noise, your boss will think that you cannot juggle between your work life and personal life which reflects your low working efficiency and incapability. So even when my new principal said to us: don’t work too hard and take care of your health, I do not know how much I can believe and follow. Irony, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>I really hope that MOE will do something, otherwise they will only lose more and more teachers, then they have to recruit more new teachers and re-train, lose them again and continue the vicious cycle. What’s the point? (Answer : The point is that beginning teacher's pay is much less than an experienced teacher's pay. So MOE wants experienced teachers to quit every year, more newbie cheaper teachers come in every year, so that MOE can save on that money, and use that money to stuff into their own pockets. MOE HQ superscale officers pay themselves $10k, $12k, $15k++ every month, doing MUCH less than half the workload and the associated emotional, mental, social, family and medical stresses &amp; suffering of a $2k teacher. That's the point.)</p>

              <p>Why is it that there are so many fools in Singapore who thinks that teachers are making a fuss over nothing? This is disgusting. Who ever says teachers has 2-3 months of holidays? If you are not in teaching, suggest that you just keep quiet. You are entitled to air your views, but not pass judgments and remarks on issues pertaining to teaching that are baseless…. why? Because of the fact that you are not a teacher and have not taught in Singapore schools.</p>
              <p>If you take really go down and understand teachers’ work, you will realise that the 2-3 months of holidays is now a myth.

              <p>Why is this teacher issue so pertinent? Because we are facing a crisis. Why are so many teachers leaving, or have left? There is something very wrong with the system. It is not the people. And teachers have to do something collectively to voice this out. Something has to be done.</p>

              <p>While we all agree that all jobs have their challenges, what unique about a teacher’s job is that its challenges are multi-faceted, we are constantly “on the job” be it physically or mentally, and also we are expected to be on our toes for our students at all times. This is already exhausting as it is. What’s even more sad is, while i strive to strike a good work-life balance, i’ve been faulted frequently for trying to dedicate that little time I am left to play the role of a husband and father of 2 my little kids. For 2 years, I have been deprived of my performance bonus because of this.

              <p>Both my parents were involved in schools in the 60s 70s 80s and well into the 90s where they retired from teaching. My father cares for the kids that he teaches and was particularly concerned about student who were not only doing well in school but also getting involved with bad elements. He has time to care for the kids as well as to educate them as per the approved curriculum. He gets off work at 1-2pm everyday. Only goes to school to do some work a handful of days during the school holidays. He spends a lot of time educating his children in the afternoons. He is well respected and all his students remember him as the educator, the disciplinarian and the sportsman that he was then.</p>
              <p>My wife is a teacher for Singapore’s MOE and has been teaching for about 15 years. These days all I hear from her are grumbles regarding the school. How she is required to stay for needless meetings that achieve little, how she is required to identify KPIs for the year, half of any given school holiday is essentially gone as they are normally full working days. She is not the only one saying this. If she was, I could understand maybe she just needs to get used to it but all her friends and all my other teaching friends are saying the same thing.</p>
              <p>My opinion is that school these days are not the education system which cares and teach as they used to and should be. They are run like corporations, with pressures on getting the results up up up. I work in an MNC, I know the difference between a money oriented organization and a true educator’s systems. Why can’t MOE? why can’t our leaders recognize this?</p>

              <p>I’m a former MOE teacher who left the service earlier this year. I can testify to the ridiculous things teachers/HODs are expected to do. One teacher was given dirty look when she informed the P that she intends to start a family in the year. Another ‘star’ teacher was told by the VP to get her career promotions and rise up first before getting married while the P announced that anyone who wants to have children should inform him first. Isn’t it a personal and private matter? Since when have they started to play a role in family planning?</p>
              <p>MOE have started to introduce CCPE/Adjunct teachers and AEDs in our system but teachers are still expected to carry their own burdens most of the time.</p>
              <p>I can relate to the battlefield scenario when one goes to the school. I love the student interaction but honestly and ashamedly, 60-70% of my workload is unrelated to teaching. Its mostly meetings, planning, calling up and looking for people, parents, reports, vendors, and more meetings! Its a luxury when I have the time and chance to sit at my desk for marking. Most people are not even thinking of marking in school. They just want to fight fire first. Just bring marking home.</p>

              <p>I can understand how frustrating it is for mainstream teachers to deal with such heavy workloads and sacrifice their personal quality time. I am a special education teacher, teaching children with Autism. Although we do not have markings to do, we also have heavy workloads of preparing for lessons (which requires a lot of time as we cannot teach children with Autism using conventional methods), doing administrative paperwork, planning and carrying out co-curriculum activities, doing various work tasks for the children who are of different cognitive levels and different learning styles, and scouting around Singapore for materials to use in our teaching.<br>Although MOE provides 50% of the funding, we, special education teachers are underpaid. Our salary is vastly different from the mainstream teachers. We have heavy workloads, we work extra hours outside of our official work time, we sacrifice our weekends and weekday nights to complete extra work and we take care of special students who need specialized care and attention (sometimes, due to tantrums and meltdowns of our students, we come home with bruises or bite marks) and yet, our salary remains low with very minimal benefits. Many of my colleagues resigned, not because of the challenging students, but because they have families and getting low pay for working long hours is very tough especially when the standard of living in Singapore is high. On top of that, losing our precious quality time to do extra work is simply depressing. I wish MOE will look into the welfare of mainstream and special education teachers.

              <p>Is really interesting to read all these comments above. Different professionals are now voicing out that they are overworked. But have they thought about this question: What is the level of influence their jobs has on the society at large? And how often do they need to be accountable to 30 over clients (a.k.a the students), the clients’ parents, the 1st &amp; 2nd heads (a.k.a. the Principal &amp; V. Principal), and the big head boss (a.k.a The MOE!)? So consider this levels of accountability, whose workload is more heavy? You decide for yourself.</p>

              <p>Teachers are complaining not because of the workload, but the relevance of the massive amount of work to the very job they signed on the dotted line for – teaching and marking.</p>
              <p>Yes, doctors are overworked. Can you tell me: do doctors treat patients, still? Are you saying the bulk of doctors’ job in the hospital is not about treating patients?</p>
              <p>I am not sure how many people out there are overworked doing work that are unrelated to their job. Most teachers don’t mind spending the extra hours teaching or marking. I don’t, and can’t, see the relevance of attending courses after courses when we don’t have the time to plan or implement these f-up strategies in the classrooms. I don’t see the need to complete 100 hours of training every year when I am already a fully trained teacher. I don’t understand why MOE pay those speakers at ‘creative-teaching’ workshops big bucks when their workshops bore us to death after we come in after school, leaving behind our unmarked books and worksheets, just so that we could mark them when we get home or during weekends.</p>

              <p>It is through this post that I realise how disgusting ignorance can be.</p>
              <p>For people who ask teachers to stop complaining and saying that other jobs are equally stressful, or teachers have long holidays, or teachers are always on maternity leave, have you ever asked what teachers are doing during the holidays or maternity leave?</p>
              <p>I was depressed when I knew I was pregnant. I thought about abortion, and discussed it with family and friends. I knew I wouldn’t have time for the baby, yet I wouldn’t be able to quit because I didn’t marry a rich man. It was the lack of courage to go for an abortion that stopped me from aborting the baby. Not anything else.</p>
              <p>When I was on maternity leave, my handphone was constantly ringing, or vibrating, to ask me about work, or to tell me to email or do something for work. What rest? The moment I closed my eyes, my handphone rang and I had to return to the computer. It was arguably the most torturous time of my life – being weak from the operation, struggling with milk supply and working from home.</p>
              <p>It’s the June holidays now. The first and last weeks are taken up by meetings. The two weeks left are meant to do work, and prepare for next term – lesson plans, resources, worksheets.</p>
              <p>I’m stoned. I just don’t feel like doing anything, except hoping to enlighten some idiots who have not, and will never qualify to, become a teacher.</p>
              <p>I came home from school today at 6 pm, braving through torrents of rain while struggling to hold up an umbrella with one hand and carry piles of worksheets and teacher’s guide file in another.</p>
              <p>When I finally got home, my hand shook when I wanted to get myself a drink. The first break of the day and I just felt so overwhelmed.</p>

              <p>I think what a lot of SINGAPOREANS need to realise our teachers are SEVERELY overworked.We tend to be an IGNORANT bunch!</p>
              <p>Secondary school teachers’ daily routines are as follows (approximation). I can’t speak for primary school teachers because most of my friends who teach are in secondary schools.</p>
              <p>-At around 7 am most of them are already in school or almost there.<br>-They teach until around 2 pm with a couple of free periods in between, these periods are usually used for the teachers to review their lesson plans/content before next lesson and/or mark their homework.<br>-After school most are loaded with either CCA’s or some form of extra classes that they have to conduct. If you look at almost any secondary school today, almost all hold COMPULSORY supplementary lessons for their sec 3 &amp; 4 students (even sec 1 and 2 to a certain extent). As such most probably only finish their day at 5pm.<br>-To add to this the teachers are put in charge of organising various school activities – Speech Day, Sports Day, National Education outings etc.<br>-Most stay back after 5 to finish up some marking and leave around 6-7</p>
              <p>Now assuming that they get back at 8 and sleep at 12 (which means they only get around 6 hours of sleep a day because they must be in sch by 7am)———&gt; that only leaves them with 4 hours to<br>-shower<br>-eat<br>-mark homework from different classes<br>-do up lesson plan for following day<br>-spend time with spouse<br>-spend time with kids<br>-carry out own leisure activities</p>
              <p>Now would you want that kind of life?<br>I would love to teach, it has been something i was keen on ever since i was a kid but seeing my peers struggle, with no life outside work is just an utter turn off to me…</p>
              <p>Is change in sight? if you ask me, change only ever comes when ‘some people’ can profit $$$$$ *ka ching* from it… So unless u expect lower wages i guess its gonna be long hours and no life…</p>

              <p>The writers’ response and inputs in “Stressful yes, but not unusual as jobs go” (ST Forum, Fri 22 May) clearly demonstrate her complete lack of understanding in the field of education. Perhaps I shall assist in helping her put things in better perspective to make up for her own “misleading” response.</p>
              <p>5am to 6am</p>
              <p>Granted a teacher’s amount of preparation is subject to one’s own personal preference in getting him/herself ready for work, so I have nothing much to comment about this aspect. However, do consider this – A family living in an apartment where there could possibly be one toilet to share amongst 3-5 people all waiting to get ready for school or work at the same time. Perhaps then there could be a reason for some delay in preparation?</p>
              <p>6am to 7am</p>
              <p>Asking for a transfer to a school nearer home? What a fantastic idea! Let’s just submit a request and a response would be received, say, in a month or two? Not to mention that we would probably have to wait for the start of a new academic semester to start in a new school, assuming such a school had a ready vacancy for us in the first place. Of course, one could neglect the fact that a school one or two neighbourhoods away could take about 40-45 minutes of travel time if one had to take a feeder bus service to a nearby MRT station, transfer on to the train, get off at a station (or two) away and get another feeder service to get to the school. Oh! Did I mention waiting time? And having to squeeze with the hundreds of other students who also happen to be going to school?</p>
              <p>7am to 7.30am</p>
              <p>“Guard duty” is “usually done by parent volunteers”. The key word here is “usually” which implies that it is not “always” the case as not all schools in Singapore have the luxury of having parent volunteers who are willing to come down at such a time to volunteer when there are other more enticing options for volunteering. While it is true that the “guard duty” is rotated among teachers and is “not a daily affair”, might I remind her that when teachers are not doing such a duty, they would be in their school’s assembly area looking after the students while waiting for the daily morning assembly to commence? This, for sure, is daily! (except perhaps for weekends)</p>
              <p>7.30am to 1pm</p>
              <p>Teachers do not teach “at a stretch” as they have one or two free periods in between. She is right! That adds up to about an hour of “free” time which of course teachers could choose to do some of the following (in no particular order):<br>- Grab a bite to eat<br>- Go to the washroom<br>- Make phone calls to parents<br>- Marking of class work<br>- Speaking to students over personal/home/school-related issues<br>- Preparation of materials for subsequent lessons<br>- Professional Sharing with teachers<br>- Quick meetings with other department members<br>- Planning for remedial or supplementary lessons<br>- CCA arrangements<br>- Planning for adhoc events – class performance, concerts, workshops, assembly programmes, fund-raising, competitions etc.<br>- Lesson observations<br>- Mentoring newer or trainee teachers<br>- Relief duty for absent teachers (there goes the free period)<br>(List is not exhaustive)</p>
              <p>Take your pick!</p>
              <p>1pm to 3.30pm</p>
              <p>Remedial lessons may not necessarily be an everyday affair so how about I expand a typical day to a typical week?</p>
              <p>Monday – Remedial, Tuesday – CCA, Wednesday – School Workshops, Thursday – Remedial, Friday – School Meetings (choose from Core Department / Non-Core Department / Level / CCA / Events / Subject etc.)</p>
              <p>And with regard to her comment about different subject teachers taking the remedial lessons, do be aware that for primary schools in general, the form teachers take all the core subjects: English, Maths and Science. And even if they are specialised teachers in a certain core subject, they will be taking TWO to THREE classes of that subject which means that they may still have to conduct remedial lessons for MORE THAN ONE class! I hope it is more evident to her now how that logic works!</p>
              <p>3.30pm to 5.30pm</p>
              <p>While CCAs may be conducted once or twice a week as a norm, might I enlighten her that additional days are usually needed when it comes to events/performances and competitions?</p>
              <p>5.30pm to 6.30pm</p>
              <p>Keying in remarks may be done in mid-term and year-end. However, just to let her know that there as schools move towards holistic assessment, such remarks will be done on a termly basis. And if teachers are not carrying out this particular task, there are others that are just waiting to be completed (refer to 7.30am-1pm)</p>
              <p>6.45pm to 7.45pm</p>
              <p>(refer to 6am-7am, but this time change students to adults going home from work)</p>
              <p>8.30pm to 1am</p>
              <p>“Most homework is marked by students…” I suggest she reflects on this particular claim. While it is possible for students to peer-mark multiple-choice questions and questions with only one possible answer, teachers still have to verify these answers. However, such questions only constitute a small percentage of the total amount of work given to a student. Does she seriously expect the student to mark his/her composition writings, mathematical statements or scientific reasoning on his/her own? This sweeping statement clearly illustrates a lack of careful and logical thought in this matter.</p>
              <p>She mentions that the daily routine listed by the writer (Ms Aishah Quek) “did not include lunch breaks”. This is for the simple reason that we do not have official lunch breaks! We have our lunch at whichever reasonable “free” time we can find in our “schedule”. Some teachers have their “lunch” at 9.30am (during recess) or even about 4pm (after remedial/CCA).</p>
              <p>She claims that “at least the teacher’s job is seasonal”. While the “long” mid-year and year-end holidays are the scheduled breaks for students, please note that while teachers “can relax a little”, they still have to be involved in some of the following before they get to take that break:<br>- Remedial lessons (for those preparing for National examinations),<br>- Enrichment workshops<br>- CCA training (for competition and events)<br>- School based workshops<br>- Work reviews<br>- Target setting for next academic year<br>- Overseas expeditions (for networking with overseas educational institution)<br>- Setting of exam papers<br>- Overseas conferences (for learning of best-practices)<br>- Time-tabling for next academic semester (especially with new teachers posted in)<br>- Preparation and planning for next academic semester<br>(List is not exhaustive)</p>
              <p>I do not disagree with the point that other jobs are stressful. What I take issue with is the writer’s reasoning and perception to what a teacher’s work-load entails. It is difficult for teachers to “cheer up” when people like her have such a narrow view of the noble teaching profession. Perhaps, such people should consider a working attachment as a teacher to open your eyes to the reality of this profession.</p>
              <p>Don’t get me wrong. I love my job. But some people out there really need a wake-up call!</p>

              <p>One reason why teachers are bogged down with tons of non teaching stuffs to do is because of the way teachers are appraised. The more school projects you take up, the more “visible” you are to your reporting officers, the faster you get promoted. Also, teachers are constantly playing office politics to get ahead of one another. Those teachers who are genuinely concerned about teaching their students will lack behind in the career ladder. That is why this report came out. If you care about your career which all of us do, then you have to play the game or you will be left behind. The whole system is not about rewarding the teacher who teaches best but rather, it rewards the most “visible” teacher who is most well-like by his bosses. Its sad but its true.</p>

              <p>does this mean that singapore does not deserve passionate teachers? a teacher that does his work begrudgingly is soooOOoo different to a teacher who does the work passionately. teachers from my country are passionate but they dont deserve to work in this kind of scenario (in Singapore) that they look like slaves in the hands of ancient egyptians….</p>

              <p>A certain teacher I know was tasked by his HOD/principal to take care of some animals after school hours as part of an initiative undertaken by the school. Staff abuse + waste of expensive man hours. Principals probably do not feel the pain since they are not the one paying their teacher’s salary, but you slave drivers will see that your abusive actions will eventually lead to a drop in their productivity and result in high staff turnover rate. I have a good feeling that teachers are quitting like nobody’s business nowadays. Pity to teachers who joined with a passion to teach but are fulfilling unrealistic and unreasonable expectations.</p>

              <p>That is why I left the teaching profession after more than a decade. Teachers who want to teach are not appreciated. Teachers are jack of all trades but master of none. They have to be an event manager, surrogate parent, counsellor, etc. When they are appraised, it’s taken that they should be doing well in the classroom because that is our ‘core’ business. So how to differentiate one from the other during the ranking session? It boils down to all the other non-teaching duties one performs. So one can be teaching a non-examinable subject like DnT or Art which has little marking and has plenty of time to perform non-teaching duties, he/she will standout cos the things he/she does is visible. Another teacher has plenty of lessons to go to and have no time to wayang so he/she is considered as not contributing to the school. When ranking comes, the teacher who teaches only will be ranked lower. This EPMS thing is full of nonsense.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I managed to find the email address to the education ministry, if I am to write a petition email complaining about teacher workload and attached the log here, will everyone support me?</p>
              <p>There is so much unfair treatment against education system in Singapore, it’s about time we should work as a team to raise up to MOE to get this improved.</p>
              <p>No point we keep complaining but no action taken. Right?</p>
              <p>I am pretty sick of the education system over here, it’s killing those teachers, can’t imagine no matter what and how they do, principal will never appreciate it, instead they will help parents to blame the teachers why? Teachers not just have to teach but have to manage all kind of rubbish administrative matters, what is this? They are human not robots, my goodness, please bear that in mind.</p>
              <p>2nd, during school holiday they still have to go to school to do project and all kind of work, they can’t even have a rest day properly.</p>
              <p>3rd, do you know that nowadays teaching ‘little monkeys’ in school is worst than before? Those ‘little monkeys’ are simply spolit brat, how can the teachers take it?</p>
              <p>I totally agree that our local teachers are overworked. It’s so hard for them to have a work life balance. When I read the articles posted earlier in May, I felt for them. My wife works as a teacher too.</p>
              <p>I have a urge to complaint to MOE even if there is a risk and the chance is slim, at least we try, if this goes on, I believe more teachers would become mad and go into mental hospital. I really hope SPH or Mediacorp would publish such article over here on the newspaper to let more people know about the workload so that MOE would follow up.</p>
              <p>This is no joke, my dear, if one is stressful it can drive one to be mad.</p>

              <p>In general, workers other than teachers will have at least 1 hour of lunch break to enjoy their lunch while at the same time, have a chit chat session with their colleagues. However, teachers can only have lunch during their free time. The fact that we can hardly find time make us even want to even skip our lunch or to delay it like till 3pm at times and I think this is not very healthy in the long run.</p>
              <p>Public seems to have this belief that when teachers dont teach, they should be free.I think its a joke. Let me list you a FEW, we as teachers have to set exam questions, have consultation time with students we need to ask questions,remedial lessons in smaller groups for those students who need more attention than the rest, understand our CCA kids cos we need to nominate our students for CCA awards when they graduate and of course, other CCA admin duties esp near competition periods where we have to attend meetings, submit entries for the competitors, CCA overseas trips etc , work reviews which is like 3 times a year which I feel its excessive and creates unnecessary burden, Civics lessons which we need to prepare, attendance taking, writing peer lesson ob forms and PPCR for documentation,meetings like SPA, SGCs, PWs in JC which in fact is not our expertise for some teachers and to handle that, we need to spend A LOT OF TIME doing our homework in order to provide the best to our students and all these are done on top of teaching our core subject and marking. Dont you feel its so scary?? We are not robots. We also need time to rest and for those we are teachers like me, I believe you can agree that for a teacher who puts in effort to teach a 2 hour lesson, you just feel so tired taht you dont even have the energy to talk to your friends. But still, you cant take a break because there are other things that you need to handle.</p>
              <p>To teach effectively, we need to have time to reflect and think about ways to teach the students, in a unique and interesting way. However due to those ambitious policy makers, poor teachers have to suffer with those enormous workloads. thinking that since we are being paid and therfore, we should just accept whatever it comes along.</p>

              <p>I was a teacher for 7 years before I resigned. It was my first job and I thought I would enjoy teaching in schools till I retire as this is my PASSION. Now, I am still doing education and I still enjoy what I am doing.</p>
              <p>The reasons for resignation is as follows:<br>1 Concerns were raised to management, but were never taken seriously. They do not take in teachers’ feedback whether their NEW projects. They just want their new projects to push through so that will look good in their portfolio.</p>
              <p>2 ever since performance bonus were introduced, office politics crept in, and backstabbing of colleagues appears. Come on, this is a school and what we taught pupils do not coincide with what we practice.</p>
              <p>3 whenever students wanted to look for me to coach them on schoolwork that they do not understand in class, I was always not available due to senseless meeting and professional development sessions, or out of school on course.</p>
              <p>4 I feel that the work I do in schools is not out of passion anymore.</p>

              <p>I have relatives who are teachers. Heard from them they have a ranking system that really stress them out. From what I gather the schools are generally a very autocratic type of organisation. The leadership approach is top down and there is very little room for disagreement and the ranking system can be subject to abuse by supervisors. For the teachers this will stifle creativity and de-motivate them. I think the school should adopt a common industry practice where the supervisors and leadership are also evaluated by the employees. This will help reduce instances of abuse, bullying, threats, etc by supervisors in charge of the teachers. There should be some check and balances and maybe in this way the school leadership can find a solution to support the teachers heavy workload instead turning a deaf year to them. The 3000+ and growing comments is testimony that teachers are overworked!</p>

              <p>To those who ask teachers not to complain, try teaching in singapore first before making your comments. Most went in with interest and passion but became disillusioned by the system. To the geek who loves programming (and claims his job is tougher than teaching), its just you and your computer you are facing. Try facing a class of children and teenagers daily and dealing with demanding parents.</p>

              <p>Come on…stop grumbling…what makes you guys think that you are the only ones? I work as a software engineer and my hours easily extend from 8am to &gt;10 pm…weekends are often spent on more programming which I’m not able to complete during the week. Am I complaining?No! In fact I enjoy it. Embrace and enjoy your work and it would not feel like work anymore!!! Education should not be a job which you throw away at 5 pm sharp everyday!!! So stop complaining!! &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p>To the person lx above,</p>
              <p>Have you taught as a full-fledged teacher before?</p>
              <p>HAve you thought about why so many and i dare dare say vast majority of teachers are complaining out loud or suffering in silence?</p>
              <p>If your line of work or other line of work has too much other things to do except what your job title says, i am sure others will pour in their support for you. You are programmer in your company and how would you feel if your company ask you to do tasks not related to programming which takes up 80% of your time in office and out of it? Would you still “Embrace and enjoy your work and it would not feel like work anymore!!! “?</p>
              <p>How would you feel if you have 4 weeks of “holidays” as perceived by others but 1st 2 weeks you have to go back to school to teach almost like normal school hours or even longer. And then the last week is as good as gone because there will be the school contact time, and other department, committee meetings and actually you have 1 week or so left?</p>
              <p>Many other points have been mentioned by others in close to 4000 posts already so i will not repeat.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree that teachers are underpaid for the amount of hours they are putting in every single day in school. I feel that the educational system in SG now is getting unreasonable, probably to keep up with the competition coming from foreign students, talents and all the fast-developing countries that has very skilled people with high education such as China, Japan, India… But really, if MOE strives to keep quiet just to push us past our limits so that we can outdo the others, when will this competition end then? By that time, I guess all the teachers would have quit their jobs to find a replacement, with a lower pay, as long as the hours are not so demanding. I’m currently studying in a JC, year 2 this year and my teachers are staying back until 9pm with us sometimes until the school closes to give us consultations, monitor our progress and even give supplementry lessons because the day time isnt long enough for her to finish her syllabus. MOE, please go out to the streets and ask any random student, be it pri, sec or JC. Ask them how many hours are they staying in school until. From there, you should be able to tell how many hours the teachers are staying back as well.<br>If the educational system sets aside “holidays” in June, Dec and shorter ones in march and sept, aren’t these days supposed to be put aside for students and teachers to rest? The normal curiculum time is already crazy (JC2 student, goes to school at 7.30am and leaves at 9.30pm, same for the teachers!! omg. lessons itself stretches until 9pm already… from 7.30am to 9pm, what kind of crazy job is it? and the pay?) And these holidays are being taken up for lessons, make-up for this and that, extra CCA… Teachers are coming back, serious OT, without any equal increase in their proportion of pay. Is this fair?</p>
              <p>Recently, the cut off point for university entry is raised to 75 points. 75/90 rank points is really, something not everyone can achieve. Those who got 70 points and below are more or less stranded. They did well, but not good enough for local universities. And I feel that this is part of the reason why teachers and principals are pushing the hours into the night to conduct lessons, hoping that it will sqweeze more content and skills into the students. But think about it, such long hours… We humans have a limited attention-span. Everyone’s probably tired from 7pm to 9pm. Teachers can’t teach at their best, neither can the students absorb. What’s the point for this? Might as well allow us to go home and have some quality time to rest or to catch up with family.</p>
              <p>I really pity my teachers, espcecially those teaching arts subjects like geography, economics, GP, history, lit, art… Sometimes they are so tired that they lose track of their teaching. But we don’t blame them, because they have so much work to mark at home, lessons to prepare, other duties to do like CCA monitoring. Seriously, MOE should do something about it before everyone burns out and this stretegy of forcing us forward will instead backfire.</p>
              <p>Who knows? Maybe in the future, teachers need to stay back longer, because the syllabus is getting harder and they have to teach until the students understand in time for the major examinations like PSLE, O and A levels. Besides acedemic achievements, I feel that it is also important to let us have time to ourselves, especially the teachers. MOE, please look into this.</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>As an ex-Primary School teacher myself, I can fully identify with the stress that teachers undergo. Teachers are indeed an overworked bunch of people who are expected to juggle many (in fact, too many) roles at the same time. It is only a matter of time before the physical and mental strain smothers the passion for teaching that most fresh NIE grads started out with. I personally have seen talented &amp; dedicated teachers who end up suffering from burnt-out and some of them even slip into a circle of depression or develop psychiatric disorders which they are still trying to recover from even after a prolonged period of time.</p>
              <p>For myself, all I wanted to do was just to teach and have more time to nurture &amp; communicate with my pupils, especially the weaker or troubled ones who needed more attention. During lesson time, I found myself rushing from one class to the other and on days when I had to stand in for teachers who were on MC, I couldn’t even find time to catch a breather. I just hoped to have the after-school hours to myself so that I could finish up the marking which was very time-consuming,set practice or exam papers, have time to prepare for lessons and think of creative &amp; fun lessons to enhance the learning experience for the pupils. However, such precious time were often taken away from me by meetings (to plan for events such as visits from some big-shot, sports day, etc.), CCA rehearsals in order to aim for an SYF medal, administrative duties which includes stock-taking etc. and a whole host of other activities.</p>
              <p>In order to bring about effective changes which will improve the work-life balance of teachers and allow them to develop into better teachers, maybe MOE policymakers should try their hands at teaching a full load for a term(which should certainly include English as Composition marking is an experience not to be missed)complete with all the MOE initiatives (acronyms which I have already forgotten), events and the whole works. Only then will they truly understand first hand how tough it is to be a teacher. Maybe then they will think twice before launching the next Initiative which more often than not, fails to address the root of the problem but instead, serves to add on more workload to the already heavy burden that teachers nowadays are made to bear.</p>
              <p>Until then, I will be sticking with my private sector job which allows me to relax after work and during the weekends, instead of ploughing through stacks of compositions.</p>

              <p>For those who say that other jobs are tough simply do not take into consideration how it is so very draining (physically, emotionally and mentally) having to engage 40 students per class (and some see 3 classes or more per day) for at least 2.5hrs a day. Have you tried playing with your child/nephew/niece for 30min in a row? How much more when teachers have to entertain (yes entertain!) 40 students for at least an hour when they have a double period lesson! The job is draining because teachers deal with human beings and when the students go to them with their problems / learning disabilities, it becomes very exhausting work … the other things mentioned on this board simply compounds the challenges that teachers face. And one more thing, if you are working a desk-bound job, your computer will not talk back to you or give you “attitude” on a bad day and you have the option of simply turning your computer off at the end of the day … how do you propose teachers “switch-off” a tantrum throwing / defiant / vulgarity-spewing student for instance? Dealing with people is always much more demanding than dealing with paper, period.</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>I worked in the private sector before becoming a secondary school teacher. I quit 2 over years ago because of various reasons that I will pen below. Namely, it’s due to 1)workload, 2)system, 3)emotional energy spent 4)the feeling that we’re cheating our students. Let me elaborate.</p>
              <p>1) It is an undeniable fact that teacher’s workload is way too much – especially for EL and humanities subject teachers. One year, I had 120+ Upper sec EL students. In a neighbourhood school, it takes 8-10 min to make one essay. You do the maths. And that is not counting the frustrations and the headaches deciphering the ‘code words’ Wait.. our 3 week cycle was 1 wk compo, next wk compre, followed by some written project. So that’s just the marking and classroom time. CCA? check. Inane committee? check. Staff meetings? check. Follow up on absenteeism/truancy/poor performance etc. Check. check check. etc etc etc</p>
              <p>2) The system sucks. Period. Ambitious principals = extra ‘bright’ ideas/programs/initiatives to win multiple awards in order to raise their profile, get more funding, just see the banners fluttering around the schools. You’ll get my drift. The victims? teachers and students of course. Worse.. while performance review is supposed to be 60% on your teaching, and 40% the other duties, in actual fact it’s more like 20% and 80% respectively. Dedicated teachers who deliver top-notch lessons and results are told “that’s what you are supposed to be good in anyway.. teach.” In order to climb up the rankings, teachers organise big events or head committees, to profile themselves and neglect their teaching. But who gets the promotions? Yes, the ones who has shown their ‘leadership qualities’ in organising big events. And the ones in the ‘inner circle’ – the golf kakis and kopi club. And don’t even get me started on the taking of MCs and childcare leave.</p>
              <p>3) Yes, every job has its stresses and long hours. But while engineers, accountants, lawyers etc spend their long hours, they do not need to spend an iota of emotional energy on others. Teachers have to be consummate showmen to motivate the students to pay attention and learn. Try doing it 4 times a day to different audiences. And what if there’s ill-disciplined children in class? We’ll need to scold, cajole, threaten, punish etc. whatever that works. and later counsel the students. And in neighbourhood schools, many of them have reasons for their bad day, and you feel for them. Do machines stand up to the engineer’s authority and question their actions or pull their bra straps? Do numbers spit on the accountants’ faces. Oh, I’m sure many a times the numbers don’t come together, but is it their fault?</p>
              <p>4) End of the day, in order to cope and preserve our sanity, teachers end up taking short cuts. Many times I’ve gone into class for a lesson, preparing for it while I’m walking there – more impressive than Chinese poets having to compose their poems within whatever number of steps they take. We get students to mark their work. We distance ourselves emotionally and some times physically and are soon not there for them to talk to. Why? Those who have counselled others will know. One session will zap the energy out of you. So, we quit. We quit because this was not what we signed up for. We were wasting energy and time doing what we felt was not core. And the scary thing is, what I’m sharing is not even the full story.</p>

              <p>@ichgo indeed, especially those students whose major exams draw near (such as those taking O, N or A levels), the teachers make them stay back everyday for several weeks to conduct extra lessons till evening.</p>
              <p>@Ex-teacher those MOE policymakers are scholars. Their jobscope is to dole out policies after policies. To make themselves look good on paper. It’s an open secret that in most govt boards, they really don’t have the substantial groundwork experience to have empathy for the people who will be affected by all their idealistic policy-making.</p>
              <p>I for one, seriously think our education system needs a big review and revamp. Teacher-student ratio definitely need to be more conducive to learning. How about school hours? I think we can look to other countries’ models and learning systems. How about introducing more technical/specialized schools like back in the day? Or how about implementing a uni-style of learning/teaching? Where TAs help out in the work for the teachers, and the teachers/lecturers themselves conduct several lesson timings throughout the day? How about not giving much homework but timely projects/presentations and lessons are more for class discussions? The education system should start being flexible and offer varied options. Why don’t the policy-makers start cracking their heads and take in all these constructive criticisms before this issue and people in this industry reaches a tipping point?</p>

              <p>the authorities really need to address this issue as teachers are an irreplaceable force in singapore. foreigners can make up for numbers in certain jobs but i feel that we need the core of our teachers to be singaporeans. imagine having our future kinds being taught by foreign talents due to reluctance of singaporeans to take on this demanding and taxing role. sounds like a recipe for a generation gap especially when working singaporeans are finding less time to spend with their kids.</p>
              <p>p.s. i am not a teacher but my mom is a kindergarten teacher who was teaching for 17 years and the increase in workload over the years saw her overworked and sleeping less. it amazed me that she was required to pick up IT skills in her advanced years and she spent long hours in front of the computer. imagine the difficulties of a 50 year old trying to figure out thumbdrives, spreadsheets, emails, word processing and internet surfing with a rudimentary command of english. i increased her allowance and encouraged her to quit the job as it was not worth it.</p>

              <p>i have been teaching for the past 15 years…<br>when i first joined teaching, i do look forward to plan all my lessons and carried out the lessons with great joy. Now if you ask me, I drag my feet to work…There are tonnes of things to do; pre, during &amp; post…Single session school means teachers are working from 7am to 5pm …planning lessons, setting papers, CCA , lesson observations, pleasing ur RO, principal,vice principal, HODs,recess duty, long hours of level reviews, departmental meetings,meet the parents sessions, book checkings…etc…etc…etc. As teachers, we are also expected to stay healhty with zeroes MCs and must refrain from taking childcare leave as all these will affect our perfomance ranking..;(<br>Now with perfomance bonus, teachers are working round the clock just to fatten up their portfolios…Need I say more???</p>

              <p>Teachers are definitely overworked. As a working mother, I find it really tough to balance work and family commitments. I just feel guilty about spending so much time on school work that my own children are neglected. And it’s very upsetting that despite schemes introduced like the part-time teaching scheme to help teachers with young children, schools are still not giving the much needed support. MOE doesn’t have any guidelines on what makes up a 3/4, 2/3 or 1/2 workload. As such, schools are left to decide and work out the workload that best meet the needs of the school and not the teachers. Many times, we are always told that school needs come first. Then, when are our needs met? I was told not to be calculative even though I’m on a 3/4 workload (3/4 workload = 3/4 of the salary). I ended up doing more than what was agreed on before I started on the part-time teaching scheme. My Principal even suggested that I should consider other options like doing contract or flexi-adjunct teachers programme. But to be a contract or flexi-adjunct teacher, I need to resign from the service. It really shows how much I’m valued as a teacher in the school. It is not surprising that many teachers are leaving the service. MOE should really look into the needs of working mothers like myself. It is quite sad that many experienced teachers are leaving the service not because they have lost the passion but to fulfill the needs of the family. More should be done to actively support work-life balance which is clearly lacking.</p>

              <p>Honey, i understand your pain. i am a single mom. My son is on a wheelchair and i need a part-time maid to look after him. i pay my maid by the hour and she also has other houses to go to so her hours are quite fixed. But my school keeps coming up with last minute meetings and duties. This was a financial and mental drain for me so i spoke with my principal about it, requesting that at least i get a one week advance notice before said duties. And you know what she said i should look into other avenues like get my neighbours to help or maybe even put my son in a hostel !</p>

              <p>I say give this a rest already. It is fairly obvious that most of the comments posted were from teachers and it is more obvious that MOE is not hearing this for the first time. As a young teacher, I feel betrayed by the Ministry. All the advertisements on smiling teachers and pupils are just bollocks. As a teacher, I am underpaid, unappreciated and definitely overworked. I have allowed three years of my youth past me by, slogging my arse off, meeting deadlines and pleasing everyone else except myself.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, I get a measly email thanking me for my effort (usually by the Principal and the HODs), or if I am lucky, a Performance Bonus which they dangle like a carrot in front of me, just to spur me to do more work.</p>
              <p>The whole system is draining the patience and most importantly passion in us teachers. One day, you will realise that all your good teachers are gone and you will only have yourself to blame.</p>

              <p>i just wanna teach. if i had wanted to run a CCA, i would have trained to become a coach or a trainer or sth fancy like that. if i had wanted to do admin work i would have become a clerk or secretary. if i had wanted to plan an anniversary dinner or a concert or sth like that, i would have become an event planner. i want none of all that. i only want to teach. that is why i signed on the dotted line. that is why i wanted to be a teacher. why must MOE complicate the sweet simplicity of education by wearing teachers down with so many other responsibilities? is any good coming out of all these? can teachers, who started with so much passion, deliver and really really teach, and provide quality education when they are weighed down with so mny other duties that has NOTHING to do with teaching at yhe very first place? maybe the ministry is just happy with the data-and-information-regurgitating-students that schools churn out year after year. we want to NURTURE students. we want to give them quality education. we want them to really learn. we want them to experience. maybe our wants and the ministry’s wants are just not one and the same.</p>
              <p>my NIE lecturer once told me that every year, during the induction ceremony, when the education minister announces that he is proud to have xxxx numbers of teachers join the system that year, and the audience will applaud, my lecturer will be the only man shaking his head. his reason? for every xxxx number of fresh faced clueless newbies that join the system, the xxxx number of teachers are actually dashing out the back door.</p>
              <p>I am a newbie and I have barely started but i am definitely counting down to the end of my bond.</p>
              <p>and dun tell me to quit if i aint happy coz the amt of $ to pay back for breaking a bond isnt a few dollars and cents.</p>
              <p>i was a tutor before and i was happy back then. because i PURELY teach.</p>
              <p>i do not want my family life to become a wreck because of an under appreciated job. it already went a lil crazy during practicum. and that was just practicum. no cca or committee meetings, yet. it scares the hell out of me thinking how it would be like when i get the “full load”</p>
              <p>i do not want to miss out on watching my toddler grow and be part of his life – just cause i am too busy with “work”.</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>I was a primary school teacher for 5 years. The workload, as everyone knows, is heavy and requires long hours at the expense of family time. At the same time, the working environment is very bad in most schools. As teachers compete for head of department posts, they resort to underhanded methods to put their competitors down. Teachers who are the principal’s pets always get away with everything and get promoted repeatedly while the rest get bogged down with more and more work as instructed by these ‘pets’. MOE encourages this harsh environment because complaints are reverted to the principal and the teacher who complained will ‘get it’ from the principal. I remember being asked by the principal whether I really needed to go for my honeymoon just because a favourite ‘pet’ of hers slotted me in for an extracurricular duty at the last minute during the school holidays. I had to shorten my trip to only 4 days inclusive of the travelling time to Europe. I arrived in Singapore at 6+ am and was back in school at noon. I saw an older colleague lose her mind in the teachers’ room. She was warded in IMH and has never been the same since her discharge. We always fear our appraisals and get threatened about losing our performance bonus.In my final year of teaching, I did not get my performance bonus because amongst other things, it was claimed that I did not talk much to my colleagues. I didn’t agree with her view as I thought that I did socialise as much as I could given that most times I don’t even have time to go to the ladies in between classes and during recess time. The principal wondered out loud to me as to why I wasn’t upset like my other colleagues who had lost their bonuses. I told her that it was just money and I will not rush out of her office crying like the others. I quit as soon as I finished my bond. Till this day, when I dream that I am still teaching, I wake up in relief that I am now free from the nightmare of teaching. In order to make life better for teachers, MOE should look into the quality and character of the principals as a well balanced principal who believes in the right values will inculcate the right working environment for happy teachers.</p>

              <p>As the son of two teachers, I rarely get to see my parents at all. Ever since my secondary school days, they have been in school from 7 to 7, 5 days a week. Overworked is a severe understatement as I have seen firsthand how much work teachers have. For example, when there are no lessons during the school holidays, they are sent for workshops, courses etc, most of which I find redundant.</p>
              <p>Family time is severely affected, as growing up I rarely saw my parents despite their best efforts to spend time with me and my brother. Before the 5 day work week was implemented a few years back, Saturdays were eaten up as well by the school.</p>

              <p>Teachers, NEVER ever sign up for half-load scheme or be flexi-adjunct. Most schools have no idea what on earth that really means. They will end up giving you 80% load or even full load at 50% pay. At least 3 of my colleagues learn it the hard way.<br>=<br>If you want to spend more time with your kids, this is how you do it; do a half-assed job and get a ‘D’. A D-grader full-time teacher will earn more than a flexi-adjunct teacher or a C-grade teacher on half-load.<br>=<br>If you already thinking of half-load or flexi-adjunct, why you care so much about the D-grade?<br>=<br>95% of all unhappiness in the school can be traced to the teacher’s fear of the ‘D’ grade? If she not scared of D, she would have long ago told off the principal or HOD for unprofessional conduct or unreasonable demands on the job.</p>

              <p>I just do not understand why MOE isn’t giving a solid solution to this problem.My friend from NIE is about to enter teaching but even before that, she has set her plans- resign in 4yrs time.I’m not blaming her.Many of my previous teachers have done that. I’m a student from NUS pharmacy.I had always wanted to join teaching and even wanted to apply for a MOE scholarship. But that was before I went back to my JC to seek advice and it was enough to make me reject teaching. My teachers looked in bad shape even though I only graduated 1yr back.I could see that stress is damaging their lives significantly.Yes, I agree that every job has its stressful periods, but teaching seems to occupy one of the top ranks in stressful jobs. It will be good if MOE shows the public what are the plans it has in the upcoming years. I am aware that allied educators are recruited,but the public does not know how many allied educators are present in each school and whether the system is working as planned. SPEAK UP MOE!</p>

              <p>MOE has overworked teachers and has short-changed their youthful energy and spirit, riding on the mantra that this job is a calling. Over the years, they’ve remove your pension and replaced it with CONNECT PLAN. The CONNECT Plan is not meant to replace your retirement as it is heavily reduced. They removed your pension and REPACKAGED it into a heavily reduced CONNECT PLAN (reducing cost for them in the expense of your welfare) and now tells you its an incentive for you to stay longer in service. HOW DEVIOUS IS THE GOVERNTMENT INDEED!<br>.<br>Then they get the teachers to be overtaxed and bonded. This again reduces cost. To suck more blood from teachers, MOE introduced the EPMS system to supposedly recognise teachers’ effort.. Rather every teacher in MOE knows this is not the case. It has been the experiences of many a teacher that the EPMS is introduced to get teachers to do more and pay them less for these additional work. When the EPMS was introduced, more and more initiatives from MOE came into schools. Now, many teachers find these initiatives laudable but they’re impractical as a teacher has only 24 hours in a day. MOE introduced EPMS to increase the productivity of the teachers at a reduced cost and knowing that many teachers would not be able to take on so much garbage, they decide that the teachers should be ranked.<br>.<br>They pitted each teacher against another teacher and ranked them. And they call this activity – appraisal. Dirty politics is rife in schools now. Ask your typical VP, he should know. As no teacher wants to have an ugly grade, teachers were easily made to conform to ANY MOE initiatives without resistance.<br>.<br>MAny teachers are repressed from the EPMS. And this repression in pouring out today. I know very well MOE is listening. If it doesn’t respond, rest assure foreign press will pick up on this. It is not that difficult since it was only recently that MOE screwed up by not allowing a deaf American to do her presentation. They eventually backtracked when pressure was surmounting from the american people and fellow teachers in Singapore and America.<br>.<br>Take your time, MOE. Again, more heart, less propaganda and machinations.</p>

              <div class="comm-text">
              <p>“We always fear our appraisals and get threatened about losing our performance bonus.In my final year of teaching, I did not get my performance bonus because amongst other things, it was claimed that I did not talk much to my colleagues. I didn’t agree with her view as I thought that I did socialise as much as I could given that most times I don’t even have time to go to the ladies in between classes and during recess time. The principal wondered out loud to me as to why I wasn’t upset like my other colleagues who had lost their bonuses. I told her that it was just money and I will not rush out of her office crying like the others…”<br>.<br>I know how you feel.<br>.<br>This is precisely what is the psyche of many unenlightened teachers who have been manipulated by P and HOD who saw a loophole in the EPMS system. If Singapore had guns, you’ll see many killing cases like you see from US schools.<br>.<br>My advice to teachers. Take the D and earn cash outside. Don’t depend on the PB and leverage on a second income. You will be pissed initially but then you’ll be happy because the control doesn’t work on you as you are NOT IDENTIFIED with their cunning way of getting you to be a hypocritical and pretentious money luster. It takes courage to have a work-life balance in MOE schools but it’s courage that is worth investing it for a healthier you. Don’t worry about labels. You spent more time seeing the kids than your HOds or Ps. The kids are a better judge of your performance. Keep your conscience clear.<br>.<br>I always made it clear to them, “I don’t suspect your intentions, and I hope you don’t suspect my intentions either. But there are things on which we disagree. Do you want me to agree on everything with you? — whether you are right or wrong? Are you absolutely certain, that you are right? If you are not so absolutely certain, then give me the freedom to decide for myself. At least I will have the pleasure of going<br>wrong on my own decision, and I will not make you feel guilty and responsible.”<br>.<br>But most importantly do not fall into the trap that MOE inadvertently has created, i.e. never allow the implicit pressure of the environment in your school and the politics played by some nutcracks thats making all our lives crazy, to get you to be identified with a D. This is dirty labelling. Just get on with your work. As you gain and see how a more and more balanced life does to you, you”ll start asking for D gradings. This happened to me in my school. I asked for a D grading during the annual meetings in end JUne or end December. As I was clear that I love teaching and I think MOE has gotten the fundamentals of teaching wrong. Why should I follow the crowd when I know they’re wrong? Why should I succumb to implicit and unthinking pressure? I’m an intelligent teacher. And I love to live my life intelligently.</p>

              <p>My heart is heavy to hear of teachers who miscarry or go IMH (not for the sake of early retirement) but because of real mistreatment in the system or abuse of power. And it’s not just about bonuses or work life balance but what the P, Vp or Kp have done to their fellowmen while they are holding office. What values or truth are MOE upholding? Would a Supt or P wants his wife, children to miscarry? Remember an unborn foetus is also a living being. Would a Supt or P wants his own children to be teachers in a school where there is mismanagement? Would a Supt, P, VP or Kp want to land in IMH? Anyway, they probably won’t. To end off, here’s an ancient wise saying for all the Supts, DOE, Ps and VP, KPs,<br>Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money. Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.” Be humble leaders. Do the right things to others when you are still breathing. Your 5-figure salary can’t save you from the grave. Morbid but true. It’s alright if teachers, ex-teachers, aspiring teachers have been oppressed or taken for a ride because there’s justice and justice will prevail. We may be privates in MOE and not generals in rank but who has the last laugh in life we do not know.</p>

              <p>@iras: Better off, your head lor! You just ask any teachers who are in service for more than 10 years. They are the best people to tell you whether easier or not. And to begin with, you think teachers dare to complain. The loved ones AROUND them can’t stand it anymore and spoke up! It’s people like you, who think you understand the NATURE of the job, that frustrate the hell out of teachers. You think we’re dealing with numbers? Dealing with paper? Dealing with words? Dealing with several unreasonable adults? We deal with LIVES! Hundreds of individuals a year!</p>

              <p>The fact that MOE is still silent on this issue of teachers being overworked is a blatant disregard to public sentiment. Teachers play pivotal role in shaping the character of our next generation. Teaching is a high calling, a noble vocation. If we want quality education in Singapore, then we have to cultivate quality teachers. Not one who work the most, but one who attend most to the needs of students. Let teachers do teaching. Anything more is diluting their professionalism.</p>

              <p>Hi Sir,</p>
              <p>I happened to come across lot of teacher’s feed back on their long working hours, no time for family situation. I feel really very sorry for them, I am an IT Professional i work very long hours. But still i feel sorry for the teachers bcoz they are the one bringing up the nation’s young generation. I feel they should be a very good state of mind to bring up their students. If some one mind set is in Toxic, they spread that to the students, it would never bring an atmosphere of high quality education.</p>
              <p>Singapore has always been achieving excel by making use of Foreign Talents / Methodologies/ Technology. I think MOE may consider the go to foreign to manage the schooling hours and teachers moral.</p>
              <p>As a parent I feel very sorry for my kid too. My daughter will have to wake up atleast at 5.30am to get to school. Her timing of food will be heavily impacted. Normal breakfast time for any one will be 7.30am – 9.00 am. By going to school early i am really concerned that her timing for breakfast and lunch is going to be very different from any common people.</p>

              <p>at the sametime, teachers must not be scrutinized by parents, teachers and parents and children must get along well, they must communicate! sometimes parents are just being selfish, they think that teachers are just someone who are from a very low class people and that they mistreated these poor teachers, i just dont understand....Teachers please take a break mannn....</p>

              <p>Woah so many comments- I didn't read thru all <span style="font-size: 15.6px;"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></span></p>
              <p>I think it all boils down to the environment of the school that the teachers are working in. </p>
              <p>I had played with the thought of becoming a teacher- then decided against it after a short teaching stint. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>1. I think it is quite difficult to leave this profession. It's hard to get another job because employers apparently do not treat the years spent in the teaching profession as work experience. </p>
              <p>2. Office politics. Though it's everywhere, I think it's especially stressful for it to be happening in a school. I have heard about teachers bitching about other teachers. [like, omg. I've always thought that teachers are supposed to be tolerating and stuff like that. sorry for stereotyping them]</p>
              <p>3. It's pretty much a thankless job. Students blame teachers for not doing a good job. A girl actually asked me why the questions I gave them for revision did not come out for the examinations. That really left me speechless. Another asked me to let her pass. And another told me to leave her alone during lessons for her to do her own stuff because she has been failing since P4 and it's too late now to do anything. Whereas for parents, they just kept pestering teachers for the whereabouts of their kids. One teacher told me that one of her student's parent always call her during weekends to ask where her child is. Another sad thing I have faced is that I had spent much effort preparing for remedial lessons for those who had failed their tests to go through the important concepts again but yet the students would just skip them on purpose. Also, during lessons, some would ask me to repeat my explanations only to talk to their friends/do other stuff while I attempt to explain again.</p>
              <p>4. Too much admin work and the ridiculous number of schemes put in place to revamp teaching methods. </p>
              <p>Sad, no?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had initially treated teaching as my first option, not because I had nowhere else to go. But since my experience had not been very good, I've decided to shelve this and perhaps look at other options. </p>

              <p>of the 4 reasons you listed, the 3rd and 4th reasons are the very main reasons my gf is quitting next year right after her bond ends.</p>
              <p>And I believed you have understated the severity of reason 4 :)</p>

              <p>Never read everything in this tread. But to the topic, Absulotely!!!</p>
              <p>I am not a teacher, but when i see some of my teacher work, i feel so indignant for them. Especially when they are a very kind teacher and have patience to teach (can teach type).</p>
              <p>Not only need to tolerate bullshits from rebellious students and also stupid admin works like collecting donation for charity.</p>
              <p>This is what happen: the school issue a small envelope by some organization for charity. And note this is a DONATION. And being student (teens), alot of them will either lose they're envolope or choose not to donate. Meaning either they lose the envelope or they hand up the envelope empty or with the envolope filled with 10 cent coins.</p>
              <p>THEN, this stupid school is not happy with the amount of donation. And the HODs begin to stress my poor teacher, they keep chasing us for $. my teacher was so stressed. Then some of us questioned, we can either donate or NOT right? so we don't want to donate, why keep chasing??? Then my teacher explained... blah blah blah... but still students are not satisfied and end up she became more stress. The HODs are such a pain in the neck. My teacher broke down to tears a few times in class.</p>
              <p>A series of stupid incidents happened too, lazy to type them all out.</p>
              <p>Not only need to tolerate shits from HODs, rebellious students and office politics, the teacher's personal life gets affected as well. Being in such stressful environment, need to prepare this prepare that for the students, do this do that, like a mistreated nanny.  Bad mood will affect lovelife and so on and on... then on the crucial year, my O level year, my teacher could not take it anymore. she went overseas to catch up with her lovelife. And i was so devastated, coz she taught very well. And my class kept on changing teachers, coz the was a short of teachers. Students studies was affected greatly as the teachers was not stagnant, today ms A tmr change to ms X. =.=...</p>
              <p>My teacher was kind enough to tell me whats going on in her life... and i stopped whining (coz she was leaving and i was so unhappy there will be a change in teaching) coz i feel so bad when i know what she has been thru. she even apologize for not able to teach anymore. So much for being a dedicated teacher... </p>
              <p>She now had return to teaching again. Coz she just love to teach. I hope she gets a promotion. Hope she is well.  And MOE should definately do more to credit their teachers....</p>

              <p>I think I have understated the severity of all four reasons :P</p>
              <p>I have only taught for a few months, but I was really grateful for this experience as I had always thought that teachers only need to be able to teach well and that's about it. This was because I had been in 'above average' schools so there weren't much disciplinary issues and the parts about office politics and admin work were not apparent to me until I tried teaching myself.  </p>
