              <p>I have something ridiculous to share here.<br> My sch P or VP emailed the KPs today, urging them to log into
              MyForum to post positive comments about teaching, as there are far
              too many negative ones. They said they need at least 50 teachers to
              do so! =S<br> Even one HOD, who is always quiet, said it was rubbish, and how the
              sch could resort to such means to manipulate the comments in
              MyForum.<br> Does that mean whatever positive comments that we are going to see
              here and MyForum are bogus? Possibly.</p>

              <p>Note : RO = Reporting Officer = HOD = Head of Department (ie. the RO for a teacher is his/her HOD)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also Note : a 'D' grade for a teacher means he/she is doing what a teacher is supposed to do (as far as the student is concerned, he/she could be a perfect teacher), no peformance bonus. a 'C' grade means he is doing more that what he/she is supposed to do (ie. do more useless admin stuff), some bonus. a 'B' grade means a normal teacher is doing the work of a HOD or VP or P, more bonus (which has nothing to do with benefitting students). an 'A' grade... you get the idea. The grading system since introduced has resulting in politics, backstabbing, manipulation and conniving between teachers against each other. (since every school needs to have a quota of teachers getting a 'D' grade, even if all teachers are excellent. But no such quota exists for A and B grades. Lovely system.)</p>

              <p>Hi overmarked teacher,</p>
              <p>If your HOD/RO hints to you that you might get a ‘D’, it is a 95% chance that you will get the ‘D’. I have seen many of such cases in my own school. It is a fallacy that if you pull up your socks in the 2nd half of the year, you might yet escape the ‘D’. Remember, to give the ‘D’, your RO needs to have warn you first. So, teachers who are not warned of ‘D’ during the midyear review are spared for the year. At least for most cases.<br> <br>What one teacher did when warned of a ‘D’ was to warn back the RO/HOD. Since I am going to get a ‘D’, why should I bother to try so hard for the rest of this year? My female colleague was brave enough to tell her hod that she will be cutting back on her work commitments since she is already going to be given the ‘D’.<br>The HOD/RO protested, and said that it’s only a warning, not a certainty. My lady colleague immediately called her bluff and told the HOD/RO that we all know how this ‘D-warning’ works. She gave the hod an ultimatum; retract the D-warning, or be prepared to work with a teacher who will totally switched off right after the June break. After all, why bother to work so hard if she will have to still take the ‘D’ at the end of the year?<br>The HOD/RO was not willing to accept such a consequence. Usually (90% of cases in all schools) most teachers, when threatend with the D, tend to do the opposite of my colleague. They will work even harder, in hope that the HOD/RO would decide to be merciful. I still laugh whenever I think of people still harbouring such a foolish thought. Don’t they know how our system works?</p>
              <p>The HOD/RO of my lady colleague was caught in a dilemma. But eventually, the HOD/RO decided to retract the D-warning.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  This post is meant to provide some basis for further discussion. Having some facts will help to avoid any speculation.</p>
              <p>  I vaguely remember the grading scheme as follows:</p>
              <p>  'A' grade: The education officer is performing beyond expectation in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> areas of his/her work.</p>
              <p>  'B' grade: The education officer is performing beyond expectation in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> areas of his/her work.</p>
              <p>  'C' grade: The education officer is performing beyond expectation in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> areas of his/her work.</p>
              <p>  'D' grade: The education officer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">meeting</span> expectation.</p>
              <p>  If a teacher is performing as expected, he/she should not be given a bonus, since others ought to be rewarded for doing more. This is a common thinking among school leaders.</p>
              <p>  I wonder if the grading scheme is still being applied now, because clarity of "expectation" and "areas of work" is questionable depending on the interpretation of school's key personnel. I have witnessed the use of a score card system to rank teachers based on certain criteria, such as</p>
              <p>  1. teaching/learning<br>  2. value-added results<br>  3. contributions in CCAs<br>  4. contributions in school-related/department-related events/committees<br>  5. contributions in other responsibilities (e.g. form teacher, supervising tutor for PW, SPA internal moderator, etc.).<br>  6. Training-related activities (e.g. training hours, department/cluster sharing sessions, action-research activities, etc.)</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>Is assessing a teacher’s performance, ( a hilarious concept in and of itself in teaching ) how does telling a teacher they get a D in May for work done in 5 months be deem as fair when the rest of the other 7 months hasn’t run it’s course?<br>.<br>Lakopi, you drink too much coffee. Even if you were to tell a teacher in August or September, that’s silly. There’s still September, October, November and December. And some teachers’ work schedule starts in the second half of the year after the SMC EPMS ranking begins in August.<br>.<br>It’s sad and stupid that the idiot who designed the EPMS system obviously wasn’t a teacher at all. How stupid can MOE get? *Shakes head in utter disbelief.</p>

              <p>In my school, the D-grade warning is usually given during the 1st work review during mid-year. The rationale is to give potential D-graders the time to improve on the work performance, in the 2nd half of the year.<br>-<br>On paper this practice looks fair, since the teacher involved has time to work out a real plan for improvement. Yet, in practice, the teacher is usually condemned to a D since other teachers who were not warned earlier cannot be given the ‘D’.<br>-<br>SMC in my school does not give a D-warning in the 2nd work review or in August or Sept. The reason is because they fear the teacher might lodge a complain to MOE, stating that the work review is unprofessional and biased, and that the D-grade is fixed (kelong). The teacher will mention that because warning was given so late, there is no time for the teacher to improve on the work performance.</p>

              <p>Yes , teachers are getting more and more work with each passing year. I am not a teacher but I can see and hear that from my teacher friends. They started off in their career with tremendous passion and drive. They love children. After two or three years, they become drained out and their passion gone. I can see that the majority of teachers are tired out every day, have lost their passion, but yet need to carry on because they need the money to survive. They cannot move on to another industry because they have very little market value.<br>Each year, quite alot of the students are getting more defiant, rude, vulgar and lazy. Just a 35 minute period of teaching in a class of such students can tire out a teacher completely and demoralize him. It can become a demeaning job for any adult.<br>Each year, many of the parents are getting demanding. Nowadays, quite a number of parents cannot control their kids (but they are not aware of it or refuse to admit it) So they, cleverly push the responsibility to the teachers to do something extra for their kids to improve their performances.<br>Each year, some of the principals and vice-principals will pressure their teachers to do something extra or different in order to boost the image of the school or its ranking. They want something different and teachers have a hard time scratching their heads to come up with something extraordinary.<br>Fortunately, we have a big pool of teachers who still persevere and still try their best even with all these adversities.<br>However, lately, their feedback and noise is getting louder and louder because things are getting tougher and tougher for them. MOE should really study and investigate their grievances.</p>

              <p>There is a huge supply of young teachers joining NIE each year, even though it is an open secret that most teachers are demoralized, badly overworked and distracted with 1001 non-teaching duties.<br>Each year, I have friends who will joyfully share with us the news that their prayers have been answered; they have been accepted into the teaching service and will be joining NIE in July.<br>So, why would MOE need to do anything to alleviate teachers’ workload when there is a huge supply of “cheaper, better and faster” teacher-wannabes?</p>

              <p>I have heard stories of male and female teachers breaking down due to student misbehaviour in class. 35 mins of sheer hell lol.</p>
              <p>One classic I heard from my friend:</p>
              <p>Teacher: Why are you always late?</p>
              <p>Student: Cher, not that I wanna be late but your lessons are really boring.</p>
              <p>Teacher was speechless because he was indeed teaching a dry subject. Nevertheless, he reported this to the HOD and the student was summoned to his office. The HOD decided to use the soft approach and the student got off with a slap on the wrist.</p>
              <p>Teacher how? Well, virtually a slap on his face and he still has to face the yaya student everyday lol.</p>

              <p>lol so what's the teacher's reaction? A retort like that in my school days would have seen an automatic suspension or punishment in front of the whole school.</p>
              <p>Man, I feel damn sorry for the state of education these days. The audacity of these students.....has it been condoned by school principals or the MOE?</p>

              <p>Ok I give u another example...this time from ITE. My friend says its sheer hell there. The canteen breaks out in fights every other day. No lecturer dares to eat in the canteen because they do not want to be "held responsible" during their lunchtime.</p>
              <p>These students are then brought to see the section head or junior director and they are given verbal warnings, at most suspensions. Calls to their parents go unheeded because they just cannot be bothered.  Attendance is erratic and they have always been warned that they may be debarred from exams. Come crunch time, no one gets debarred. Reason?? Because the department's KPI (and eventually performance bonus) is pegged to the attrition rate.</p>
              <p>Haha...what a farking joke!!</p>

              <h4 id="teaching-life">This is the excerpt I got from MOE forum, possibly from someone who is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a teacher himself/herself:</h4>
              <h4><em>A teaching life or a teacher’s lot? (Tan Lee Hwang, ST Forum, 21/5, pA34)</em></h4>
              <p><em>I find Ms Aishah Quek’s diary of a teacher’s day last Saturday (‘Work-life balance? Here’s one day in the life of a teacher’) misleading in detailing the lack of a work-life balance for her husband, a teacher. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>Using the same diary format as Ms Quek, I would like to explain why.</em></p>
              <ul>
              <li><em><strong>5am to 6am:</strong> Wake up and prepare for school. A lot of people, including students, take only half an hour to prepare for school or work.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>Leave for school at 6am and arrive at 7am.</strong> If he needs to take one hour to reach school, Ms Quek’s husband should ask for a transfer to a school nearer home.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>7am to 7.30am:</strong> The ‘guard duty’ he does is usually done by parent volunteers or rotated among teachers, so it is not a daily affair.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>7.30am to 1pm:</strong> Regular teaching. Teachers do not teach from 7.30am to 1pm at a stretch. They have one or two free periods in between each day.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>1pm to 3.30pm:</strong> Prepare for and conduct remedial lessons. Again, this is not an everyday affair as different subject teachers will take turns to conduct remedial lessons.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>3.30pm to 5.30pm:</strong> Take charge of co-curricular activities. Again this is usually only once a week for primary schools. For secondary schools, these are usually done by outside coaches or student leaders.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>5.30pm to 6.30pm:</strong> Key in remarks on students for mid-term report book. This is required only twice a year, during mid-term and year-end.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>6.45pm to 7.45pm:</strong> Travel home. He should request to teach in a school nearer home to cut travelling time.</em></li>
              <li><em><strong>8.30pm to 1am:</strong> Marking books, worksheets and the like. Most homework is marked by students who exchange books and worksheets, with the teacher going through the answers during class time.</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>An exception is for examination papers and compositions, which are marked by teachers. These are usually marked in school during the teachers’ free periods. The daily routine listed by the writer did not include lunch breaks.</em></p>
              <p><em>While a teacher’s job is stressful, so are other jobs. Having to work long hours is the norm for all jobs now. At least the workload of a teacher’s job is seasonal and there are times when they can relax a little, for example, during the long mid-year and year-end holidays.</em></p>
              <p><em>So teachers, cheer up, you are not alone, all other jobs are stressful and requires us to work long hours as well.</em></p>

              <p>Dear Kiaboon,</p>
              <p>  Thanks for sharing :)</p>
              <p>  Let me add some details, from personal experience as a teacher:</p>
              <p>  1. CCA teachers will need to be around to supervise the conduct of CCA activities. In the case of niche CCAs, the frequency of training may be high even to the extent of weekend trainings.</p>
              <p>  2. Free periods in between are well-filled with department/committee meetings, briefings and perhaps consultations with students.</p>
              <p>  3. Entering of marks is definitely more than twice, because school cockpit is not able to support large user loads. Teachers have to take turns to enter marks at designated time periods and wait for the database to respond. In addition, teachers may need to print the slips out and distribute to students for parents' signatures. Also, teachers need to be briefed before the marks are entered. Much time is spent in this area as a result. Sometimes, there is a school-based system and that makes teachers enter marks twice.</p>
              <p>  4. Marking can be quite substantial if teachers are already struggling to find a continuous stretch of time to mark with momentum. Sometimes, departments set certain expectations on the amount of homework/assignments to be done, which students even find it hard to cope. Books and worksheets may be left to students to mark if they are of the MCQ-type, I believe. That is probably done to increase efficiency.</p>
              <p>  5. As for lunch, I often hear my colleagues lament that they barely have time to eat properly. For me, I used to survive on a heavy breakfast to last for the entire day.</p>
              <p>  6. For June hols, it's quite routine for schools to use weeks 1 and 4 for school remedial lessons, CCAs, school meetings, training, etc. The only protected time (on paper, say on SEM appraisal reports) may be weeks 2 and 3, where teachers typically prepare teaching/learning for next two terms.</p>
              <p>  Thanks.</p>
              <p>Cheers,<br>Wen Shih</p>

              <p>The 65-pages thread (and the glimmer of hope it represented in the minds of many teachers) is dying out. MOE (correctly) predicts that as long as it keeps quiet (and it has instructed the local media not to print the many never-published letters on this topic), public interest in this matter will wane, and status quo (ie. abuse of teachers by school leaders, HODs, P, etc) will be restored, which keeps MOE HQ (who certainly aren't overworked and/or overstressed like teachers, but are paid 2x or 3x as much every month) happy and its self-interest intact.</p>

              <p>I went into teaching with the idea that a teacher’s job is to teach his/her pupils well. However, after teaching for a few years i find that this is not true. Teachers not only have to plan 3 different subjects’ lessons, conduct interesting lessons, mark workbooks and piles and piles of worksheets. They have to use up their free periods to do relief, safety duty, carry out research, organize activites. In the end, there’s almost no free periods at all. After the normal curriculum hours, teachers have to stay back to conduct remedials, supplementaries and attend long staff meetings which end late. Up to this point, teachers do not have time to mark students’ work like Compositions, thick worksheets and plan the next day’s lesson yet. So all these has to be done at home after the school closes. By that time, teachers are already mentally and physically drained out. How about school holidays? They are to be spent going back to school for meetings again, creating the next term’s resources, organizing and planning for next term’s activities, setting exam papers. Teachers can also be asked to accompany students for overseas trips for 2 weeks. All these takes up the supposedly rest time of teachers. At the end of the day, during work review, RO will tell you that you are not doing enough and you are at risk of getting a D. How can a teacher not feel demoralized and lose his/her passion and suffer from depression?</p>

              <p>A sup recently met up with a group of teachers at school over this article and its replies. This sup said that if you are not happy, you can disconnect your connect plan. You go figure what it means <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"></p>
              <p>For non-teachers, Connect plan is like a cash payout every number of years. 4th, 10th, 15th, etc… This is to “motivate” you to stay in the system.</p>

              <p>I think it is high time we teachers took action. Here is what you can do;</p>
              <p>1) Put your foot down and systematically reduce the amount of work you bring home. Do it gradually, week by week.<br>-<br>2) Cut down on your monthly expenses, so that you won’t be so financially affected by a ‘C-’ or ‘D’ grade.<br>-<br>3) Focus on your core duty as a teacher; teaching, marking hw, running your CCA. If you are not that affected by the ‘D’, you will come to realize that your principal and HOD are really that powerless to make your life difficult.<br>Making your life hell revolves entirely around the ‘D’ grade. That’s the worst bite they can give.<br>-<br>4) Vote against PAP. The political party is supposed to listen to our voice, and help us. So is the union. But our ruling party has decided that an active union is bad for our country. So, every union is now rendered powerless under the law. Even the biggest union NTUC is more synonymous with supermarkets than workers’ rights.<br>If the PAP education minister won’t listen to the voices of teachers, then it is time to disconnect him from his own connect plan in MOE.</p>

              <p>The supt that asked teachers to leave if they not happy is a retard.<br>:<br>Widespread low morale in any organization usually leads to massive inefficiency and high turnover rate, which will ultmiately lead to greater cost for the organization.<br>:<br>MOE is full of such incompetent leaders who climbed their way up not by real talent, but by claiming credit for other people’s work and by wasting a whole lot of time inflating their accomplishment via reports and powerpoint slides.<br>:<br>Just do a half-assed job and collect your pay and connect plan. Why be so bothered about the ‘D’ grade? If you really need the money, give part time tuition outside. If politicians can hold multiple directorships, hold down a full time job and still be an MP, i don’t see why teachers can’t give multiple tuition outside school to get more money.<br>Teachers who work long hours in school also know that 80% of the things they are busy with are not even closely related to teaching.</p>

              <p>I was a teacher here, until 5 years ago.<br>My marriage broke down because I had no time for my husband.<br>He had an affair with someone who had time for him.<br>He couldn’t take the nonsense of me marking and marking and marking,at home, at dinner, at family gatherings, even on the bed (which made him loses all interest).<br>.<br>In my moments of despair – mental breakdowns, depression, marriage counsellings, MCs and no-pay-leave for the counsellings,<br>guess what did my V and HOD told me?<br>To wake up and buck up or risk a ‘D’….<br>and that the world still goes on, the sun still rise and set.<br>.<br>I woke up. I bucked up. I quit.<br>I realised that yeah, life still goes on. What is the point of all those stupid rankings and nonsense? For what? Am I getting paid by the millions?? NO!<br>I lost my husband, I am not going to lose my children too!<br>For the first year, after signing above the ‘dotted line’,<br>I left Singapore. My parents took care of my 3 children.<br>I went to teach in Indonesia. I settled down, adjusted, stood and faced the world in a foreign land, alone.<br>My second year, I uprooted my children.<br>My fourth year, we went to China.<br>.<br>Now I am so much happier TEACHING. With 36 periods per week, I teach ONLY English. I marked only EL papers, EL homework, EL worksheets.<br>No stupid MOE system.<br>No tons of admin work.<br>No ambitious and incompetent Ps, VPs and HODs.<br>All I do now is teach and plan my lessons to cater to my pupils’ needs. Meetings are done twice a month. Of course we have other duties to perform but seriously, they are nothing compared to what I was doing in Singapore. Holidays are truly holidays.<br>.<br>Pupils are more respectful, parents are more appreciative.<br>.<br>Of course $ is less than what I used to get in Singapore but my children and I are much more happier. We get to travel about during holidays. We went to so many different places. My children have grown to appreciate the value of life, to appreciate what they have, to be respectful towards elders. Learned to do volunteer work at those less fortunate villages, learned to care for the less fortunate, learned to sympathise and empathise. Their IQ are not of those toppers in Singapore but their EQ are much way higher than most of them. This I dare to say.<br>.<br>To those stressed out teachers, step out of your comfort zone.<br>Dare to venture outside Singapore. It is not easy to leave your family, your friends, your everything behind you and pastures are not necessarily greener on the other side but at least you have tried and you know it yourself if they are greener or not. I did, when my world crumbled. Leaving my children behind during the first year was the hardest thing I had ever done in my life (until today). Look where am I now?<br>.<br>To MOE, if you don’t wish to lose anymore good and dedicated teachers, you better wake up from your stupid and insipid ideas and methods of managing your teachers.<br>.<br>To unappreciative and unreasonable parents, you gave birth to your young(s). Ultimately, they are your responsibility. Not the teachers’. With your unreasonable complaints, threats and even letters to MOE, at most, the teacher loses his/her job. But when your kid is all grown up with no positive changes in character, you are the one to suffer. Not the teacher.</p>
