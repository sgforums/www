              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Ok guys it's quite long so sorry about it but I really need advise.<br> <br> I'm 20 this year, just completed National Service. In 2005 I completed my O level but I screwed it with results being -<br> <br> English - A1<br> Mother Tongue - C6<br> Pure Physics - E8<br> Pure Chem - E8<br> E Maths - D7<br> <br> Being naive then, I enrolled in MDIS for a Diploma in IT course which I
              completed. However after completing it, I realised MDIS certs are not
              recognised and can be considered useless so I did not went for the
              Advanced Diploma and went to NS.<br> <br> After finishing my NS, I went to enroll in SIM - Diploma in Management
              Studies as after doing some online research, it seems to be the most
              recognised private school. However I was told that with only 2 O level
              credits, my chance of entering is very, very slim. SIM will only
              confirm by mid - end November whether or not I am accepted in the
              course. Right now I'm feeling very stressed and I'm not sure what to do
              at all.<br> <br> I understand if I'm not accepted by SIM, I will either have to enroll
              in other private schools or retake my O level. I would like to ask do
              our local polys accept mixed O level certs? Meaning since I have
              cleared my English and Mother Tongue, will it be possible to re take
              only my Pure Physics, Chem and E maths and use both certs to enroll?<br> <br> However I understand if I go this way by the time I graduate from poly,
              I'll be 25 and most likely will end up going to SIM RMIT for the degree
              course.<br> <br> So should I retake the 3 subjects and enroll in SIM Diploma course,
              skipping the 6 months foundation course so I end up only wasting 6
              months or go to poly after retaking the 3 subjects?<br> <br> Or what about Kaplan, is this private school recognised?<br> <br> I'm so sorry for my wall of text but I'm really not sure what my future holds given my past attitudes and laziness.<br> <br> I thank you all in advance for any inputs. </span></p>

              <p>U can drop any of the polys an email and check with them. Most of the time people take the O's cert in 2 consecutive yrs and use it to apply.</p>
              <p>English and Chinese requires little studying compared to the rest so if u can, maybe u can just considering retaking them as well since an O's cert is better than 2 combined.</p>

              <p>Yes you should. From your english,I can see that you actually have a very understanding area, just that you seem to somehow have taken a wrong subject combination.</p>
              <p>You should try to tilt towards the arts subjects and humanities side. But ultimately, it is your own choice though.</p>

              <p>I understand given my calibre, I will not be able to go into any
              of the local unis if I were to graduate from poly. Therefore I'll
              end up going to SIM RMIT/UOL program. If I were to go SIM Diploma
              in Management Studies, I can go to SIM RMIT/UOL after completing it
              and saving time too.</p>
              <p>I would like to know what's my chance of entering SIM with only
              2 credits and if I'm rejected what my are my options.</p>

              <p>There are ppl from NA who managed to get into uni.</p>
              <p>I got a classmate in uni who has dyslexia yet he still managed to handle his academic work with alot of extra effort put in.</p>
              <p>If u have really changed, there is always a chance u can do well. Don't give up on urself before you even try.</p>
              <p>In poly, O's results are history and there are ppl who didn't do well in O's who excel in poly, doing even better than those who did well in their O's. The environment is totally different and some ppl just do well in the poly route.</p>

              <p>Do u intend to take the lessons or just take the exam without lessons?</p>
              <p>If just the exams that would not be a problem. If u want the join the lessons, it will depend on when the private school u choose opens for registration but generally Nov should be in time i guess.</p>

              <p>take one step at a time, slow and steady ... there are no short cuts to education, everyone has to put in the time and effort. Trying to find a short cut would only let private school owners get their next district 10 bunglow, like that raffles education group chap. So just batten down and put in the hours and years.</p>

              <p>You should be thinking of how to capitalize and leverage on your MDIS IT diploma certificate. Are your interests in IT? If not, you wouldnt enroll and study for it right?</p>
              <p>Have you ever consider getting a job after NS? IT related work? Then a year on from working, decide to take up a part time course either management or IT?</p>
              <p>Why its better? Cuz by getting a job, first, you get actual working experience. Second, you build on your IT diploma and at the same time you earn money to provide for yourself and money for your next education cert.</p>
              <p>If you plunged again to another SIM course or what, what if later you are unable to cope? Or not interested in the field? or you have money concerns?</p>
              <p>Also, your self-esteem will be higher when you started work. If you join MDIS alumni, seek the alumni organization's help to get you a related job, or ask someone you know from there to be your referree for reference letters.</p>
              <p>For you, 2 good reference letters from Acad director or course lecturer or supervisor from MDIS and your SAF NS OC or CO should suffice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about this choice. Might work out better for you.</p>

              <p>For the IT diploma that you have, if its not recognized, then it wouldnt be offered in Singapore, then what for they want to set up the course and allow people to enroll.</p>
              <p>You need to find out more from MDIS, the diploma you have and what companies' or institutes recognize it and how you can capitalize from it.</p>
              <p>Also, remember that if in job or poly or institute they say that your diploma is not recognized, you need to show confidence to them and challenge them back that it is so and so....... like casetrust certified, recognized by MOE, or that the diploma is equal to so and so level in education etc. All these you can learn quickly by contacting MDIS to help you. </p>
