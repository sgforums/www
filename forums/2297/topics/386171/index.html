              <p>You are past 20 so you can no longer disrupt NS for any education.</p>
              <p>A local dip is still the best choice compared to any other private dip for local work as well as if you intend to persue further studies be it local or overseas. Without a dip, taking a private degree requires bridging courses generally and private degrees are generally not very well recognised so they are quite a last option.</p>
              <p>Each poly have their own rules on how many times you can retake a certain module etc before you are terminated from the instituition so i am unsure about NYP nor your chances of returning.</p>

              <p>Hi Augustine,</p>
              <p>You may wish to consider taking up another diploma course instead after you have ORDed from one of the local polytechnics. I hope you will not mind me saying so, but perhaps the current diploma course which you are doing is not really suitable for you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>in the past yes. now the cookhouse food very good taken care off by private catering people. cost of one soldier per meal is around 5~7 dollars that was my time now not very sure. at times good good fruits and ice cream. well at least taht was my unit (not commando) other units should be the same no bias. army rations in the field also improving. army jobs not all 4 walls. depend on vocation clerk and logistics maybe station in camp. comabt all out in the field. technician specialist service machines and weapons etc in camp. regulars can still book out everyday 8-5 unless got exercise deployed in the field or standby in camp. drivers move all around the island camps so yeh its not cclaustrophobic at all. unless you do wrong things serve in dark room <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
