              <p>Hi everyone. I've been surfing in this forum for about a day, and i think its a very nice forum for Singaporeans to interact. I am wondering, for my grades as an o level student, which is around 10 marks for my L1R5, where should i go? JC or poly?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally have the intention to go into a business course, but i dun know whether going poly or jc is better because i want to get a degree. Which option is better?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks you all for ur opinions , if any.</p>

              <p>Business is a very general degree, not what i would advice for a 1st degree but if thats your interest, by all means.</p>
              <p>Business is not a very specialise subject that requires much prior knowledge and your results look decent so maybe JC might be a faster route for you since 3 years in poly does give you some background etc but for business degree, you don't really need much background to start with to waste an additonal year.</p>

              <p>Since his interest is in business courses, there is no direct 2nd year so JC would save more time and money but thats the oppersite if he was to choose engineering as <a href="../../../users/76972">sbst275</a> mentioned and the duration would be the same regardless JC or poly due to the direct 2nd year.</p>

              <p>Afraid I don't really understand what you are trying to say, sorry :S but I suspect that what the OP wants is a uni degree in business administration at the end of it, not just a diploma in business? So he is asking which route, JC or Poly is more viable towards that end. Which I still reiterate is JC because it is 1. Shorter (2 years) 2. Cheaper (24 sing per term vs 4000 per year?) and 3. Easier entry (need say BCC at A levels as compared to being top 2% in poly).</p>

              <p>Which uni did u managed to get business with BCC? I have friends who have problems with even BBB. Anyway you do not need to be top 2% in poly, what age did your knowledge exist? Nowadays it depends on how well you do in poly since the poly grades are put on scoring system that is compared to that of the JC results. You still need to do well but there are courses where even top 10% can enter and some where even the top 1% might not stand a chance.</p>

              <p>Afraid I don't really understand what you are trying to say, sorry :S but I suspect that what the OP wants is a uni degree in business administration at the end of it, not just a diploma in business? So he is asking which route, JC or Poly is more viable towards that end. Which I still reiterate is JC because it is 1. Shorter (2 years) 2. Cheaper (24 sing per term vs 4000 per year?) and 3. Easier entry (need say BCC at A levels as compared to being top 2% in poly).</p>

              <p><br>the faster is only for overseas. some uni esp in Aust gives poly students even 2 out of 4 yr exemption... hence in 2 yrs instead of 4 yrs of their JC peers, they'll get their degree. as again, it only applies to home - home courses i.e. engineering.</p>
              <p>As for biz, this one TS would really gotta sit down and think as from poly rt there wun be much exemption even from dip in biz.</p>
              <p>as for who can get in, it's not true only top 10% in poly can get in. I've heard of ppl GPA 3.5 still got in... As for A levels, BCC can't really get you any courses either if you do check e grade profile based on last yr's admission exercise.</p>

              <p>Which uni did u managed to get business with BCC? I have friends

              2% in poly, what age did your knowledge exist? Nowadays it depends
              on how well you do in poly since the poly grades are put on scoring
              system that is compared to that of the JC results. You still need
              to do well but there are courses where even top 10% can enter and
              some where even the top 1% might not stand a chance.</p>
