              I don't know, people study business for a myriad of reasons, why should we question them? Even if it is for glamour or the money, we are here just advising OP on how to get into a BBA, not to go into lengthened debates about his raison d'etre. And if your information is correct, which by the by I highly doubt so, that students need AAA to enter business, then of course students would be drawn to a more entry-rigorous course.

              Are you talking about the dumping ground image for engineering in local unis? I think you are correct. My friends who are passionate about engineering had already decided to go overseas for an engineering degree instead of staying in Singapore. The trouble is with the image as you rightly say. Engineering in NUS has always been seen as a back-up (maybe not electrical engineering) if you do less than expected for A levels. Whether or not, that stereotype is true, I know not, for I am an arts student - and my back up is not engineering.
