              <p>Hi, I need help with a few interpretations.</p>
              <p>"Some people say that Man is naturally a hunter, with a primitive urge to set out in pursuit of his prey with a heavy club - or its modern equivalent - on his shoulder. I disagree with this view. Surely, our earliest ancestors, who at first possessed no weapons, spent theri time sratching for roots and were no doubt themselves often hunted by carnivorous animals?"</p>
              <p>What would be the modern equivalent of the hunter's club? (does the "shoulder" in the passage mean it literally or figuratively? If it is the latter, what is it?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why did our earliest ancestors have to <em>scratch </em>for roots for their food?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, can someone tell me what advantage does an animal have if it is hunted in its own territory? I think the animal will die peacefully and at ease because it is familiar with the environment it is in. Suggestions?</p>

              <p>From my understanding...</p>
              <p>The modern equivalent would be the tools or method that the modern people use to feed themselves... like in terms of society, the skills we have in order to stay in the job and bring back the dough.</p>
              <p>I think the shoulder is figuratively as normally people refer to bearing the weigh/burden on the shoulder.</p>
              <p>Advantage of the animal being hunted in its own territory is that the road of escape is clear as it should know the place well even...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's what I think and can serve as a second opinion if it is wrong.</p>

              <p>It will be easier if I can see the full passage.</p>
              <p>From what I can see, the modern equivalent could be either a gun or a pen, depending on how the whole passage is.</p>
              <p>Our earliest ancestors have no weapons of their own, hence they cannot hunt down other animals for food, and will have to rely on digging the roots of trees and plants for food.</p>
              <p>If one is hunted in its own territory, it will have a better chance of survival, regardless of whether it chooses to escape or engage the enemy, as it has a complete understanding of its surroundings.</p>

              <p><br>yep, since guns are put on shoulder, the modern equivalent of the "club on the shoulder" would mean the equipment / tools / skills we have at our disposal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the same vein, since we "at first possessed no weapons", weapons in this case meaning <em>tools / skills</em>, we had no other way to forage for food than to use our bare hands, hence we must "scratch for roots"...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>being hunted down in your own surroundings give you an advantage because you know it better. imagine if a murderer break into your house, and you know where best to hide. the bugger will take quite some time to find you...</p>
