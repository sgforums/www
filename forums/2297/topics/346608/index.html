              <p><span class="postbody">To me, combined sciences is actually tougher on the student... This is why:<br><br> combined physics is roughly about 75% of pure physics
              <br> combined chem is roughly about 75% of pure chem
              <br> <br> so if you take pure sciences, your workload is 100% + 100% = 200%
              <br> if you take combined sciences, your workload is 75% + 75% = 150%
              <br> <br> But the thing is... for pure sciences, it is 200% for two subjects
              <br> for combined sciences, it is 150% for only one subject!!!
              <br> <br> It is this reduction of about 50% in workload that makes school tell
              students to drop to combine sciences, but the problem is that the
              student has to deal with more content for less subject grades.</span></p>

              <p>The combined sciences syllabus is designed in such a way, it's to provide broad-based understanding of the subjects(chem, bio, understand) in relation to our daily lifes. Students taking combines sciences will be able to apply knowledge gained to everyday life, and understand how the subj have an impact on human.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, my school doesn't offer pure sci for NA students. Yea, in order to excel for both Science(Chemistry, Biology), I read up the pure Chem &amp; Bio textbook and assessments book myself. I've gained a deeper understand of how stuffs work.</p>

              <p>Yes, this is a matter on which I've advised many students on, for many years now.</p>
              <p><br>The advantage Pure Science has over Combined Science is :</p>
              <p>1) More H2 subject opportunities at 'A' levels.</p>
              <p>2) One of your sciences won't 'pull down' or 'sabotage' the other science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The advantage of Combined Science over Pure Science is :</p>
              <p>1) Much easier to pass and/or score A1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, ultimately, the decision to take Pure vs Combined, depends on several factors, including the student's desired career path and desired 'A' level subject combination, as well as the student's competence in one or both Sciences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a student is generally weak in science, he should (or from the school admin's perspective, he has no choice but to) take combined science. However, he should be careful to choose a combined science combination that does not sabo himself (eg. if he's lousy in Physics, he should take cobined science Chem + Bio, instead of combined Phys + Chem).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, all students interested in a career in Science rather than Arts or Commerce, must compulsorily study the Pure Sciences at 'O' levels, and H2 Sciences at 'A' levels. Else their planned career in the Sciences may be jeopardized. (eg. To study Medicine, you need distinctions in H2 Maths, H2 Chem, and either H2 Physics or H2 Biology; so at 'O' levels, you should be taking Pure Chem and Pure Physics or Pure Bio; or better yet, Triple Pure Science.)</p>

              <p>That point is already covered by my</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) One of your sciences won't 'pull down' or 'sabotage' the other science. &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In other words, as long as both your physics and chem are strong, it's much easier to score A1 in combined phy+chem, compared to pure phy, or pure chem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if one of ur sciences (eg. phy) is weak, then you're shooting urself in the foot by taking combined phy+chem. Coz ur phy may pull down ur chem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So it depends on the student, if he's good enough in both sciences, then taking combined science would give him a higher chance of passing and/or scoring A1 (compared to pure). But if he's really good in science (and he wants a career in science), then he must take pure sciences.</p>

              <p>Actually my issue is.... schools normally want students who are weaker in science (or sometimes, weaker in studies) to move from pure to combined... which is dumb</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that's the sodium-potassium pump required to maintain the resting potential. This requires ATP. The action potential (ie. the nerve impulse itself), in contrast, does not require ATP. This may come as a surprise to 'O' level students.</p>

              <p>This is interesting...</p>
              <p>I think I roughly see the diff now.....</p>
              <p>Workload is higher for 1 subject grade, but it's easier to score because the cohort taking combined science is usually weaker in science</p>

              <p><br>Yes, my point exactly. Just in case any student is confused about what we've been discussing, let me put it this way :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Combined Science (eg. Phyiscs/Chemistry), to score A1, you need about 75% marks.</p>
              <p>In Pure Sciences (eg. Physics, Chemistry), to score A1, you need about 90% marks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is due to the Bell-Curve, in which all the raw scores are arranged from highest to lowest, and only the top X% gets A1, the next Y% gets A2, and so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the tens of thousands of top students (who score 7A1s) all take Pure Sciences, which is why the A1 grade is pushed up (eg. to 90% marks).</p>

              <p><br>Yes, greater depth and higher level of thinking, PLUS the bell-curve (see my post above), makes the Pure Sciences a lot tougher to pass and/or score, compared to the Combined Sciences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, all students interested in a career in the Sciences and must therefore compulsorily take Sciences in the University and must therefore compulsorily take H2 Sciences in the JC and must therefore compulsorily take Pure Sciences at 'O' level, have no choice but to stick to Pure Sciences, and find ways to improve your grades (eg. come to <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition">my tuition for Chem/Bio</a> and <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/strategictuition/">Eagle's tuition for Physics/Maths</a>).</p>
