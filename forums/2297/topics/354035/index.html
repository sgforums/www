              <p>I think the early 80s and late 70s born are more aware like they used to in the 90s,But they seem to be more street smart in talking their way through than the current generation who tend to talk like nerds.</p>
              <p>The young now are so indulged in their self centred world , faced with worry and stress have missed out on developing basic key human skills during their childhood.</p>
              <p>A good childhood involves developing key skills in activities done in the outside world like playing, catching spiders, and exploration, enjoying hobbies, trading with other kids your possessions in exchange for theirs. it is during this important time of one's like which shapes our adulthood. We understand about the environment, people, places and be streetsmart.</p>
              <p>The young now are so deprived of this expereince, they just stay at home studying for their homework, playing computer games, reading lots of garbage in google.</p>
              <p>The CCA activities found in schools now are meant to develop skills?, I think it is laughable because many kids find it a chore and added burden. I think schools should try to develop the innate capabilities of a kid then force things down their throats.</p>
              <p>If i have a kid, i will want him to have his own "CCA activities" in the outside world than superficial things done in schools. Therr will be lots more things they will learn than the CCA done in schools.</p>

              <p>I notice that kids like to brag about their CCA in school like they are the team leader ect.. This kind of things just fosters elitism and sense of pride.</p>
              <p>Things i had done in my childhood:</p>
              <p>Cycling: develops my sense of direction, control and awareness</p>
              <p>Catching spider:  develops my sense " hunt and kill"</p>
              <p>Soccer: develops awareness, physical and mental strength</p>
              <p>Computer games: develops my sense of hand to eye and mind coordination and attentiveness</p>
              <p>Pets: Develops my sense of environmental harmony with nature and emotions like compassion, kindness</p>
              <p>Trading and gambling cards and possessions: Develops my analytical and communications skills when dealing with fellow humans. Some way it is also related to spider catching, remmeber the spider fights in schools?</p>

              <p>Dont be surprised, even if they joined teen gangs , they do learn how to be streetsmart. Same thing happened to me.</p>
              <p>What schools can do is to educate them on communication and analytical skills which they can use in what they intend to do,  then to force them to do CCA</p>
              <p>I find CCA is just a shallow thing without proper guidance. The kids willnot relate to how it will help them in developing skills.</p>

              <p>Why do you think there is zero guidance from teachers in most
              CCAs?</p>

              <p>It must be mah, or else why TS think CCA is a waste of time?</p>
              <p>yup, the school teacher is just for decoration. kids use it as a front to form mafia to rape murder and rob all the time...</p>

              <p>Should join teen gang... the  seniors will teach them about
              sex, and to use condoms. Help you buy cigeratte, where to hide and
              smoke them, and engage their everyday lives in very meaningful
              activities. So meaningful I don't know how to list them out.</p>
              <p>Join CCA and you will get zero guidiance from the teacher in
              charge, the friends, and the seniors in school. You will engage in
              meaningless activities like learning a musical instrument, how to
              be part of a team, playing as a team, how to interact with other
              kids, or to work towards a common goal as a team.</p>

              <p>I think the early 80s and late 70s born are more aware like they
              used to in the 90s,But they seem to be more street smart in talking
              their way through than the current generation who tend to talk like
              nerds.</p>
              <p>The young now are so indulged in their self centred world ,
              faced with worry and stress have missed out on developing basic key
              human skills during their childhood.</p>
              <p>A good childhood involves developing key skills in activities
              done in the outside world like playing, catching spiders, and
              exploration, enjoying hobbies, trading with other kids your
              possessions in exchange for theirs. it is during this important
              time of one's like which shapes our adulthood. We understand about
              the environment, people, places and be streetsmart.</p>
              <p>The young now are so deprived of this expereince, they just stay
              at home studying for their homework, playing computer games,
              reading lots of garbage in google.</p>
              <p>The CCA activities found in schools now are meant to develop
              skills?, I think it is laughable because many kids find it a chore
              and added burden. I think schools should try to develop the innate
              capabilities of a kid then force things down their throats.</p>
              <p>If i have a kid, i will want him to have his own "CCA
              activities" in the outside world than superficial things done in
              schools. Therr will be lots more things they will learn than the
              CCA done in schools.</p>
