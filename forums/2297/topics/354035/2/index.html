              <p>Some CCA's should never exist in the first place. They should make it optional, letting people who genuinely wish to develop their interests. Right now, it's compulsory for secondary 1 students to be in the Uniform CCAs, which I think although some students enjoy, I don't think the same applies to the rest.</p>
              <p>However, i have to agree that they should continue to use the points system for the CCA, that idea was adopted from the US education system, if it has allowed the US to produce several all-rounders, i think it should do the same for singaporeans too.</p>
              <p>TS, even if other worldly things which u mentioned has better and practical benefits than the ones touted by CCA's. Does it help in cultivating other essential qualities like discipline?</p>

              <p>All of u idiots have never left singapore. In other countries people dont need CCA to develop their skills, although there are clubs and CCA groups, these are joined by people who are genuinely interested in them . it is because this skills development in already incorporated into their education system. But what they do is outdoor activites alone or  with their family instead of GETTING FARKED EVERY SAT IN A UNIFORMED GROUPS just to earn points for graduation for the sake of doing it.</p>
              <p>it is the same in NS ( the mega failure CCA) which is supposed to teach u leadership and independence skills. it is a big failure when u watch our sg males after ORD , their mind getting screwed up, having paranoid delusions, whining and swearing, picking up habits like smoking, unable to continue further study, and unable to meet expectations. It is because these things are being forced on the person instead of the person willingly taking up the activity.</p>
              <p>Time spent on your interest is the best CCA worth doing.</p>

              <p>Discipline cant be cultivated, it comes from within one's self. Discipline enforced is not cultivation, it is merely stopping the consequence of indiscipline. I prefer kids making mistakes earlier in life and learning from it than they do it in adulthood.</p>

The son smoked stick after stick and at the end of the day , he felt so groggy that he could barely stand. The father then came and said to him , " look at u son, this is what tobacco does to u".

              <p>you are right. LKY said the same thing about genetics. you can be good buddy with him.</p>
              <p>People who are bad, it's not their fault. they inherited it. People who have parents that is not" bad" won't turn bad, ever. since there is no "bad" genes to inherit</p>

              <p>All of u idiots have never left singapore. In other countries people dont need CCA to develop their skills, although there are clubs and CCA groups, these are joined by people who are genuinely interested in them . it is because this skills development in already incorporated into their education system. But what they do is outdoor activites alone or  with their family instead of GETTING FARKED EVERY SAT IN A UNIFORMED GROUPS just to earn points for graduation for the sake of doing it.</p>
              <p>it is the same in NS ( the mega failure CCA) which is supposed to teach u leadership and independence skills. it is a big failure when u watch our sg males after ORD , their mind getting screwed up, having paranoid delusions, whining and swearing, picking up habits like smoking, unable to continue further study, and unable to meet expectations. It is because these things are being forced on the person instead of the person willingly taking up the activity.</p>
              <p>Time spent on your interest is the best CCA worth doing.</p>

              <p>Yes of the most of those that did  , some ended in the gutter while others went on to become successful professionals. But CCA also does not guarantee u will end up as a successful professional as well.</p>
              <p>But i do know lots who dropped out of school catching too much spiders, playing red alert also having successful businesses and earning lot more than professionals who took the conventional route.</p>
