              <p>language is not something u can study and do well in a short span of time.<br>and u definitely cant rush thru it<br>u have to read, speak, write regularly<br>there is no crash course, somemore we are toking abt As</p>
              <p>and since oredi in JC, the language ability is quite fixed oredi so it is really not easy<br>since your first utterances as a year old baby, u are learning language(s) <br>wat u came in contact with the past 18 yrs of ur life would have shaped the lang system in ur brain<br>u can think of 1001 excuses like.... me parents is ang moh pai..... i think chinese is difficult.... chinese is boring..... i dun like my pri sch chinese teacher.....chinese is oni 1 subject out of 9........who needs chinese? english ftw. i can spend the time to learn german even.<br><br>learning and improving the lang shd come from the heart<br>if u have no interest and trying to study it bcos too bad it's one of the subjects i gotta sit for, the mentality itself would be the biggest hindrance<br><br>read a lot. a lot a lot.<br>take the initiative to carry a concise dict with u<br>whenever u come across a character or term u do not know, check it out and put a mark beside the word<br>next time if u found yourself checking up this word again, slap urself for forgetting</p>
              <p>watch the news every nite, if possible<br>now they come with subs so it's easy to relate wat they are saying to the words (by sec 2 standard, u shd be able to understand 90% of the terms used in local media)<br>when u are out, try to take note of signboards, menus, brochures the auntie stuff in ur face at the mrt station, displays or anything with chinese words on it..... to let u feel tt it is in ur everyday life, not only as a subject.....</p>

I began to learn English when I was 13(I'm 21 now)and I read English book everyday. But I don't have any foreign(native English-speaking)friends, I have nobody to communicate with when I want to practise oral or listening skill of English. I must admit that learning English is a very difficult and frustrating thing for most Chinese students. Maybe it's easy for European and Indian students. But the language &amp; culture of far oriental</span></div>

Instead,western countries were influenced by Latin Language and ancient Greek,Roman culture) Nobody speaks English in China in daily life. Most students of Chinese high schools and universities don't like English(very few like it,such as me),the only power to make them insist on English learning is examination.</span></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;"> English is compulsory course in all schools(even in kindergartens!) of China.If you want to go to university you must get a high score in the"College Entrance Examination" which includes English test. In universities of China everyone has to take part in the CET4 and CET6("College English Test(Class 4/6)"), because a high score in these tests is helpful for seeking a good,well-payed job after graduation,inspite of the fact that most people won't use English in their daily work.</span></div>

              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;">So Chinese students have to make an effort to master English. But it's really frustrating. I read English text daily, but I still forget English words everyday! The amount of common daily words of English is FAR more than Chinese language. I memorize and forget English words everyday. Sometimes I even forget the most frequently-used English words which I have learned in high school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;"><br>Listening is another difficulty for most Chinese students. English teachers recommand us to listen to BBC or VOA radio. In fact it's quite easy to get English listening-training tapes, CDs, VCDs and MP3 files in China, Hollywood movie DVDs are everywhere. But most of us can't catch the words in the conversations of them(tapes). We(most Chinese students) think that those native speakers speak too fast, so their English sounds like a kind of alien language(one guy says"it's Mars language, not Earth one"). Although it's a simple conversation, we can't understand most part of it(There is no unknown/new word in the conversation, but I'm still unable to understand what they say). So I'm extremely nervous when I encounter an American now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;"><br>Why is English so difficult to learn? Dear American friends, I need your help.</span></p>

              <p>Since primary school till now, i have been struggling with
              chinese.<br> now at the jc level, i can frankly tell you that my chinese is
              beyond redemption, ask me to retake the PSLE chinese and i can
              probably do it with a C grade.<br> when i read the h1 chinese comprehensions, etc , i can barely
              understand a thing !<br> my chinese alevels are still some time away, so i have some time to
              rush for h1 chinese, and my target isnt very high either, S will
              do, but obviously a B if possible at best.</p>
              <p>I cant focus wholeheartedly on chinese since i have to consider
              other subjects as well, so do you guys have any methods whereby i
              can juggle the' improve chinese plan' into my daily time?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Same! But I can suggest to you that you could try doing some exercise on Chinese, which I did. And whenever I find words that are hard to understand, I would always try to translate it to English. That way helped me a lot and now, my Chinese is a little improved. :)</p>

              <p>Like what FireIce said, if you take an antagonistic/defeatist mentality with regards to Chinese, that in itself is the biggest hindrance to learning Chinese. If you want to do well, you should, however hard it is, <strong>rid that mentality first</strong>. Then you will be able to have the genuine motivation to study the language conscientiously, which is required to do well in it.</p>
              <p>Cliche as it sounds, read, read and read. Since there's an oral component in H1 Chinese, you ought to make an conscientious attempt to speak (however horrible/incoherent it sounds) and improve. Don't be lazy and check all the words you don't understand on the dictionary or online dictionary. Here's an online Chinese dictionary which I found helpful - http://www.nciku.com/</p>
              <p>Yes, your productivity is bound to be extremely low because your abhorrence for Chinese is deeply ingrained in you. The better you get with time, the more productive you'll become.</p>
              <p>You must have confidence in yourself - that's of paramount importance too. All the best.</p>

              <p><br>now is still april, i guess u still have sometime to practise your chinese.</p>
              <p>if your CL in O level got a B3....well my guess is you are just there, but you need more hardwork (rmb you are taking H1 chinese already, not O level)</p>
              <p>Its nt whether about the productivity, English, Chinese, or whatever language u you are studying, it shld be part of your everyday "routine", or i shld say, part of you everyday.</p>
