              <p>Q1. The equation which you gave as the answer, does not suggest the oxide is amphoteric, merely that the metal is in Grp II and that its oxide is soluble. The correct answer should be an equation which shows the metal oxide reacting with a base or alkali (eg. NaOH) to generate a complex salt. Eg. Al2O3 + 3H2O + 2NaOH ---&gt; 2NaAl(OH)4 </p>
              <p>Q2. Because you should familiar with the fact that chlorine is a non-metal and readily gains electrons to be reduced to chloride anions, instead of losing electrons to form Cl+ cations. Also note that Cl- has a stable octet while Cl+ does not.</p>

              <p>Metal oxides are usually basic. Therefore, for its oxide to display amphoteric properties, look for an equation in which it behaves as an acid, rather than a base. Eg. Al2O3 + 3H2O + 2NaOH ---&gt; 2NaAl(OH)4 </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option A shows the metal oxide behaving as a regular base (in accepting protons), ie. doesn't suggest amphoteric properties.<br>Option B is faulty/errorneous because the charges are not balanced. If they added water as a reactant and balanced it correctly (see my equation in previous paragraph), then option B would be the answer.</p>
              <p>Option C shows the hydrolysis and hydration of a soluble Grp II metal oxide (transition metal oxides are usually insoluble), which therefore implies it is a basic oxide, ie. doesn't suggest amphoteric properties.</p>
              <p>Option D shows the metal oxide behavnig as a base (in accepting protons from the acidic salt NH4+Cl- which for 'O' levels you're not required to know is acidic), ie. doesn't suggest amphoteric properties.</p>
              <p>So for this faulty question with these faulty options, all 4 options are wrong. As <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/134754">Darkness_hacker99</a> said, this question setter jia-lat / jiak-lak ("eat strength").</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary :</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/237288">ultimatenolifer</a>, for 'O' levels, when they ask you to write/choose an equation to show that a metal oxide is amphoteric, just choose an equation in which the metal oxide behaves as an acidic oxide to react with bases/alkalis (since non-amphoteric metal oxides only behave as basic oxides to react with acids).</p>

              <p>Additional Note :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beryllium oxide, a Grp II oxide, is indeed an amphoteric oxide. (For an explanation why, see the end of this post. For 'O' levels, you don't need to explain why; just memorize that 3 common amphoteric oxides are the oxides of Pb, Zn, and Al. There are actually several more, which you'll encounter at 'A' levels.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, BeO does not dissolve (ie. hydrolyse and hydrate) in water; as implied by option C of your question (see 1st post of this thread). (The reason why BeO is insoluble in water, and has no reaction with water, is due to the large magnitude of the endothermic lattice dissociation process. Again, an understanding of this is not required for 'O' levels.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BeO does however, dissolve (ie. react to form soluble products) in aqueous acids and aqueous alkalis, demonstrating its amphoteric properties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BeO reacts with acids as follows :</p>
              <p>BeO(s) + 2H+(aq) --&gt; Be2+(aq) + H2O(l)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BeO reacts with alkalis as follows :</p>
              <p>BeO(s) + 2OH- + H2O(l) --&gt; [Be(OH)4]2-(aq)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could go into deeper detail and explanation why certain metal oxides are amphoteric (ie. due to the high charge density of the metal cations, they have a propensity to accept dative bonds from hydroxide ion ligands to generate complex ions; their oxide anions undergo hydrolylsis to generate hydroxide ions, but overall the metal oxide accepts more hydroxide ion ligands than it generates; hence when the metal oxide removes from solution hydroxide ions as an overall net effect, it is considered to have acidic capabilities and and hence the metal oxide is regarded as amphoteric), but an understanding of such is not required for 'O' levels. </p>

              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>You're right. The ans should be A not C.</p>

              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>Regard this as a simple logic-type question, ie. knowledge of content of 4 options not required; in other words, assuming the info stated by each of the options is true, which option is logically inconsistent? D, because if the reduction of iron ore to iron is exothermic and takes place near the top, then logically the top should be warmer, not cooler.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Increasing the temperature does not change the activation energy required for the reaction; instead what happens is increasing the temperature increases the percentage of reactant molecules whose energy equals or exceeds the activation energy required for the reaction, and therefore the rate of reaction increases.</p>

              The question is in error (all options' molar masses exceed 30g, since X = 27g and O = 16g). Tell your student to ignore this qn.
              
              An error-free, similar question, that you can give your student for stoichiometry practice would be :
              
              
              Titanium(IV) oxide TiO2, is heated in hydrogen has to give water and a new titanium oxide. TixOy. if 1.598g of TiO2 produced 1.438g of TixOy, what is the formula of the new oxide?
              
              Solution :
              
              No of moles of Ti before redox = No of moles of Ti after redox
              
              this implies :
              1 (No of moles of TiO2) = x (No of moles of TixOy)
              
              this implies :
              1 (1.598 / 79.9) = x (1.438 / (47.9x + 16y))
              
              this implies :
              x / y = 2 / 3
              
              Therefore, formula of titanium oxide = Ti2O3

              <p>thx for the replies guys. btw i would like to clarify some stuff on the topic of reactions due to some varying answers given in different assessment papers.</p>
              <p>Am i right to say that an endothermic rxn is as follows? (correct me if im wrong)</p>
              <p>1) the products have more energy than the reactants</p>
              <p>2) the total energy change in bond formation is less than that in bond breaking</p>
              <p>3)the enthalpy change of a rxn is calculated by : energy released by products - energy taken in by reactants</p>

              <p>thx for the replies guys. btw i would like to clarify some stuff on the topic of reactions due to some varying answers given in different assessment papers.</p>
              <p>Am i right to say that an endothermic rxn is as follows? (correct me if im wrong)</p>
              <p>1) the products have more energy than the reactants</p>
              <p>2) the total energy change in bond formation is less than that in bond breaking</p>
              <p>3)the enthalpy change of a rxn is calculated by : energy released by products - energy taken in by reactants</p>

              <p><br>Statements #1 and #2 are fine. Statement #3 is problematic and ambiguous. It is better rephrased to :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The enthalpy change of a reaction is calculated by : the sum of the endothermic (ie. positive value) enthalpy/energy* change or heat absorbed to break the (relevant or total) bonds in the reactants to reach the transition state, and the exothermic (ie. negative value) enthalpy/energy* change or heat released by the transition state species as it is converted into the products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(* technically, energy and enthalpy are not exactly the same, but for 'O' level and even 'A' level purposes, they may be regarded as approximately the same)</p>

              <p>Qn1.</p>
              <p>Molarity (ie. molar concentration) of protons (ie. H+ ions) are greater in the solution of H2SO4 (which is a strong monoprotic acid and a weak diprotic acid) compared to in HCl (which is a strong monoprotic acid only).</p>
              <p>Qn2.</p>
              <p>Since iron is more reactive than tin (see redox potentials below), thus when iron is coated with tin, the iron acts as the anode while the tin acts as the cathode. Any tin which is naturally oxidized (eg. by contact with atmospheric oxygen and water) will be immediately reduced by the iron, and the iron consequently experiences an accelerated oxidation / corrosion / rusting (because it is being oxidized by both the tin cations as well as atmospheric oxygen and water). This is also the basis for 'sacrificial protection' when galvanizing iron with zinc.</p>

              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>Write half equations at electrodes :</p>
              <p>H+ reduced to H2 at cathode</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>H2O reduced to H2 at cathode.</p>
              <p>AND</p>
              <p>Cl- oxidized to Cl2 at anode.</p>
              <p>Write balanced redox equation. Apply stoichiometry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>If both H+ and OH- (ie. H2O) is being removed from solution, then the molarity of the acid will increase, which means the pH will *decrease* (not increase!) as the electrolysis is being carried out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Correct answer is B, *not* A. Method A sucks (ie. lower yield) because some of the insoluble CaSO4 ppt coating the CaO reactant will prevent complete reaction. Method B is better (ie. higher yield) because both reactants (in the final step) are aqueous, and thus will not encounter the difficulty described in Method A.</p>
