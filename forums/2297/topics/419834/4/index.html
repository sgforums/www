              <p><br>Q1. Since more H+ is needed during the titration, there must have been more base (either OH- or CO3 2-, depending on the indigestion tablet) present in the titration flask.</p>
              <p>Q2. As Darkness Hacker said, sulfuric acid is a stronger acid than phosphoric acid. Nonetheless, not a fair qn to be asked at 'O' levels, and Cambridge wouldn't ask it.</p>
              <p>Q3.  From sample mass and molar mass, find moles of metal. Since 2 moles of electrons are required to reduce so much of metal ions to metal atoms, you can work out the moles of electrons required to reduce 1 mole of metal ions, and hence deduce the oxidation state or ionic charge of the metal ion.</p>
              <p>Q4. From volume of H2 gas, find moles of H2 gas, hence find moles of electrons transfered. From formula U2(SO4)3, you know the metal ion is tripositive U3+. Hence based on moles of electron transfered, calculate moles of metal atoms deposited.</p>

              <p><br>As mentioned in a previous post, I'll leave 'O' level Chem qns for others to help out.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, a couple of comments :</p>
              <p>Q1. "Moles of oxygen" is ambiguous, as it could refer either to O2 or to O.</p>
              <p>Q2. Question is erroneous, or has a typo.</p>
              <p>Q3. Question is erroneous, ionic salts cannot be obtained by evaporation. Furthermore, even if they have different solubilities at different temperatures, you cannot completely separate them via crystalization or 'evaporation', even with repeated processing.</p>
              <p>Q4. Because there isn't a cation available to be reduced at the cathode, nor an anion available to be oxidized at the anode. You'll need an ionic electrolyte for electrolysis.</p>
              <p>Q5. The missing info necessary to answer the question is : nickel(II) hydroxide is insoluble.</p>

              <p>Since Ni(OH)2 is solid, you can add excess of it and remove it via simple filtration. In contrast, you cannot add excess H2SO4, because it will contaminate the salt crystals.</p>

              <p>It means the crystals will be a mixture of sulfuric acid crystals and nickel sulfate crystals.</p>
              <p>Methyl orange will contaminate the crystals, just as excess sulfuric acid would (see preceeding statement).</p>
              <p>You have to redo the titration without indicator, once you've determined the correct volume of acid to be added in the preliminary titration (ie. with indicator).</p>

              <p>hopefully, my last 2 qns on this thread :)</p>
              <p>1) Is it a requirement for substances to be separated by paper chromatography to be liquids? If not, any eg. of solid substances that can be tested?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) In an expt, 4.0cm3 of 1.0mol/dm3 aq iron(iii) chloride was mixed with 4.0cm3 of 1.0mol/dm3 aq NaOH.</p>
              <p>Fecl3(aq) + 3NaOH(aq) =&gt; Fe(OH)3(s) + 3Nacl(aq)</p>
              <p>What would be observed when the rxn was complete?</p>
              <p>a) Brown ppt in a green soln</p>
              <p>b) Green ppt</p>
              <p>c) Brown ppt in yellow soln</p>
              <p>d) Green ppt in pale yellow soln</p>

              <p>The substance to be tested via paper chromatography need to be soluble in the solvent used (eg. water, ethanol, etc). Solids will not travel up the chromatograph paper.</p>
              <p>NaOH is limiting, and Fe3+(aq) is in excess. Hence, the product is a brown ppt of Fe(OH)3 in excess Fe3+(aq) which is a pale yellow solution.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, but by definition, when a solid dissolves in any solvent (not just water), it is no longer a solid!</p>
