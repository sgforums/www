              <p>Q1.</p>
              <p>Write half equations at electrodes :</p>
              <p>H+ reduced to H2 at cathode</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>H2O reduced to H2 at cathode.</p>
              <p>AND</p>
              <p>Cl- oxidized to Cl2 at anode.</p>
              <p>Write balanced redox equation. Apply stoichiometry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2.</p>
              <p>If both H+ and OH- (ie. H2O) is being removed from solution, then the molarity of the acid will increase, which means the pH will *decrease* (not increase!) as the electrolysis is being carried out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3.</p>
              <p>Correct answer is B, *not* A. Method A sucks (ie. lower yield) because some of the insoluble CaSO4 ppt coating the CaO reactant will prevent complete reaction. Method B is better (ie. higher yield) because both reactants (in the final step) are aqueous, and thus will not encounter the difficulty described in Method A.</p>

              <p><br>Originally, you have a beaker of sulfuric acid (aq) which contains free moving ions. so there's high conductivity.</p>
              <p>As barium hydroxide is added to the sulfuric acid, it forms barium sulfate. this process actually mean that ba2+,so42-  and h+ and oh- ions come together; free moving ion decreases, so there's a drop in conductivity.</p>

              <p><br>Q3. Since there is greater moles of tablet soln in the titration flask, you'll need to drip down a great moles (hence volume) of HCl from the burette to reach equivalence point (endpoint).</p>
              <p>Q4. Since Rb is a Grp I metal, and thus it's salts are soluble, hence you'll need to use titration to obtain the pure salt (without excess of acid or base, which would contaminate the salt).</p>
              <p>Q5. CuO is a black powder. Between ethanol and ethanoic acid, only ethanoic acid would react with the black powder of CuO to generate a blue-green solution of copper(II) ethanoate.</p>

              <p><br>Q1. CaCO3 reacts with HCl to generate CO2 and soluble CaCl2.</p>
              <p>CO3 2- + 2H+ --&gt; H2CO3 --&gt; CO2 + H2O</p>
              <p>BaSO4 remains insoluble and doesn't react with acids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. Copper is too unreactive to dissolve in acids (unless aqua regia "royal water" is used). Copper is more reactive than silver, and thus can be oxidized by Ag+ ions, to generate Cu2+(aq).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3. Because when both electrodes as well as the electrolyte ions are of the same metal, there will be no redox reaction occuring, hence no electrons flowing and therefore the bulb does not light up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When two metals are used (including the same electrolyte ions), the more reactive metal is eagerly oxidized (think "reactive metals means they like to be oxidized; unreactive metals means they like to be reduced" as a guide) and this metal electrode will be called the "anode", and electrons from the oxidation process eg. Fe ---&gt; Fe2+ + 2e- are sent hurtling through the external wire, through the lighted light bulb, and into the "cathode" where the electrolyte ions of the less reactive metal gratefully accept the electrons and are reduced eg. Cu2+ + 2e- ---&gt; Cu to form solid copper metal around the cathode metal (which ideally should also be copper).</p>

              <p>Red Cat riding (or punching / kissing / hugging / etc) An Ox means Reduction occurs at the Cathode, at the Anode Oxidation occurs.</p>

              <p>Q1. Ans is indeed A. Under standard conditions, oxygen exists as molecular dioxygen, so that's a molar mass of 32g, which means there are 0.5 moles of He and 0.5 moles of O2.</p>
              <p>Q2. Ans is indeed B. CuO is basic and will reduce the molarity of protons in the solution, which would decrease the rate of reaction between protons and Zn. Pressure doesn't affect rate of reaction unless one or both reactants are gaseous.</p>
              <p>Q3. The question is erroneous. It shouldn't be a weak "alkali", but a weak "base". The two terms mean slightly different things. Now that that's out of the way, the question setter intends the answer to be D because Pb2+ reacts with a low molarity of OH- ions to generate a white ppt of Pb(OH)2(s). In high molarity and/or with excess OH- ions, the Pb(OH)2 is reacted away to form the soluble complex ion : tetrahydroxoplumbate(II) ion [Pb(OH)4]2-(aq).</p>
              <p>Q4. Ans is Grp V, the element is nitrogen. However, 'O' level students would not be expected to be able to answer this question. At 'O' levels, when so many different oxidation states are possible, the element should be a transition metal. Some of the nitrogen-containing compounds with the various OSes are Mg3N2, NO, NO2, N2O, N2O3. N2O4, N2O5, HNO2, HNO3, etc.</p>
              <p>Q5. Ans is indeed A. Nuclear energy is hazardous, but does not generate as much CO2 as burning fossil fuels to generate electrical energy. Catalytic converters convert highly toxic CO to (relatively) non-toxic CO2, but indirectly contributing slightly to global warming.</p>

              <p>Q1. Because it involves the combustion of hydrocarbons (less stable = more energy) to generate carbon dioxide and water (both species more stable = less energy). How do you account for the difference in energy of the reactants vs the products? Where did the energy go to? T'was lost to the environment as heat.</p>
              <p>This is also the underlying reason why bond forming (the products with the bonds formed, are more stable, and accordingly have less energy, than the gaseous atoms reactants) is always exothermic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. Question is erroneous and/or lacks information (not to mention its unsuitable for O level). The question makes no mention of the relative molarities of all 4 species. Furthermore, the thiocyanate ligand is written erroneously as CNS-. The correct formula would be -SCN or SCN- (the negative formal charge is delocalized by resonance over both the S and N atoms). Assuming there are excess of the thiocyanate ligands, then adding Fe3+ would (as predicted by Le Chatelier's principle) shift the position of equilibrium over to the right, generating more of the blood red pentaaquo(thiocyanato-<em>N</em>)iron(III) complex ion.</p>
              <p>If you think the additional Cl- ions added can function as ligands to displace / substitute away the -SCN / SCN- ligands, leading to a visible colour change, that thinking is erroneous because to accomplish this, you need to add concentrated Cl- solution (eg. concentrated NaCl or HCl solution) without adding more Fe3+ ions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3. Calcium hydroxide is only partially soluble. Solid Ca(OH)2 is known as slaked lime, while aqueous Ca(OH)2 is known as limewater. CaSO4(s) is relatively insoluble. Method 2 results in a solid ppt that is mostly CaSO4(s), but which may contain some Ca(OH)2(s), as well as unreacted Ca(OH)2(aq) and H2SO4(aq) in the resultant colloidal mixture at the end of the titration . Consquently, when the salt generated is insoluble (and furthermore one of the reactants is only partially soluble), it will be difficult to accurately carry out a reliable titration that ensures both aqueous reactants (ie. the acid and base) are completely reacted.</p>
              <p>Method 1, on the other hand, involves first adding limiting HNO3(aq) to excess solid CaCO3(s), ensuring that the filtrate contains only Ca(NO3)2(aq), which will be able to, when mixed with H2SO4(aq), ionically precipitate out insoluble CaSO4(s) residue with a high yield, leaving the flitrate of soluble HNO3(aq).</p>

              <p>Q1. All options are false (but for O levels you can assume 25 deg C so option #1 can be chosen to be the answer, for an O level qn, but not for an A level qn.).</p>
              <p>#1. Acidic solns have pH less than 7 only for temperatures equals or exceeding 25 deg C.</p>
              <p>#2. The degree of dissociation and ionization depends on the strength of that particular acid.</p>
              <p>#3. Depends on whether the metal is reactive enough. Some metals eg. Ag and Pt, do not react with most acids. Only aqua regia is powerful enough to react with such metals.</p>
              <p>#4. Diprotic (the term dibasic is obsolete and should not be used) acids simply means the acid has two acidic protons that can be donated or abstracted by a base. The proticity of an acid (or base) has nothing to do with it's strength.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q2. All options are false. The only possible answer is option B) Barium chloride, for the possible redox reaction between Cl- and Fe3+. However, you can <a href="http://infinity.usanethosting.com/Tuition/StandardRedoxPotentials.gif">check the redox potentials for yourself</a> and see that the reaction is unfeasible at standard conditions (ie. equal molarities of Cl- and Fe3+, and at 25 deg C).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q3. Acids only dissociate their protons (H+ ions) in protic solvents, most famously, in water solvent. In non-polar aprotic solvents (such as methylbenzene), acids remain in their molecular (assuming they were molecular to begin with; there are acidic species which are ionic) form, and have no thermodynamic compulsion to dissociate their protons.</p>
              <p>In (the strongly polar) water solvent, the proton can be accepted by a water molecule to generate the hydroxonium ion, and both the hydroxonium ion and the conjugate base anion can enjoy the stabilizing effect of hydrogen bonding and/or ion-dipole interactions with the water solvent. The heat released during such hydrogen bonding and/or ion-dipole bond formation, will be sufficient to compensate for (heterolytically) cleaving the covalent bonds in the original acid molecule required to dissociate the proton.</p>
              <p>In the case of a non-polar, aprotic solvent such as methylbenzene, the (relatively) lower heat energy evolved during the formation of the (relatively) weaker ion - induced dipole interactions would not be able to sufficiently compensate for the energy absorbed in (heterolytically) cleaving the covalent bonds in the original acid molecule to dissociate the proton, and thus the protons do not dissociate.</p>
