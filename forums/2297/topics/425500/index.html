              <p>If you know you are weak in English, start working hard on it. </p>
              <p>The TYS is and always will be your best friend. Do not just read the essays by others, practise writing in their style and words as well.</p>

              <p>here are some tips..<br>- start reading more, it can be yahoo's news, straitstimes online, or even ur SS/History/Geog textbooks to improve in grammar. you may want to write down new words or phrases you have learned into a book or word documents in computer so that you won't forget them so easily..</p>
              <p>- start writing and try to speak proper English from now on..you must make sure not to make the same mistakes in your English compos.<br>"I'll be taking O levels this year, and I wanted to get into International Business in Diploma @ SP but the COP is 8. It is seemingly an impossible task to me as my R4 was 11 in this term, with a D7 in English. I'm very afraid that i'll fail my O levels because of my
                                      poor command of English. How can i prepare well for O levels?"</p>
              <p>- practise more paper 2 and learn how to rephrase words correctly, or techniques of answering</p>
              <p>- you should also consult your English teacher for english oral practices</p>
              <p>- for other Math/Sciences, TYS is extremely useful</p>

              <p>Although you cannot master English language in a few days time, you can actually improve on it.</p>
              <p>1. Speak up. English Oral exam is to help pull your grades up, so you should score at that area. There is TYS for oral communication, find your teacher for oral practices, especially the picture discussion, it requires some good vocab.</p>
              <p>2. Practice and practice. Use more vocabs in your composition. You should also write different types of composition, narrative, argumentative, descriptive etc and let your teacher grade them. She will then tell you which type you are strong in. Then start to work on that.</p>
              <p>I know of students who are good at narrative, then in  the end wrote something else just because the topic is easier, and yes, the did badly for the paper. 30 marks is a lot.</p>
              <p>Buck up on your summary writing skills, 25 marks is alot as well. Learn to identity key points and how to rephrase it. Always give ample time to do the summary. Again, many students neglect the summary as they spent too much time on the questions infront, hence doing badly. Remember, time is key!!!</p>
              <p>No short cut, you have to practice. Read more newspapers such as Straits Times, listen to English news.</p>
              <p>You have about 6 more months to O Levels, you can still do it and get a B3 and above, it is possible. <br><br>Your R4 with 11 is good, on average you have a few distinctions? Don't forget, some courses allows you to deduct 1 or 2 points from CCA, so it's possible.<br><br><strong>Stay motivated</strong> =D</p>

              <p><br>Dear swiftwind , seeing your predicament ,reminds me of what i am 16 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I felt English is a very difficult subject , Now i am a Tuition teacher in English language ,i realised that English language is still a subject in O level .The main focus is language proficiency.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tell yourself this question , How often you practises english with friend</p>
              <p>The 3 main potential area to improve and get more marks to get a pass or even A2</p>
              <p>is</p>
              <p>1.Inferential question - read more passage ,you do not need to do all to answer, but understand how is the passage structured</p>
              <p>2.Using your own words - replace words of expression , emotion , mood ,action to another equivalent .Look at the Thesaurus.Sleep with it if necessary</p>
              <p>3.Summary Question - Try practising summarising ,minus all the details like 3 months ago , a while ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For good English Assessment book on Paper 1 and Paper2</p>
              <p>there is a book by a Eng Literature teacher . from Marshall Cavendish Publication</p>
              <p>Basically this is the Ru Lai Buddha Palm Ninth level,the best i would recommend .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>English Composition you can buy those model essay</p>
              <p>dissect, scrutinised and question every phrase how the author writes</p>
              <p>and practise writing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grammar is sadly ,no hard and fast rule. you have to keep practising checking your essay before you submit the paper 1</p>
              <p> </p>
