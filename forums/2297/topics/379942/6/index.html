              <p>My take on the EL Paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paper 1 Compo: Did Question 3. Was not confident about it though since i wrote a narrative rather than a recount. The question was misleading. The question said 'Write about an occasion when an attempt to help led to unexpected consequences for the helper'. The last two words were quite misleading. Are we suppose to write a personal recount or a narrartive?</p>
              <p>Coincidentally, one school guessed the one word essay question on the dot. It was Bartley Sec. I looked at their prelim paper and i saw 'Power' as their one word essay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paper 1 Situational: I made the smart move to write a formal letter. My other classmates thought it was an informal but i think they were mislead. Honestly, the situational writing for this year was weird. I took it as a letter of invitation. My presentation in short is that i told the audience (ex-students) about the retirement of the school principal and the invitation to the event. By the way, i think that this question does not require the students to do a reject since it's NOT A PROPOSAL. Which organiser would want to tell the audience what happens during the thinking process of the event?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paper 2: It was quite managable. I think it was almost a breeze. But still, i don't feel confident about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a whole, i think i would be able to maintain my B3 for English.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck for Maths Paper 1 tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Correction: It's 1400hrs (2 pm) the paper start. Do please be advised to report at your respective exam venues 30 mins - 1 hour before start of paper. Do also note to bring all your mathmatical sets and your calculator (Remember to use the approved calculators by MOE). Most of all, please sleep well and enter the exam hall with a clear mind and not a nervous one since nervousness may cause a negative effect on your performance.</p>
