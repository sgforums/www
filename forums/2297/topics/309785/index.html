              <h1 class="clr">Singapore’s 4th public university will be medium—sized</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s fourth government—funded university will be a
              medium—sized institution, taking in not more than 3,000 students a
              year. For a start, it will take in about 500 students.</p>
              <p>Minister of State for Education, Rear Admiral Lui Tuck Yew, said this in Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Rear—Adm
              Lui also said that the new university will be independent of the
              existing ones in Singapore and could offer integrated courses centred
              on Design, Engineering and Business. Engineering students could be
              required to study design to make user—friendly products and learn how
              to market them by taking business modules.</p>
              <p>He said: "The new
              university could encourage this entrepreneurial spirit by offering
              students the flexibility to disrupt their studies for a year or two to
              start up their own businesses. Should they choose to, they can then
              come back to the university to complete their degrees."</p>
              <p>As for
              the proposed Liberal Arts College, the National University of Singapore
              (NUS) has submitted a proposal to establish a Liberal Arts College as a
              self—contained autonomous entity, similar to the Yong Siew Toh
              Conservatory or the NUS—Duke Graduate Medical School.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Management University (SMU) is also looking at offering a liberal arts education as it expands its programmes.</p>
              <p>Rear—Adm Lui said the government will study their proposals further before making its recommendation.</p>
              <p>Rear—Adm
              Lui said the calibre of the students admitted to the proposed Liberal
              Arts College will be comparable to the best in the American Ivy League
              universities.</p>
              <p>Professor Lily Kong, NUS vice—president (University
              &amp; Global Relations), said: "One of the key advantages of situating
              a Liberal Arts College within a larger entity is that it can leverage
              on the reputation and resources of a university....</p>
              <p>"NUS proper
              might be interested to offer a course in Russian history, and maybe
              five students are interested to do it. The Liberal Arts College is
              interested to do it and another five students are interested to do it.
              You may not offer it if you were two stand—alone institutions, but as
              one (institution), the 5 plus 5 could come together and have a very
              lively, small class."</p>
              <p>NUS agrees that the Liberal Arts College education will cost slightly more than current degree programmes offered in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Prof
              Kong explains: "A lot of liberal arts colleges will rely on various
              things, one of which would be higher fees. Two, would be endowment.
              That’s a very critical part of it. In Singapore, the government does a
              great deal, so hopefully through a combination of the three sources, we
              might be able to manage an affordable education."</p>
              <p>The government has not provided any details on when the new university will be built.</p>
              <p>With
              the new university, the government hopes to achieve its target of
              having enough university places for up to a third or 30% of each
              student cohort by 2015. This would require an additional 2,400
              university places per year.</p>
              <p>Meantime, the three universities will
              increase their student intakes so that from this year, a quarter of
              each cohort can enter university. That’s an increase from 23.5% in 2007.</p>
              <p>Out
              of the new 25% target, the Ministry of Education said that 19% were
              projected to come from A—Level students and 6% from polytechnic
              students.</p>
              <p>Rear—Adm Lui said that currently about one in six
              polytechnic graduates proceeds to one of the three public universities
              in Singapore. But he hopes this can improve to one in five. That works
              out to 14,700 places this year, with 900 more to be added next year. —

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The proposed fourth university will take in its first batch of students by 2011, said Senior Minister of State for Education Lui Tuck Yew, who chairs the committee on the expansion of the university sector in Singapore. <br><br>Mr Lui revealed on Saturday that after the recent Cabinet reshuffle, he is now also overseeing the polytechnics and institutes of technical education (ITEs). <br><br>Top students can soon look forward to a new choice of publicly funded university in 2011. <br><br>Mr Lui said his committee aims to submit its final report to the government by the third quarter of this year. <br><br>"We have the International Advisory Panel that is meeting in Singapore at the end of June. So we are putting together a draft report that we hope they will consider, and give us their inputs and suggestions, then we will submit to the government," he said. <br><br>With his promotion announced in the Cabinet reshuffle on 29 March, Mr Lui, who has been in charge of the teaching of the English language, will now also oversee the post-secondary sector, as well as the Private Education Bill which will be introduced later this year. <br><br>Mr Lui is meeting the principals of the various polytechnics and ITEs on Monday to hear their plans. <br><br>He said: "Our technical education and vocational education are really of very high standards. The institutions do a very good job in preparing students for the workplace. In terms of numbers, those who are able to find work within six months are well above the 90 percent mark, and that's discounting those who go on to further education. <br><br>"Starting salaries for polytechnic graduates are now about S$1,700 or S$1,800 for those who have served National Service. It's also gone up for the ITE students. That's one of the reasons why our students now see the polytechnic avenue and the junior college avenue on equal basis." <br><br>As for his new portfolio as Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts, Mr Lui said his immediate priority is to familiarise himself with key areas of work. <br><br>"The start is to make sure that I am at least familiar with all the major areas that MICA (Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts) is looking at. Minister Lee Boon Yang has asked me to try and make sure that I'm familiar with all the different areas that the ministry is looking at. He's already lost two very good doctors and he's gotten me – a rookie – in place of the two doctors," he said. <br><br>But there is no doubt Mr Lui will ease comfortably into his new posting at MICA. <br><br>He said: "All these are different but very exciting things that add colour not only to my life but also to my work!" <br></span></p>
