            <div class='col-md body'>Thailand    September 20, 2006 00:38 GMT<br><br>Thailand Remains Under Martial Law; Public Holiday Declared<br><br>Thailand's army leadership has declared a public holiday in<br>Thailand today as the country remains under martial law. All banks,<br>schools, government offices, the stock exchange and private offices<br>will be closed for business for at least one day.<br><br>As of 1600 local time, Bangkok continued to be quiet although there<br>has been a noticeable decline in commuter traffic. There have been<br>no reports of violence so far.<br><br>The Bangkok international airport and regional airports remain<br>fully operational and foreigners with scheduled flights out of the<br>country have proceeded with their departures without government<br>intervention.<br><br>The so-called Council of Administrative Reform, primarily composed<br>of top military generals who staged a military coup on the evening<br>of 19 September, now controls government and private media, which<br>have all stopped regular programming and are airing patriotic<br>programs.<br><br>Thailand remains under martial law, which effectively gives the<br>military broad powers to maintain law and order and implement<br>extraordinary security measures to prevent civil unrest or<br>violence.<br><br>At this stage, it is unclear if Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra<br>has conceded to the Council. There have been reports that he may<br>return to Bangkok from New York, however, these reports have not<br>been confirmed.<br><br>The Council has directed government ministers, universities heads,<br>heads of state agencies, and other civil servants to report to the<br>Council on 21 September.<br><br>On Tuesday evening, the Council, through army chief Lieutenant<br>General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, declared martial law, suspended<br>parliament and revoked the constitution. The Council also announced<br>that it has taken control of Bangkok and prohibited unauthorized<br>military troops movement.<br><br>A few hours before the announcement, tanks and troops massed at the<br>Government House, the complex where the prime minister's office is<br>located, indicating an apparent military coup attempt.<br><br>In reaction to the coup attempt, Shinawatra declared a state of<br>emergency and ordered against all troop movement around the<br>country. Shinawatra is currently in New York and was due to deliver<br>a speech at the United Nations when the coup attempt occurred.<br><br>SOS Comment<br><br>The latest measures announced by the Council appear to be<br>preventive measures against any backlash from Shinawatra's<br>supporters in politics and the armed services. These appear to be<br>measures to ensure that law and order is maintained.<br><br>Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been confronting speculation<br>of a possible coup since protest actions against him commenced in<br>January 2006. There has been widespread speculation that Thailand's<br>conservative military establish may intervene to end the country's<br>continuing political crisis. The likely aim of the military faction<br>that has declared martial law is to remove Shinawatra from office<br>and ensure a smooth transition of power. It is likely to<br>temporarily hand in power to Thailand's revered king until a new<br>prime minister is elected.<br><br>The current situation in Thailand is assessed to be an internal<br>issue and does not pose a direct threat to the security of<br>foreigners in Bangkok at this time. Previous military coups in<br>Thailand, while violent, did not adversely affect foreigners in<br>country. Extraordinary security measures in Bangkok and other major<br>cities are unlikely to focus on foreigners, although they may lead<br>to travel delays.<br><br>However, confrontations between pro- and anti-Shinawatra groups<br>cannot be ruled and may spark incidents of violence. These<br>confrontations may also occur in areas outside Bangkok. In the last<br>few months, Shinawatra installed a number of close associated to<br>key positions in the military and police and these elements may<br>attempt to defend him by all means. Groups with political<br>interests, including those operating in southern Thailand, may also<br>exploit the unpredictable political situation to further<br>destabilize the government. Violence is unlikely to target<br>foreigners, however, foreigners face the risk of being caught in<br>violent incidents.<br><br>The situation in Bangkok in the next 12 to 24 hours is likely to<br>remain quiet although it will remain politically tense. The martial<br>law declaration is likely to mitigate against the risk from protest<br>actions by supporters of Shinawatra in the next 12 hours. However,<br>the situation may change if the prime minister returns to Bangkok<br>as this may trigger protest actions by his supporters.<br><br>Travel Advice<br><br>All immediate travel to Thailand should be postponed for the next<br>24 hours or until the situation fully stabilizes.<br><br>International SOS Members currently in Thailand are advised to<br>stand fast in secure locations until a more thorough assessment of<br>the situation is made. Avoid local movement unless they are<br>absolutely essential in the next 12 to 24 hours.<br><br>International SOS Members seeking further advice or assistance<br>should contact the 24-hour Region Security Center in Singapore on<br>(65) 63387800.<br><br>sOo means those gg thailand cannot go liao lor?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
