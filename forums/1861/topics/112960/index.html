            <div class='col-md body'>This following forum is created to create public awareness abt this guy, Steven Lim. I think a new forum is needed to spread news all over abt his acts.Ppl who are new to him may think he is rather FUNNY, but after refering to past forums regarding him, I was horrified and think he is not the slightest funny<br><br>quote:<br><br>Quote:<br>I witnessed the most shocking thing that ever happened in every day life to<br>me, for a long long time.<br><br>I was walking at the underpass between Orchard MRT and CK Tang (you know the<br>one with the blind accordian player, you know him!) and when I came across<br>what I thought was the most attention grabbing marketing gimmick in a very<br>long time. There was a girl standing in the middle of the path with A4 print<br>outs on her back and on her forehead which had " <br>www.stevenlim.net" on it.<br><br>The girl was using a newspapers to cover her face too. Wow, I thought to<br>myself. This "Steven Lim" guy has a completely new "out of the box" method,<br>perhaps "artsy-fartsy"; approach to getting his website known! I mean, EVERY<br>SINGLE PERSON was literally stopping dead in their tracks to look from<br>either direction!<br><br>Excited, I quickly called my friend Elgin that I was supposed to meet at Far<br>East Plaza to come along to have a look. Before Elgin arrived, I found a<br>tall guy in his late 20s wearing a black sleeveless tight t-shirt hanging<br>around the side of the underpass, and I presumed him to be the "Marketing<br>minded Steven Lim". I told him that I was impressed by the idea and asked<br>him how he got it. He told me proudly that he thought about it himself.<br>However, I couldn't help but keep looking at the girl but feel that<br>something wasn't right. I also noticed that the girl had two girls on either<br>side of her who seemed to be encouraging her in a "don't worry, we're here<br>for you" kind of way.<br><br>"Who is that girl? Did you employ her? She's very brave! Where did you get<br>her from?"<br><br>Steven replied by saying that it was his girlfriend. The horror hit me when<br>when her friends came up to me and told me and Elgin that she was doing it<br>completely against her will. Steven has asked her to do it with funny<br>sunglasses and when she refused, he got angry. Apparently she loved him so<br>much that she didn't want him to be angry with her and so she'd rather bite<br>the bullet and cover her weeping eyes with the newspaper the whole time.<br><br>And what did this 28 year old hunkalot Steven do? He stood by the side and<br>soaked up the glory and attention that he got as a result of his 16 year old<br>girlfriend's humiliation. Angered, Elgin and I questioned him about his<br>"business practices" and his only defence were lines like "I'm paying her $5<br>an hour" and "Of course I got unhappy when she didn't want to do it for me,<br>it's only natural"! The whole time his poor girlfriend stood crying next to<br>us, and her friends started looking to us for reason and support.<br><br>Elgin and I went on to give him a half an hour lecture on how NOT to treat<br>his girlfriend and suggested other ideas to market himself without having to<br>resort to emotional blackmail. His final response was "Thanks for the<br>advice, but please visit my website. It's really good. Ask your friends to<br>visit it as well!"<br><br>I felt so bad that ANY girl had to live with loving such a person that I<br>ended up giving her a $300 watch loupe that I just happened to have on me. I<br>just felt so sorry for her, and even more than such guys existed.<br><br>During the half hour lecture, he also asked me to support him on Singaporean<br>Idol, let other people know about his website and how interesting all the<br>new stuff is, and how he thinks he'll succeed in life by doing things like<br>that.<br><br>God Bless his girlfriend, and all who stood with her.<br><br>http://pachome1.pacific.net.sg/~freestyle1279/sl.jpg<br><br>PS: I've attached a photo that I took of the "ad campaign" before I found<br>out the truth. I'd like to hear your views, but please let me know if<br>you're going to do anything drastic or public with this.<br><br>Check out the pic<br>http://pachome1.pacific.net.sg/~freestyle1279/sl.jpg<br><br>People...tell me your view..how can such thing happen.If any1 still thing he is gutsy and admirable...do think twice...this act is psychotic....it freaks me out so badly....and i think some also mentioned abt his public exposure acts....HOW CAN SUCH ACT BE PERFORMED??? explaination is needed....the public is not happy....authorities should take some actions against him...<br><br>In short, he is rather dangerous...lurking ard everyday hunting for preys. This is not a busy body forum created....but do spare a tot if he tries to talk to your sis or gf....moreover, some short sighted gals may be blinded by the fact tat a 'famous' guy is so frenly to talk to them..so i hope we can spread this msg  abt him to the whole of Singapore. Let him be real famous to every1 for the 1st and last time....warm the females around you!!</div>
