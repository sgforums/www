            <div class='col-md body'>Match Report for Jun 8th<br><br>Its back to Marina South for the Reds FC as they welcome back the student players. Its was a bright sunny morning but the lads showed worrying signs for Manager Robin. Midfielder Ah boon was rocketing the stationary ball cloud-ward from inside the penalty box. Striker Alvin Chia was bragging about his shot which hit the crossbar. Defender Ian was crossing balls which hardly left the ground. Including defender Kelvin, they were clearly less than match fit. Reds was missing several players for the match with, Jem, Jimmy, Robin Yap, Derrick, Lawrence, Patrick and Charles all out. Adding to the most serious selection crisis to date, prolific striker Khairul have decided to leave the Reds. To curbs the crisis, Manager Robin have again made shrewd signings of "Glenn" and "Rod" on loan to take on France.<br><br>Straight after the kick-off, France took the game to the Reds. Reds' defence and midfield was faltering as quick as the French team incessant attacks. Reds' towering Glenn was a key man in central defence, winning most of the battle against the french strikers. Cunning Jean Tiaga then instructed his players to play the ball short and use the flanks against Red's struggling wing-backs. The wise move lead to the goal as the cross from a french winger found unmarked zidane in the six-yard box for a brilliant half-volley. Man of the Match custodian Colin Goh got a finger to it, but wasnt enough to keep it out. 1-nil to France.<br><br>France was enjoying their possession as no.14 henry takes Red's left-back Ian for sprinting session at ease and Zidane conquering the midfield with Vieira. Reds had their chances with near misses from Alvin Ang and pot-shots from Russell which Barthez was equal to. Despite being hairier and darker, ref "Kumar" was doing a la Molina in the middle of the park. Staring straight back at the slightest pertulance from the fast tiring Reds. Half-time whistle came... and that's about the only thing the Reds would feel Molina has done right.<br><br>Before the 2nd half could start, a storm arrived. But that didnt detered the game to continue. The Red's lady supporters must have confirmed that women are smarter of the beings. The cool rain seemed to refresh the Reds as they began their 2nd half in a more effective made-in-Italy style by defending deeper with long ball played to counter France's short attacking play. Both sides had their chances.<br><br>At almost the hour mark, a twist in the game. A French attack brilliantly cut out by Skipper Robin had the ball landed with Glenn. The towering centre-back turned defensive midfielder ran with the ball, calmly looked through his options and picked up teammate "Rod" in a breathe-taking fashion. As the French defenders are admiring the quality of the pass, "Rod" ran the ball unmarked into the six-yard box with Barthez rushing out to meet him. "Rod" tried his luck with an unleashed shot at goal which the french defenders tried to clear in bizarre fashion. The ball went across the face of the empty goal untouched to greet on-rushing Russell. No prizes for guessing the outcome when a chance like this fall for the Red's leading scorer.<br><br>After the equaliser, Reds continued to defend stoutly with discipline. Reds beginning to look more confident and comfortable playing the Italian football. Little questions why AC Milan are Europe Champs as a Reds' long ball found an unmarked Alvin Ang who thundered a low stinger pass the right hand side of Barthez. The French stunned in misbelief. However they didnt took too long to recover as they are much fitter than the fast-tiring Reds. Thus, despite being in the driving seat, Manager Robin's shouting at his players could at one time be heard from almost every end of the reclaimed. Ah Boon was clearly showing tiredness as the unmarked player could only head the ball centimeters further on one occassion.<br><br>When your out-field players become soft, there's only one hope left... your keeper. Colin Goh displayed one of his finest performance for the reds. He was sure in claiming the crosses. Good anticipation in rushing out when his defenders lost to their markers and managing to reach the strikers with his goal-kicks. The France strikers became impatient with time running out. They were fast in losing ideas despite having much possession and were reduced to taking aimless long range shots which wouldnt trouble keeper Colin.<br><br>Final score Reds 2 France 1. France was made to pay for not taking their chances as Jean Tiaga could only shake his head in misbrief.<br><br>The post match "dressing room" atmosphere for the Reds still lacks harmony but on a more positive note, the unsettled business did finally came to light and is accepted by the team.<br><br></div>
