            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>Reaching one year is by no means an easy feat, as I've known teams that are formed and disbanded in just months.  It's good to see that we have come a long way and have really built a team which I see playing for many years to come.<br><br>One thing that really impresses me is that while we all have certain areas in our game which could be improved, each and every player has shown a similar willingness to play for the team and that is something you don't see in every team.<br><br>As a team, I think we have really progressed from our early days in Bukit Merah Sec Sch.  We have become more organised, especially our defence, although there could be some improvement to our attack.  This 4-2-3-1 formation has suited us in many areas, but I do intend for the team to switch back to a more conventional 4-4-2 formation sometime in the future (playing alone up there quite lonely lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>I don't think I will go into individual performance at this point of time, as I would really like to see what the other players have to say about the team.  Looking forward to see what you guys have to say...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Happy birthday to Reds FC!!!!!<br><br>I have played for several social teams in the past and none of them could come close to what this team has achieved.Its a nice feeling to know that each and every member of Reds FC has shown commitment and love for the team and the game as well.<br><br>Over the year,every single player recruited has not let the team down in any way and has contributed to the development and maturity of the team.The management consisting of Russell and Robin has done a tremendous job in organising games,thinking up of prep/post match talks and also getting the players together every Sunday.<br><br>After a year,we now know each others' strengths and weaknesses,style of play,mentality and attitude.Hopefully we can use this to our advantage in the many more matches to follow.<br><br>We must continue to adopt the right attitude for every match,play as a team and for each other.It doesn't matter if we are weaker than the opposition skillwise or in terms of match fitness.I believe that as long as we are united and determined,we can beat any team.....really i do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ya man....Happy Birthday Reds!!<br><br>The team was started based on friendship and here we are, one year later, still standing together as one.....with our friendship being stronger.   We have grown not only as a team but individually, I must say that many of us have grown in our very own ways too. Our understanding and acceptance for one another in the team has grown to be mutual and understood.<br><br>I have learnt much from all of you being a manager as well as an assistant manager.  The mentality of Reds is solid!! Very positive and always taking things in the right spirit.  Very difficult to find in many other teams.  Commitment and respect for the team is more than 100%. No one is taken for a ride in the team.  Importantly, our passion for the game is still burning hot!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Guys, keep up the good work.  We have got many years to go so play safe and remember to enjoy playing the game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Before I go, if anyone of you has anything that you wish to highlight about the team or about yourself, please always remember that you can always approach Russ or me to discuss about the issue.  Our doors are always open.  Currently, Robin and Kelvin are still studying.  If you guys have any difficulties in terms of forking out the weekly expenses for the game. Such matters can be sorted out easily.  Cheers.<br><br>Reds, many more good years ahead of us!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi guys, wld like to put up a suggestion..hope u pple can give me ur feedbacks..<br><br>i remembered visiting the websites of some of the other social teams and i recalled these teams having some sort of an annual awards thingy..<br><br>i thought it'll be nice if we can have 1 of our own since we are celebrating our very first b'day. we dun have to organise any function or anything but maybe what we can do is to vote for the winners for the different awards and put the names up on our website. if u guys want we can also chip in a little amt of money for some prizes or trophies. the trophies can then be passed on from winner to winner..<br><br>the different awards can be as follows:<br>1) top goalscorer of the year (which russ has clinched)<br>2) player of the year<br>3) most improved player<br>4) best defender (includes colin)<br>5) best midfielder<br>6) best forward<br>(other suggestions are welcome)<br><br>to ensure a fair choice of receipients, each team member will vote for each category and the management can collate the votes and announce the winners on the website..<br><br>juz tot this wld be a nice way to end off the past year and can be a form of incentive for players to perform each year..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </strong><br><br></div>
