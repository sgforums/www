            <div class='col-md body'>With recent inputs and suggestions from some of our players, I am considering tinkering with our team formation.  Apart from the 4-2-3-1 formation, others that may suit our team include 4-4-2 and 5-3-2 (or 3-2-3-2).  Obviously there are pros and cons for each formation, thus would like to hear some inputs from you guys...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the 5-3-2 could work out.... maybe can gradually try it out.<br>at least with a 2 man strike... it shd provide more attacking options.<br>i felt after we adopted the formation for the second half we played better generally... especially in the first 20 mins of the 2nd half...<br>HEADS UP REDS!! we will win our next match... i can feel it....!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really hope to see more inputs from our players as I am seriously considering a change in our formation.  I really am looking at different options so do chip in your views.  I do have to remind you that I am looking for a formation that will bring out the most in the entire team, not just your starting eleven!  Do give it some thought as I'll bring this up in the next match as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly belief that 5-3-2(wing backs) is a feasible evolution from our current formation but lets us not rush into this and gradually try it out especially during matches where the scoreline is to our favour or opponents aren't able to punish us...<br><br>AHLIANS vote for a 5-3-2 as it gives us more bite upfront as well as allowing our wing backs to express themselves(especially ian , pat and alfred!)<br><br>DEFENSE=== Hopefully with this... we can try to string more passes from the back... maybe keep possession(time wasting when we are up) or force the opponents to come at us then we can break. realistically speaking the only drawback for this formation unfortunately is that we seem a little short of cover in the centre back dept...<br><br>MIDFIELD==the 3 man mid can take turns to attack/defend so if 1 happens to be tired... can stay back to catch his breath at the same time provide cover for the back. Of course the mids can also drift to the wings(e.g. right).... then the whole team inclusive of the opposite wing back(leftback) can drift more to the centre....<br>this formation gives us 3 centre mid when we want to be compact in the midfield when defending and an additional 2 mid(wing backs) when we going forward. I admit it wld be asking alot of pat/ian &amp; alfred or whoever else takes up the role but i have never seen the 3 of them complain abt fatigue before.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>STRIKERS===upfront with 2 strikers.... we wld be able to cause more problems to the opponents be it from a counter attack from the back or a cross/long ball... at least the guy upfront is not so isolated as russ/ang/andy/boon/alvin chia/derrick etc. always seem to be.<br><br>The current formation seems to be restricting the 2 DM's(alvin jimmy alan etc.) and the 2 fullbacks(esp pat/ian/alfred/myself) from commiting forward too much although i understand that the primary role is essential in the 4-2-3-1 formation.<br><br>this is just my humble opinion... i am very happy with the current formation however i think it wld be gd if the team decides to explore other posibilities....Hope to hear from the rest of you guys as well!<br><br>cheers!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>p.s= congrats on the excellent result last week. really wish i were there but had to work!! sorry bros!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taking some of the inputs from our players, I decided to try out the 4-1-3-2 formation which seems to be working well.  Not that the formation is making us play better, but that we have so far been able to adapt to the formation quite well.  As I have said, what our players must take note is that the midfielders will be expected to control the midfield, with the DM role more focused in just holding up the midfield.  As we use this formation for more games, do provide your views and suggestions on it.</div>
