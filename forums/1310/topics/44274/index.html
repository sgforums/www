            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Guys, I guess I should have started this earlier but I hope it's not too late in any case.<br><br>Since Nov 2002, I have been the manager of Reds FC and it has been about 7-8 months now.  Along the way, I have done with the best of my abilities on what I felt was best for our team.<br><br>I dun think I have asked anyone of you this (not even Russ or Bara) but what do you guys think of me as a manager for the team? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>What are the things that you feel I should improve?  After yesterday's game, somehow I felt that I have been inadequate in managing the team. I also felt that there is a growing gap between the players and myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Bottomline; Tell me my weaknesses as a manager and maybe suggestions on how I can improve them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no doubts that Robin is doing a great job.  As stress b4, it's not easy to manage a social team where the players come from all walk of life and have different attitude towards the team.  Robin, just remember, respect is earn and authority is given.  I believe you have earn your basic respect from us but I don't think you've really make full use of your given authority.  Should be more firm on your comment during and after the game.<br><br>Hey, guys, let's put in the effort to build this team.  Self discipline and commitment are very important. Just base on Robin hard work doesn't work.<br><br>I'm a guilty party when talking about commitment.  Not too nice to comment on my own commitment.  I know there's something wrong with me and I will try to overcome my problem.  Will give my best to the REDS.<br><br>Can't spent too much time here.  Catch up with you guys soon.  Good luck for those taking their exams.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo brudder Robin.... its tough to be the Rock ..... opss. i mean, the manager. Esp, when we only got top scorer, sometimes man-of-match but .... manager of the month? its really a eat-strength-and-not-peach-good (translate from chinese...hehe) job....<br><br>Well, do take it easy at times when the team is down.... losing... conflicts. My personal view, ( in general... juz for reference) is dat there are surely times where the opp is clearly stronger than us. Thus when losing is inevitable, instead of screwing pple, we give then encouragement.<br><br>On criticism.... players makes mistakes. However, if player knows it... and show willingness it not commit again, punishment (scoldings shall best be pardoned) However some are bad habits... confirm have to be told. ( but then again sometimes bad habits die hard. thus... as a social team, in keeping bruddership, we can only pray dat 1 day he will realised it and correct it himself after being told-off.)<br><br>Its been a pleasure playing wif u as manager. Of cos.... it always takes time for a player to adapt to the style of a team. Thus i do haf to admit dat i werent too hapi whn i started out wif the team. But gradually, i got adapted to the team betta and been enjoying much more.<br><br>I guess its usu 2 things dat keeps players from the manager.<br>1: Pride; Every player who don the reds jersy will demand pride esp from the manager. thus when pride is shaken... esp by mgr, r'ship may be soured. Thus usu... mgr have to be rather diplomatic. Being authoritative may be tyrannic to others. (it tough to be the rock.... opps i did it again ..... )<br><br>2: Conflicting views/strategy: Always exist. there are always doubts. (god made us diff. so are our thoughts. upon agreeing, not all may agree totally) esp whn the team loses. Thus, haf be ready always to hear comments, take blames, control temper. ( its can get really frustrating whn pple dun c ur pt and u dun c other's pt)<br><br>so far so gd for us... but we shall all work to improve<br><br>WELL DONE BROTHER ROBIN !!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rob...its really not easy being a manager of a social team,on one hand you have to try to please everyone,on the other,you have to make decisions that may not be to the liking of some....so i urge you to con't to do what you think is best for the team on the whole.<br><br>So far in terms of committment,you have been excellent but i feel that there are times when you hold back on yr comments. As the manager,you have every right to give the team a roasting when we under-perform,its up to us to accept it graciously and work on our faults for the good of the team.I personally would appreciate criticism if i dun play up to expectations.Get down to what went wrong with each individual and point out what has to be done or expected in the next match when faced with defeat.<br><br>It all boils down to the aim and goals that the team has for the future,we were supposed to join a league but postponed the idea beacuse we came to a conclusion that we ain't ready for real competition,okay,reasonable enough,but i guess we have to start acting like we want to improve and gear up for the next league or something.Remember the opponents that kena screwed by their own when they failed to excecute one touch football,maybe not to that extent,but we have to start working along that line.<br><br>However,if our intention is just to get muddy on a Sunday morning,and maybe,just maybe find fun in that,then i guess our Manager's role would be redundant......he would be contented with saying:"although we lost,we did well to get a goal back after being five-nil down for almost the whole match"...........so what i'm trying to say to you Rob is ...... dun worry abt being harsh,just be really frank abt how you feel with the team's performance or any individual for that matter after every match.<br><br>Last but not least,you have a bunch of humans with different characters,temperaments and attitudes,and not little Luo Hans without any feelings,so its up to you to figure out the best solution to deal with different players in differing situations.Easy right?.Well not really!!!IDealing with people is one of the hardest things to master.<br><br>Nevertheless,i think Rob has done a reasonably good job and i urge the players to give their utmost support and respect to him so as to make life much easier for him.<br><br>THE END<br><br></div>
