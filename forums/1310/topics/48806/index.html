            <div class='col-md body'>had to start a new thread coz i can't reply the old 1.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>i won't comment on every player like in the previous thread coz by now i think we already have a general idea of each player's strengths and witnesses...i have a few general comments though...<br><br>i feel that the team need not get anymore guest players for games..that was why we decided to have a big squad in the first place, so that if a few players are injured or unable to come down for games we will still have enough players to field..wats the point of having a big squad if we still call down guest players? some players really need the playing time. take ang for example..give him more playing time and he begins scoring goals...i heard Reds is getting 2 more players perhaps as regulars and both of whom are centrebacks, i wonder if this is a wise move.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>people like alvin chua whom you consider as 1 of the less-fitter ones has proven that he can last a full half if u give him the chance..if a player is lacking in fitness and you only let him play less than half of the game, there's no way he can improve. which is why it wld be good to keep the squad small for each game. 14 i reckon would be a nice number...only when you cant even make 11 players then shld u turn to guest players..or juz call off the game...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have to agree with Khai on this one.Since we have already decided on our finalised numbers with the inclusion of Bernard,we should work on our current squad and give the available players more opportunity to prove themselves.Remember....more players means less playing time and i guess even though everyone is more or less okay with the rotations,it still breaks the momentum of players being sub out and it can lead to silent and built up frustration for some.<br><br>I know some players are out injured or are tied up with family commitments but they will return eventually and i foresee there might be a problem of overloading in the team then.Since we are still a social team playing friendlies,then i feel that we should give our current players more playing time by keeping the numbers controlled,its not as if we are short of players in each match.<br><br>Its a total different issue if lets say we were in a tournament.If that is the case,then we should have at least 17 to 18 players available for each match.But for now,our current strength is good enough for sunday morning friendlies and if we really have to recruit more players,then maybe a centre-back position or two,because the midfielders and strikers positions are very packed as it is and players already have limited playing time.<br><br>Just my point of view so would appreciate it if the management just give it some thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fullbacks - Alfred, Ian, Kelvin, Chester, Patrick<br><br>Centre Backs - Charles, Jeremy<br><br>Midfielders - Robin Goh, Bernard, Damien, Jimmy, Boon, Alvin Chua, Lawrence, Derrick<br><br>Strikers - Russell, Khairul, Alvin Ang, Robin Yap, Alvin Ang<br><br>If you look at the distribution of our players, it is hard not to see that we do not have a very balanced squad. We really need to get back-up for our centre backs. We either recruit or put one of our current players there. Robin has been doing a pretty good job there so he is an option.<br><br>As for the longer playing time, we can consider it for the fitter players. What I would suggest is to pair players who normally play in the same positions up, for example, Boon and me or Russell and Alvin Ang. We can then look at both players and determine whether they can both last half a game without compromising on standards. If the answer is yes, we should allow both players to play one half each for reasons already stated by Jeremy and khairul.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can see that we have an unbalanced team but hey, these are the 20 that we decided to put in the team so we have to stick with the 20..if we need backup for the centrebacks we can always get the midfielders or strikers as cover..Robin has done well there and i'm sure people like kelvin and alfred can do a decent job there. it might not be pretty but that's how a team learns and matures..we learn the hard way rather than take the easy way out and get 'star guest players' every time we are short in certain departments (no offence to anybody or their frenz)...<br><br>u need to remember that even though we get an extra defender, midfielders and strikers too will be indirectly affected in terms of playing time..<br><br>i've got nothing against the team recruiting 1 or 2  more regulars but surely some1 got to make way coz i dun think we can operate with more than 20 players for a social team..i dun mind staying out of the team to make way for another defender..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding tis issue abt getting new players, i think it may or may not be a wise move.<br>in actual fact , we do have many players in the team on paper though many arent able to come down regularly but we seem to be still doing quite fine for example robin does pretty well in the centre back position.<br>It is a actual fact that we lack cover in the centre back department.Therefore we may need some cover there, but I strongly feel that if a new player is to be recruited, he should really be a asset to the team, a much better player than for example robin playing at the back.<br>Apart from adding 1 player, don see the need for us in the near future to add any more players.<br>Anyway we recruiting tthe ang moh ah???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Boon, if you are asking about my friend, the answer is no. All I did is to let Robin and Russell know that he is available if we need a centre-back. Robin has been making it very clear to us that the guest players will remain as just that and we must make it known to them that they should not expect to be a permanent fixture. It is no different from the few times when Robin enquired about Ben's availability from Khairul.<br><br>Whether we recruit or not, it all depends on what kind of comfort level we want. We do have players in our team who can't take losing very well.<br><br>With that being said, like I've written in my earlier post, Robin, if he is willing, is a good option. With Charles back, I think we are reasonably covered. Having our own current players covering that position is of course the ideal situation.<br><br>Kudos must be given to both Robin and Russell for leading by example during the last game. Russell did not put himself in as a striker as he saw that we already have four strikers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Robin, my only concern here is that u make the right decisions which can be accepted by the whole team..make it known to the team in advance ur intentions to bring in new players or watever other actions u plan to take for that matter, so that any decision made will be a team decision...<br><br>at the moment, i think u already have a comfortable and great bunch of players to work with..moreover, the only person who is a bad loser and probably a negative influence has already left the team..so juz stick with ur current squad and bring out the best in them ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would agree with kai on diz issue.<br>Our current squad is pretty big already, hence i believe additional permanent players are not required. Or else, there will be too much compeition for places in the team.<br><br>So far, guest players dat appeared are generally due to small turn-outs for matches. (for example, "glenn and rod" were invited becos the turn-out was less than 14) Hence, current handling of guest players my management has been good!!!<br>Applause!! applause!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As highlighted during the last match debrief, I think Robin has been doing a fantastic job in handling guest players.  As Ian highlighted, they have only been called down when necessary.  Having said that, it is not a coincidence that we have always been calling down defenders as guest players.  What we can do with is an additional centre back who can lead our back line.  Obviously, the additional player will also need to commit to our team and accept the existing rotation policy.  While we are looking at some options, we have not asked anybody to join the team as yet.  Whoever is included in the team should be someone who will be an asset in the team in terms of skill and attitude.</div>
