And it also have been long long since I player soccer.  Think that's more than 3 months.  Tried playing couple of wks ago in Ubi but failed.  My ankle worsen instead.  Now, spend enough $$$ to rectify my problem and hope it really do.<br><br>I believe we have a brillant game yesterday.  If only all of us have the burning desire and attitude to win just like what Ang have demostrated, we will be a difficult  team to defeat.  Let's put in extra ince, don't need to be miles, in every next game and will be CHAMPION.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was good to see several of our players playing their hearts out last Sunday, searching for the win.  The desire to play and win was more evident than in recent matches.  Having once again let in 2 soft goals early in the match, we did really well to dominate the game and get 2 goals back. If not for the poor finishing of the strikers, we could have and should have won the match.  Colin really didn't have much to do!<br><br>Anyway, I hope we can use the last performance to get into the right momentum again and get more positive results.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been some time since our last victory and even if it was a friendly match, I must say the way we came back from a goal down to win the game makes the victory that much sweeter.  However, I must say that we should not have let in the 2nd goal, even if we were at the sloping end of the pitch.  Anyway, it was a good fight back and good effort from our players.  Considering the fact that several players were again playing out of position (Ang at centre-back!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  ) and in a new formation (3-5-2 for the benefit of those who were not there), I think our performance was commendable.  While I don't think our opponents were very strong, I feel we made them look poorer than they actually were.  Well done guys, let's try to build on this!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match comments....<br><br>after so many match de-briefs... some things nvr changed....<br>same problems been pointed out... bt... are those really the problems?<br>or is it becos every1 haf their own way of how the game shld be played that it is conflicting the flow of the game?<br><br>Problems cited are:<br><br>keeper nvr charge down the approaching striker?<br>centre backs too slow?<br>wing backs missing in action at defence?<br>wingers too wide?<br>centre mid missing ?<br>or<br>strikers lacking marks-manship?<br><br>compact the midfield? or play to the flanks?<br><br>Personally i feel dat our team is capable of gd football. most of us have footballing brains. The thing we need to approach every game is the real drive to win it! the desire to win! motivation and the spark to get every1's feet moving 5% faster and focus 5% more. And dat littke % may juz make a difference when the first goal is scored in our favour.<br><br>Basically we knw wat to do and knw wat is wrong.... but human makes mistakes. but finger pointings will take place whn we dun play up to expectations.<br>When we play well.... or win the game.... no complaints...<br>Comments will be: everyone played well.<br><br>i nvr minded construction comments... even if it criticizes my game...  however.... ambigious comments such as "the full backs are being "caught"..." doesnt help. Firstly... my name wasnt mentioned... secondly.. we were told to take it constructively... means.. to accept the comment.<br>Frankly.. has the situation been really analysed? or was it from dat angle only? why was the left back caught?<br><br>1) was it becos he simply refuse to chase the winger?<br>2) refuse to pass the ball and was tackled?<br>3) mis-passed the ball?<br>OR<br>4) is he was making an overlapping run and waiting for the return ball from a teammate or making a off the ball run to SUPPORT a TEAMMATE while ball is intercepted resulting a counter att by the opp?<br><br>i beleaf there's case to case... the centre mid.. doesnt only belong to the centre mid... likewise... the left and right wing doesnt only consist of the left and right back in defence only.<br>Soccer is a flexible game with changes taking place during the course of the game and datz y it interests pple.<br><br>I reccomend dat we practise some pysch-ing up of players before the game and if finger pointing need be... be specific. Bring out the situation and the player's name. point out the mistake individually Openly! Its a man's game....<br>mentally and physically shld be juz as tough. Cant solve the prob... well atleast we tried... the player may not be able to accept at 1st... bt he might tink abt it atleast.<br><br>But Covered problems are still problems and they can grow to become serious problems... so maybe the mgt can take a diff approach in diz....<br><br>I dun tink Fergie goes: hey full backs... wat were u doing?! he will bring out the names....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wasn't able to post a proper reply to the above feedback till now, as I really never had the time to do it.  Have to apologise for that.  It's good to see feedback from players and I only wish there'll be more.  You're not the first to highlight the need for more specifics during debriefs, which is something that I will try to change.  Having said that, it will not be possible to be specific in every observation.<br><br>What I just want to highlight is that when I ask players to take observations constructively, I am asking players to think about how what had been said may involve them and how they can change, if necessary.  If players don't even bother to think about how they have played or how to improve, then there's hardly any chance of any improvement at all!<br><br>I believe we all want to see the team improve in every aspect and I hope that all players will give their honest (and constructive) views on how the team can improve, both on and off the pitch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Match on 17th Oct was good, although we still have the occasional lapse of concentration leading to silly goals. Still, we won 4-3.<br><br>Overall, I like the way our play was compact. We challenge for the ball before the opponent touches the ball, before the opponent gets the ball under control, unlike our previous many losing games when we wait for the opponents to get the ball under control before we start INCHING towards them.<br><br>In any case, even if we lose this match, I will not be sad, probably disappointed at most. I still stand by my principle - if we lose playing good football, credit to the opponents; if we lose playing bad football, shame on ourselves.</div>
