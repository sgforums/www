            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys...<br><br>gotta say bernard was outstanding at rightback yesterday. he carried the ball out of defence well and started a few nice attacks. he brought our central midfielders into play, playing simple but intelligent passes to them. ian too, over the last few games, had improved tremendously in this area.<br><br>i think at the moment our greatest weakness still lies in our attacking third. now that we are playing with 1 sole striker, we should reduce those long pumps forward coz 1 against 4 defenders is too much to ask of any striker, especially since russ/ang are not pacy. they are on the other hand, good at holding up ball and so i feel it's better to play the ball to their feet so that they can bring the other forwards into play.<br><br>i wld also like to see the attacking mids fetch the ball more from the DMs instead of running away from the ball. this is where a lot of our moves break down.<br><br>on hindsight, i feel that we create more chances playing 4-4-2. ang especially, has good flick-ons and so it'll be good if he has a partner upfront. it has been mentioned before that with 4-4-2 our wingers are often isolated, so maybe we can try out a diamond midfield with 1 attacking centremid in front of a defensivemid and the right/left mids cutting inwards.<br><br>that's all i have...CHERIOS!!<br><br>something educational...<br><strong>http://coachmarino.com/Coaches/Chalktalk/442/4-4-2-3.htm</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Khairul's suggestions are worth considering seeing that the current formation seems to be expecting too much from Russell and Ang.<br><br>Apart from that, I have also made several other obeservations. Firstly, the AMCs are not holding the ball long enough for the formation to be effective. More often than not, when the pass was made, we do not have enough players up front.<br><br>Secondly, our AMRs and AMLs are playing too wide. We must bear in mind that there is only one striker up front to receive the cross. The AMs should play a tighter game, switching positions if required.<br><br>Thirdly, our finishing have been quite poor of late. We have won games because our opponents failed to finish off their numerous chances and the same goes for us too.<br><br>Lastly, the formation requires us to be compact both defensively and offensively. The AMs need to come down during defensive periods and likewise, the defenders need to push up during offensive periods. Failure to do either will only leave huge gaps on the field.<br><br>All things considered, the current formation may be too demanding for our skill level, experience and players rapport/understanding.<br><br>However, I do also notice some good improvements in the team and players. Some of our players are getting fitter by the match. Off the ball running have also improved and we can see more players supporting each other.<br><br>It takes time for a team like us to gel, especially when we only play together once a week.<br><br>Despite our poor results recently, I still look forward to every sunday and the week will only be complete after the game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good observations from both Khairul and Alvin.  I myself feel that there our attack is not performing to our potential.  If time permits this Sunday, I would like to speak to all the attacking midfielders and strikers on this issue.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>i think the problem with 4-2-3-1 is that it takes away the sting in our attacks since we deploy more players defensively. perhaps we shld start with 4-4-2 instead and then revert to 4-2-3-1 when we already have a comfortable lead. it's relatively easier to attack, score and then defend the lead rather than to play defensively, concede goals and then try to catch up. this is what has been happening in the last few games.</div>

Evening matches are almost impossible for me since I have to be at my parents' place for dinner on Sunday nights. On the second week, I was on MC for a wisdom tooth extraction *ouch*, then I got a viral fever the following Sunday courtesy of the wisdom tooth wound getting infected.<br><br>Good news is that I am up and dandy, raring to go for our next match!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Once again, I think we gave a good account of ourselves in yesterday's match and were unfortunate not to finish the game victorious.  We were very compact and there was more passes playd between our attacking players, creating some good chances.  We definitely were the more organised team and created the better chances.  I guess the ref's bad call for the first goal went against us as well.  However, as long as we can produce performances like yesterday's, we will be winning many matches in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Looking forward to the next match....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking at the last match.... well i've got something to share with u guys.<br>Those guys that found me rather slow and subdued in the last match, they were rite.... i felt so too.<br><br>I couldnt bring my heavy legs to run. I've realised this is due to the 3hrs of non-stop street soccer i had on saturaday b4 the match.<br><br>Hence, the experience i wana share wif u guys is dat not to do too strenuous exercises before the match-day if u do not exercise regularly. Match performance will most likely be affected.<br><br>datz all from me.....<br><br>regards.<br><br></div>

Nevertheless, will strive to make it on time.<br><br>Ang's eye for goal is excellent! Keep it up man!<br>Would like to highlight Russell's contribution to game as well. He made up for his missed chances with excellent cover in defending when the team was eager to push up for the equaliser and winning goal. Took up more of the player-maker role instead of trying aimlessly for goal. Pragmatic footballing sense i would say. Thumbs up for that.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>apart from the several skirmishes between both sets of players which sort of disrupted the spirit of the game, i thought overall it was an enjoyable game.<br><br>ang deserves a pat on the back for his all-round contribution. was unlucky not to have added to his goal tally.<br><br>juz want to highlight that even with our recent disappointing run (1W, 4D, 5L in the last 10 games), i don't think we are playing badly at all. felt we were unlucky on several occasions..or maybe jem juz needs to get a new pair of slippers..<br><br>on a more positive note, a few of our players are finally displaying their true potential. robin "sublime" yap especially has been excellent of late and it's been a joy playing alongside him. bara is the other one worth mentioning.<br><br>hope we can get a win next wk before the fasting month starts for me. wld be more than happy with a mere 1-0 scoreline..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good to see some of you guys in here again... Ian, the score was 1-1.<br><br>I think it is very obvious that we have actually improved as a team, although our recent results indicate otherwise.  Not to make excuses, but I believe we have been facing generally good opponents in most of the past 10 games... less Ah God's team, which was a joke of a match anyway...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The spirit of the team has been fantastic and it says a lot when such levels of morale can be kept even though we've often not been getting the results we deserve.  It really does make it all the more enjoyable to play in this team...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, I'm sure we're all looking forward to the next game to put things back on right track again, but there'll be no comments on corner turnings  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ....<br><br>By the way, with my exams just round the corner, Robin will be handling all matters for the match this Sunday...

            <div class='col-md body'>Old McDonald had a new monitor.....eeee ya eeee ya ooooooo!!!!!<br>I'm back and so will the match reports!!!!yay!!!!<br><br>Juz wanted to say that our fighting spirit has been improving,much to the extent of us caring more on pushing forward and scoring,thus compromising possession and control of the game.I am guilty of that too,coz there were times when i pushed to0 far up and also refused to pass in front of goal,and released Barbie type shots.<br><br>However.wif Richard settling comfortably in defence,Ian and Kelvin being on top of their game,the defence seems to be getting back their bite after losing Charlie for awhile now.<br><br>I can sense victory coming very soon with this kind of attitude and urgency that we have cultivated and adopted,and it won't be about luck,it won't be about my pink slippers,it would just be about Reds FC playing together as a team,and earning the hard fought victory.</div>
