            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with robin with the instances he referred.<br>On this issue, i believe this is due to the fittness. several factors mentioned such as waiting for ball etc... i guess its due to the fittness and confidence of the players. when a player is sure of his fittness, he will be more aggressive, knowing he win be able to win the ball. thus will not hesitate to get to the ball first. players like robin and jeremy usu displays dat.<br><br>however when a player is concerned abt gettin injured in the process of challenging for the ball, "waitng" situations will arise when hesitating.<br>i guess its abt building up fittess....<br><br>abt communication...<br>well i guess its confidence. with confidence in ursf in the game, u will be able to focus in the game even when u dun play well. u will know dat u can still contribute to the team even if u made earlier mistakes.... with the confidence, u will still shout to ur teammates to alert them of opposition closing down on them or even asking them to let go when u are gg for the ball.<br><br></div>

Often, we will play to the pace and momentum of the game. If a pass is short, it may not be that we do not have the initiative to go for the ball but just a case of not expecting it. The quality of passes must be improved also. That is the real root of the problem and we should concentrate on solving that.<br><br>As for the new formation which we tried during the second half, I have two observations. Firstly, Ang was playing too deep. He should operate like an out and out striker and there is no need for him to come down to get the ball as that is Russell's job. Secondly, Russell too was not playing exactly to his role. He is too defensive minded. On hindsight, Boon may be a better option.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i did not want to share this wif u guys initially coz it's kind of demoralising but i guess i'll do it anyway since it's for our own good.<br><br>somewhere in the second half, the referee came up to me and mentioned a couple of things to me. he somewhat agreed that we are playing too many long balls and moreover, he also mentioned that many of us can't even pass the ball properly. deep inside me, i got to say i have to agree with him.<br><br>like ian mentioned in the other thread, our game plan is as simple as this : 1) work very hard to win the ball when we don't have possession; and 2) play direct 50-50 balls to our strikers once we have gained possession. we totally have no patience in our build-ups (if i can even call it that) and this is largely the reason why we lose possession of the ball almost as soon as we won it, not giving the opportunity for our players, our defence especially, to regroup and push up.<br><br>although i tend to agree with robin on the issue of players waiting for the ball to come to their feet, i also think that part of the problem once again lies with the fact that a lot of our "passes" are played in the air. for passes played on the ground we can run and meet the ball, but if passes are played high??<br><br>robin is also spot on about the formation thingy. formations only look nice on paper but what's more important is how we play it on the field itself. if we want to play the 4-5-1 formation with a sole striker upfront, i suggest that the sole striker must be one who can hold up the ball well and who is more of a "box player". ang and russ shld rotate for this position simply becoz of their physique and playing style. russ is not suitable to play behind the main striker.<br><br>robin, the last few games russ for some reason has been playing more of a midfield role. i suggest we keep him upfront. if it's the overload of strikers that is an issue, i'd like to revert back to centremid coz i want to try to get the team's passing game going. i realise i'm definitely not the best player around but i really wld like to have a go. i did try to string a few passes in the last game and i was happy to see that a few of the players were responding. we did manage a few shots at goal.<br><br>btw bara, any feedback from ur 1819 lads that u can share with us?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I did ask them and most of the comments were on how organised we are. Generally, we received very favourable comments for our defensive plays.<br><br>Offensively, one of their comments was that we failed to capitalise from the fact that their last man(the shortie) is new to the position and he does not play the off-side trap. We should have gotten our tall strikers to position themselves nearer to their back line and play the high balls into the box.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Match on 6 July 2003</span></strong><br><br>Even though we won, I felt that the scoreline did not reflect the full potential of our team. With yesterday's team, we actually had difficulties in sealing the victory early. We have to reflect on that and think about what we could have done better for games like these.<br><br>On top of that, I would like to commend Alvin Chia (as a left mid) and Robin Yap for playing well during yesterday's game.  For the 4-4-2 formation, I hope to see an improvement in the wing play and crosses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The match at Khatib has been one of our best team performance in quite a while.  Our tactical discipline was superb as everybody performed their primary role very well.  This is the best way to bounce back from the previous game.  Good job guys!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I'll leave it to Jem to provide the match summary, I just want to highlight a few things.  First and foremost, we lost to a very organised team (on and off the field) who have been playing together for 4 years.  As a team, they played better than us and are in fact currently top of the competitive league they're competing in.  I must also highlight that we did not play all that badly and maybe didn't deserve such a scoreline.  There are other things regarding our play which I will try to highlight before the next match.  Personally, I am looking forward to erase the memory of the last match this Sunday...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apart from the things that were mentioned during the match debrief, I just want to highlight that our work rate for the last match was commendable.  I think we played very well as a team and maybe deserved more than a draw.  Nevertheless, good job guys!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, much have been said during the match debrief.  I personally believe that this was mainly due to the fustration of yet another defeat, thus I must highlight to everyone again that we did lose to a better team.  On a personal note, I have to say that I could see that everybody was trying their best.  Thus I may not like the result, but I think our individual performances was alright.  Let's get back to winning ways next Sunday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday's match was a really good team performance yet again.  We set the pace of the game, played to our strengths and supported each other quite well.  Due to that, we were winning balls in the midfield and had some quite impressive build-ups.  I must also add that the credit for our victory really goes to every player from the keeper to the attackers.  As I had mentioned during the debrief, we did not beat a poor team yesterday.  Such performances always make me look forward to the next game!  Well done guys!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although we lost the match last night, I personally think that it was actually another good team performance by us.  I really feel that the scoreline did not reflect how close the game was.  On another day, we definitely could have taken them on.  Although the team slowed down at times during the match, I can see that everybody was putting in a lot of effort.  As long as we continuously play for each other and try our best, victories will keep coming.  See you guys next week.</div>
