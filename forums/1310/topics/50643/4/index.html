            <div class='col-md body'>It could be seen that everybody gave their all in the match yesterday and that's the kind of spirit the team will thrive on.  We played well against a very physical team and got a good result.  As I mentioned during the debrief, we did not really make good use of the space given to us in the first half, but that improved in the 2nd half as the whole team started to string passes together.  Got to give it to the defence again as the game was won as much by the defence as the attack.  As always, such performances make me look forward to the next game...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frustrations and outbursts on the field are simply part and parcel of the game. i guess it's inevitable when u hv 11 individuals with differing views and opinions trying to operate as a unit.<br><br>i myself had my fair share of outbursts in the past but what i learnt from those incidents is that losing your temper doesn't do any good to your game.. and in the heat of the moment u say things that u dun mean which u will regret later.<br><br>as such, going into reds' second season, my new season resolution is to keep my temperament in check (with my own team mates as well as the opponents) and try to be a useful player to the team.<br><br>wateva happened last sunday, i hope both parties can put that behind them coz they are important players to the team.  conflicts are ever present in any team but a good team sticks together no matter wat. probably the reason why i decided to come back...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, although we allowed our opponents to draw level with us at 2-2, I think we had a superb game.  With practically no reserves, we managed to last the whole game at quite a consistent level.  Considering this is still the CNY and HRH period, that is pretty good.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I also want to highlight that Richard had an awsome game on Sunday!  His positioning and reading of the game was superb.<br><br>Well done guys, looking forward to the next match... but I better try to run during the week... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
