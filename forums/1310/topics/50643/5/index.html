I enjoyed myself on Sun but definitely need to catch up on my fitness.  Sori I had to leave earlier cos' of work.  Have been pretty much occupied and busy with work. Hope you guys understand.<br><br>In any case, my observation was that our team seems to be geling up pretty well in terms of passes and positioning.  Robin Yap seem to have improved greatly on his fitness making endless runs, beating the defenders most of the time.  Reading by our defenders have improved too. I agree with Russ, I think Richard had a awesome game. Well done!!Keep it up.<br><br>I am on day shift this Sun so I'm out once and again. Enjoy the game. Cheers.  </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to recap on yesterday's match, I think everybody gave a good overall performance.  While we started quite sluggishly, we did pick ourselves up and play with the aggression and commitment we are very capable of.  As I mentioned, while we gave a good performance, we did not take advantage of the extra man on the field, which is something we should all think about.<br><br>One area in which we definitely need to improve on is our running off the ball and positioning.  We have got to try to run into space to support each other, give options and make things easy for ourselves.  While we have really improved as a team throughout our first year together, this area can really bring our teamplay to another level!<br><br>If you guys have any comments, do feel free to bring them up.  I'm glad we are able to give Richard a victory in what is most likely his last game with us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeh... gotta agree with Russ quite abit here. Off the ball runnings and running into spaces are very impt. Its allows our team to play a neat and effective passing game.<br><br>By running into space and calling for the ball, we reduces the chances of the player with the ball in trying to dribble past their markers and losing the ball.<br><br>And its really great we won the last match for Richard and for ourselves!

            <div class='col-md body'>Was sluggish, but the win was all that matters <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, since Richard was out, we may be lacking a center back. Lady Luck seemed to be on our side as I visited our club pub on Wednesday and bumped into an Englishman named Paul from Darlington, and he plays center back in England! Sorta sounded him out and he is pretty interested to link up with us. He will be at the pub this Friday 13th Feb, so come down if you wanna meet him. He is a little shorter than Richard, but he is a pretty stout man, playing scrum in his rugby team ...<br><br>So an English center back went home, and another arrived to replace him :p Nice!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though we lost 4-1, i think there was a vast improvement in terms of overall performance in the 2nd half. We prevented our opponents from scoring and managed a goal ourselves.<br><br>Think credit must go to Alvin Ang for his performance as an outfield player AND as the team assistant manager. In the absence of Russell and Robin, he got the team into shape after a horrific 1st half and also got on the scoresheet himself.<br><br>Hope the attendance for future matches would be better in the weeks to come. Good luck to all Red's players who are busy with exams, shift-work or quota-hitting, really hope your schedule allows you guys to come for sunday games. Cheers Red's...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your compliments Yap.<br><br>Have to agree that our 1st half is a nightmare where we let in four goals in the space of 25mins or so. We were too eager to attack during the 1st half and as a result, we allow the opponents too much space when they are on their offensive.<br><br>Despite the scoreline,  we have a tremendous 2nd half and I think we played very good football which we are definitely capable of.<br>From my personal point of view from yesterday's match, I think we have matured in playing as a team where we can forgo the scoreline in the second half and recomposed ourselves to play the game. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned during the debrief, I think there can be no doubt that we actually had a very good game.  The commitment, passing, finishing was superb as everybody gave their all.  Unfortunately we were not able to finish the game victorioius and what makes it more painful is that we were ahead for most of the game.  Regardless of the result of this game, I think we can be very happy with our performance and I can't wait to play our next game!<br><br>On a not so happy note, I have noticed that the punctuality of our players have again begun to slack recently.  For the last game most of our players came way after the scheduled time to be there (half hour before kick-off) and some even came after kick-off.  I am not pointing fingers and can understand that you might have had justifiable reasons for the last match, but am just highlighting once again that the basic respect for the team and players should be given.  Those perpetual late-comers know who you are and I hope that some effort can be put in on this matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been a long time since we've played a game like that.  Fantastic performance by our players, the intensity and desire was first class.  It is really good to see such a team performance, especially after recent results.  We have got to make sure we can keep up this momemtum.  The only point I will need to highlight is that we will need more variation with free-kicks.  Will touch on this before the next match.  Once again, such a performance makes me look forward to the next game!  See you guys this Sunday.</div>
