            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, I think we all know that we lost to a team that we shouldn't have and that the scoreline did not reflect how tight the match was.  Much was said during the debrief, but I have to remind all of you of the cliche that "the league is a marathon, not a sprint".  The first result will not make our season and neither will the second.  As I've said before, as long as we keep the intensity we had in the first match, we will do alright.<br><br>All I can say is that I wanna put things right this Sunday....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at our opponents yesterday, our team play was not as good as it should have been as we should have won by a much bigger margin and in a more comfortable manner.  We started the game very slowly, with some players looking complacent and only seemed to wake up after we conceded a goal.  Nevertheless, we managed to grind out a result (though with a bit of help from their keeper...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and gain 3 more points!  Considering that we started with a makeshift line-up, I think we did pretty well.  Once again, we could see our players giving their all, which always sets the team in the mood for the game.  Well done guys!<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned during debrief, we started the match very poorly and ended up going 3 goals down.  However, we managed to pick ourselves up later in the game and managed to get back into the game with 2 goals.  Although we were not able to snatch the draw, the way we recovered was commendable.  As I said, if we were to lose a match, this is the way I'd rather lose them.  One of the more enjoyable defeats I've experienced!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, the last game was played with much organisation and composure.  In my opinion, we outplayed the opponents in most departments and should have won by a larger margin.  This is saying a lot as indivually, our opponents were not bad ball players!  Most importantly, we managed to get the 3 points which will see us climb up the table again.  Well done guys!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As we have committed to the league, we have to keep playing games every week, else we will lag behind in games played.  The organisers are currently stressing this to the teams.  However, whenever we are not playing any match, we will definitely try to arrange kickabouts for those who are keen.  I am glad to say that the turnout for such kickabouts have been quite good, which displays the eagerness of our guys to play soccer every week!</div>
