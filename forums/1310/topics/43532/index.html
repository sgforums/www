            <div class='col-md body'>robin, the braddell-westlake sec sch field is actually quite a good pitch on a normal day..it's juz unfortunate that the 1 time we played there was during the rainy season..definitely much better than marina or woodsville...<br><br>but 1 field i wld definitely want to recommend is dunearn sec..excellent pitch with good toilet facilities juz beside the field..but a bit far though, in bt batok...<br><br>maybe can check with your lobang ref if can get these fields..worth the money...</div>
