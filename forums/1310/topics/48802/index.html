            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys...juz thought i wld like to bring this matter up..from an outsider's point of view...<br><br>i think it has been said time and again about how Reds has grown as a team in terms of size, maturity, organisation, blah..blah..blah... of course Reds is still far from being a good team as there are still a lot of shortfalls and definitely lots of room for improvement, but at the same time gone were the days where Reds will get thrashed<br>5-0 week in week out..<br><br>with this in mind, is the team then ready to take part in tournaments and leagues?? the last time Reds had this discussion it was decided that the team was not ready..to be honest there are other teams out there that are not as organised nor as big in size as Reds but are still brave enough to take up the challenge...<br><br>So wat if you get thrashed in the tournament?? so wat if you are not good enough?? i always believe that you are not playing in tournaments becoz you are good but rather you are good becoz u played in tournaments and gain exposure..some of the players in the team are already in their late 20s, some already hitting the dreaded 30s...you can play social friendlies anytime, even when you are already in your 30s but to play competitively it helps if you play it while u are still young!!<br><br>pardon me for bringing this matter up again coz i noe that some, if not most, of the players are dying for some competitive action..wldn't it be a shame if all our efforts to put this team together are wasted juz on friendlies all year round?<br><br>i really hope people like boon, jem, chia, ian, bernard and the rest do give your sincere views on this coz it's no point agreeing to watever the managers decide yet you feel otherwise...at the end of the day we want to have fun playing and if you feel that playing in competitions is a lot more fun than mere friendlies, then do speak up...afterall, you can still play in a tournament during certain part of the year and for the rest of the year you can still have your friendlies...<br><br>Chao!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me i would love to take part in a competitive tournment.Few reasons<br>-More exciting, chance to win back some prize money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">??<br>- Quality oppenents, we may or may not get thrashed.When we get thrashed , it is a good learning process. There is not much achievement in winning 5-6 goals against much inferior oppenents.<br>-Frankly we am not getting young too, fitness is going downhill by the years, better to take advantage of our fitness now.<br>-Less stress on the manager to fix matches, we can still play our social soccer if there is no competitive matches.<br><br>i cannot remember all the reasons cited the last time for our refusal to take part, but i think the rolling sub was mentioned.<br>is money a problem??This rollng sub problem if considered to be a problem should be brought up to all the team members as we still need to tackle tis problem sooner or later if we are going to take part in a tournment.<br>regarding the issue whether we are ready as a soccer team.A social soccer team like ours have reach a stage where improvement in standard is not going to come easy.As we have neither coaching nor training sessions.Dont think we can make much headway with our standard  even in a year's time.And the fact  that all of us have been playing soccer for a pretty long time , at our age now improving ourself individually is not going to be tat easy for us.<br><br>So if there is any tournment ,i would strongly urge the team to participate.It is never easy to satisfy everyone or get everyone agreement, so the next best thing is to follow the majority. If the decision make is a bad one in the end, the majority is to be blame.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess there's lots of enthusiasm to join the league....<br>frankly, i was one of those who opposed to the league thingie during the last meeting.... from the earlier threads, i realised some have forgotten the reason dat we decided not to join....<br>here are some of the reasons back then and some of my own:<br><br>1: The younger players are facing exams back then and not sure if the dates of games will clash wif the exam dates + after we start working, some of us may be required to work on weekends sometimes and may not be able to play every sunday. uncertainty here will create disruptions in team selection for the fixtures<br><br>2: Some believe we are not gd enuff yet. ( me included, not becos i tink we will get thrashed, but we need more friendly games to build up to match fittness. Most players including the student players are not match fit enough to finish a game. Rowing subs was unsure.<br><br>3: for me: for those who are closer to me will knw dat i'm a basketball turned soccer player. i feel dat there's much room for improvement for my abilities and hence a less competitive environment can let me build up easier, as losing tuff competitive will make players lose morale more easily and give up as well. i tot of giving mysf 1 yr to brush up my basic skills to meet up the challenge.<br><br>4: not all players are hitting their peak. not all are happy wif their contribution. and not all welcome the stress at the competitive level. they prefer to play sunday soccer leisurely.<br><br>5: some of the players cant take defeat well. we are winning games now, so we can safely say the atmosphere is pretty gd. however whn we start losing games... fingers will be pointing ( naturally), conflicts will raise, friendship will sour.... these are human nature and every individual is different.<br><br>6: personally, u guys may feel dat i tink too much.... but .... look; the mgt did so much to put diz team 2gether. website, jersy, etc....<br>however, joining a league.... will hurt morale if we lose. nobody likes to lose. and feel pple will look at themselves. to be frank, its quite obvious dat some players are able to contribute more to the team than others. its quite impossible to keep up wif some of them. for (example, being a defender, i cant be as steady as charles or jem. my lack of dat will be punished by stronger opposition.) if they do, and feel dat they are responsible for the defeats, then they will lose confidence.... and hence with the frustration, will start to walk out of the team. friendship will sour, new players will be needed.... and soon, it will become a social team no more. the players in the team are young adults, not youngers like 18+, they wont be able to take much criticism whn they dun do well in a match. most of us hold much pride and have our individual way of thinking how soccer shld be played, such things will surface strongly whn the team becomes a team dat wants to win.<br><br>joining compeition will add make 1 wana work harder to win. inj will be more common. cramps, strained and sprain....  and imagine some of our players are big earners... they will wish less dat they get inj over soccer which may = less bucks earned.<br><br>a team dat wants to win... will very much differ from a team dat wants everyone to be hapi. we can say, we take defeat positively, but its always easier said than done. for eg, if we lose a match, shld we juz say... "ok we lost to a stronger opponent."? or we say... "midfield totally empty! wher was the defensive cover? why the defence playing wif the ball? ---the former will be too soft, but  the later will most likely result in a rebuke, or kick off a finger pointing session.<br><br>guys i'm not trying to be a spoiler here.... juz wana let u guys see it in a diff perspective. every individual is diff, and the reason they are in diz team may be different as well. the mgt haf a headache to manage cohesivemess and competitiveness... i guess we shld be patient and accept the overall team's opinion, hence i believe the final decision does not lies with the mgt only.<br><br>when i first join the team, i was excited to achieve great things with the team, however, diz has landed me in frustrations. tdy, i've change my view.... i juz wana enjoy soccer wif the team.... and i've blended in much betta. if u ask me wat kind of team shld join the competition.... then i would say..... 1) a team dat has everybody understanding their own abilities and respecting each other and the mgt decision or comments totally! ( sounds impossible rite?)  2) players in the team can match another's ability more or less. (not possible for our team as well--- will result in finger pointing when we lose rite?) - unless we haf a non-playing reputated coach or manager....<br><br>Final decision: well, i'm not trying to sound contradicting here, i'm juz stating some facts.... we are all humans. we have character flaws. hence... we shld only join if all the players in the team agrees to it and not just the majority. i hope u guys understand wat i mean as i kinda sound quite confusing here.<br>i'm personally onz for the league, juz dat i haf the above concerns.<br>we need the whole team to say "ready!" can we?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i posted the earlier msg whn i was abt to fall aslp.... damn.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>its really confusing... here i juz summarize it<br><br>*) its a diff choice between wanting to keep all hapi or winning<br><br>eg: there are occassions where scoreline is close. eg if we are down at 1-0, players who knws they cant contribute much will choose to be left out and allow the betta players to play. if such situations persist, these players will soon have little playing time and thus lose interest in playing for the team<br><br>eg: In another case; will all be hapi wif losing whn we persist to use the 20min rowing subs mtd even whn we are down by eg. a goal?<br><br>- in other words, go for the win or "give other's a chance since everyone paid for the field?"<br><br>hence if we are <strong>all</strong> prepared to <strong>lose </strong>or win respecting the fix 20min rowing subs policy of our team, then we are ready.<br>which means, we join the league to get exposure, better opponents and better field and not juz winning.... then i would say we are should join.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems that joining the league once again a hot debate.  Everyone would have their own character, own fair share of thinking.  What Ian had mentioned was right.  We should consider the teams' decision and not just majority.<br><br>Just don't forget what is our main objective forming this team.  If we think we're moving a step furhter, then we should change our mind set.  In fact, it's very difficult to please every players, have a fare share of playing time for everyone.  So, for eg, last match, Ian injured just less than 5 mins into the game and left out for the whole match.  Is he going to pay lesser or don't have to pay?  The answer is no, obviously.  We're a team.  This's one of the criteria that we have to meet.  In the tournament, we are going to pay an entry fee, if i'm not wrong, the field too.  Some players might be left out for the whole match.  Are you going to take it, feel unfair....?<br><br>There are lots more samll details to consider, like committment, integrity, sportmentship......  Lets discuss this with the whole team as found that not all participating here.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joining a league will definitely be something I wish for the team. However, i share the same sentiments as Ian and derrick. We are still not ready as a team.<br><br>We should seriously consider Charles's suggestion. We can start by joining some one-off competitions like futsal or seven a side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys,<br><br>firstly i wld like to apologise if my initial post seems somewhat provocative..never was it my intention to cause any resentment within the team or to question the management's credibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>the reason why i am constantly urging the team to enter a league is becoz i'm sure it will benefit us greatly in the long run..when i first joined the team i had great ideas and ambitions for the team, especially with robin at the helm. i knew i wasn't going to be satisfied juz playing social friendlies..<br><br>it's now almost a year since Reds was born, and i feel that joining a league is juz what we need to spice things up a little bit..juz to break that monotonous run of friendlies, friendlies and more friendlies..<br><br>i want to play in a league for the fun, excitement and more importantly the experience. why even think about how far we can go or whether we can win the tournament?! it definitely will take us a few tournaments/years before we can even think about finishing tops in any competition...which is why we need to start now before all of us become daddies... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i definitely think we are ready..not ready to win tournaments but rather, ready to take that next step and go competitive..<br><br>futsal and 7-a-side wld be options, but then again it's not exactly what we've been training for.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   and the long waiting time and large number of fights associated with 7-a-side tournies is a turn-off..</div>
