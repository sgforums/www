What happens to those who has never scored? Defenders and obviously goalkeepers do not have as much chances to score as compared to strikers and midfielders. By putting all scorers up, it may just make those who doesn't, feel marginalised by their positions.<br><br>Those who are in better scoring positions should already be motivated by the chance to have his name featured on the homepage. All he has to do is to be in the top five scorers list.<br><br>Of course I would also like to display as much information on the site but that would only mean more updating work in the future. i hope you'll understand.</div>

Therefore, its only right that we honour the top scorers. If you feel that other players should have the chance to be honoured, may I suggest having a player of the match award for each game. In that way, any player that has done exceptionally well will have a chance to receive his due recognition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My comments:<br><br>a.  <strong>Man-of-the-match</strong> Not a bad idea as it is definitely a fairer assessment of performance than goals scored, but difficult to implement.  With everybody supposedly concentrating on the game, who to decide?  It should be decided by neutrals anyway...<br><br>b.  <strong>Top scorer list</strong> I personally feel that a top 5 list is sufficient as that's what it's supposed to be... a list of top scorers!!<br><br>c.  <strong>Score chart</strong> Let's not confuse this with the above.  We could have a seperate page to show the number of goals scored by each player.  Question is... do we also include other stats (i.e. tackles, passes, assists) to ensure that other defensive players are not left out?  I personally feel that a chart with only goals scored is not a balanced chart and is far from being fair, while if we were to include other stats, it would be too time-consuming... and we would have to change the website name to Opta.<br><br>d.  <strong>Motivation</strong> With regards to the motivational factor in the game, I would like to state that I have only looked at goals as one of the benchmarks of my performance since I moved into the forward position.  However, even if I scored a goal but didn't contribute otherwise, I still would not feel happy with my performance.  If I am not playing upfront, my benchmarks would not include the goals I scored and would actually depend on the position I played in (e.g. crosses, tackles, assists, etc).  I would be particularly worried if every player in the team actually viewed goals as recognition of their performance.<br><br>To sum up what I have written above, I basically feel that while it would be good to have a seperate page to include indicators of our players' performances, it would be too time-consuming for a social team like ours.  So let's move on man....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scoring goals has never been an indicator of performance in our team so no cause for concern. Like wat Khai said, let's juz keep it short and sweet. We will juz stick to wat we have.<br><br>Bara, no doubts about your effort and hard work in creating and maintaining the web site.  Great job once and again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regareds to the top scorers lists,i think Bara's idea of putting up only the top five is a motivational factor in itself for players who wanna be in that list.Quite redundant if everyone who have scored are placed in the list,anyways the fifth position is only four goals,so everyone has a chance to catch up really.So for the chart toppers,keep up the good work,and for the rest,lets try even harder and make your chances count!!!!!<br><br>The purpose of writing the match reports is not because i'm very free or "bo liao",but more importantly,its to give recognition and encouragement to the players who have performed well in the match.I try to remember the scorers and the players that assisted as well,in the hope that it will motivate everyone to give it their best in every match and their hard work wouldn't go unnoticed.Even defensive players who have stood out had been mentioned.<br><br>I might decide to include my man of the match in each report but then there are inherent problems because then it would just be my single judgement and as Russ said,some players play more than others.</div>
