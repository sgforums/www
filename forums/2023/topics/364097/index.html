              <p id="paragrah">Perhaps no single cultural product is held more dear in Japan 
              than manga. It was a dominant form of pulp entertainment in the early post-World 
              War II period, a forum for social dissent in the 1960s, then for female 
              creativity in the '70s. By the '80s, manga was at the center of a mass market 
              that outstripped its overseas comic-book equivalents. At last count, there were 
              more than 20 manga museums in its home country, including The Kyoto 
              International Manga Museum, and now there is talk of creating a National Center 
              for Media Arts to include manga and anime.</p>

              YONEZAWA MEMORIAL LIBRARY OF MANGA AND SUBCULTURES</span></td>

              <p id="paragrah">But as the national government swings belatedly into action, some 
              experts are saying it is time to shift the focus from manga itself onto the 
              fans' subculture that has fed its success.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"As with the pyramids of Egypt, the greater the base, the higher 
              the zenith," said Kaichiro Morikawa, 37, associate professor of Global Japanese 
              Studies at Meiji University in Tokyo. "The focus tends to be on the zenith 
              rather than the base."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">That changes this summer, when Morikawa and Meiji University will 
              open the Yoshihiro Yonezawa Memorial Library of Manga and Subcultures, which 
              will house the 140,000-plus items of the late manga critic and subculture 
              enthusiast's private collection.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Yoshihiro Yonezawa was among the first manga critics in Japan, 
              and he helped to legitimize the medium with his writings in the '80s. Up until 
              his death in 2006, he was a voracious collector, known to fill entire houses 
              with books and manga, then abandon the space as storage and migrate to another 
              house to repeat the process. This earned him a unique sort of repute, and 
              friends would come to him to "donate" loads of manga and magazines they no 
              longer wanted.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Before his death, Yonezawa agreed to leave the collection in 
              Morikawa's care on condition he provided permanent placement. Morikawa and a 
              half-dozen assistants are currently spending their days in an abandoned middle 
              school in Ochanomizu, central Tokyo, cataloging heaps of unorganized boxes 
              gathered from across Tokyo and adjoining Chiba Prefecture to the northeast.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"The collection is not noteworthy because it contains any special 
              or supremely rare items, but rather because of its broadness," Morikawa 
              said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"He didn't just collect things popular among maniacs or of 
              general interest, but rather those things that others did not collect."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Yonezawa's trove includes everything from rental manga 
              (kashihon), which was popular postwar as cheap entertainment for children and 
              the poor, to ladies comics and pornographic manga for women — genres that exist 
              to this day. There are even examples of manga sold from vending machines, and 
              miniature manga given away as extras or prizes (called <em>omake</em> or 
              <em>furoku).</em> Among the many such items in the Yonezawa collection is the 
              original "Gigantor," the first giant-robot manga in Japan.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"This collection is nowhere near as large as that of the Diet 
              Library, but it contains loads of items not included there," Morikawa explained. 
              "Further, all the manga here have their original covers. The Diet Library 
              removes these and disposes of them."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">But perhaps more than as a collector of manga, Yonezawa is most 
              famous for his role in founding Comiket, the Comic Market. Since 1975, this has 
              been a place where amateurs and professionals buy and sell <em>doujinshi,</em> a 
              broad spectrum of works ranging from written academic criticism to drawn 
              pornography produced outside official publication channels. The majority are 
              remixes of popular characters from manga, <em>anime</em> and games put into side 
              stories, situations and relationships not intended in the original work.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">While this is flagrant copyright infringement, most authors and 
              publishers permit this fan activity as long as it is not a blatant copy, obscene 
              or for profit.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Koichi Ichikawa, one of the three power-sharing representatives 
              of Comiket since Yonezawa's death, explains that the organization was founded in 
              a revolt from the Manga Taikai, a convention to showcase and learn from 
              professional manga creators.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"Comiket was founded as an alternative," the 41-year-old engineer 
              said. "They wanted to be free in their expression and activity, to parody and 
              criticize and rewrite."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Under 26 years of Yonezawa's leadership, Comiket grew into the 
              largest public gathering in Japan. As the focus of the <em>otaku</em> (geek) fan 
              subculture on which the manga industry subsisted, it now draws more than 500,000 
              people to Tokyo Big Sight in Odaiba twice a year.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">Reflecting the importance of the event in the new Yoshihiro 
              Yonezawa Memorial Library of Manga and Subcultures, the first floor will feature 
              exhibits related to Comiket, including a draft of the original opening 
              declaration. The second floor will be a small reading room and a reception desk 
              for the closet stacks, stretching from the third to fifth floors.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">In another indication of the new library's focus on the fan 
              subculture surrounding manga, it will be the first facility of its kind in Japan 
              to house a substantial collection of doujinshi, both from Yonezawa's collection 
              and some 400 boxes donated by another late Comiket organizer, Tsuguo Iwata. The 
              only other doujinshi collection in the world was held by Doujin Bunko in Tokyo's 
              geek Mecca of Akihabara, a commercial reading room that closed in 2002.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Morikawa also revealed to The Japan Times that the opening of the 
              ambitious Yoshihiro Yonezawa Memorial Library of Manga and Subcultures is just 
              the beginning of a long-term plan he has to bolster resources for the collection 
              and for the study of Japan's popular culture at Meiji University. Eventually, he 
              said, he would like to expand the new library into what he is tentatively 
              calling the Tokyo International Manga Library, a "united archives" of pop and 
              subculture materials.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Having served as the commissioner of "Otaku: Persona = Space = 
              City" — Japan's pavilion at the 2004 Venice Biennale of Architecture — Morikawa 
              has long harbored a desire to make those Venice exhibits the core of a more 
              permanent facility. He also hopes to add exhibits charting the historical rise 
              of anime, manga, games and otaku.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Importantly, Comiket, which has an estimated 2,000,000 doujinshi 
              titles in storage, and the Contemporary Manga Museum, a private collection that 
              boasts 200,000 manga titles, are cooperating with the project, which Morikawa 
              said he hopes to realize in the next 10 years.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">Aside from the exhibition and archive space, Morikawa would also 
              like the Tokyo International Manga Library to include a hall to host small 
              doujinshi sales events from around Tokyo.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While otaku are popular figures in the "Cool Japan" image 
              overseas, Morikawa emphasizes that his goal is not to elevate subculture so much 
              as to catalog its contents: "The value of a product or activity is gauged by its 
              impact on the future. We want to preserve those things that are dismissed and 
              discarded as subculture so that they may be better assessed by future 
              generations."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Although unique in its focus on otaku subculture, observers are 
              interested to see how the Tokyo International Manga Library develops alongside 
              the national government's planned National Center for Media Arts, the exhibits 
              of which it seems likely to duplicate, at least in part.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Morikawa declined to comment on the new national center, concrete 
              discussion of which has only really started over the last few months.</p>
