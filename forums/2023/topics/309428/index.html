              <p>Not only the anime Naruto but other animes too... These are not consider fillers because it's trying to tell you <strong>THEIR</strong> life within the 2 years before finding Sasuke. Without these eposide, viewers cant seem to feel for the characters more. This is anime, unlike manga where you can see moving pictures, sounds and emotions. Manga might be interesting for you because they get to the point... why? Because drawing in Manga is far more easier then creating anime. In Manga, you might want see what happen quickly but you cant really '<strong>feel'</strong> it.</p>
              <p>For example, some of you might hate the 'curry of life' episode, but without that episode, how do you know that Raiga is also from one of the seven swordmen of the Mist? That is also where Kisame, one of akatsuki is from. It's trying to tell you that Raiga is different from the rest because he save the little sick boy (Ranmaru) etc.. you can feel more emotion from this.</p>
              <p>To me, these are the element that make the anime more interesting... showing Naruto's righteous side, stupid side etc..What makes you think that 'Naruto' anime is about saving Sasuke? or about Akatsuki? If so, it should be 'Naruto the Sasuke Saviour' or 'Nukenin* of the Akatsuki' For those who dunno, 'Nukenin' refers to missing ninja who betray their village. The title stated 'Naruto' so it about <strong>Naruto's LIFE</strong>..</p>
              <p>What is really consider as a <strong>fillers</strong> is the 1 hr episodes consist of the 'Top 5' battles.. This is then a fillers.. Because they got nothing better to do and they got into a live studio showing their past battle.. There is also one whereby Orochimaru even got interviewed... This is what you can call.. crap fillers. Because other than these, the rest is actually within the storyline.. and if you cant accept the storyline, it's better for you to give up watching anime. If you just want to know what happen to Sasuke and Akatsuki, you might as well read a storybook or even read a spoiler.</p>
              <p>PS: Even storybooks have fillers too, you cant expect the writer to write as simple as "hero's friend turned bad, then the hero fought with him, the friend regretted and they live happily ever after." See without your so-called fillers, my story just end like that..</p>

              <p>Yah la I know.. but just want to say dont hate fillers mah.. it's just part of the story.. wouldnt it be interesting to know that Raiga is one of the seven swordmen? somemore before you read about manga or watch the anime, you you expect that it's about naruto saving sasuke and akatsuki part?</p>
              <p>For me, at first I thought 'Naruto' anime story is about how a chunin, who was being hated by the whole villege, wanted to become Hokage... I just hope the story goes until he reach his pathway to become hokage (That's what the intro was about). I didnt expect that sasuke had this's past and seek his revenge in evil way.. neither do you expect too right? It's just how the story is being developed.. just that you find the part of sasuke and akatsuki more interesting.. hence making it into the 'actual' storyline...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah that's what I mean.. if the anime didnt show this.. the viewer wouldnt know that the secret of bug jitsu user right? And yeah.. naruto was dumb again to find a similar bug 1000000 times bigger the size.. lol</p>
              <p>I know nobody interested about Raiga and 7 swordsman.. but Kisame who was a akatsuki, was part of this organisation before.. and there you go... <strong>'Akatsuki' - the main storyline..</strong></p>

              <p><br>I watched all.. including the 'Top 5' battle scene which is think this is the only fillers... The rest was about naruto and gangs seeking way to improve their skill and they met other ninja along the way. I wouldnt want 'Naruto' merely about sasuke or akatsuki.. Talking about akatsuki, I believe most of you were interested about individual's past life right and why they become akatsuki..</p>
              <p>Yeah.. 2 years.. after that shippuden come out and you see naruto was more matured... but before that, why you think naruto was more matured if you didnt see his stupid side?</p>
              <p>Talking about 'filler' I wanted to see all the five strongest village shinobi... the land of lightning and land of earth.. but sadly they didnt show... 'fillers' indeed..</p>

              <p><br>Hi friend.. Both are different thing.. the other thread is about the doubt that hopefully can be answered by forumers here. That thread is target only the issue about 'Gaara and kazekage' which the answer can be replied by people who read the manga too. Of course, there are some helpful replies in there. The Naruto thread you provide are in the anime where people watch and people say. But my thread happen to be outside the anime becasue it didnt really show. That is about Naruto...</p>
              <p>This thread is about <strong>fillers </strong>but i'm using Naruto as an <strong>example</strong> because most of the forumers here hate it. I also mention that <strong>not only anime Naruto, other animes too.</strong> See.. you just mention the 'another' anime - Dragonball. And I believe many animes do have fillers too, that's why I state my point of 'fillers' being the part of the storyline where you can explored in-depth of the characters in the story.</p>
              <p>I wont say anything if you closed my thread that is being 'repeated' or the question had been ask over and over again. Hence, it can refer to a single thread that is created cater to it. I believe there are also many similar anime thread being opened but the details inside is different. If im not wrong, you also open a thread called 'The new Akatsuki' <a href="/forums/2023/topics/270766">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2023/topics/270766</a> . That is also about Naruto right? Although the detail inside is different but 'Akatsuki' originated from Naruto too...</p>
              <p>Besides, that Naruto thread you provide mainly contain complaints and fillers hater...</p>

              <p>but as a whole i dislike fillers as it doesn't really introduce anything to the development of the actual storyline or the characters since fillers cannot crash with the manga.</p>
              <p>characters introduced in fillers are easily forgettable as they won't appear again except in another fillers. take for example the bounto arc in bleach, the whole story is so un-bleach and uninteresting.</p>
              <p>that's why i prefer watching short anime as they get to the point without all the draggy-ness.</p>
