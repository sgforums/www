            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, problems happpen with people using mkv is because they dont have the required codecs. Which is easily solved with FFDShow and Haali.<br><br>And do you know that H264 is actually optimised for low bitrate videos, like bitrates of 500kbs?<br><br>I personally recode using x264 and neroaac to achieve an average filesize of 90-175mbs, depending on the type of show. Usually I get an average quant of 18 which corresponds to CQ2 of MPEG4(DivX &amp; XviD included)<br><br>And when you recode, of course you drop the resolution to SD size. Who needs the HD when the target is 140mb or less?<br><br>With certain tweaks and optimisations, you can achieve better results with x264 than what I've done so far even.<br><br>Personally I dont use rmvb anymore for recoding anymore. Color information is lost real media only supports 65535 colors. Though it is up to what you want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with abao, i prefer my animes to be in .mkv format. i'm not worried about disk space as i have plenty of them. not enough i can always get a new hard disk. hard disks aren't expensive these days anyway.<br><br>all my gundam 00 episodes are in .mkv. 300+MB for each episode. i want my animes to be viewed in th best quality possible.<br><br>regarding what allen mentioned playing mkv files with VLC, yes it does has some problems like lag and subtitles not displaying properly. that's why majority of people play them with media player classic. no problems at all.<br><br>but ultimately it boils down to individual's preferences. no point arguing what's good what's bad.</div>
