              <p>From the anime, was Gaara's father the foruth Kazekage?

              <p>Garra's father was killed by Oro meh? I know Orochimaru killed the kazekage and then acted as him, but was it Garra's father? I'm not sure but i think they didn't mention it although i won't know.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure where was said that Orochimaru got injured by the Kazekage. But Orochimaru is definitely in the Kage level, as one time the 3rd even wanted to hand the title over to him and he's among the same class as Tsunade and Jiraiya which the former eventually becoming the 5th. And besides the 3rd is already very old his body couldn't take it, plus Orochimaru went on to research many forbidden jutsus.</p>
              <p>This is what i think, the Sand is one of the bigger villages and thats why its considered among the 5th strongest. Another thing to note that is that the Kage need not be the strongest as there are other qualities to choose from as well including leadership. And why can't Sasori be stronger then him?</p>
              <p>This is my views.</p>
