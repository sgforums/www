              <p>Tousen, Aizen and Gin (i call them TAG, haha) were the ones that
              severed Kensei's and Mashiro's chain of fate when they stabbed
              them. Thus, like Ichigo they start to become hollows. Hiyori, for
              reasons unknown started transforming also.....or is it that i
              missed the scene where she got attacked???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hougyoku haven't come into the picture yet in this flashbacks,
              but there are many fans' theories about its true uses...very
              interesting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The remanining espada must be strong, otherwise Aizen wouldn't
              be that confident to bring just 3 (making it 6 total) to fight the
              hordes of shinigami + vizards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I quite favor the vizards, just by looking at the way
              Shinji wiped Grimmjaw's ass earlier on. Plus, Lisa's
              cute! </p>

              <p>Hiyori got attacked by Kensei in the very first attack...remember?</p>
              <p>But how did they manage to so easily hit their Chain of Fate puzzles me. U mean, a realy physical slash on them would easily cut off the chain of fate? Then Kenpachi's Chain must've been slashed numerous times. lol.</p>

              <p><br>You made a good point! But Kenpachi could use his reiatsu to shield himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Kensei, its a direct stab. I assume its the same for Mashiro.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hiyori's.....not shown. But its like she got influenced by the hollow aura or something like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She's quite a weak character, i'm surprised. First the vizards saved her from Hollow Ichigo, now 100 years ago Shinji saved her. To think that she's such a bossy character, this really pisses me off, lol.</p>

              <p>that time when Byakuya first appeared in the series was when he and Renji came to retrieve Ichigo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shun-po + stab that Byakuya used on Ichigo, according to Renji, was a trademark move of Byakuya to sever something. I guess is to remove Ichigo's Shinigami powers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, soon we will get an explanation from Aizen, current chapter (-99) preview out on some sites already....</p>

              <p>i'm guessing cutting the chain link and soul sleep will make the shinigami powerless and maybe cause the hollow to form, just my guess....cos kensei got slashed then the mask formed. Shinji got slashed by Hiyori and his mask also form. Probable?</p>

              is not suitable for training people. that's why he couldn't
              personally train Chad.</p>

              <p>- vizards can have bankai, 4 of them were captains 100yrs
              ago. high chance (if not 100%) of them having bankai,
              pre-requisites for gotei captaincy.</p>

              <p>Hmm the slashing part is the thing I pointed out. I think it's to do with the formation of hollows. Cos it seemed that way lor, from the past 5 chapters.</p>
              <p>As for why Kensei's Team 9 was out there with the 10 disappeared vanguards, could it be Aizen's experiments? Then, I would be interested in Urahara and Myuri's experiments already...</p>
              <p>What was Aizen trying to do? See if shinigamis can become hollows by slashing them? That doesnt explain how Kenpachi is still alive despite being slashed up down left right...and MAYBE the slashes are different from the normal slashes we see being inflicted on the captains by Ichigo when they barged into SS?</p>
              <p>Maybe Urahara's bankai is to counter Aizen? Possible? haha.</p>

              <p>I think the vanguard were there to investigate the missing-souls case. But when even the vanguard disappeared, Kensei felt that the culprit had turned to experimenting on shinigami instead, so his team went there to catch the culprits, before more shinigami became victims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Maybe Urahara's bankai is a defence type, hence he got Renji (offence-type bankai) to train Chad. Or his bankai could be like Inoue's rejection ability. Seeing that he's former R&amp;D chief, maybe his bankai could also have some 'creation' or 'rejection' powers? </p>

              <p>I think Urahara's bankai might be interesting. I really wish that the author would let us see it! haha. 2 vs 3 in the next chapter??? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Initially I thought Mayuri was involved in the Missing Souls case. hahaha. But it was kinda weird that Aizen knew that the Boss would send out 3 captains out to help Kensei! Gosh. And I think explaining needs to be done for the slashing part. haha. How it turns shinigamis to hollows. It's kinda weird.</p>
