He initially began his work in concentration camps during World War II, implanting cybernetic organs in the bodies of dead prisoners in an attempt to bring them back to life to serve in the FÃ¼hrer's army. However, the Allied forces intervened to defeat the Nazis, so he fled to South America where he once again continued his sinister experiments.<br><br>From one of his experiments emerged the Cyber Series Â— artificial humanoids possessing superhuman strength and agility. But something was amiss: the 5000 original Cybers, engineered to be the perfect servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they began disobeying their creator, Von Reichter ordered all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. By this time, Cyber-29 had already died in a playtime accident when he fell from a cliff, but Von Reichter managed to transfer the dead child's brain into the body of a panther to be reborn as Data 7. Cybersix was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping with the help of a black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When the slave was later interrogated and killed by Von Reichter, Cybersix escaped once again and made her way to the fictitious city of Meridiana, where she adopted the identity of a boy killed in a car wreck, Adrian Seidelman, and now battles her evil creator and his minions.<br><br>Like all of Von Reichter's creations, Cybersix depends on a mysterious life-giving fluid called "sustenance". When her supply ran out, she was forced to prowl the city in search of other creatures of Von Reichter's making, such as Frankenstein-like Fixed Ideas or the more human-like Technos, to kill them and take their sustenance to survive. Almost by accident, she became a superhero by defending the people of her city from Von Reichter's malevolent plans, often carried out by his cloned "son" JosÃ©. Along the way, she meets the resurrected Data 7, as well as a young boy named Julian, and falls in love with biology teacher/reporter Lucas Amato. [from wikipedia]<br><br><strong>Personal Rating</strong>:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>Personal Comment</strong>: I stumbled upon this anime when I was browsing wikipedia for 90's show. But this is not the 1st time I watched the show. If I remembered correctly, I was 6 when this show appeared. I was too young to understand the show but I really liked it alot for some reason.<br><br>Anyway, the show is a real collaboration. Its was a comic from Argentina and was later adapted into an animated series by Canada and animated and co-produced by Japan.<br><br>Into the show, the show has the standard super hero super villain theme. The villain wants to take over the city at the same time kill the heroine by sending out monsters. Kinda like Pretty Cure theme. I like to emphasis on the word "theme" coz the story and genre genre is nothing like Pretty Cure or other super hero anime. The main villain is ultimate evil but the villain in contact with the heroine is a joke. As per standard.<br><br>As for the life of the heroine Cybersix, as she is hiding from the evil bad guy, so she disguises herself as a guy by the name of Adrian and work as a teacher at a local high school. That is by day. By night, she let down here hair and auto look like a girl and don tights and high heels...... I know it sounds weird but believe me, its a good show. She befriend a co-worker at work as Adrian but the co-worker fell in love the heroine.<br><br>So, 1 super heroine (check), 1 alter ego (check), 1 group of super villains (check), a monster per episode (check), 1 complicated love life (check)<br><br>This should be good enough to cover 13 episodes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Overall, this is not a super great anime. But it is indeed worth watching. Plus, for a few, its a trip down memory lane ^_^<br><br>Plus, the Opening Theme OWNS<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3iOOFDUFIE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3iOOFDUFIE</a><br><br>Six episodes are available for view on stage6.dvix.com, here's 1<br><a href="http://stage6.divx.com/user/BronzeDragonrider/video/1239197/Cybersix---1x01" rel="nofollow">Episode 1: Mysterious Shadow</a><br><br>P.S, the comic looks UGLY!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
