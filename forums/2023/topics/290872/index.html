            <div class='col-md body'>But did the manga explain why dante created pride and greed? &lt;- Never Read<br>and also abt Gluttony - Who made him? &lt;- Never read manga also<br>and why gluttony was so attached to Lust? &lt;- Dunno, probably because she's his partner?<br><br>But hw come when Gluttony died when trying to eat Dante by crawling his way to the lift, and Dante performs a transmutation in the lift while trying to escape during the last episode, and both perish. &lt;- Spoilers watch the movie.<br><br>What is the correct name for Winry Rockbell<br>Coz some episodes mentions abt Winry, den some episodes mentions abt Winly &lt;- Japanese pronouces "R" as "L", so since the show is in an ang moh setting, the fansubbers dunno to use "R" or "L" for name until its confirm to be Winry.<br><br>How can Scar perform the transmutation in Lior which will kill all the invading soldiers when he lost both of his arms (One to kimberly and the other to AL) &lt;- The circle he draw hao liao mah, he not Ed need to clap his hand together to form a circle wat.<br><br>According the the last episode, it seems human transmutation is possible? as Al transmute his edward back and edward den transmute Al back &lt;- Al used his own body (which is the philosopher stone) and soul to transmute El. And Ed did the same ting for him. The Al Ed brought back was flesh and blood what, so its a one on one exchange. While Al had the stone so he can do anything.<br><br>Lastly how come the anime nv follow the manga? Coz Winry parents was supposely to be killed by Roy Mustang, but just now i wiki it and it seems the culprit is Scar &lt;- Ask the directors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  The mange is still on though.<br><br>So FMA on screen is only restricted to the 51 tv episodes and One movie rite? &lt;- Yes.</div>
