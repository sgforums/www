              <p><strong>English Tittle</strong>: They're Here! Powerpuff Girls Z</p>
              <p><strong>Genre</strong>: <span>adventure</span>,
              	<span>comedy</span>,
              	<span>magical girl</span>,
              	<span>science fiction</span></p>
              <p><strong>Plot Summary</strong>: In order to stop an ecological disaster, Ken Kitazawa used Chemical Z,
              a new form of the Professor's original substance Chemical X, to destroy
              a giant glacier. However, the impact of Chemical Z caused several black
              and white lights to appear in the <a title="Tokyo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a> sky. Three ordinary girls, Momoko, Miyako, and Kaoru, were engulfed in
              white lights and soon became the new defenders of Tokyo City: the
              Powerpuff Girls Z. However, the numerous black lights caused others to
              turn to the side of evil. And so, using their ultra super powers, Hyper
              Blossom (Momoko), Rolling Bubbles (Miyako), and Powered Buttercup
              (Kaoru) dedicated their lives to defending Tokyo City from the likes of
              those swayed by the black lights and Him's black powder. (from wikipedia)</p>

              <p><strong>Personal Review</strong>: At first, I saw this show on youtube... Having saw PPG before, didn't really like it except for a few episodes, I have some ideas of the PPG storyline and so decided to give this show a try just for some kicks... I was quite surprised and delighted how it turned out...</p>
              <p>If I were to discribe this show is simple words, they would be cakes, sweets, laughter and smiles... Unlike the original PPG cartoonnetwork style humor, PPGZ is made of pure japanese cute anime girls sweetness... (think Akazukin Cha Cha)</p>
              <p>The show retained the original PPG's character names but had givin them new personalities, Momoko (Blossom) being an otaku, sweets addict and boy crazy, Miyako (Bubbles) being the most mature though childish at times, ditzy and very polite and Kouru (Buttercup) being... actually she's pretty much the same except she's a bit nicer and a lot cuter (^o^)... Same goes for the villans as well...</p>
              <p>For the storyline, compared to the PPG, PPGZ has more of an indept storyline at the same time has quite a hillarious cute sweet magical anime girl type comedy... Seriously, the show is so funny, it's leave's you with a grin in every episode... In the later part of the series, the show has a lot of episodes filled with cute pupply loves....</p>
              <p>As for the grapics, I cannot stress enough the cuteness of this show... The show is soooo cute, it makes you want to get a cute plush toy and hug it to death at the same time eat some cakes and ice cream...</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I find this show quite interesting compared to the original coz it has a longer "in the begining" story comapred to the accidentally puring Chemical X... [spoiler]<span style="color: #ffffff;">During the Edo era, there was a demon so evil that no one dared to speak it's name, so they called him "HIM"... Him caused EDO much Choas and Grief that Edo's scientist has made a Kennaium, a chemical made of white magic, to transform 3 of the village girls into warriors to defeat Him... The three girls managed to defeat Him and saparate Him's dark essence from His body and seal in a stone coffin with their white magic... The body was hidden in a temple in the mountains while the essence was thrown into the sea...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Present day, Professor Utonium and his son was experimenting on Chemical Z which seem to has the ability to amplify power, fired a laser powered by Chemical Z at a nearby ice berg, which turns out to contain the sealed Him's essence, and caused it to explode and send the Kennanium and Him's essence in all direction, him's essence hits a few people in Tokyo and turned to monsters and caused Him to revive and the Kennanium hits 3 girls which created the Powerpuff Girls Z</span>[/spoiler]</p>
              <p>Overall, this show is mainly for those looking for something cute and funny...</p>
