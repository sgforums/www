Diffused light.<br>Try to use good light. Daylight is good but not direct sunshine! Best if the sun is behind white clouds, as the light gets diffused this way . Direct sunshine will glare off the model too brightly like when you are too close and use the flash - everything gets washed out.<br>So if it is in direct sunshine move the model out of the direct sunlight and into the shade.<br>The worst light is indoors at night with just the normal house light on, or indoors on a dim day.<br><br>Remember photography is all about getting light into the camera (both digital and film types). Better the light = Better the picture.<br><br>2. Image Quality Setting<br>With our digital cameras we are given options in the settings to take either low quality, medium quality, high qualty, and super high quality pictures. So check that your camera is set to take the highest quality.<br><br>Then, when the pics are transferred into the computer you are starting with the highest definition picture. You can always reduce the image quality afterwards to make the picture file size smaller. But you can never turn a low definition picture into a high definition one.<br>Remember rubbish quality in = rubbish quality out.<br><br>3. Depth of field - focussing<br>Without going into the technicalities... you will find that if you get too close to the model with the camera the pictures will come out with part of the model sharply in focus and parts of the model blurry! This is because of the limited depth of field.<br>Instead, you will find it much better to move away from the model slightly and use the camera lense to Zoom right in and make the model fill the picture. This way you will find that all of the model will be sharply in focus.<br><br>But don't move too far away as camera movement (hand shake) can also start to affect the picture and make it blurry.<br>So try about 4ft away and zoom in.<br><br>4. Composition.<br>When taking pictures it is important to think about the composition. Think about the background, what is behind the model? is it a nasty brick wall, or the dustbin? These things can spoil the picture. Also if the background is very busy, e.g. a bookshelf full of different coloured books, this will distract the eye from the model. Also the background colour can clash with the model colour. Like fashion - when your wife says to you  "You can't wear that tie with that shirt!!"<br>For this reason it is a good idea to get a few pieces of different coloured card, or cloth as a backdrop against which you can take your good pics.<br>Then you can try the model in front of different colours and see which one suits the best.<br><br>5. Light Filling<br>(for when you are getting more experienced..)<br>With your model set up ready for taking picturs you can mess about with other lights, e.g. angle poise lamps, battery lamps, or pieces of white card which will bounce light onto any dead spots which need more light.<br><br>Hope you find this usefull and that your picture taking improves.</div>

For example, most of my figurine and firearm images are shot at the lowest ISO speed and smallest aperture setting for minimal digital noise and maximum depth of field, and since I shoot under natural lighting conditions, my exposure times are typically in the region of 0.2 to 0.5 seconds, thereby necessitating a tripod.<br><br>But, hey, the beauty of a digital camera is you can experiment to your heart's content! If the image doesn't turn up to your satisfaction, just erase it and try again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
