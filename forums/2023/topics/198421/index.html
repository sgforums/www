Along with his trusty guitarist partner Hiroshi Nakano, they make Bad Luck, a JPOP sensation waiting to happen.<br><br>The TV series opens with the interview of another band, Ask, their relaxed, self-assured and professional air rival the childish one shown by Shuichi on his late entrance. That evening Shuichi would meet the often foul tempered Yuki Eiri. The beautiful romance novelist picks up and reads lyrics that Shuichi had written and declares the boy had 'No Talent.'<br><br>Angered and intrigued by this strange encounter Shuichi's mind was filled with thoughts of the strange man; in his anger he writes a new song in time for the live show Bad Luck had secured as a crowd-warmer for Ask. Hiro notices Shuichi's strange behaviour and decides to inquire further. As the two talk however a TV interview reveals the identity of the golden-haired man.<br><br>Shuichi finds himself wanting to see the man again and rushes out of the studio to find him. Eventually he sees Yuki as he was driving down the road. The rash youth jumps into the middle of the road and stops the car thus starting a strange and often hilarious Shounen Ai story between the two.<br><br>During the TV episodes more is understood slowly about the central characters, their nature, their desires and fears. The latter is especially true for the poker-faced Yuki whom owns a deep and dark secret.<br><br>The love of these two endures hardships and they share sweet moments as Shuichi grows into a better singer and meets new people, some of whom will help him through on his road to stardom. Some of the same people will also help Yuki find that something which until now had remained a void in his heart.<br><br>An interesting subplot is the rivalry between the bands and even members of Bad Luck; this leads to some scenes that show the maturity and growth of each character early on. The introduction of Nittle Grasper as a legendary band and their lead singer Ryuichi Sakuma as Shuichi's role model sets an interesting parallel to the romance this series has to offer.<br><br>Some themes of the plot are a little mature but generally the story offers much in the way of anticipation and character development. *Watch for the impromptu kisses from Yuki!<br><br>Comments:<br>Firstly My First BL Anime...<br>Nice Songs also...<br>Nice wor...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://bestanime.co.kr/newAniData/HNY_img/img/GRAVITATIO/GRAVITATIOimg012.jpg"></div>

Because of his fall, he lost his memory. Sora gets a new roommate after he returns to school, Sunao Fujimori, his childhood friend, though he doesn't remember him. Matsuri Honjou is Sunao's best friend and another childhood friend of Sora's, though Sora doesn't remember him either.<br><br>So Sora is a student at a private school, and although he does know that he recently fell off a third-story building, he doesn't know how it happened or why. Sora does have some suspicions that him falling has something to do with his roommate or the science club president Nagase Kai.<br><br>Matsuri Honjou, gets the roommates into all kinds of hilarious situations aimed at getting them to admit their feelings for each other. Making things more complicated than they already are is the fact that Sora and Sunao have alternate personalities. Yoru is Sora's alternate personality, while Ran is Sunao's alternate personality.<br><br>And just to make things even more difficult, Yoru and Ran are lovers! Of course, Sora and Sunao are not. But the good thing is the feelings of their alternate personalities seem to spill over into Sora and Sunao as time goes by, bringing them together.<br><br>Commets:<br><br>Kekeke...
