            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>1) Why now? After so many years of downloading anime from the net, it practically becoming a norm in Singapore or I should say its already a norm. Not that I'm saying they can't take any actions, they could have at least take actions to 'educate' the public that downloading anime from the net is illegal and give the public a few days of grace before start hunting down for offenders.</blockquote>The RIAA also didn't start catching until P2P was prevalent.<br><br>My guess is that anime only gotten popular the past few years, and together with P2P technology, it drove up illegal downloads.<br><br>According to various articles, ODEX has warned them since early this year, and the lawsuits didn't start until a few months ago.<br><br>This probably explains the time lag and why they start suing now.<br><br><blockquote>2) ODEX claimed that the downloading of animes is hurting their profit. That maybe true, ONLY for those licensed ones in Singapore, but for those not licensed ones, that may not be the case.<br><br>I would also like to point out that 100 people downloading an anime title in Singapore DOES NOT represent that 100 people will buy it through legal means. What's more for those unlicensed ones, no profits would even begins with. ODEX is just only trying to make the situation turn very ugly.</blockquote>As with businesses, they love to exaggerate the situation. ODEX, as a business, won't be excluded as well.<br><br><blockquote>4) I remember ODEX said that if their titles were to be played in an 42 inch television (or LCD, dunno which they are referring), the viewers won't notice any differences. I say to hell with that, the biggest TV i have in house is only a 32 inch CRT (old), I doubt many own a TV that are 42" or bigger. The biggest my friend own is a 40" LCD widescreen TV.</blockquote>Testers often test products that normal users don't have. You could ask ditzy.<br><br><blockquote>5) A forumnites pointed out one problem which people failed to see which they can use this to fight back I believe, AVPAS = Anti - Video Piracy Association of Singapore, why the heck does it only sue anime downloaders? I know you all will say AVPAS = ODEX but since it is named AVPAS, isn't it actions is strange/doubtful? If that is the case, they should not use the name 'AVPAS' as it is completely misguiding the public, it should be called 'AAPAS' (Anti-Animation Piracy Association of Singapore).</blockquote>Don't say too fast yet. AVPAS may already be acting behind the scenes, but we are seeing no reports yet. As far as I know, I've received no alerts about it yet.<br><br><blockquote>6) If AVPAS are not going to educate the public, then don't sue primary kid, is that even necessary? Even just a warning will scare @^#^s out of them.</blockquote>The primary school kid is already sued. Nothing can be done.</div>
