            <div class='col-md body'>if yu look at the dvd price compare to the r1. r2 or the taiwen r3 release. Odex pricing are consider cheap. Their DVD quality ain't as bad as what most people have said having gotten to view one of their DVDs. The only thing they lose out are the extras that fans like me want so badly T.T Their packaging surely will lose out to the import, maybe even to bluemax naruto released. Their subbing are kinda improving, but sometimes, got bug like that, the sub will like go on the next sence and cover the next sub line, i must rewind and forward -.- Other than that, still alright. I am agaisnt Odex witch hunt on the people that download fansub, however, that's nothing much we can do. If we fans don't like Odex dvd release, there's always yesasia, amazon, ani-play(in sg) to get our import DVDs xD For Taiwen import, there's a shop at chinatown point xD</div>
