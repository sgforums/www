            <div class='col-md body'>Whole thing is a scam. First they set up the AVPAS, do some works to get credits, than set up Odex (both share same address) and begin to get licenses.<br><br>Mean time, have someone monitor for 6 months. Than pretent to start warning people in low profile. And starting to issue letter to a few to test water ( They knew well S'porean kaise). Successful than mass mailing.<br><br>All those who get letters should unit, engage a lawer together and fight for the case. Stop them from earning half of the proceeding.<br><br>For every charge them issue. 50% goes to admin fees which become their profits. Of cources they don't make money hence the *admin fees* are too high.<br><br>If *A* are truely concern about piracy, they should do what www.hipfriends.org.sg did. Sadly, more and more well educated making use of LAWs to make personal gain.</div>
