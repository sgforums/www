            <div class='col-md body'>Their principle may express support for them. However, if Odex do not have exclusive right. They can not proceed. The Japan companies can come down and files application themself.<br><br>To grant Odex exclusive in this situation, especially when they suffered bad publicity, where the potential boycott of they products is possible across SEA. I do not see any reasonale behine except one; The Japan companies attempt to use SG LAW to set a benchmark for further application elsewhere hence SG enjoy good publicity on LAW in SEA. They willing to forego the SG market for wider pies. Another word, Odex just a tool they use, surely will get abandon later by them.<br><br>Gonna see how the court handle this time.<br><br>The trouble is that Singnet as symbol of SG have not even contested the applications but by consent may send them wrong signal. If the court grant them the order this time, it's gonna go through this process over and over again. The end is, they will get 80% of BB user details at their disposal. Not forgeting beside the usual 3K-5K. There is also damage claim up to 20K on each dowloader. Good profits for them I say.</div>
