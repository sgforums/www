            <div class='col-md body'>HI all,<br><br>Just sharing my 2 cents worth after observing the happenings around this saga. I am not pro or against ODEX, but I would just like to point out some of the other relationship links between ODEX and AVPAS, apart from the usual 'same address, say board members in both organistaions.<br><br>I was just reading up on internet sites all over pointing out the harshness the whole issue has been handled, and how it could have been done to reach out to all anime fans in Singapore. I have bookmarked AVPAS' website for the pass few days trying to see if they have anything new to update, cos I personally feel if they are the ANTI VIDEO PIRACY ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE, then shouldnt this association cover all illegal downloads over the internet AND not just limited to Japanese Animation and Drama? Reading up on the 'About AVPAS' pages leads me to think they are seriously doing this just their (maybe sister company, Odex) could reap the gains.<br><br>Why do I say so? Look at the list of examples of pirates anime and drama they have. All Japanese. How about American shows? Like how about people downloading sitcoms like Charmed, Desperate Housewife, Lost, CSI? I've read people saying any form of video downloading is illegal. Not that I am saying sitcom downloaders should be caught too, but hey, what I am trying to point out is that, ODEX = AVPAS.<br><br>All of AVPAS's findings in the website says this: it points to the internal commitee members of Odex trying to work their way to get the profits, hence creating a so called AVPAS, who so called authorised ODex to catch downloaders. Let me just put it simply (AVPAS/ODEX authorised themselves to do it, but by masking it as ANTI VIDEO PIRACY OF SINGAPORE, they have more credibility to get a court order.<br><br>I thought that such organisations should have been made up of several key businessmen of the specific industry? It should also be a non-biased agency looking to work with both sides of society: community and businessmen alike. Why aren't the directors of TS, Poh Kim, Blue Max in this association? Clearly, in my opinion this speaks volumes about its intentions in the beginning.<br><br>AVPAS, if they claim to be so honourable should have a mass educating campaign saying that this video piracy is no good. Not just stun people into paying. We are all living in fear everyday now, waiting for the 'Ticket to Odexland' ala Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Be ready to reach out to<br>the anime fans, there are not many of us, but in numbers we are a significant lot. I wouldn't say we would make or break their business, but I would say, we could definitely have supported Odex if the outreach is better.<br><br>Nothing of the sorts on their VCD/DVD qualities, because I believe to each his own. I only believe that by downloading over the internet is the fastest way to get our doses of anime straight after being aired in Japan - so as to still keep the interest in that particular series alive. Of course, dedicated fan subs played a part in making this work. Why not Odex work closely with such fan-subs, for the quality and the subtitles and all. Costly I know, but Mr. Stephen, though we share the same name, you as a businessman should know one thing - small investment for future gains.<br><br>There you have it. I've said what I've wanted to say, after days of cowering in fear of receiving the letter. Let's hope the community will be more united in a more passionate way than be digsruntled and showering this comapny with hatred as it will lead us no way and be further branded as internet criminals. Much like mp3 downloaders.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 thing that I want to  "Pei Fu" abt ODEX is he is clever to use the <strong>LAW</strong> to gain profits which he reported the anime Downloading have cause the impact of his profit lost.<br><br>Secondly from most acticle i had read, it seems like like ODEX Co had a bad marketing strategy to begin with;<br><br>1. NO ads (even i myself have seen any form of advertising. while japan do promote their DVDs)<br><br>2. Low Quality Videos<br>3. Pricey<br><br>As a marketer i bet u guys know that how will customers pay for a pricey DVD/VCD with low quality (where ODEX Deem it as *original) i belive that with such bad marketing strategy have caused the company lost of profit not form Downloading.<br><br>By getting the LAW to back him up he is NOT fining people instead getting <span style="color: red;">"unethical PROFIT" </span>which the company called it a lost of profit which they Never even put in any form of promotion.<br><br>I feel that  companies should always bear in mind its their responsibility to make sure their GOODS sell not to blame other as this is a MONOPOLY market. Just because U lost in the businese war and they resort to such lowly tactics.<br><br>----------- my thoughts -------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the posts and links in this thread, there one a word I could say is "WoW!?". I mean this case was a few months ago, and its still ongoing.<br><br>I have a few questions in mind though...<br><br>1) Why now? After so many years of downloading anime from the net, it practically becoming a norm in Singapore or I should say its already a norm. Not that I'm saying they can't take any actions, they could have at least take actions to 'educate' the public that downloading anime from the net is illegal and give the public a few days of grace before start hunting down for offenders.<br><br>2) ODEX claimed that the downloading of animes is hurting their profit. That maybe true, ONLY for those licensed ones in Singapore, but for those not licensed ones, that may not be the case.<br><br><strong>I would also like to point out that 100 people downloading an anime title in Singapore DOES NOT represent that 100 people will buy it through legal means. What's more for those unlicensed ones, no profits would even begins with. ODEX is just only trying to make the situation turn very ugly.</strong><br><br>3) ODEX mentioned that dunno what south korea market hurting badly because of downloading, why the hell do you even begin sue Singaporeans and not South Korea when we are downloading anime titles not licensed in Singapore (except for those downloading licensed ones) but in South Korea. Like I say, not licensed in SG = no profit to begins with in SG. That means ODEX claims/reasons for their actions doesn't make sense, at least give a convincing reason.<br><br>4) I remember ODEX said that if their titles were to be played in an 42 inch television (or LCD, dunno which they are referring), the viewers won't notice any differences. I say to hell with that, the biggest TV i have in house is only a 32 inch CRT (old), I doubt many own a TV that are 42" or bigger. The biggest my friend own is a 40" LCD widescreen TV.<br><br>5) A forumnites pointed out one problem which people failed to see which they can use this to fight back I believe, AVPAS = Anti - Video Piracy Association of Singapore, why the heck does it only sue anime downloaders? I know you all will say AVPAS = ODEX but since it is named AVPAS, isn't it actions is strange/doubtful? If that is the case, they should not use the name 'AVPAS' as it is completely misguiding the public, it should be called 'AAPAS' (Anti-Animation Piracy Association of Singapore).<br><br>6) If AVPAS are not going to educate the public, then don't sue primary kid, is that even necessary? Even just a warning will scare shits out of them.</div>
