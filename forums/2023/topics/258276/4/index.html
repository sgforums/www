            <div class='col-md body'>You know, this really pisses me off whenever they try to restrict us from getting any form of anime. Heck, I don't even feel Singapore is not a democratic anymore, it's turning much into a dictatorship, just like Nazi Germany, and a money-minded country instead of its old, people-minded views. What? Wanna watch anime? Buy it from ODEX? They have a lousiest quality called subs ever! I've bought once from them, 'Love Hina', and guess what? I can barely make out the subs as the words were warped! What i do? I gave it to a friend of mine and said good riddance to that only bought anime.<br><br>Fansubs does their jobs way, way better than any licensed companies, as they are more dedicated to the shows, and more concerned on the people who are watching it, not money. Seriously, if the term 'Money is the root of all evil', is correct, then Singapore and its money-mindedness is pissing me off.<br><br>Yes, I'm a Singaporean as well, but I cannot agree to this calibre these so-called 'legal action' are doing. Hmph, they are just monopolising the industry that has yet to be captured in the wrong hands. Idiots they are... Maybe they are just little whiners like these...<br><br>MONOPOLISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><img src="http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n67/sargesagara/1179806156764um9.gif"></div>

Beware</strong></span><br><span class="small">Japanese animated cartoons distributor sending letters to culprits warning of legal action<br>By Chua Hian Hou, June 1, 2007</span><br><br>PRICES of anime DVDs here are the world's lowest, but fans of these Japanese animated cartoons prefer to get them online - for free.<br><br>Now they may land in the soup because a crackdown has been launched, and they are the targets for downloading these English-subtitled cartoons through file-sharing networks.<br><br>Local anime distributor Odex, which brings in the DVDs from Japan, has sent out letters to culprits it has identified as having downloaded these 'fansubs' using the Internet and peer-to-peer systems like BitTorrent.<br><br>'Fansubs' are the works subtitled by bilingual fans of anime as a service to the community of non-Japanese-speaking anime fans.<br><br>Odex spokesman Stephen Sing would not say how many legal letters have been issued.<br><br>A copy of one such letter obtained by The Straits Times announced that Odex would take legal action against the alleged downloader unless he settled the issue. Odex did not say what constituted a settlement.<br><br>The letter to this particular alleged downloader - a SingNet subscriber - came attached with a three-page listing of alleged downloads.<br><br>Mr Sing said that Odex, together with the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore, had no choice but to take legal action, because 'pirates' here download more anime files than any other country except the United States, which was 'ridiculous, considering our population'.<br><br>Anime fansubs, around since the 1980s, used to come in video cassettes, but the Internet and BitTorrent have made it cheap and easy to get hold of the cartoons.<br><br>An anime fan here, who declined to be named, said the community was downloading fansubs because original anime works were of poor quality and overpriced.<br><br>Mr Sing's counter: 'Perception problem.'<br><br>Focus groups, he said, have been unable to differentiate fansubs from its DVDs when played back on a 42-inch TV set.<br><br>Mr Sing added that on a per-DVD basis, prices here were the world's lowest, and that even when Odex bundled three DVDs for a $9.90 trial offer, fans did not bite.<br><br>In the US, the price of a two-DVD set costs between US$15 and US$20, depending on the anime title.<br><br>The anime fan was dismissive of the crackdown and said it would not stop fansub piracy. The community is tech-savvy and will find ways to continue downloading without getting caught, he said.<br><br>Under Singapore's Copyright Act, users found guilty of 'wilful' and 'significant' downloads face fines of up to $20,000 and up to six months behind bars.<br><br>The Act does not specify what constitutes a significant number of downloads.</div>
