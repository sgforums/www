In hindsight I admit that it was a flippant remark, and could have been more sensitive about it. But it was never intentional, nor meant to offend anybody, the last thing I'd think of doing is to alienate myself with our potential customers. But enough had been said about this.<br><br>The 9-year old kid.<br><br>I've received his parent's consent to release the terms. (Please note that we cannot do so without his agreement, that is a privacy issue). His appeal to the copyright holders was based upon age and low income family with all documents furnished and accepted. The final amount was S$600 to be paid over 12 months, and the parents paid up one shot. The case was resolved in July.<br><br>The charity issue.<br><br>The original message to the press was : We will invite or engage a reputable auditor to audit our accounts pertaining to the collection and costs of this excercise. If (note the word IF) there is any profit, we will donate all of them to a charitable cause.<br><br>Now if you ask me, I'm absolutely confident that there will be <strong>NO PROFIT</strong>. But the only way to show the public this is to have an audit so as to prove our motive and transparency. If we are to be found that there is a profit, then we should not take that money, it's that simple actually.<br><br>Traditionally piracy issues tackle distribution entites - shut down the local pirate shop and you resolved much of the problem. BitTorrent changes that completely. Downloaders and filesharers no longer need to go anywhere physically to pick up something. Yes, you can say it is all "non-profit", but while you're downloading you're uploading too - what gives you the rights to give somebody else something that you did not own? What gives you the rights to get something that you didn't pay for - anime is a business production, the anime studio has a rights to demand payment for it - and that should be respected. By taking them just off the net willfully, you've basically throw the respect of copyright aside, and justifying it to say that it is for the "greater good". The greater good of who? Certainly not the anime studios or the animators in Japan.<br><br>The so called merchandising benefit only applies to a very minor sector of anime - no doubt that they are usually the most advertised, or the most well-known. But the majority of anime in Japan doesn't have a merchandising potential that is bigger than TV/DVD sales, and those titles, and therefore their studios, suffer because of illegal filesharing. We've talked to all of them, they told us. Have you talked to them?<br><br>(o.o)y</blockquote>If they know there will be no profits, why do they have to demand $3k - $5k of settlement fees in the 1st place?<br><br><blockquote><br>Originally Posted by <strong>xysing</strong><br>But with so much publicity now, it is difficult for me to be convinced that somebody who is still downloading NOW is unaware that filesharing is illegal.<br><br>So if the individual is still doing so, what choice do we have except to take stern actions against him.<br><br>However, for all who are willing to respect the Anime studio's rights to survive, please stop illegal filesharing now. There will be no backlog letters.<br><br>There is really no point arguing about quality, speed, availability and so on, the fundamental is the same - illegal filesharing is infringing the intellectual property rights of the copyright holders. And no one is going to dispute that it is wrong. Judge Ernest said that, Andy Ho said that, everybody said that. So even if Odex is restricted by the technicalities of the Singapore law to help the copyright holders, that is not going to change a thing, the copyright holders will do it themselves if need be.<br><br>(o.o)</blockquote></div>

If he cannot give us a reasonable explanation of why that happened, we will reserve the rights to take legal action against him, with all the evidences that we have collected before and after the 3rd of September (there would necessarily be evidence after the 3rd in order for this to happen).<br><br>If you have any friends who still do not know the danger of filesharing, please let them know.

No one can turn back time.<br><br>If one stops downloading now, we will be giving the individual the chance to do what is right, and prioritze our actions on people who are still downloading despite all these publicity.<br><br>I don't see the reason why an individual should only stop downloading because they know that we are not going to send them any letters, that is so besides the case. Illegal filesharing is a crime in Singapore, and the fact that we will or will not send any letters to anyone shouldn't have anything to do with whether or not the individual want or do not want to stop downloading. With all the news that we're getting now, I think a typical law-abiding Singaporean should already know that filesharing/downloading is illegal, since, through all the articles available out there, the only single constant fact is that downloading is illegal in Singapore.<br><br>But yes, if Mr A stops downloading today, he will not be receiving any letters from us.<br><br>(o.o)</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Yes, the current group of PACNET users will not be receiving letters from us. </strong><br><br>(o.o)</blockquote></div>

Before they started all this crap, did they ever stop to ask themselves: 'WHY are the people downloading? Could it be that our products are not satisfying the customers?'<br><br>They could have just gone out to do market research. And surely, with enough  objective and honest research (surveys, interviews with Otakus, etc), the root causes can be identified and subsequently addressed.<br><br>Instead what do they do? They sit in their ivory towers and keep telling themselves that they weren't doing anything wrong. And when they do admit to their mistakes, they try to deflect it away from them.<br><br>I still refuse to accept the 'double-6' incident as a 'PR disaster', for, as I've mentioned before, 'it was a PR disaster' translates as 'We said things that others didn't want to hear, and we're sorry for that'. That, to me, is not the same as a full and unreserved apology.<br><br>And deflecting the problem of poor subtitling to the MDA.... that's pure hogwash. Then in that case my younger cousin should blame Cambridge if he doesn't do well for his O Level English, for he's not allowed to write about explicit sex scenes in his composition. Never mind about his bad grammar.<br><br>Pfft... 'nuff said. I will never support Odex products at all.<br><br>One of the cardinal rules of marketing:<br><br>'You need to work twice as hard and spend twice as much to woo a customer whom you have lost compared to trying to keep the customer.'<br><br>So if they go bust.... they should look to themselves before blaming others.</div>
