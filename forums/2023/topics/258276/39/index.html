            <div class='col-md body'>The more I read what they try to explain, upset I am. Not only they acted like BIG shot, go around shooting anyone in their path. They also talk like they <strong>already win the battle with Pacnet</strong>. What I can see, they are smart in not only manipulating the LAW abetting residents in SG (with the 2Ks), and they also manipulated the lack of technology knowledgeÂ’s of the judges. The lack of know how give them the opportunity to do just what they want. What I am afraid even more if they use SG law to benchmark for they own purpose which can be very scary.<br><br>Next thing you see is: me or .......go figure.<br><br>One thing I don't understand, for someone who is director of a raided game company, tell me he/she do not know what happen on their door step, gotta be kidding yeh ? Can I say consent? A directors going around gloating on his victims, how good can that person be by the above?<br>I hope the court will take into consideration how wide the implication this can be, most victims are all student, what kind of damage can this cause them? How they going to face their futures? Stop issue letter will not solve the problem; put the blame to their parent for not educating them?  An even worst analogy. How many parents in SG knew about their rights and the Laws? They simply abetting them, trusting the gov will protect and safe guard their interest.  They knew very little about their right and the Laws. Is this exact nature been use by a commercial firm for they gains.<br><br>Also, what will happen to the identities they collected. What happen to those financial informations associate to these people. I feared their informations can be missuse by these commercial firm for extra gains. Next thing you know, you can google and get them. probably a twin somewhere, some how. Does the court consider this ? Judge Lau did, what about the rest ? Can I said is scary ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From :<br><br>http://digital.asiaone.com/Digital/News/Story/A1Story20070904-24099.html<br><br>Japanese, Korean anime are booming, not ailing<br><br>Tue, Sep 04, 2007<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I WRITE to correct the claims made by Odex director Peter Go in the article, 'StarHub must give names of illegal anime downloaders' (ST, Aug 14).<br><br>Quoting from the article: 'Mr Go said the South Korean anime market, once the largest after Japan, collapsed several years ago due to piracy problems. This prompted Japanese studios making anime to band together to mount the crackdown here as they were worried Singapore, although not as big a market, would end up the same way.' And 'illegal downloads, available online since the late 1990s, have cut deeply into the profits of producers and distributors'.<br><br>However, this is false.<br><br>According to the December 2006 issue of Reason magazine (twice named one of the United States' 50 Best Magazines by the Chicago Tribune): 'The global sales of Japan's animation industry reached an astonishing $80 billion in 2004, 10 times what they were a decade before. It has won this worldwide success in part because Japanese media companies paid little attention to the kinds of grassroots activities - call it piracy, unauthorised duplication and circulation, or simply file-sharing.'<br><br>These activities, claimed by Odex to be illegal and piracy, are widely known as 'fansubbing', or the distribution of Japanese anime with amateur translation and subtitling by fans. They have proven to be a free and far-reaching source of promotion by exposing people to anime, which would have been costly and risky if done by commercial distributors.<br><br>A great example is The Melancholy Of Suzumiya Haruhi, which shot to worldwide popularity due to fansubs. It is reasonable to say that fansubs have contributed to the continuous and massive growth of the Japanese animation industry.<br><br>The Korean animation industry is also very much alive. According to recent articles this year by PRZoom and ee-<br><br>ProductCenter, the 'South Korean animation industry is the third largest behind the US and Japan' and 'it accounts for 30 per cent of the total output in the global animation market'. The sheer size of the Korean animation industry shows it is far from collapse.<br><br></div>

There are occasions when the quality of translation may be the cause of poor subtitling. This has nothing to do with the classification process but it is still worthwhile for distributors to address as consumers would expect to have accurate translation of purchased works.<br><br>It is also the distributor's responsibility to ensure that subtitles reflect the true content of an anime (that is, animation) especially its dialogue and commentary. If subtitles are not accurate, they can mislead the viewer and also make it difficult for the BFC to classify an anime accurately.<br><br>The BFC has never asked for subtitles to be tweaked. We require that subtitles accurately reflect the content of a film or video so that we can classify the content accurately. Inaccurate subtitles also do no service to the community or to the young who may be misled into thinking that an anime is suitable for them when it could be meant for a higher age group.<br><br>As the ratings for videos (including anime) range from G to M18, there is sufficient leeway to allow for the subtitling of mature content without subtitles having to be tweaked.<br><br>We urge all distributors to translate and subtitle their content accurately so that they can provide an informative service to viewers.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209169.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/209169.asp</a>[/b]</blockquote>LOL, owned.

This prompted Japanese studios making anime to band together to mount the crackdown here as they were worried Singapore, although not as big a market, would end up the same way.' And 'illegal downloads, available online since the late 1990s, have cut deeply into the profits of producers and distributors'.<br><br>However, this is false.<br><br>According to the December 2006 issue of Reason magazine (twice named one of the United States' 50 Best Magazines by the Chicago Tribune): 'The global sales of Japan's animation industry reached an astonishing $80 billion in 2004, 10 times what they were a decade before. It has won this worldwide success in part because Japanese media companies paid little attention to the kinds of grassroots activities - call it piracy, unauthorised duplication and circulation, or simply file-sharing.'<br><br>These activities, claimed by Odex to be illegal and piracy, are widely known as 'fansubbing', or the distribution of Japanese anime with amateur translation and subtitling by fans. They have proven to be a free and far-reaching source of promotion by exposing people to anime, which would have been costly and risky if done by commercial distributors.<br><br>A great example is The Melancholy Of Suzumiya Haruhi, which shot to worldwide popularity due to fansubs. It is reasonable to say that fansubs have contributed to the continuous and massive growth of the Japanese animation industry.<br><br>The Korean animation industry is also very much alive. According to recent articles this year by PRZoom and ee-<br><br>ProductCenter, the 'South Korean animation industry is the third largest behind the US and Japan' and 'it accounts for 30 per cent of the total output in the global animation market'. The sheer size of the Korean animation industry shows it is far from collapse.<br><br></div></blockquote>both total ownage..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
