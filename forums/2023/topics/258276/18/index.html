To some pple it can be justified if they cannot get that quality of subs from  odex or elsewhere. giving a more extreme example to make it clear, take a video and send it to 2 places to sub. you get 2 videos 1 with lousy and near incoherent subs and poor video quality, the other is one with at least passable quality and english. assume the 1st is odex. and the other is your fansub. some pple would say because odex does not give you quality that the other side gives, it is ok to d/l the other one. in essense, because of the quality difference the become 2 totally different products even if the license might technically be the same.<br><br>and its just one example. i'm sure they got other justifications too.<br><br>odex keepig the money, i don't know seriously not enough infor. reasonable to  assume either way or neither.</div></blockquote>Lets look at your post.<br><br>You concluded all your paragraph in a way whereby you agree there are some sort of controversies here<br>And there are things that we arent certain off.<br><br>Which is correct. This could very well lead to a good debate.<br>Which would certainly bright light to this issue.
