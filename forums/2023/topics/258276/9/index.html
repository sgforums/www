But for a kid, it is almost the "end of the world". I shudder to think if a kid commits suicide over this.<br><br>Secondly, the intangible cost of this action will have serious repercussions on their ability to even maintain or improve on their sales.<br><br>Thirdly, AVPAS and ODEX are staffed by the same people. Where is the separation of interest?<br><br>Lastly, any claim of offence must be physical in nature and anyone slapped with such a claim has the legal right to demand to see evidence regarding his/her assumed crime.<br><br>However, if the people who have been charged per se, do not insist on protecting themselves to the fullest extent of the law and making full use of their rights to ensure that the "prosecution" is legal and valid, and not some smoke-bomb wayang performed by a company who lacks credibility in the anime scene in Singapore; then we will never see the end of it.</div>
