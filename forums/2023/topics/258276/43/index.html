But their being there was enough to intimidate," the event's organiser -- who only wanted to be known by his online moniker Zer0 -- told Reuters by telephone.<br><br>He added that police -- who had four anti-riot vans at the scene -- also took down the anime fans' particulars and that they were filmed by plainclothes policemen. A police spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment.<br><br>Public protests are rare in Singapore, where outdoor demonstrations are banned and any public gathering of more than four people requires a permit.<br><br><a href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070907/3/37k8b.html" rel="nofollow">http://asia.news.yahoo.com/070907/3/37k8b.html</a></div></blockquote>CSJ and the SDP must be so jealous.

Subscribers can click on the link on the notice; they will be asked to acknowledge receipt of the notice and promise not to download any more pirated anime.<br><br>If they deny they have done this, they will have a chance to explain their position with the same link.<br><br>Mr Sing said if the subscriber does not respond, the firm will consider a court order to get his ISP to release his details.<br><br>The firm has changed tactics hoping the individual with the Internet subscription - often a parent whose child is downloading anime at home - will rein in such activities if they find out about them.<br><br>Read the full report in Tuesday's edition of The Straits Times</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guilty until proven otherwise. Pretty much how our system works.<br><br>But my concern will be notices sent out to the wrong people, and therefore making them guilty. In the report it's stated that if they refused to sign it, ODEX will then ask for court orders to release their details.<br><br>That will put them greatly in distress, especially for innocent users.<br><br>Mine is a good example, I didn't bother to clarify... since there's no way to. You can't reply to a robot, can you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I've received 2 emails from Singnet stating that my computer is attacking other computers when in fact I didn't. Coincidentally, I've sent out abuse reports to Singnet about hacker attacks. Those reports contained an IP address of which I logged in at another time (giving me an IP address in those reports), thus getting those emails. The thing about those 2 emails are that they are automatic, so I supposed that they set some automatic trigger when a particular IP address was detected.<br><br>Automatic emails can't be replied back... so I don't know how these innocent users are going to clear their name.</div>
