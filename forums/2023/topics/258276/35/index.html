[/b]</blockquote>I'm not sure about this, but somehow I have a distinct feeling that the Japanese companies wouldn't dare to antagonise the bulk of the anime fans in Japan with such legislation. Also, as it is, they make tonnes of money from selling figurines and stuff at conventions which are hugely popular in Japan. I am also unsure how well the Japanese anime DVDs sell in Japan either. Given how high tech most Japanese households are, it isn't too much a stretch to imagine that they would be able to record the shows as they are aired in Japan. Trying to penalise those who record the videos down will to also antagonising the companies who sell the players as well. (Note that I do not put it past them to shit on about even their own fans.)<br><br>It seems to me, that they are trying to crack down on fans outside Japan. I know Viz does crack down on some of the fansubbers with "Cease and Desist" notices but nothing more than that. Most Fansubbers try to stay within the law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tis strange to clamp down so hard on the downloaders when the source of most unofficial fansubs are derived from capture of free-to-air broadcasts.<br><br>It's a different segment altogether. There are anime consumers, people who buy DVDs by the tons to watch and then there are the fans, who may or may not buy, but are involved in the culture much more than the consumer.</div>

No. If you look porperly, Odex is a SUB-LICENSE owner of the anime. THat means, Odex have no rights on the anime itself. What Odex has rights over is the stuff they sell.

Who would like to watch anime that suddenly have ad inbetween when the atmosphere is high =.= its like pouring a cold water over u =.=</div>
