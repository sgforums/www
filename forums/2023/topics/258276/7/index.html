I will fake produce a record of his IP address illegally torrenting a picture that I once drew during a particularly boring physics lecture.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya i tell u, if that company can do a better job than the fansubs, naturally people will get stuff from them. Best is they start selling/ distribution of the anime online like maybe 2days after the show released in Japan. U can do that, get a better sub team? Why not pay abit like 50c per epi also never mind what.<br><br>But if u sub so slow, sell your anime like a noob ( 5 episodes for $20). What do you expect people to do? Wait two years before you sub finish? A good example is Naruto and Bleach. U see those sold in the shops. Now already Naruto:Shippuden liao they still haven even finish subbing the first season. My goodness.</div>

If thats the case then their really retarded...</div></blockquote>Someone said that Odex doesn't relies on anime to survive.<br><br>Anyway my predicted possiblities for the future to come would be:<br><br>1) Odex continue to give sh!t quality anime at an expensive rate, AVPA continue to catch, striking fear in SG Otakus' heart causing them not to download. Singapore anime communities/viewers will slowly fall apart and die. In maybe 1-2 years later, not much people will focus on anime, instead focusing on some other things. Animes will slowly cease to exist in SG market.<br><br>2) Odex continue to give sh!t quality anime at an expensive rate, otakus in singapore don't give a damn, continue downloading (though direct and some other ways) and watching anime by online video streaming method. AVPA continue to catch but due to too much people downloading and too much sources to covered, AVPA slowly lose the battle (just like against the war against SPAM and the DRM war).<br><br>3) Odex decided to improve its quality and releasing rate, however at a slow rate, maybe 1-2 years later (I think impossible for them to do a great improvement at a short time), SG Otakus don't give a sh!T since they are too slow (again) and continue to download/stream from internet with the AVPA is doing a losing battle scenario.<br><br>4) Odex decided to improve its quality and releasing rate, however at a slow rate, maybe 1-2 years later (I think impossible for them to do a great improvement at a short time), SG otaku suck thumb and wait/buy since scare get caught.<br><br>Thats the possiblities I could think of. I think most likely is possibility 1 or 4, since Singapore very Kia Si one, unless all the otakus united then would be possibility 2.</div>
