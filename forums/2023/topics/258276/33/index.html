            <div class='col-md body'>I highly doubt ODEX next appeal will lose. Seriously, when the day ODEX decided to walk down this path, there is no turning back, especially after winning 2 cases.<br><br>If the next appeal of PacNet case, ODEX were to lose, ODEX will be in big trouble, so is singnet and starhub. OK, maybe not starhub since starhub did try to protect its customers' privacy.<br><br>Reasons?<br><br>If ODEX were to lose again, what will ODEX do with the money fined from the anime downloaders? Give them back and say sorry? I doubt so.<br><br>If ODEX were to lose again, anime fans will not keep quiet about why ODEX decide to press charges against them when ODEX do not have the rights?<br><br>With all the damage from ODEX done, for sure anime fans will not keep quiet about it.<br><br>For after what ODEX had done in the past, they really can't afford to lose the battle right now, especially this moment.<br><br>As for singnet, u all know, it did not even try to protect, so some damages will be on them too.<br><br>With the announcements that ODEX will get permission from the copyright holders to sue, I think some of the PacNet downloaders can prepare to recieve the love letter.<br><br>Main point - ODEX can't afford to lose now.</div>

Seriously, when the day ODEX decided to walk down this path, there is no turning back, especially after winning 2 cases.<br><br>If the next appeal of PacNet case, ODEX were to lose, ODEX will be in big trouble, so is singnet and starhub. OK, maybe not starhub since starhub did try to protect its customers' privacy.<br><br>Reasons?<br><br>If ODEX were to lose again, what will ODEX do with the money fined from the anime downloaders? Give them back and say sorry? I doubt so.<br><br>If ODEX were to lose again, anime fans will not keep quiet about why ODEX decide to press charges against them when ODEX do not have the rights?<br><br>With all the damage from ODEX done, for sure anime fans will not keep quiet about it.<br><br>For after what ODEX had done in the past, they really can't afford to lose the battle right now, especially this moment.<br><br>As for singnet, u all know, it did not even try to protect, so some damages will be on them too.<br><br>With the announcements that ODEX will get permission from the copyright holders to sue, I think some of the PacNet downloaders can prepare to recieve the love letter.<br><br>Main point - ODEX can't afford to lose now.</div></blockquote>I wouldn't dare to bet if ODEX wins or loses. The chances are pretty equal, and knowing Singapore, nothing is impossible.<br><br>Singnet may not be on fire though, as I've said, it's stated plainly in their T&amp;C that a court order will get them to release the info.<br><br>If ODEX loses, I doubt anime fans will do anything, unless enough rubbish is digged out, like the NKF case. Singaporeans typically won't go after a case for very long once they want a specific outcome and that outcome is granted to them.<br><br>They may go after if ODEX didn't do as promised after losing the case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Odex to hire independent auditor to show sincerity<br><br>To prove it is not profiteering from the enforcement actions, Odex will hire an independent auditor to go through its accounts at the end of the case. And every extra dollar will be donated to charity, said Odex director Stephen Sing. Odex is seeking between $3,000 and $5,000 from each illegal downloader. Said Mr Sing: "We are just trying to recover the costs incurred for this (legal) action."<br>.<br>The costs include lawyers' fees and payment to Internet investigation firm BayTSP. Odex also has to pay the ISPs to reveal their subscribers' identities Â– one asked for up to $150 per IP address, said Mr Sing. Out of the 1,000 IP addresses tracked down through SingNet, there were only 400 subscribers, as each user is typically assigned up to four IP addresses. Compensation was sought from 300 "heavy" illegal downloaders.<br>.<br>Odex has settled 105 cases, one of which involved a nine-year-old child Â– most were in their late teens to mid-20s. Odex's lawyer Lau Kok Keng said it had gone to the police at first but was advised to gather the evidence Â– including downloaders' identities Â– on its own.<br>.<br>Looking ahead, Odex, which will launch a video-on-demand website today, is aiming for a "free and legal alternative" for fans by broadcasting anime on free-to-air television. Recently, Singapore became the first country outside Japan to broadcast D.Gray-Man, said Odex managing director Peter Go, with more titles under negotiation.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208537.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208537.asp</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese anime firms close ranks with Odex They pledge court action if local provider's appeal fails<br><br>Loh Chee Kong<br>cheekong@mediacorp.com.sg<br>SOME were flown in from Japan. Others appeared on video to show their support of their local representative, anime distributor Odex, which has come under flak from fans for its court actions against illegal downloaders.<br>.<br>At a press conference held by Odex yesterday, the message from nine anime copyright holders Â— including some of Japan's biggest animation studios Â— was clear: They are prepared to take legal action against the wrongdoers directly, should the Singapore courts reject Odex's bid to do so.<br>.<br>After getting court orders to force Internet service providers (ISPs) SingNet and StarHub to hand over subscribers' data, Odex's crackdown on illegal downloading hit a roadblock last Thursday, when the court rejected a similar application against Pacific Internet (PacNet) on the basis that Odex Â— as a sub-licensee Â— was not in a position to file the application. Odex is appealing against the decision.<br>.<br>Remarking that protecting copyright in Singapore "is more difficult than we thought", said international sales and marketing manager Fumiki Yamazaki from Showgate, one of the four Japanese companies in town. He said his firm will not hesitate to "go straight to court" if necessary. Its stance was affirmed by all the other copyright holders present.<br>.<br>The latter were understandably aggrieved, said Odex's director Stephen Sing, as illegal downloading here was rampant.<br>.<br>According to data collated by Silicon Valley-based Internet sleuth firm BayTSP, in the past 10 months, there were 483,310 counts of illegal anime downloading, mainly through peer-to-peer file sharing protocol BitTorrent. This makes Singapore the country with the highest number of illegal downloading counts per capita, at 10.89 per cent Â— far ahead of second-placed Sweden at 3.70 per cent.<br>.<br>Odex's managing director Peter Go added: "Even in the past month, when there was so much coverage on the case, the count went down by only 17 per cent (compared to July)."<br>.<br>Countering online allegations that anime fans had no choice but to turn to illegal downloads due to the poor quality of their DVDs, Mr Go pointed out that fans in focus groups "could not tell the difference" between Odex's products and those sold in Japan when screened on "a 42-inch plasma TV".<br>.<br>As for complaints about the accuracy of the DVD subtitles, Mr Go said the firm had to abide by censorship requirements. "For example, in Fruits Basket, some of the dialogue had to do with love between two boys, so we changed it to them being best friends. As a result, we got bombarded for having poor subtitles," he said.<br>.<br>According to Mr Go, Odex represents 32 copyright holders and distributes 90 per cent of the anime titles sold here.<br>.<br>In the past two years, its DVD sales have fallen by more than 60 per cent. "We hope to achieve at least an 80-to-90-per-cent reduction in illegal downloading. Whether it's realistic or not, we'll have to see," he said.<br>.<br>In other countries, noted TV Tokyo Corporation's manager Yukio Kawasaki, most culprits stop downloading illegally once they have received a complaint letter from the licensee. He said Japanese animation studios usually leave it to their local representatives to take action against copyright infringers.<br>.<br>Based on exchanges with anime fans here, Mr Sing said Odex "understands they will not stop downloading just because we sent them a warning letter".<br>.<br>Toei Animation Enterprises' manager Ryuji Kochi said he "regretted" the negative publicity Odex's legal action had generated. He reiterated that it "takes many people's work" to create animation.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208525.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/208525.asp</a></div>
