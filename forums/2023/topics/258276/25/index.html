If more then one of us are willing to fight it out in court, I believe the sheer amount of court case bills that odex have to fight will eventually bankrupt them.

When was company set up anyway?</div></blockquote>I 1st knew about ODEX about 2 1/2 years ago when I bought their VCD Vandread. I tot it was nice until I realise that it was a mere english dub (I like anime for a long time, but I'm not very knowledgeable about it at the time). Then I proceed to buy their Fushigi Yuugi, which I completely regretted, $90+ down the drain for a badly made english dub and quality of VCD and its format (they tried to squeeze 3 epi in 1 VCD).<br><br>Finally, I proceed to buy GUNDAM SEED during the hype in Singapore. It was sorta good until I saw that it was released in 2002. It reached SIngapore 2 whole years later? WTF?<br><br>That was when I stopped buying from ODEX, about 6 mths ago, I took a look at their GUNDAM SEED DVD set, I tot, what the hell? The hype over already you still make new product? Then I took a closer look, $39.90 for 5 episodes. Only a mad man would buy this. That means, to get the full set of GUNDAM SEED DVD, they have to pay $390+. THat's over the top crazy.<br><br>That was my past experience from ODEX. The only good thing I bought from them was Ai Yori Aoshi. But that also, they didn't bother to separate the episodes, I have to scroll half the CD to watch the next episode.</div>
