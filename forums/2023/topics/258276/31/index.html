            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting article here from CNA Forums, just some information thou, do not take it too seriously.<br><br><a href="http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?p=1285177#1285177" rel="nofollow">http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?p=1285177#1285177</a><br><br>Mr Peter Go and Mr Sing were the directors of Games Mart which closed down. Check out ACRA report at the link.<br><br>Filed under: Info Â— Darth Grievous @ 17:10<br>The recent victory of PacNet (or PI) over Xedo seems to have taken the Internet by storm, and I have heard many talk of people wanting to jump ship once their current contract expire.<br><br>Personally, I not only approve what these fellows intend to do, I will actually encourage them to do so! Because on a more personal - and selfish - level, I really donÂ’t mind some of these downloaders go choke up PIÂ’s bandwidth so that I can have smoother surfing on SingNet or Starhub. Hiak hiak hiak.<br><br>Anyway, from an unverified source, I was told that XYSing KYSing of Xedo (and his fellow director), were also directors of a defunct company called Games Mart. (And my own searches on ACRA confirmed this. ACRA reports found here: <a href="http://www.nowhere.per.sg/local/odex.pdf" rel="nofollow">Odex</a> | <a href="http://www.nowhere.per.sg/local/gamesmart.pdf" rel="nofollow">Games Mart</a>)<br><br>This source informed me that back around 1999, Games Mart Pte Ltd was caught for counterfeit goods (primarily Sony Playstation stuff), and 2 of their directors and an employee were subsequently charged.<br><br>These two directors - names omitted as unverified - were found guilty and sentenced to 15 months of jail, along with an employee named Jason, who was sentenced to 10 months. (I have so far failed to verify this and I am not sure if any news on this court case can be found on the Internet to support these unverified claims. It does not seem likely I could get my hands on the court reports like these cases of people getting sued by the Public Prosecutor here and here.)<br><br>Personally, I would really like some solid verification of the Games Mart case, and I would appreciate anyone who would point me in the direction of a reputable source of such information. I am personally quite upset with the fact that some people had actually told me that they wouldnÂ’t take blogs and forum comments into serious considerations, but would take note of whatever single-page piece of poo Xedo had currently put up on their site. If that is a testimony of just what low esteem Blogosphere is held by people, then there is really no point for any attempt at Blog journalism, because those people with serious content are discredited in one broad stroke!<br><br>Anyway, what I did find in Google, was a brief mention in the comment section of a blog by someone of the moniker of Beowulf that some anime released by Xedo were actually released previously under Games Mart.<br><br>While I am not attempting to imply anything here, but it appears that the bad quality of Xedo products has gone a long way back.<br><br>And though this really does not justify the very act of downloading anime Â‘illegallyÂ’, it does explain why some of the people are downloading fan-subs and not buying Xedo products in spite of their attempts at lowering prices.<br><br>Food for thought: Is it not necessary to consider these facts, when the argument that downloading is hurting sales is presented in court by Xedo? After all, it appears that there is a long history of people who did want to get their copies legally not getting what their moneyÂ’s worth.<br><br><a href="http://www.nowhere.per.sg/?p=407" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowhere.per.sg/?p=407</a><a href="http://" rel="nofollow"></a></div>

Last Thursday, Odex failed in its bid to force Pacific Internet (PacNet) to hand over the data of suspected illegal downloaders, whom Odex had tracked down with the help of Internet investigation firm BayTSP.<br><br>BayTSP's chief executive officer Mark Ishikawa, a former hacker, will arrive in Singapore later this week to help Odex prepare its appeal, according to his publicist Jim Graham.<br><br>Mr Ishikawa has has appeared as an expert witness in the United States on peer-to-peer technologies. Recently, BayTSP gathered evidence for Viacom in its US$1-billion ($1.5-billion) lawsuit against Google and YouTube.<br></div><div class="quote_body">Mr Graham told Today: "Mark will be working with Odex to demonstrate that we were under contract to Odex and that our data identified the IP addresses of individuals who were downloading and sharing copyrighted material licensed by Odex."</div></blockquote>It is strange that why do they want to prove this in the court, when in the 1st place, the main reason in DJ Ernest Lau dismissing the case is that Odex is not the copyright owner or exclusive licensee of all but one anime video titled Mobile Suit Gundam Seed.<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/207450.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/articles/207450.asp</a><br><blockquote>But the judge said under the Copyright Act, "only the copyright owner and the statutory exclusive licensee Â… have the right to take action against copyright infringers".<br><br>Odex appeared to be the exclusive licensee for just one title, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, the judge added.<br><br>Even then, the Act only gives the exclusive licensee the right to take civil action against the infringer.</blockquote>More drama in place??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some information about BayTSP (the company that ODEX hired)'s methods in using automated "crawlers" to sniff..<br><br>There has been claims that its actions may be considered as tresspassing. After all, this is a company whose CEO is a former hacker, Mike Ishikawa.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Next week in my Â“IT and the LawÂ” course, we're discussing cyber-trespass. Reading the course materials got me to wondering whether BayTSP might be a cyber-trespasser.<br><br>BayTSP is a small company that works for copyright holders, monitoring the contents of P2P networks. Among other things, they query individual computers on the P2P networks, to see what they contain. Are those queries trespasses?<br><br>The closest case is probably eBay v. Bidder's Edge, in which a Federal judge granted a preliminary injunction that stopped Bidder's Edge from using a web crawler to access eBay's site. The judge found it likely that the automated accesses by Bidder's Edge to eBay�s site were trespasses. And it wasn't that Bidder's Edge was hammering eBay's site with so many requests that the site's reliability or response time were affected and the impact of the accesses was minimal, but the judge found that that was enough to get over the legal bar.<br><br>To be precise, eBay claimed that the accesses constituted Â“trespass to chattelsÂ”, a legal term that is defined roughly as intentionally messing around with somebody else's stuff in a way that causes damage. It's a step, but not a huge one, from the Bidder's Edge ruling to a claim that BayTSP's activity constitutes trespass to chattels. It's far from certain that a court would take that step; and bear in mind that the Bidder's Edge ruling was criticized by many at the time.<br><br>BayTSP argues that what they are doing is legitimate, because P2P users are publishing the information for anybody to see, and BayTSP is only doing what any member of the public could do. That argument seems pretty strong. But Bidder's Edge made the same argument, and it wasn't enough to save them.<br><br>My guess is that a lawsuit against BayTSP, even if brought by a sympathetic plaintiff, would be a long shot. And I think such a lawsuit probably should fail, just as the Bidder's Edge ruling should have gone the other way.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=516" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=516</a><br><br>Go and read up on EBay vs Bidder's Edge in the American courts. BayTSP's methods are similar to what was used, in that there is widespread automated data crawlers(I think that's what they are) querying P2P networks, which may be used for legal transfer of files between individuals and corporations.<br><br>Does their activity pose a threat to the network's resources? Possibly.<br><br>(Chattels = Property, usually private property)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My question is, why is Odex/Gamesmart, itself a pirated goods company with some of its directors having been jailed, spearheading this anti-piracy drive? I just don't get it<br><br>this is like getting a bunch of paedophiles to organise an anti-child pornography campaign!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
