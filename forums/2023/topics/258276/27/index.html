            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Anime downloads: Grey areas</strong><br>More clarity needed with regard to important issues relating to the Odex case<br><br>Monday Â• August 20, 2007<br><br>Letter from Toh Hsia Yee<br><br>The recent attempt by Singapore distributor Odex to halt illegal downloads of Japanese animation raises many hard questions which need to be answered.<br><br>Foremost, it was reported that Odex had sought the identities of 1,000 subscribers from each Internet service provider. Based on the the reported compensation of between $3,000 and $5,000 per person, this would net Odex something between $9 million and $15 million.<br><br>Is this sum to compensate royalties, investigation costs or administration charges?<br><br>Is it also Odex's prerogative to impose a 10-per-cent interest rate on instalment arrangements for people Â— often minors Â— who cannot afford such payment?<br><br>Second, Odex is not the sole distributor of all Japanese animation in Singapore. Poh Kim and Blue Max also license popular series such as Bleach and Naruto respectively, while some titles remain completely unlicensed.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no way for the average Internet user to know which series come under Odex. Its website is perennially under construction and the only unofficial list is one compiled by netizens on Wikipedia.<br><br>How can Singaporeans respect Odex's copyrights when they do not even know what Odex has rights over?<br><br>In addition, an extensive list of licensed Japanese animation can be found on the website of Anti-Video Piracy Association Singapore, or Avpas.<br><br>However, it appears from visits to local shops around Singapore that most of these series are simply not, if ever, released for sale.<br><br>A reasonable production time-lag is acceptable but when the wait is four years and counting, this business practice becomes rather dubious.<br><br>Lastly, Odex explained that it was compelled to take further action when rampant downloading persisted even after Odex sent letters to 17 illegal downloaders in May this year.<br><br>Does this mean that those who heeded the warning will not be penalised if they stopped promptly from May?<br><br>It is imperative that these issues are addressed if Singapore wishes to remain a clear, transparent and intellectual property-abiding nation. The law must be respected but should never be exploited.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Odex Â— having your cake and eating it too<br><br>Here is my summary of what I think of OdexÂ’s grand scheme to dominate the local market in one daring move, and why I think they will fail terribly and spoil it for the rest of us. As some of you may or may not know, I met with Peter Go, director of Odex, twice before and had some discussions with him long before the start of the on-going fiasco (after he read my letter). At that time, I promised him that I would not reveal anything that was said during our private conversations, so I shall honour that promise. Not that I have a need to, now that Odex has shown its hand and everything has been made public. Anyway, just hoping to clear up some FUDs that have been making their rounds in every single forum thread on the topic.<br><br>Anti-Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) is not affliated to the government.<br>Never was, never will be.<br><br><strong>Odex is the sole active member of AVPAS.</strong><br><br>Although Odex is inconspicuously in the middle of the member list of AVPAS, it is not too much a stretch to say that AVPAS is essentially Odex and not much more. Basically itÂ’s like how music labels use RIAA to redirect the bad publicity away from their brand names, except that Odex is failing horribly at it because they were too lazy to create a letterhead for AVPAS and decided to use their own instead. Big mistake.<br><br><strong>Odex is not, and has never been, the dominant proliferator of anime in Singapore.</strong><br><br>They may be the one with all the licensing rights, but exponential growth of animeÂ’s popularity seen locally was not their doing. Odex VCDs and DVDs have never received the level of acceptance and respect given to R1 DVDs by the American anime community. With or without BitTorrent.<br><br><strong>Odex employees download fansubs.</strong><br><br>According to various personal blogs belonging to related individuals. Or just common sense. I mean, the only reason why those people are working for Odex is because they are anime viewers. Where do almost all Singaporean fans get their anime fix from? Hint: it ainÂ’t packaged in silver. Are their employees being issued similar letters?<br><br><strong>Odex did not send any warnings.</strong><br><br>When a local blogger first mentioned in passing that Odex was going to take legal actions, they denied it and refused to comment on it. Then one day the letters started flying out of the blue and immediately started to demand money. This really makes one question OdexÂ’s intention.<br><br><strong>As a private entity, Odex cannot file a criminal suit.</strong><br><br>Although they mentioned Â“fines of $10,000 per item and imprisonment of 5 yearsÂ” in their letter, Odex can do nothing of that sort. They can launch a civil suit against you and if they win they can claim damages incurred. But they cannot force the relevant authorities to press criminal charges against you. That is up to the government to decide.<br><br><strong>Neither can Odex prevent any criminal charges.</strong><br><br>Even if you pay Odex their $3,000 or so, there is nothing to stop the government from pressing criminal charges against you. Copyright infringement is a criminal offence in Singapore. Odex can do nothing to interfere with that. In fact, even if they promise not to sue you themselves, there is nothing that legally prevents them from reporting you to the relevant authorities. In fact, it would be illegal for them to make such a promise.<br><br><strong>Odex claims $3,000-$5,000 settlement is for legal and tracking fees.</strong><br><br>With 1,000 subpoenaed IP addresses per ISP for SingNet, Starhub and PacNet, we end up with exactly 3,000 IP addresses being affected. LetÂ’s very generously estimate that PacNet manages to appeal successfully and protect the identity of its subscribers and that 1/3 of the addresses are either duplicates (due to dynamic IP assignment) or otherwise unsuitable for OdexÂ’s purpose (e.g. employees, friends and/or relatives). We are still left with about 1,300 or so targets. LetÂ’s assume that everyone only has to pay, on average, $3,000. That is a total of 3.9 million dollars we are talking about, and that is the low end assumption. It can potentially be twice as much if you change a few variables.<br><br>According to this The New Paper article, Odex enlisted the help of a US company in tracking BitTorrent downloads. It doesnÂ’t take 3.9 million dollars to run a bunch of servers to auto-scrape at regular intervals every torrent file posted on AnimeSuki and TokyoTosho using their RSS feeds. As for legal fees, Odex mailed their letter using their own letterhead and, from the accounts of people who received the letter, there is no indication that a lawyer was present during their meetings with Odex representatives. Which means that Odex only had to pay for at most legal advices, if anything at all. Certainly not worth 3.9 million dollars.<br><br>All that money has to go somewhere. I wonder whereÂ…<br><br><strong>Odex has already paid all the necessary fees.</strong><br><br>At least, that seems to be a logical assumption, since people donÂ’t work for free. In other words, Odex created this elaborate scheme to instil fear, uncertainty and doubt into fansub downloaders, but they donÂ’t want to have to pay for it themselves. So now they are asking you to pay up. They want to have your cake and eat it too. Also, what happens when they have collected enough to make back their original investment? I doubt it was anything more than $100,000, unless people really do pay millions(!?) of dollars for someone to scrape torrent trackers, in which case I shall end my rant here because I have a company to start up. After making back their investment, will Odex cease this futile fear mongering or will they earn some profits while they are at it? Have they already earned back their investment? I think there are a lot of questions in this area that need answering.<br><br><strong>Odex does not have a foolproof case in court.</strong><br><br>There is little precedence to work with, but there are many holes in their argument. The only evidence they have of your infringement is the IP address, which may not be enough.<strong>Various people have also reported that they were turned away when they went to talk to Odex with a lawyer, which is an indication that Odex is uncertain about the validity of its claims. At least one person was advised by his lawyer to ignore the letter and delete all the things he downloaded.</strong> So far Odex has not taken any actions against him. If more people refuse to pay up, Odex may be forced to either sue someone to make an example of him or to give up on this whole endeavour. If they do sue, there is no guarantee of victory and it is very hard to guess how much damages the court will award even if they win. It may even be less than $3,000-$5,000.<br><br><strong>You are not guilty until proven so in court.</strong><br><br><strong>You are not obligated to show anything to Odex just because they send you a letter.</strong> You do not have to admit to anything and you should not incriminate yourself. Ask them for all the evidence they have against you. Ask them to explain clearly how each piece of evidence proves their claims. Ask them for a breakdown of the payment and why the amount varies from person to person, especially since they claim that it is supposed to be for the fees they have incurred. Do not sign anything. Seek legal advice if possible.<br><br><strong>Odex is attempting to launch a Video-On-Demand service.</strong><br><br>Prevent people from downloading and then launch their own service. It seemed like the perfect plan. Unfortunately, it was delayed (perhaps indefinitely), leaving people with nothing but an empty Â“under constructionÂ” page. Also, consider the next pointÂ…<br><br>[b]The Odex brand is permanently tainted.<br><br>Who is going to utilize a VOD service if Odex does manage to get it up eventually? The same teenage anime fans that are defacing pictures of Stephen Sing, the other director of Odex, on HWZ now? Somehow, I donÂ’t think so. Mr. Peter Go also mentioned in the TNP article that Odex sales fell 50% in 2006. Well, whoÂ’s taking bets for 2007? In the unlikelihood that sales actually improve, it can only be attributed to market demands generated by certain pyrotechnic displays. Seriously, I have bought Odex VCDs before and now I wonÂ’t ever again. How exactly was this supposed to be a response to poor sales again?<br><br>[b]My General Paper teacher read about this in the papers and he thinks that Odex is just being greedy.<br><br>This is the first time my teacher has heard of Odex. His opinion is that if Odex was really working for the public good, they should have given sufficient prior warnings. ItÂ’s very sad when such an unpleasant undertaking becomes your companyÂ’s sole source of publicity for most of the population who has, until now, been completely oblivious to your existence. Contrary to the popular old saying, there is such a thing as bad publicity, especially when you are trying to sell something.<br><br>[b]Most other forms of downloading are not affected.<br><br>HTTP, FTP, IRC, video streaming sites and a whole lot more. BitTorrent just so happens to be easily monitored due to every torrent file having its own tracker and swarm. But no US company is going to be able to log your HTTP downloads without violating some much more serious laws. While P2P file-sharing networks are vulnerable, they are much less so than BitTorrent due to the different nature in file distribution. Ultimately, this crackdown will only serve to increase the popularity of crunchyroll and similar video streaming sites, which is indeed a terrible prospect for those of us who somewhat value video quality, but does nothing for OdexÂ’s stated goal of fighting illegal downloads.<br><br><a href="http://www.darkmirage.com/2007/08/19/odex-having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkmirage.com/2007/08/19/odex-having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was looking at some of the bitorrent packets.  And I really have no idea how on earth to differentiate which packet was for an anime or other data.<br><br>2ndly, It seems that the packets themselves only carry the IP addresses, (saw a lot of ISPs, from Malaysia, Yugoslavia and USA as well ) but nothing that can pin point a user like a mac address.<br><br>With most users at home operating WLANs, its even harder to accuse a person of "illegal" download with tools such as bitorrent.   Most of the WLAN security (WEP, WPA) technology we see in Home Router/access points can be easily broken into within 2-4 hrs.<br><br>I agree with the previous forum post that there is always plausible deniability here.  Unless Odex wants to fork out more money to conduct computer forensics testing on your equipment, they can't prove you, downloaded any "illegal" anime as they would put it.<br><br>Odex is not a governing authority in anime downloads in Singapore.  IMO, as long as you don't download THEIR fansub, I don't see that they have any case at all.<br><br>Maybe if the government intervenes and explicitly indicates that downloading ANY JAPANESE ANIMATION, instead of buying ODEX products is ILLEGAL, then we are screwed.<br><br>Who wants to create a new version the Monopoly game with me?  We replace all the estate names with Anime titles instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue of wireless certainly will raise questions. But we need concrete proof. If you yourself don't use P2P, then it's possible to win the case. I'm pretty sure the laws here allow a forensic scientist to examine the hard disk. If offered this option, get a forensic scientist to examine the hard disk, to prove that no P2P softwares have never been installed before.<br><br>However, if you use P2P, you better be prepared for fight hard.<br><br>There's also another issue to point out. MAC addresses can be fake, as long as the user have the technical know-how. It's pretty easy to do it in Windows and Linux (don't ask me how, I do a lot of illegal stuffs... so this isn't new to me).<br><br>Of the so many users caught, I don't believe none will know how to change their MAC address, unless it can't be changed (for minority of the network cards, but it still can be bypassed).<br><br>Not to say I'm helping ODEX, we have to be clear on facts here.<br><br>Anyway, I doubt if ODEX could obtain a warrant to do a forensic on your hardware, simply because they can't. They are after all a private entity. Unless of course, this case is turned in to the police. Then it's another issue.</div>
