            <div class='col-md body'>It has been noted that Article 38 of Japan's copyright law allows parties to 'distribute by wire a work already broadcast for non-profit purposes'. - Andy Ho, Straits Times 16th August 2007<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_148784.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_148784.html</a><br><br>Let's take a look at the Copyright Law of Japan.<br><br><a href="http://www.cric.or.jp/cric_e/clj/cl2_1.html#cl2_1+SS5" rel="nofollow">http://www.cric.or.jp/cric_e/clj/cl2_1.html#cl2_1+SS5</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Performance, etc. not for profit-making)<br>Article 38<br><br>(2) It shall be permissible to diffuse by wire a work already broadcast, for non-profit-making purposes and without charging any fees to audience or spectators.<br>(3) It shall be permissible to communicate publicly, by means of a receiving apparatus, a work already broadcast or diffused by wire, for non-profit-making purposes and without charging any fees to audience or spectators. The same shall apply to such public communication made by means of a receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in private homes"</span><br><br>The above two Sections of Article 38 places reasonable and fair doubt on ODEX's affidavit and claim to act on TV Tokyo's behalf, until the latter has expressively stated that it has authorised ODEX in a publicly accessible or notarised document, served notice in either Japanese or Singaporean press or any publicly available channel of communication, or accessible through a document request filed in a Japanese court (may or may not be under the  Government Organizations Information Disclosure Law. I do not know if TV Tokyo is a state-owned enterprise of Japan);  that ODEX may take legal action for TV Tokyo in Singapore for any perceived breach of copyright.<br><br>However, do note that Article 38 applies to companies and individuals under Japanese jurisdiction. Therefore, where does that place ODEX's tale of allegedly suing on behalf of TV Toyko in any correct or believable context at this current moment?<br><br>Like I said, is anyone going to call the bluff and enquire with the studio in Japan or the Japanese authorities concerned?<br><br>This thread should be flame-free and meant for rational discussion on the legal aspects and legality of ODEX's claim of authorised representation for TV Tokyo.<br><br></div>

It appears that ODEX is rely on section 136.<br><br>Let's see 136(1):<br><br><strong>136. Â—(1) A person who at a time when copyright subsists in a work</strong> Â—<br><br>(a) makes for sale or hire;<br>(b) sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade offers or exposes for sale or hire; or<br>(c) by way of trade exhibits in public,<br><br>any article which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be an infringing copy of the work shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the article or for each article in respect of which the offence was committed or $100,000, whichever is the lower, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.<br>----<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe downloaders will not fall under 136(1) as they don't satisfy 136(1)(a) to (c) [Continued in 3.]</span><br><br>he then goes on to mention that even under Section 136, the accusation is on shaky ground.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">3. Let's now consider s136(2):<br><br><strong>136(2) A person who at a time when copyright subsists in a work has in his possession or imports into Singapore any article which he knows, or ought reasonably to know, to be an infringing copy of the work for the purpose of</strong> Â—<br><br>(a) selling, letting for hire, or by way of trade offering or exposing for sale or hire, the article;<br>(b) distributing the article for the purpose of trade, or for any other purpose to an extent that will affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright in the work; or<br>(c) by way of trade exhibiting the article in public,<br><br>shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for the article or for each article in respect of which the offence was committed or $100,000, whichever is the lower, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.<br>---<br><br>Once again, a normal downloader will not infringe this section, as the commercial element required in this subsection is not satisfied. </span><br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1698411" rel="nofollow">Link</a><br><br>---------------------------<br><br>Right, now we see that in both Sections, the offence hinges on "will affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright in the work"<br><br>Now then, consider that the owner(s) of the copyright of the work falls under their own Copyright Law in Japan. One might argue quite successfully about the unique nature of fan-sub culture in that it drives community growth and diffusion of product popularity, and key sideline business as well..<br><br>Andy Ho wrote a damn tight article.
