              <p id="paragrah">When it was announced in April that ¥11.7 billion had been set 
              aside in 2009's supplementary budget to create a new National Center for Media 
              Arts (NCMA) — a museum for manga, <em>anime,</em> video games and technology art — 
              the news was greeted in the same way that most cultural-policy issues are in 
              Japan.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">In other words, except for a few short, businesslike reports, it 
              was ignored.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">By the end of May, however, the plan had rocketed to center 
              stage. In his first debate with Prime Minister Taro Aso, new Democratic Party of 
              Japan President Yukio Hatoyama devoted one of just seven questions to the 
              supplementary budget and what he derisively referred to as the "State-run Manga 
              Cafe."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The need for a central facility to research, archive and exhibit 
              the country's popular culture — and to act as a kind of international 
              clearinghouse for these art forms — has been debated in think tanks hosted by 
              the government's Agency for Cultural Affairs for around a decade. So long had 
              deliberations dragged on that in an interview with The Japan Times this time 
              last year, Tamotsu Aoki, the agency's head, said he didn't think the plan would 
              get off the ground any time soon.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">But what a difference 12 months can make.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Not only is the plan off the ground, but with the supplementary 
              budget now enacted by the Diet, it is hurtling toward fruition at a very 
              unbureaucratic speed. "Our job is to proceed with preparations as quickly as 
              possible," Aoki told this newspaper last week.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Yet while most commentators on cultural policy are cautiously 
              applauding the development, important questions remain. Why, for instance, has 
              the plan developed so swiftly over the last year? Why is the DPJ so hostile to 
              it? And will the facility meet the expectations of those who have called for its 
              creation for so long?</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The answers to the first two questions are related. Put simply, 
              the DPJ thinks the plan was fast-tracked either on the orders of, or to curry 
              favor with, Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is a fan of anime and manga.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"It's Taro Aso who likes anime. Now the bureaucracy has decided 
              to build (a museum) for him. . . . It's a nonsense and a terrible waste of 
              money," Hatoyama told an audience in Aomori on May 9. (For most media outlets, 
              it was this speech that made the NCMA newsworthy.)</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Yoshiyuki Oshita, a cultural policy specialist at Mitsubishi UFJ 
              Research and Consulting, said that Hatoyama's and the DPJ's attacks could be 
              explained in one of two ways. "Either they are being made without proper 
              understanding of the Agency for Cultural Affairs' proposed plan," said Oshita, 
              noting that the NCMA is not just for manga and anime, but also for technology 
              and digital arts. Or the criticisms "represent a purely politically motivated 
              intervention into the cultural sphere," he said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">There's probably some truth in both analyses. But the degree to 
              which Aso was really involved in the plan's genesis is debatable.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The first official mention of a national facility for media arts 
              was made in February 2007, in the Second Basic Policy on the Promotion of 
              Culture and the Arts. "There is a need to consider the establishment of an 
              international facility for new cultural art forms such as media art," noted that 
              document — approved by then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Even that was hardly out of the blue. The original Basic Policy, 
              from 2002, had declared that "young media artists should be nurtured . . . and 
              facilities related to these art forms" should be bolstered. And since 1997, the 
              Agency for Cultural Affairs has been hosting an annual two-week Japan Media Arts 
              Festival celebrating these arts.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Last year, just a year into his tenure as head of the agency, 
              Aoki, an academic by training, created an advisory panel to examine ways in 
              which Japan could improve the promotion of its culture abroad. In its final 
              report, the panel urged that the issue of the establishment of a museum for 
              media arts be "addressed quickly."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Heeding that advice, in July 2008 Aoki set up a second committee 
              to consider preparations for such a facility. Chaired by University of Tokyo 
              Professor Yasuki Hamano, the body published a report this April that has become 
              a rough blueprint for the new facility.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While the NCMA plan's decade-long gestation period precludes it 
              from having been initiated entirely at the behest of Aso, the timing of the 
              Hamano committee's report has raised eyebrows.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="paragrah">An Agency for Cultural Affairs spokesperson confirmed that "there 
              had been talk within the committee that their report would be published in the 
              summer." For some reason, however, that date was advanced to April — in time to 
              be included in the supplementary budget. The DPJ thinks this speed-up followed 
              pressure from Aso, and that — in the words of DPJ Diet member, Seiji Ohsaka — 
              "they've rushed it into the budget before anything is decided."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Agency for Cultural Affairs head Aoki explained what happened as 
              follows: "In March, we were told it would be possible to apply for funding for 
              this kind of facility within the supplementary budget. We were very appreciative 
              of this opportunity."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">In other words, the "pressure" — if it can be called that — was 
              interpreted less as a stick than as a carrot, and a particularly attractive one 
              at that.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"The Agency's annual budget is very small in comparison with 
              other countries," Aoki added, noting its ¥102 billion allocation for 2009 is 
              about a third less than South Korea's and seven times less than France's. "This 
              opportunity was much appreciated," he repeated.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Of course, the official line on the NCMA plan's inclusion in the 
              supplementary budget is that it will serve as a fiscal stimulus in the current 
              economic downturn — which is why the supplementary budget was created in the 
              first place.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Mitsubishi UFJ's Oshita added his analytic weight to this 
              argument, explaining that in terms of immediate economic stimulus, ¥11.7 billion 
              spent on a museum is no worse, and no better, than spending it on a new road or 
              bridge or, for that matter, "digging a hole and filling it again." The important 
              question, he said, is whether or not it can stimulate industry in the 
              future.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Promotion of Japan's so-called media-contents industries 
              (including manga, anime, TV and film) has recently become a high priority within 
              several government ministries — including the Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
              Industry, the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry and the Foreign 
              Ministry. Hence it was probably this prioritization, Oshita suggested, that 
              convinced Cabinet members that the NCMA-as-fiscal-stimulus idea was worth a 
              try.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The DPJ's objections to the NCMA have subsided slightly since the 
              ruling Liberal Democratic Party used their coalition majority in the Lower House 
              to enact the supplementary budget — effectively overruling the objections of the 
              Upper House's DPJ majority. However, argument about the NCMA will likely flare 
              again during the upcoming election. Importantly, the DPJ is refusing to say 
              whether or not it will terminate the plan if it wins power. "We're still 
              considering how to approach that issue," a party spokesperson said by phone last 
              week.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">For his part, Aoki would not be drawn on the consequences of a 
              change of government. "We will respond to the circumstances in which we find 
              ourselves," he said.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">So, as things stand — and with ¥11.7 billion now in the coffers 
              for buying land and constructing the building — it is full speed ahead as far as 
              the Agency for Cultural Affairs is concerned.</p>

              <p id="paragrah">The April report tentatively names the new facility the Kokuritsu 
              Media Geijutsu Sogo Senta (which, for lack of an official version, this writer 
              translates as "National Center for Media Arts"). It also recommends that the 
              center should be four or five stories high and around 10,000 sq. meters in total 
              area — and that it should be built within the next two or three years in Tokyo's 
              waterfront Odaiba district.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">As for its activities, the plan says the NCMA should research, 
              collect, nurture and exhibit the work of young creators in the fields of manga, 
              anime, video games and art forms using computers or electronic media.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">It is envisaged that such a center would attract 600,000 visitors 
              a year, including researchers and tourists from around the world, and generate 
              ¥150 million in ticket sales annually.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">However, nothing is set in stone, and deliberations on all of 
              these details are set to continue within the NCMA "planning office" recently 
              established within the Agency for Cultural Affairs, and also within a new 
              committee of specialists that will be convened in the near future. An Agency 
              spokesperson revealed to The Japan Times on Friday that the new committee will 
              publish a revised "basic plan" for the NCMA in July and that an architectural 
              competition will be held soon after that. In September the architect, location 
              and a detailed NCMA "project plan" will be announced.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">In terms of attracting researchers from abroad, most commentators 
              agree that the potential is great. "Still," explained Jaqueline Berndt, deputy 
              director of Kyoto International Manga Museum's research center, "I worry whether 
              this will be a scholarly institution. At the moment we get many many e-mails 
              from foreign scholars, especially graduate students, who want to research or 
              want information or resources." The new NCMA, she said, will need the resources 
              and staff to foster such exchanges.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">It is also expected that the facility will be popular with 
              tourists. "This could be a really vital tourist resource," said Takeshi Komiya, 
              senior director of HIS Experience Japan, a leading inbound travel agency. But he 
              warned: "You can't just say, 'OK, we built a center.' You need to explain to 
              visitors, 'Yes, we have Kyoto and Nara, but this is also an important part of 
              Japanese culture.' "</p>

              <p id="paragrah">Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the April report is that it 
              says management of the facility will be outsourced to private enterprise, with 
              the intention of it being entirely self-financing.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The closest thing to a precedent for such a business model would 
              be Japan's regional museums, management of which can now be outsourced to 
              "independent administrators." The key difference, however, is that in the case 
              of the regional museums, the independent administrators are paid a set fee to 
              run the facilities. The NCMA administrator would have to operate the entire 
              institution solely on whatever income they manage to wring from it.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Even stranger is the suggestion that the NCMA's collection would 
              be bankrolled by its own income. It is hard to imagine that a private management 
              firm appointed on a three- or perhaps five-year contract would bother expending 
              precious operating funds on a cost-heavy, largely unprofitable collection.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"There has been talk of there being some manga artists willing to 
              donate works to the NCMA," one Agency for Cultural Affairs spokesperson said 
              sheepishly, before Aoki added that this, too, is an area awaiting further 
              consideration.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">The planned NCMA has also been criticized from within the manga 
              and anime fraternities.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Manga artist Kei Ishizaka declared at a DPJ hearing on the plan 
              that, "manga fans would not come and look at original drawings hung in frames 
              using government money."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">But, for every skeptic, there appears to be a supporter.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">For instance, manga artist Machiko Satonaka was so "fearful that 
              the plan would be swept aside" that she gathered like-minded colleagues and set 
              up her own press conference on June 4 to register their support.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"The preservation and restoration of precious original manga 
              drawings, which are deteriorating rapidly, is urgently required," she told the 
              assembled reporters.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Others still have voiced concerns that the NCMA plan might be a 
              cynical attempt by the government to enlist manga and anime for the enhancement 
              of Japan's geopolitical influence. If so, that's news to Berndt, of the Kyoto 
              International Manga Museum. She recalled a recent foreign graduate student 
              hellbent on uncovering just such a motivation. "Maybe from a European 
              perspective, it looks like that, but in Japan . . . there really isn't one," she 
              said, almost with a hint of disappointment.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Still, perhaps the most important point is one that Aoki, from 
              his position as head of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, is at pains to 
              make.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">"People keep referring to this as a museum of manga and anime, 
              but it is not," he said. "It also includes all the technology and digital forms 
              of expression."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Mitsubishi UFJ's Oshita went even further. "The definition of 
              media art is very difficult. Although it does include manga and printed matter, 
              I think at its core will be the idea of <em>eizo</em> (video content)," he said. 
              "As can be seen from the popularity of (video-sharing Web site) YouTube, videos 
              are now the central parlance of the Internet. They will change the way we 
              communicate."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Oshita sees the new facility as a potential clearinghouse to 
              filter out and preserve the best of the myriad, but ephemeral, video content 
              that now floods the Internet — from television programs to advertising to 
              amateur-produced parodies and video diaries.</p>
              <p id="paragrah">While not quite as revolutionary in his thinking, Aoki also has 
              his sights set on distinguishing Japan from the rest of the world. "Japan has 
              been a global leader not just in anime and manga, but in digital art," he said. 
              "Making a facility like this is a way to maintain that leadership."</p>
              <p id="paragrah">Perhaps. But while Aoki and others are keeping one eye on the 
              world and the other on the task of quickly planning for their new facility, 
              there's a lingering threat that in the next few months their feet could be 
              pulled from under them, and the museum could be demolished before it is ever 
              built.</p>
