            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Come i translate the Lianhe Wanbao version (although my lang skills aso cmi one)</span><br><br>Japan, 16 Yr Old Girl Cleaved her Father to Death<br><br>(Tokyo Associated Press)<br>"I hate my father". This was the reason that the girl killed her father, cleaving him with a axe when he was asleep. She made at least 2 cuts on his neck, causing him to die due to excessive blood loss.<br><br>The girl washed her face of blood after the kill, and sat there until the police arrested her. Around 5am JST (6am SGT), her mother made the police report, saying that "My husband was killed". Police arrived at the house to find the second floor filled with blood and a guy lying there. He was pronounced dead and after investigations, was found to be a policeman as well.<br><br>The Police said that the guy, aged 45, was Kyoto's Traffic Department's Policeman and lived with his wife and 2 daughters. His 16 year old daughter took a hand axe 30 cm height, 11 cm wide blade and made 2 cuts on the left side of his neck (thats where the aorta is... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ). He died without a struggle.<br><br>The girls admitted to killing her father.<br><br>"I hate my father, thats why i used the axe to kill him, the axe was bought from a home appliance store last week..."<br><br>She remained calm through the intergoration.<br><br>According to the police reports, she said that she was unhappy with her father's private life and was irritated by him. Her mother admitted that her daughter had indeed spoken that she doesnt like her father. Her elder sister however said that her father was a "Outstanding" one and would never use force on his family members.<br><br>The article then ends with reports of past murder incidents......<br><br><a href="http://randomc.animeblogger.net" rel="nofollow">randomc.animeblogger.net</a> has also reported that due to this murder, the anime 'School Days' final episode airing was cancelled by at least 1 televesion studio.<br><br></div>
