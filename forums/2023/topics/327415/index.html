              <p><strong>LAST YEAR: Local firm Odex takes legal action against illegal downloaders of anime <br> <br> NOW: Japanese anime producer sends lawyer's letters  <br> <br> By Liew Hanqing <br> August 15, 2008</strong> <br> <br> ANIME fans beware - the copyright holders of these Japanese cartoons
              are still cracking down on those who download them illegally. <br> <br> <img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-08-14/NP_IMAGES_HQSHOW.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <br> The New Paper, 2 Aug 2007.  <br> <br> Singapore law firm Rajah &amp; Tann is now acting on behalf of Japanese
              anime producer and distributor Showgate Inc to enforce its copyright
              here.<br> <br> Showgate owns the copyright to popular anime series, including Devil May Cry and Great Guardians.<br> <br> It is not known how many letters have been sent out so far.<br> <br> The New Paper obtained a copy of the letter, which stated that the
              users had allegedly downloaded anime through BitTorrent, a popular
              file-sharing program, and that these downloads were an infringement of
              Showgate's copyrights.<br> <br> <strong>7 DAYS TO RESPOND </strong><br> The owners of the Internet accounts that were allegedly used for the
              downloads have been invited to 'enter discussions' with Showgate's
              lawyers.<br> <br> They have seven days to respond to the letters, failing which, legal action will be taken.<br> <br> Last year, local anime distributor Odex undertook similar enforcement
              action, sending letters to hundreds of netizens who had allegedly
              downloaded bootleg copies of anime series licensed to Odex.<br> <br> Downloaders were ordered to pay Odex up to $5,000 in reimbursement for
              its enforcement expenses, and to sign letters of undertaking not to
              repeat their offences.<br> <br> Showgate is an associate member of the Anti Video Piracy Association of
              Singapore (AVPAS), a local anti-piracy alliance founded by Odex in 2003.<br> <br> Odex director Stephen Sing, who is also secretary of AVPAS, told The
              New Paper that he found out only yesterday that Showgate had begun
              cracking down on errant downloaders, after a colleague told him about
              online discussions about it.<br> <br> <strong>SHOWGATE CONSULTED ODEX </strong><br> He said Showgate was one of the Japanese companies that had consulted
              with Odex when the local anime distributor conducted enforcement
              activities against downloaders last year.<br> <br> Mr Sing said: 'Last year, we acted on behalf of the Japanese companies and were mainly just following their instructions.'<br> <br> This time, it appears that Showgate is acting independently.<br> <br> One netizen, who received a letter on Tuesday from Showgate's lawyers,
              posted a thread on a popular online forum asking fellow netizens for
              advice on his next course of action.<br> <br> In his posts, he admitted to having downloaded copies of Devil May Cry in April this year.<br> <br> He added that he plans to seek legal advice before responding to the letter.<br> <br> The New Paper tried contacting him via e-mail and through the online forum, but there was no reply.<br> <br> The New Paper asked Rajah &amp; Tann several questions, including
              whether information on the downloaders had been obtained from all three
              Internet service providers, and what kind of settlement their client
              was looking at.<br> <br> But one of its lawyers would only say: 'We have no instructions from
              our clients, the respective Japanese copyright owners, to issue any
              press statements or respond to queries at this point of time.' <br> <br> - With additional reporting by Andre Yeo <br> <br> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> <br> <strong>Odex's first salvo: May 2007</strong><br> <br> <img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-08-14/NP_IMAGES_HQSHOW_8.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <br> Odex director Stephen Sing. --ST File Picture  <br> <br> <strong>MAY 2007</strong> Local anime distributor Odex gets court order requiring Internet
              service provider (ISP) SingNet to release account information of users
              whose accounts are linked to illegal downloads of anime distributed by
              the company.<br> <br> It sends letters to them, and also hires US company to track illegal
              downloads and trace users. Downloaders each made to pay $3,000 to
              $5,000 in reimbursement to the company.<br> <br> <strong>AUG 2007</strong> StarHub asked to disclose names of illegal downloaders. Incident
              creates uproar among netizens, who call it privacy infringement.<br> <br> Soon after, Odex director Stephen Sing is flamed online and threatened. Anti-Odex online campaigns follow.<br> <br> <strong>SEP 2007</strong> Mr Sing announces that Odex will not send any more letters to Internet
              users with a recent history of illegal downloading, provided they stop
              at once. <br> <br> <strong>JAN 2008</strong> High Court orders ISP PacNet to
              give up names of users who illegally downloaded anime to be sent to six
              Japanese anime studios.</p>

              <p>I guess it is. I watch quite a lot from said sites too. As with this Odex case, if the producers/proprieters of the content you're watching doesn't care, then you're quite safe.</p>
              <p>In other words, if the copyright holders decide to take action, you would probably find yourself in the similar predicament as the... vicitims in this Odex saga.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, though. I bet many are also watching illegal content on online video sites. Therefore, you'll never be along should <em>someone</em> decide to take action.</p>
