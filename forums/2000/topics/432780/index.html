              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">The four-year-old Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan's relationship is going through strain. Says an insider, "They are having some issues. They have been arguing and fighting a lot, more than normal couples do. And it isn't healthy. </span><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"><br></span><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"><br></span><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">One of the reasons for the differences is that they are not being able to </span><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"><span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;">spend time with each other. Bebo has always been the busier one (by choice) and Saif had no qualms about being with her on the outdoors of her films, whenever time permits. But since he began shooting for his last two films — Akarshan and Cocktail — things haven't been the same." <br><br>A source close to the couple adds, "The other matter is delicate. It's about the money being spent by the actress. While Saif doesn't mind splurging on his girl, he doesn't quite feel the same way about shelling out for her family's holidays etc. Especially now when he has been feeling the financial pressure with his second production Agent Vinod getting delayed. He was to shoot in seven countries before. But that changed and the budget was scaled down majorly. Before he left for his London outdoor, the couple had a huge fight about finances." <br>Saif has also been upset with Kareena for not spending enough time with him. She hasn't made time for their annual mid-year holidays as she's been shooting round the clock for Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan's home productions or her endorsements and attending promotional events. The source adds, "While the mid-yearly holiday in July appears impossible, even a Christmas holiday for Kareena looks difficult now as she starts promotions for Aamir's film then." <br><br>A production assistant from the sets of Bodyguard informs, "One day Kareena broke down while talking to him on the phone. She was emotional, and crying." Saif likes doing one or two films in a year, and likes his holidays and breaks in between. But this year, it looks impossible given her schedule, and he is irritated about that. <br><br>And finally, there are the rumours of Saif's bonding with Deepika Padukone. First on the 45-day schedule of Akrakshan and now Cocktail in London. Meanwhile, Kareena has found a confidante in Aamir Khan, her co-star in the untitled Reema Kagti film for which they have been shooting in Pondicherry for almost a month. <br><br>The source adds that Bebo has been advised to make time for her man if she wants to save her relationship. And that's one of the reasons why she took off to London. "It wasn't just for Madame Tussauds as projected. It was a work-cum-pleasure trip — taken to appease Saif in the wake of their fights and spend some quality time with him. Everyone close to the pair are hoping that they will sail through this rough patch and stay happily ever after.</span></span></p>
