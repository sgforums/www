BUT!! he started to ignore me when i speak to him.. he would have excuses like "i'm too tired" or "i've a very bad day today" .. i thought he was really stressed by the work load.. Then!! he started to come home late.. and gets very agitated when i speak to him.. i'm so worried about him.. i called his friends and asked is "Him" very stressful and tired about the family.. they said he was fine and asked me to give him freedom.. i thought that would helped.. i spoke to my sister about these but she told me to look up.. she had male friends who look for prostitute after work.. i started to get worried and try to check his phone.. there was no messages but there are alot of "unknown" calls.. if i ask him who called him, he would say it's his friends.. i couldn't do any thing as he have all his ways to hide from me.. i had my 1st baby.. i have no evidence to even question him.. i'm helpless.. i really need suggestion.. anyone have any suggestions??<br><br>Pls! i need help!!<br>[/b]</div>
