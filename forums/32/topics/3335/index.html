Oops (*sotongs prepare to shield himself from attacks from everywhere*)<br><br>Guys would say,"I'm going to choose her."<br><br>Gals would say,"Oh please choose me."<br><br>Some people would say, love at first sight can only be short-term. To some extend it is true, but not always.<br><br>I believe most of you had come across of friends who had a relationship for about 6 months and get married and they have a happy family.<br><br>I also believe most of you had come across of friends who had a relationship for many years, but get married and end up in divorce.<br><br>The most important senses that play a part for this Love at first "sight" of coz is your eyes. Some sayings, that the eyes is link to your heart. Chinese saying, "yan jing shi ling hun 1zhi 1chuang" not 4zhi 1chuang hor...that one is at your butt.<br><br>Your eyes never lie. I believe most of you can tell whether a person likes or don't like you by looking into his, or her eyes. It is not 100% accurate, but it is a good gauge.<br><br>Guys have the most powerful tools to use over a girl, that is the mouth. Guys who can talk very well are often very popular with girls.<br><br>Ladies have the most powerful tools to use against man, that is their eyes. Ladies that have eyes that can talk, will have lots of guys around her, not necessary to be very beautiful.<br><br>Hee...better dun tok to much liao...

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I dun agree with you guys as to sell yourself to a gal.  Doesn't mean that you can "sweet-talk" a gal, you can get her immediately.  More importantly is whether you two can click or not.  Love at first sight, yes it does happens but, as you grow and mature, you would not believe in such things anymore. You will tend to look for someone whom you can actually relate to.<br><br>For me, I believe that two persons must have the "chemistry", then they can then be together.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though a bit off topic here. But just something to add here. This hv nothing to do with love at first sight.<br><br>Spending on a car or other luxury is nothing bad or sinful... We all worked so hard sometimes is because we want to spend a little bit more on someone we love and something we dream to have. I believe every guys want to give the best to his wife and family. And every lady should know that your guy is trying his very best to provide the best he can afford to you. "Earn what u can spend comfortably and dun overspend what u can't earn."<br><br>Know our limits. The only good thing about going after luxury in life is, it inspires people to upgrade themselves. If everyone is too contented with what we have, we will still be living in the stone age.</div>
