So you help others with the<br>pursuit of knowledge.<br><br>You're the reason that people say teachers are also<br>students. You are as much a learner as a master, and this<br>fact satisfies you.<br><br>As you grow older you'll become more introspective,<br>wondering if your life meant anything.

Like Buddha of old, you can be a persuasive speaker, and you use your creative talents to further the objectives of your heart instead of your mind. Just be careful that your friends don't take advantage of your relaxed nature.<br><br>You would benefit from an occasional reminder that time is money. Though you might bristle at this cliche, it will actually protect your mellow demeanor. Let's face it - no one wants to be a doormat.<br><br>Above all, you like going with the flow. Oh yeah, you like to talk a lot, hang out over the bottomless cup of coffee (or, more likely, herbal tea), and philosophize about life's littlest mysteries. That's cool. Whatever.

You are completely selfless and full of love. As a concrete feeler, you do well with your emotions, which are very strong. You understand and appreciate why you feel the way you do and, for the most part, you're at peace with yourself.<br><br>Suffering in the world really disturbs you.<br><br>You are a motherly figure, even if you're a guy. The world's children need people like you.<br><br>On the rare occasions when you try to assert yourself, you're cute and awkward, but highly effective. Want to be even more effective? Toughen up (a little). Tae Kwon Do lessons or a Schwarzenegger double feature would be a good start.<br><br>Other HEALERS from the entertainment world include:<br><br>Robin Williams as the title character in Patch Adams<br><br>Jane Seymour as Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman<br><br>Eddie Murphy as the title character in Dr. Dolittle<br><br>Roma Downey as Monica in Touched by an Angel<br><br>Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life<br></div>

Learn to be a little more personable and you could be a great leader--you've definitely got the "vision" thing down.

Although you are an introvert, your dominant ideas lead you to assert yourself often--especially through your work. You actively put your creativity to constructive use and, because you are ruled by your heart, you are less likely to be inhibited by logic.<br><br>You have an intuitive understanding of emotion and know how to evoke it in others, but the real world can be a prison of foolishness and embarrassment if you don't get your head out of the clouds a little more. Also, you are 87% likely to write poetry.
