            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Life is very unpredictable</span><br><br>You will not know what is going to happen or what you have now will be with you in the future. What matters most is to be happy now, even if you're alone.<br><br>Being alone may not be a bad thing. At least for me now, I know that it's not easy to find true love and also to have the kind of respect and love from my other half.<br><br>Why settle with someone whom you don't love but just to have someone in your life? Keep searching. Heaven will provide only the best for you!<br><br>At least I know that I have my family and true and close friends. That matters too! If you have found your true love, congratulations! You're really blessed. But it doesn't stop there. You have to continue to maintain it and make the love grow. True love will never end.<br><br>Sometimes...<br><br>Sometimes in your life you might feel lonely. It's that time when you are all by yourself thinking for once in your life that you want to have someone to share your life with.<br><br>Sometimes you wonder what life would be like to have that special someone again. And sometimes you wonder whether if ever you will find the right person.<br><br>But what is right and and what is wrong you wonder.<br><br>How can you tell when you have met that person? How do you know that it will last? How can you tell that he or she will not change?<br><br>Sometimes when you met that someone, he will change as time goes by. Everyone changes you say. But if that somebody is really that someone you have been looking for, one thing should never change and that is his or her love for you.<br><br>You have heard of the famous saying "Through thick and thin" but most couples could not survive that period.<br><br>You have heard "Love conquers everything" Does it really? In search of love you sometimes get confused between infactuation and true love.<br><br>Infactuation is the thing that will not survive "thick and thin" and neither will it "conquers everything". How then you asked yourself, can you tell the difference.<br><br>Ask yourself, did this someone stick to you no matter what how many of your bad sides have you shown to him or her. Can you call this someone and ask for help or favour and he or she and you will not fear "no" as an answer. Can you rely on this someone no matter what state is he or she in, be it angry or sad, happy or dissapointed.<br><br>He or she is always willing to hear your problems. Can you look into this someone's eyes and you feel that you understand him or her or suddenly you know what he or she is thinking.<br><br>There is no need for anyone to speak.<br><br>The list of questions to ask yourself would be endless.<br><br>The bottomline is to remember that true love is a perfect balance between two people. It's not one sided. It's a perfect harmonious compliments between the two.<br><br>Sometimes, the best way to obtain true love is not to wait for true love to come to you but to search for it. And not by going to everyone and asking "Are you my true love?" but by giving him or her the gift.<br><br>The gift of love. It is only by giving your love to someone that you will find love lifted to new levels that you never dreamt possible. And when you have found your love... it is by giving that you will sustain your relationship. Never stop giving, ever...<br><br>Sometimes but not all the time, you shouldn't take people for granted for sometimes people are blind and not notice the extraordinary of the ordinary...<br><br>Sometimes you have to love that someone just enough coz that someone you love might be someone you hate and hate that someone just enough because that someone you hate might be someone you love someday...<br><br>Sometimes life takes a very interesting turn... what you never expect, happens and what you expected, never...<br><br>[This message has been edited by zzzzland (edited 04 April 2001).]</div>
