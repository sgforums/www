            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Boost Your Immune System</strong><br>-----------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Are you prone to getting colds, flu and infections that and zap your energy both mentally and physically?</span><br><br><strong>Go for foods that are rich in antioxidants</strong><br>Foods like eggplant, zucchini, corn, pumpkin, beetroot and carrots are all good sources of vitamins A, C and E which can help boost your immune system and fight cancer-causing free radicals.<br><br><strong>Go for garlic</strong><br>Garlic is a natural antibiotic, anticoagulant and anti-cancer agent. It has been used for many centuries and by many cultures to ward off infection. Whether you eat it raw, or try it in an odourless supplement, there's really nothing like it for your immune system.<br><br><strong>Chocolate in moderation</strong><br>Studies are showing more and more that people who eat chocolate up to three times a month are healthier than those who overindulge or abstain completely. Chocolate contains phenols, which are free radical-fighting chemicals. As well as boosting the immune system, cocoa in chocolate is also thought to restrict formation of a type of cholestrol that damages the heart.<br><br><strong>Exercise !!!</strong><br>While exercising in moderation will help you resist infection, be careful not to overdo it because it can make you more susceptible to colds and flus. If you're training hard then make sure to up your intake of carbohydrates to help your body adjust to energy you're burning.<br><br><strong>Get a good night's sleep</strong><br>Sleep is essential to strengthening your body and helping you ward of ailments. 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night is ideal, but remember that quality counts. If you have bouts of insomnia or tend to toss and turn then cut down on caffeine and practice relaxation techniques.<br><br><strong>Be optimistic</strong><br>Optimism and laughter have been known to have great healing powers. Some research even suggests that an upbeat attitude can strengthen the immune system, and reduce pain, and enhance the effects of many medical treatments.<br><br><strong>Manage your anger</strong><br>Whether you blame stress, overcrowding or public transportation, everyone at some point is bound to loose their tempers and become angry. While it's great to blow off steam once in awhile, our immune system gets considerably weaker when we get heated-up or tend to lose our tempers often. Anger has also been linked to heart disease.<br><br><strong>Get a massage</strong><br>An aromatherapy massage, using a mixture of lavendar, rosemary and geranium oils, helps to relieve tension and can be a powerful way to strengthen the immune system. Accupressure or a shiatsu massage is thought to help stimulate the lymphatic flow.<br><br>[This message has been edited by zzzzland (edited 16 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Correct Way Of Eating Fruits - By Devagi Sanmugam</strong><br><br>We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not so easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat fruits. Do you know of anyone who hates fruits? Most likely no. Everyone will immediately tell you about the fruits they like very much.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The reason why everyone likes fruits is because our bodies crave for it instinctively. The colour, the texture, the aromas and the sweetness all make it very attractive. But I find that most of us tend to think of fruits as a treat e.g. on a hot day - water melon! </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">But do you know that fruit is an important food to the human being?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Remember our ancestors were not meat eaters or seedeaters - they were all fruit eaters.  Fruits have the highest water content of any food. In addition, the vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids that a human requires can be derived from fruits. When fruit is consumed correctly, nothing can surpass it. </span><br><br>Even for those who want to lose a little weight, the proper consumption of fruit will help.  A survey was made and it was found that those who eat fruits more at every meal tend to want to eat less in the next meal.  The reason, being the sugar in the fruit. It was also found that a particular substance in some fruits could cut the risk of heart disease or heart attack.  The substance protects the heart by preventing the blood from becoming too thick and plugging up the arteries. So fruit is cleansing!<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Fruit requires less energy to be digested than any other food. Everything consumed by the human body eventually breaks down in the system and is transformed into glucose, fructose, amino acids etc. The brain cannot function on anything except glucose. Fruit is glucose in the body. Its digestion, absorption and assimilation requires only a short time, rather than to break down food like chicken, mutton etc. Other foods spend about 1-4 hours in the stomach! Fruits do not digest in the stomach. Most fruits are predigested except for bananas, dates and dried fruits. They pass through the stomach in twenty to thirty minutes as if going through a tunnel. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">They break down and release their life giving nutrients in the intestines. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">What is correct eating of fruits?  </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN IN AN EMPTY STOMACH.</strong></span><br><br>If you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your<br>system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities. Fruit is the most important food. Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.  In the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil. So please eat your fruits in an empty stomach or before your meals!</span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water melon I burp, when I eat durians my stomach bloats up, when I eat bananas I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit in an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and produces gas and hence you will bloat! Graying hair, balding, nervous outburst, dark circles under the eyes - all these will not happen if you take fruits in an empty stomach. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">There is no such thing as some fruits like orange and lemon are acidic because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Sehlton who did a research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight. </span><br><br>When you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice. Not from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste.  So stop making 'goreng pisang' or 'durian porridge' if you want nutrients. Cooking destroys all the vitamins.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. But if you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly. Because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprise when your friends tell you how radiant you look! During the fruit fast you can eat fruits, prepared in salad forms and make it more interesting. </span><br><br>This article is your reading for pointers only.<br><br></div>
