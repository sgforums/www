            <div class='col-md body'>My results is as below:-<br>Quite accurate!!<br><br>----------<br>You are seeking an affectionate relationship, offering fulfilment and happiness. You are capable of powerful emotional enthusiasm. Deep down, you are a kind loving person, always helpful and willing to adapt yourself if necessary to realise the bond of affection that you desire. But you need the same consideration and understanding from others...and it is this need that sometimes will hold you back ... so let go - trust and you may pleasantly surprised at what happens ...<br><br>You are a fighter and always on the defensive. You always need to be sure that your position is safe and established. When you finally make a decision you will pursue it to the bitter end in spite of all opposition.<br><br>You give the impression that you are a self-sufficient individual...pretending that you are stoical...indifferent, that is to pain or pleasure. But this is not so...for in truth you are an extremely emotional person, one that may make hasty decisions...and perhaps repent in leisure. It is time now perhaps to break the bond of detachment and become the real "you". The you that you would like to be. ...<br><br>You are feeling trapped by the situation as it stands at this time and what is more, you feel powerless to remedy it. You are stressful, angry and disgruntled. You feel that everything that you try to do to change the situation is thwarted and your hopes and aspirations all seem to be receding into the ever distant future.You have reached the state where you now doubt whether your dreams will ever be achieved... and this is not only causing mental stress, but heartache. You need to get away from it all ... You need to have time to think ... to recuperate ... to be able to make your own decisions.<br><br>You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave you alone..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>let my dear friend judge.....<br>but they like miss out something leh.....<br><br>You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that 'True love is just around the corner' and - if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will.<br><br>Your situation is such that at this time it is essential that you resolve your inherent problems immediately. You are not listening nor taking heed from your many friends and advisers, all of which believe it or not, 'wish you well'. Most of your colleagues feel that your attitude is out of context - an attitude of recklessness and desperation. It is imperative that some solution be found, but whatever you do, think before you act.<br><br>You lack confidence and that is a great pity because deep down you are indeed a warm caring person. This lack of confidence is making you wary of being drawn into any open discussion or conflict and so you feel as if you should let matters lie and leave well alone. But there may be a pleasant surprise in store for you. You are beginning to grow and very soon - sooner than you believed possible - this warm loving new you will be available for all to see and to appreciate.<br><br>For whatever the reason, you find it extremely difficult to sustain relationships - that is to sustain them in the manner that you would wish. You are a very gentle sort of person, full of feeling, sensitivity and susceptible to love and affection, looking and longing for a partner with whom you can enjoy 'All things bright and beautiful' - someone with whom you can seek out the more esoteric things of life. But up to now this person has only existed in your imagination. You are very choosy, appreciative, refined and extremely artistic in temperament and it is your hope to seek others who will allow you to form and express your own taste and judgement and who at the same time may assist you in your intellectual or artistic growth.<br><br>You are inclined to be too trusting and you feel that you need to be on your guard against the possibility that your endeavours and actions may be misunderstood. Too often you have been taken advantage of and you have been mentally abused. Now you are seeking a relationship which can provide peace of mind, where you can be yourself and not have the need to put on a false front.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sotongs...there u go again .. talk ****<br><br>okie ... here's mine:<br>not 100% accurate lehhh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> hmmm maybe I don't quite understand myself yet?<br><br>Utmost in your mind is success. You are constantly seeking stimulation and a life full of experience. You are trying to 'grow' and above all you need to develop freely and to shake off the shackles of self-doubt. You are an enthusiastic individual, full of life with the desire to live intensely. You like contact with others and are enthusiastic by nature. You are receptive to anything new, modern or intriguing. Your interests are many and you are likely to expand your fields of activities. You are optimistic about the future and you deserve every success because deep down you are a 'winner'.<br><br>You are not be feeling so good at this time. Everything seems to be getting on top of you. What you need is a rest from all of the the present trials and tribulations in peaceful surroundings and with someone - male or female, it doesn't really matter - who can really understand you and appreciates your needs.<br><br>You feel that you deserve far more than is being attributed to you, but there is no-one to whom you can turn to for sympathy and understanding. Your pent-up emotions and inherent egocentricity make you quick to take offence, but as matters stand you realise that you will have to make the best of things as they are.<br><br>You are being unduly influenced by the situation that is all around you. You do not like the feeling of loneliness and whatever it is that seems to separate you from others. You know that life can be wonderful and you are anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to live it to the full. You therefore resent any restriction or limitations that are being imposed on you and you insist on going it alone.<br><br>You don't like authority and you rebel against all forms of limitation. You are your own person and you intend to stay that way and to get on in the world simply by your hard work and determination.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Among all the personality tests that i have done, this one is by far the most complete and specific.<br><br>When you try the test, the results it shows, is the personality-cum-emotion-state at that moment you are in.<br><br>*Pause* How well do you know yourself? Take sometime to think about it seriously.<br><br>I have done this test countless times.  I must say doing this personality test has been an enlightening experience for my personal development and self-discovery.<br><br>Be honest, you will be amazed by the results.<br><br>[This message has been edited by topazz (edited 09 May 2002).]</div>
