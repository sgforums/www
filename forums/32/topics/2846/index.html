            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SINGAPOREANS GETTING FATTER</strong><br>MORE Singaporeans are overweight, and affluence and lifestyle changes are to blame.<br><br>A survey by the Ministry of Health in 1992 found that 21 per cent of the population were overweight and 5 per cent obese. Another survey in 1998 found that 24.4 per cent were overweight and 6 per cent obese.<br><br>Last year, however, the World Health Organisation proposed stricter criteria to measure obesity in Asians. This was because an Asian who has the same Body Mass Index (BMI) as a Caucasian has more body fat, says Dr Tey Beng Hea, who heads the Weight Management Programme at Alexandra Hospital.<br><br>With the new criteria, the 24.4 per cent classified as overweight in 1998 were reclassified as obese, which makes the total figure for obese Singaporeans 30.4 per cent. Dr Tey says more Singaporeans are overweight because their lifestyles have become more sedentary. 'People have also gone from low-fat, low-sugar diets to high-fat, high-sugar ones,' he adds.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The BMI is used to determine obesity. To get your BMI, divide your weight in kilogrames by the square of your height in metres. An Asian male is overweight if he hits 23 on the BMI and obese if he hits 25.</span><br><br>You can use the waist-hip ratio to check if you have too much abdominal fat. Divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement to get the ratio.<br><br>Men who have a ratio of more than 1 and women who have a ratio of more than 0.85 might be more prone to Type II diabetes and hypertension.<br><br></div>

The assignment or organs is NOT based on the patient's sex, race, religion or financial status."<br><br>The ODA can only be truly successful if all Singaporeans are covered.<br><br>"Under Islamic law, the waris has rights over the body of the deceased, and his consent must be sought and given before any organs can be removed. Under the existing law, Muslims must pledge their kidneys and their pledges must be co-signed by two waris. This proved a major obstacle to getting more Muslims to pledge their kidneys, said Mr Ameerali. More than 12,000 pledge cards had to be rejected because they were not endorsed by two waris. The amendment would remove this obstacle, he said. If adopted, it would mean many more patients waiting for donor kidneys would have a chance to get a kidney transplant earlier. There are now about 13,000 Muslims who are registered kidney donors, up from a mere 400 in 1990. But they make up just 4 per cent of the 310,000 Muslims eligible to pledge their kidneys, he said."<br><br>It is the typical mentality of Singaporean to think along this way... why should I help others when others refuse to help me.<br><br>So instead of pushing the blame on others, the onus is on you to make a pledge today(properly filled form) and commit a selfless of kindness.<br><br>Everyone wants to die with a complete body.<br>What good can a body do if the spirit no longer resides in it?<br>What good does the spirit gains that even in death would not help others?<br><br>* those in quotes are extracted from various news articles.<br><br>[This message has been edited by CloneMe72 (edited 17 June 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Cloneme...I feel that when one has passed away, one should not be selfish, if you can, donate your organs to others so that they are given a chance to live. What use does it have when your spirit is no longer in the body? Next time when I am gone, i will donate whatever organs to other living humans so that they are given a chance to live.  This is better than any other good deeds that you have done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=blue]I guess nowadays alot of people also think like that....cremate then scatter the ashes into the sea or fields....I also find it kinda troublesome for people to come and pray to me...but have you ever think about it.....they put your ashes into the temple or colobarium is because the alive want to remind themselves of the dead....all the good memmories they had...this is also to ease the pain they had when the person is dead...to them at least they know that the person has now got a good resting place and will be in peace....today is my grandfather's death day.. Every year when this day comes, I feel hurt and sad...cause he loves me so much..even he is dead for 5yrs already...but I still miss him very much  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some common clubbing myths:<br><br>Myth #1<br>"Dancing will help me burn the calories off."<br>You can shimmy and shake all you want, but dancing once or twice a week even for an hour only burns off about 250 calories. Barely enough to work off those strawberry daiquiri calories.<br><br>Myth #2<br>"Fingerfoods don't count."<br>Think again. You may just be picking on small quantities of food, but bar nuts, a few chicken wings, and some butter-covered popcorn contain about 275 calories per serving.<br><br>Myth #3<br>"Supper helps to soak up the alcohol."<br>Who can resist tucking into some char kway teow, or wanton noodles at the end of a night of clubbing. But by 4am in the morning, your body's metabolism slows down and once you get to bed, no way is your body burning all those calories that you just consumed.<br><br>Instead of regular beer (which contains about 171 calories per mug), drink Lite beer which contains about 100 calories per mug.<br>Order a wine spritzer which only has 41 calories as opposed to red wine, which has 120 calories.<br>A mixed drink with sprite or coke contains between 140 to 150 calories per can, while a club soda or seltzer contains hardly any calories.<br></div>
