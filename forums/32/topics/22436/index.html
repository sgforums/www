            <div class='col-md body'>My Answers.<br><br>1)Earning $5000 a month should make me feel comfortable living in Singapore at present.<br><br>2)4 to 5 room HDB flat should be sufficient.<br>It is how you renovate the interior and make it a home that's important, not the size.<br><br>3)I would like to have a car. Not a must but if I can afford, why not ? It would be very nice and convenient.<br><br>4)A loving gf before marriage, a loving wife after marriage, a loving mother after birth.<br><br>5)3-5 children. A mixture of girls and boys will be nice. No particular numbers.<br><br>6)Not more than 100. Long enough to see my children grow up and start than own family, and left a few yrs of my life to go tour around the world with my wife. That's enough.<br><br>7)I like dogs, they are faithful animals. I like fishes too, they relaxes your mind if you see them swim.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">Even, if you have plenty of money, without a job, seem like the world had gone meaningless. Your brain is not put to good use. If I have the money, of course I would like to start my own business. If not, an IT related job would make me happy. I like computer stuffs    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>9)Taiwan, Japan, San Francisco, etc.<br><br>10)My purpose in life is, if I can fulfill all the above answers, I would be very contented.
