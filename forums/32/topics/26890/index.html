When you meet someone you're attracted to..  that's not a choice. That's chance. Being caught up in a moment (and there's a lot of couples who get together because of this) is not a choice. That's also a chance.<br><br>The difference is what happens afterwards. When will you take that infatuation, that crush, that mind-blowing attraction to the next level?<br>That's when all sanity goes back, you sit down and contemplate whether you want to make this into a concrete relationship or just a fling.<br><br>If you decide to love a person, even with his faults, that's not a chance. That's choice. When you choose to be with a person, no matter what, that's choice. Even if you know there are many people out there who are more attractive, smarter, and richer than your mate, and yet, you decide to love your mate just the same, that's choice.<br><br>Infatuation, crushes, attraction comes to us by chance. But true love that lasts is truly a choice. A choice that we make. Regarding soulmates, there's a beautiful movie quote that I believe is so true about this: "Fate brings you together, but it's still up to you to make it happen."<br><br>I do believe that soulmates do exist. That there is truly someone made for you. But it's still up to you to make the choice if you're going to do something about it or not. We may meet our soulmates by chance, but loving and staying with our soulmate is still a choice we have to make.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">We came to the world not by finding someone perfect to love...

Perfection exists in one's own mind. As long as you believe the person is perfect, he/she IS, to you that is.<br><br>Believing in a person's perfection comes when you are able to accept their shortcomings and love the person as they are; such applies to all relationships be it friendship, kinship or BGR.</div>
