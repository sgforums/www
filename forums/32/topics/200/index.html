I don't know how long I'll<br>be...<br>But I'm not gonna let you down... Darlin' wait and see....<br>And between now and then... till I see you again...<br>I'll be loving you... Love, Me<br><br>I read those words just hours before... my Grandma passed away...<br>In the doorway of a church... where me and Grandpa stopped to pray...<br>I know I'd never seen him cry... in all my fifteen years...<br>But as he said these words to her... his eyes filled up with tears...<br><br>If you get there before I do... don't give up on me...<br>I'll meet you when my chores are through... I don't know how long I'll<br>be...<br>But I'm not gonna let you down... Darlin' wait and see...<br>And between now and then... till I see you again...<br>I'll be loving you.....
