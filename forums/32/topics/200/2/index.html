            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I preferred old songs, I think their lyrics are very nice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Elvis Presley had died a long time ago before<br>our times, but listen to the songs he sang, you can hear the emotion he puts in. For this song, he reads out a part of the lyrics beautifully. Try to imagine and picture yourself when you are listening to this song. It is really really very very nice. And of course, very very sad.<br><br>Elvis Presley<br>Title: Are You Lonesome Tonight?<br>Album:<br><br>Are you lonesome tonight,<br>do you miss me tonight?<br>Are you sorry we drifted apart?<br>Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day<br>When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?<br>Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?<br>Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?<br>Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?<br>Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?<br><br>I wonder if you're lonesome tonight<br>You know someone said that the world's a stage<br>And each must play a part.<br>Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.<br>Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance<br>You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue<br>Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange<br>And why I'll never know.<br>Honey, you lied when you said you loved me<br>And I had no cause to doubt you.<br>But I'd rather go on hearing your lies<br>Than go on living without you.<br>Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there<br>With emptiness all around<br>And if you won't come back to me<br>Then make them bring the curtain down.<br><br>Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?<br>Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?<br><br></div>
