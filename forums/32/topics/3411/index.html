            <div class='col-md body'>Something worth sharing........<br><br>Pack Of Biscuits<br><br>One night there was a woman at the airport who had to wait for several<br>hours<br>before catching her<br>next flight. While she waited she bought a book and a pack of biscuits to<br>spend<br>the time.<br><br>She looked for a place to sit and waited. She was deep into her book, when<br>suddenly she realized that there was a young man sitting next to her who<br>was<br>stretching his and, with no concern whatsoever, and grabbing the pack of<br>cookies<br>lying between them. He started to eat them one by one.<br><br>Not wanting to make a fuss about it she decided to ignore him. The woman,<br>slightly bothered, ate the cookies and watched the clock, while the young<br>and<br>shameless thief of biscuits was also finishing them. The woman started to<br>get<br>really angry at this point and thought "If I wasn't such a good and<br>educated<br>person, I would have given this daring man a black eye by now."<br><br>Every time she ate a biscuit, he had one too. The dialogue between their<br>eyes<br>continued and when only one biscuit was left, she wondered what was he<br>going to<br>do. Softly and with a nervous smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit<br>and<br>broke it in two. He offered one half to the woman while he ate the other<br>half.<br><br>Briskly she took the biscuit and thought, "What an insolent man! How<br>uneducated!<br>He didn't even thank me!" She had never met anybody so fresh and sighed<br>relieved<br>to hear her flight announced. She grabbed her bags and went towards the<br>boarding<br>gate refusing to look back to where that insolent thief was seated.<br><br>After boarding the plane and nicely seated, she looked for her book which<br>was<br>nearly finished by now. While looking into her bag she was totally<br>surprised to<br>find her pack of biscuits nearly intact. If my biscuits are here, she<br>thought<br>feeling terribly, those others were his and he tried to share them with me.<br><br>Too late to apologize to the young man, she realized with pain, that it was<br>her<br>who had been insolent, uneducated and a thief, and not him.  How many times<br>in<br>our lives, had we known with certainty that something happened in a certain<br>way,<br>only to discover later that it wasn't true?  How many times has our lack of<br>trust within us made us judge other people unfairly with our conceited<br>ideas,<br>often far away from reality.<br><br>That is why we have to think twice before we judge others. Let's always<br>give<br>others the benefit of the doubt before we think badly of them.  Author<br>Unknown<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There once was a King who offered a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture  of peace. Many artists tried.  The King looked at all the pictures, but there were only two he really liked and he had to choose between them.<br><br>One picture was of a calm lake.  The lake was a perfect mirror for peaceful towering mountains were all around it.  Overhead was a blue sky with fluffy white clouds.  All who saw this picture thought that it was a perfect picture of peace.<br><br>The other picture had mountains too.  But these were rugged and bare.  Above was an angry sky from which rain fell, in which lightening played.  Down the side of the mountain tumbled a foaming waterfall.  This did not look peaceful at all.  But when the King looked, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a crack in the rock.  In the bush a mother bird had built her nest.  There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest...... perfect peace.<br><br>Which picture do you think won the prize?  The King chose the second picture.  Do you know why?  "Because," explained the  King, "peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work.  Peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart.  That is the real meaning of peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A farmer's donkey<br><br>One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.<br><br>So he invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first,the donkey realised what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieten down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.<br><br>With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it<br>off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!<br><br>Moral:  Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Triple Filter<br>In ancient Greece, scholar and intellectual, Dr. Socrates was reputed to hold knowledge in high esteem. One day an acquaintance met the great philosopher and said,<br><br>"Do you know what I just heard about one of your friend?"<br><br>"Hold on a minute," Dr. Socrates<br>replied. "Before telling me anything IÂ’d like you to pass a little test. ItÂ’s called the Triple Filter Test."<br><br>"Triple filter?" asked the man.<br><br>"ThatÂ’s right," Dr. Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what youÂ’re going to say. ThatÂ’s why I call it the triple filter test. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?"<br><br>"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and wanted to tell it to you."<br><br>"All right," said Socrates. "So you donÂ’t really know if itÂ’s true or not. Now letÂ’s try the second filter, the filter of goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?Â”<br><br>"No, on the contrary, it is bad."<br><br>"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, but youÂ’re not certain itÂ’s true. You may still pass the test though, because thereÂ’s one filter left: the filter of usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me?"<br><br>"No, not really." Replied the man.<br><br>"Well," concluded Dr. Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither true, nor good, and nor even useful to me, why tell it to me at all."<br><br>A Passing Thought:<br>An arrow which has left the bow and killed an innocent soul,<br>and a spoken-word which has come out of your mouth and hurt someoneÂ’s heart,<br>both can never be recalled.<br>So before you speak, please use the triple filter.<br><br>------------------<br>~CloneMe~<br>It won't rain all the time.<br>The sky won't fall forever.<br>And though the night seems long,<br>your tears won't fall forever.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ^3rdWatch (edited 30 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Water, Water Everywhere,<br>And Nary A Drop To Drink<br><br>Several years ago we experienced a very dry spell in our area. One day we came home and our well pump was continuously running, but pumping no water.<br><br>As hundreds of other wells in our area, our well had finally gone dry also. We made arrangements for a water tank to be plumbed into the house, which also required me hauling water from the local water company to fill the tank.<br><br>This usually meant at least 2 trips to town every week hauling water. For over two and a half years I made these bi-weekly water runs, it was a real pain, specially in winter.<br><br>One day I got totally fed up with taking all that time, and constantly having to worry about whether there was enough water in the holding tank for the wife to wash clothes.<br><br>We decided to drill a new well. What that meant was we also had to dig a ditch from where the old water line went into the house to the new well.<br><br>When I originally purchased our farm, the owner had told me where the well was. Since that time we had built a big porch across the front of the house, which also happened to be right over where the owner had told us the well was.<br><br>Since I had always "Assumed" the well was under the porch, I had never bothered to dig it up when it went dry.<br><br>So putting number 1 son to work digging the ditch for the new well; lo and behold, he ran into where the old well really was! It wasn't under the porch as I had assumed for all those years.<br><br>Upon removal of the well cap, we found water just about 10 feet down from the surface. We put a new pump in and discovered the well we thought was dry, was making over 22 gallons a minute! And if you know anything about<br>water wells, that is a whole lot of water!!!<br><br>For over 2 years I had been hauling water because: I was operating under a false assumption of where our well really was.<br><br>For over 2 years, I was sitting on top of a well that had enough water to provide half our town with service.<br><br>That water was there all the time, all I would have needed to do was put forth a little effort and find it.<br><br>If I only had.......<br><br>* Put forth the effort<br>* Done something about my situation immediately<br>* Looked instead of taking someone else's word for it<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT - AGAIN AND AGAIN<br><br>There was a little boy with a bad temper.  His father gave him a  bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, to hammer a nail in the back fence.<br><br>The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence.  Then it gradually dwindled down.  He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence.  Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all.<br><br>He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now  pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper.  The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.<br><br>The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.  You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence.  The fence will never be the same.<br><br>When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one.  You can put a knife in a man and draw it out, it won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there.<br><br>A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.<br><br>[This message has been edited by topazz (edited 31 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the very begining, the gal's family objected strongly on her dating with<br>this guy. Saying that it has to got to do with family background &amp; that the gal will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.<br><br>Due to family"s pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Though the gal luv the guy deeply, but she always ask him: <span style="font-style: italic;">"How deep is yr luv for me?"</span> As the guy is not good with his words, this often cause the gal to be very upset.<br><br>With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him, he only endure it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his<br>studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very<br>good with words. But all I know is that I luv u. If u allow me, I will take<br>care of u for the rest of my life. As for<br>your family, I'll try my best to<br>talk them round. Will you marry me?"<br>The gal agreed &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married.<br><br>So before he leave, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, while  the guy was in overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their luv thru emails &amp; phone calls, though it's hard, but both<br>never thought of giving up.<br><br>One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realised that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum<br>crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that could come out of her mouth was juz a sign. she has lost her voice. The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down.<br>During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry, it's still juz silence cry that accompanied her.<br><br>Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone which pierced into her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know &amp; not wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer. With<br>that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phonecalls all the gal could do, besides crying is still crying.<br><br>The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy. With a new environment, the gal learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must<br>forget the guy. One day, her fren came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her fren not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't any more news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her fren came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her<br>fren what's going on, she saw the guy standing in front of her.<br><br>He used sign language telling her "I've spent a year's time to learn sign language. Juz to let u know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I luv u." With that, he slipped<br>the ring back into her finger.

In the first, she placed carrots, in the second, she placed eggs, and<br>in the last she placed ground coffee beans.<br><br>She let them sit and boil, without saying a word.  In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners.  She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl.  She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me, what do you see?"<br>"Carrots, eggs, and coffee," her daughter replied.<br><br>She brought her daughter closer and asked her to feel the carrots.  The daughter noted that they were soft.  She then asked her to take an egg and break it.  After pulling off the shell, the daughter observed the hard-boiled egg.  Finally, the mother asked her daughter to sip the coffee.  The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma.  Then the daughter asked, "What does it mean, mother?"<br><br>Her mother explained, "Each of these objects has faced the same adversity -- boiling water -- but each reacted differently.<br><br>The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting.   However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.<br>The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had  protected its liquid interior, but, after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.<br>The ground coffee beans were unique, however. They changed the water."<br><br>"Which are you?" she asked her daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?  Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?"<br><br>Think of this: Which am I?<br><br>Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?<br><br>Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I once have a fluid spirit, but after death, breakup, financial hardship, or some other trial, have I become hardened and<br>stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart?<br><br>Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water,the very circumstance that brings the pain.  When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor.  When things are at their worst, do I get better and change the situation around me?<br><br>How do you handle adversity? When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate to another level?<br><br>What gives you the greatest opportunity for long term happiness? That is your highest choice.<br><br>May you be blessed and bless others<br>By Always making your Highest Choice<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><br><strong>The story of Woodcutter</strong><br><br>Once upon a time, there was a very strong woodcutter. He asked for a job from a timber merchant, and he got it. The pay was really good and so were the work conditions.<br><br>For that reason, the woodcutter was determined to do his best. His boss gave him an axe and showed him the area where he was supposed to work.<br><br>The first day, the woodcutter brought down 18 trees.  The boss was very much impressed and said, "Congratulation, Go on that way!"  Very motivated by the words of boss, the woodcutter tried even harder, but he only could bring down 10 trees.<br><br>Day after day, he was bringing down less and less trees. "I must be losing my strength", the woodcutter thought to himself. He went to the boss and apologized, saying that he could not understand what was going on.<br><br>When was the last time you sharpen your axe?" the boss.  "Sharpen? I have no time to sharpen my axe. I have been very busy trying to cut trees."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The moral of the story:</strong></span><br><br>Our lives are like that. We sometimes get so busy that we don't take time to sharpen the axe. In today's world, it seems that everyone is busier than ever, but less happy than ever. Why is that? Could it be that we have forgotten how to stay sharp? There's nothing wrong with activity and hard work. But we should not get so busy that we neglect the truly important things in life, like our personal life, taking time to read etc.<br><br>We all need time to relax, to think and meditate, to learn and grow. If we don't take time to sharpen the axe, we will become dull and lose our effectiveness. So start from today, think about the ways by which you could do your job more effectively and add a lot of value to it.<br><br>May you be happy always!<br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=brown]<strong>The Pretty Lady</strong><br><br>[color=brown]Once upon a time a big monk and a little monk were traveling together.  They came to the bank of a river and found the bridge was damaged.  They had to wade across the river.  There was a pretty lady who was stuck at the damaged bridge and couldn't cross the river.<br><br>The big monk offered to carry the pretty lady across the river on his back. The lady accepted.  The little monk was shocked by the move of the big monk.  "How can big disciple brother carry a lady when we are supposed to avoid all intimacy with females?" thought the little monk.  But he kept quiet.<br><br>The big monk carried the lady across the river and the small monk followed unhappily.  When they crossed the river, the big monk let the lady down and they parted ways with her.  All along the way for several miles, the little monk was very unhappy with the act of the big monk.  He was making up all kinds of accusations about the big monk in his head.  This got him madder and madder.  But he still kept quiet.  And the big monk had no inclination to explain his situation.  Finally, at a rest point many hours later, the little monk could not stand it any further, he burst out angrily at the big monk.<br><br>"How can you claim yourself a devout monk, when you seize the first opportunity to touch a female, especially when she is very pretty?  All your teachings to me make you a big hypocrite."<br><br>The big monk looked surprised and said, "I had put down the pretty lady at the river bank many hours ago, how come you are still carrying her along?"<br><br>[color=brown]<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">[ This very old Chinese zen story reflects the thinking of many people today.  We encounter many unpleasant things in our life, they irritate us and they make us angry.  Sometimes, they cause us a lot of hurt, sometimes they cause us to be bitter or jealous.  But like the little monk, we are not willing to let them go away.  We keep on carrying the baggage of the "pretty lady" with us.  We let them keep on coming back to hurt us, make us angry, make us bitter and cause us a lot of agony.  Why?  Simply because we are not willing to put down or let go of the baggage of the "pretty lady".<br><br>We should let go of the pretty lady immediately after crossing the river,immediately after the unpleasant event is over.  This will immediately remove all our agonies.  There is no need to be further hurt by the unpleasant event after it is over.  It is just that simple. ]</span></strong><br><br></div>

So the restaurant owner and the farmer made an agreement that the farmer would deliver frogs to the restaurant, five hundred at a time for the next several weeks.<br><br>The first week, the farmer returned to the restaurant looking rather sheepish, with two scrawny little frogs.<br><br>The restaurant owner said, "Well... where are all the frogs?"<br><br>The farmer said, "I was mistaken.

Turtles, being naturally slow about things, took seven years to prepare for their outing.  Finally the turtle family left home looking for a suitable place for their outing.<br><br>During the second year of their journey they found a place ideal for them at last!  For about six months they cleaned up the area, unpacked the picnic basket, and completed the arrangements. Then they discovered they had forgotten the salt.  A picnic without salt would be a disaster, they all   agreed.  After a lengthy discussion, the youngest turtle was chosen to retrieve the salt from home.  Although he was the fastest of the slow moving turtles, the little turtle whined, cried, and wobbled in his shell.<br><br>He agreed to go on one condition: that no one would eat until he returned.  The family consented and the little turtle left.  Three years passed and the little turtle had not returned.  Five years... six years... then on the seventh year of his absence, the oldest turtle could no longer contain his hunger.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Balance of life</strong><br><br>Something to think about..........<br><br>Mary and Susan were friends for years.  They grew up together and attended the same schools.  They were now both in their 40's, and both had great careers.  They both had a similar upbringing Â– same education, same family values, similar support and financial position.  But there was one main difference.  Mary never seemed to have enough time.  She watched her life long friend Susan.  She had similar responsibilities and interests.  Susan had a career, she had three children, she had her hobbies, one of which included golf.  Over lunch, Susan was telling Mary about the golf game that she played last weekend.<br><br>"Susan, where do you find the time to play golf?" asked Mary.  "I never seem to have the time, now with the children older and doing there own thing I thought I would have time to play golf like we did when we were in college."<br><br>Susan looked at Mary and laughed, "Mary, we both have the same hours in a day.  You do have the time to play golf!"<br><br>With a sigh Mary replied, "That's easy for you to say.  I never seem to have time.  My work takes so much of my time.  I am in the office at 7:30, I leave at 6:30 in the evening.  By the time I get home and have dinner, it is 8:00!  And, then I usually have a briefcase full of work.  The weekends are full of more work.  Just to keep up, I have to put in the hours.  You know what it is like!"<br><br>"Of course, I know what it is like," Susan said.  "But what would happen tomorrow if you got sick? Who would do the work?"<br><br>"Sick. Who has time to get sick! exclaimed Mary.  "But if I did get sick, someone else would do the work, I suppose."<br><br>"You know something, Mary, I used to be like you.  I worked night and day and of course on weekends.  When I got home I was exhausted but I would push myself and read my children a bedtime story.  By the time I went to bed, I would be more than exhausted.  The boss I had was very demanding.  She was there early in the morning, late at night, and she always worked weekends.  I felt I had to do the same - I needed the job to help support my family - just as you did.<br><br>But then I had a change of bosses.  The man I worked for was older and much wiser, I might add!  Of course, I continued to work the hours I had been working.  One day he came to my desk and passed me a card that had a quote on it which said,<strong> 'What I do today is important, because I will never have today again' </strong>- then he left.<br><br>I sat there stunned. I suddenly thought of what was important to me.  While my work was important, I realized my children were more important.  I also realized that time for me was important.  It was 4:30, the official closing time of the office.  I straightened my desk, felt a twinge of guilt about leaving, but I forced myself to leave.  I was home by 5:00.  My children and husband were surprised.  I had a wonderful evening.  It was not a chore to read that bedtime story that evening."<br><br>Mary was looking at her friend thoughtfully and then questioned Susan about the work she had left on her desk.<br><br>Susan replied, "I never thought this possible, but I actually accomplished more the next day then I had in weeks.  As I was leaving the next day I stopped at my new boss's office and thanked him for the quote.  He told me a story about advice his dad had given him many years ago when he was working night and day.  He referred to it as 'Balance of Life'.  His dad told him to keep balance in his work, in his family life and in time for himself.  He explained to me, while all aspects of our life are important, without a balance, you become addicted and like all addictions you lose<br><br>- no balance with your family - you lose them<br>- no balance with your work - you lose your perspective and you actually lose focus on the important aspects of your job.<br><br>- no balance with yourself - you forget who you are and when you retire you have nothing!  Or worse than that, if you lose your job through a company sale or downsizing you lose your identity.<br><br>He went on to tell me that who we are is NOT what we do to make a living.  Who we are is a balance of our family, our work, ourselves!  It truly was the best advice I ever received."<br><br>Mary took a drink of her tea and tearfully looked at her friend, "But I would never get my work done if I left at 4:30!"<br><br>Susan looked thoughtfully at her, "When you go to work on Monday, look at what you have on your desk.  Make a list of everything you have to get done and beside that list write the impact of not doing it.  Then focus only on the top three items that have the most impact.  Do that everyday for a week.  At first, you will find it difficult to leave.  But, after awhile, you will find that you will have more energy, and you will be more focused in your work because you have BALANCE!  There are times when we have to lose balance - a special project at work, or a family matter at home - but consciously focusing on balance keeps everything in check."<br><br>Mary smiled at her friend, "Thanks for talking with me.  We have been friends for so long.  Thank heavens I have balance with your friendship!  You have convinced me. I will leave the work in my briefcase this weekend.  On Monday, I will make the list first thing.  Perhaps next weekend, I will have the time to go golfing with you!"<br><br></div>

They agreed that yes, it was.<br>The professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.  Of course, the sand filled up everything else.<br><br>"Now," said the professor, "I want you to recognize that this is your life.<br>The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost, you would be nearly destroyed.<br><br>The pebbles are the other things in life that matter, but on a smaller scale.  The pebbles represent things like your job,your house, your car.  The sand is everything else.  The small stuff." "If you put the sand or the pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for the rocks.  The same goes for your life.  If you spend all your energy and time on the small stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things that are truly most important.<br><br>******Pay attention to the things that are critical in your life.<br>Play with your children.<br>Take time to get medical checkups.<br>Take your partner out dancing.<br>There will always be time to go to work, clean the<br>house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal."<br><br>******** Take care of the rocks first - the things<br>that really matter.
