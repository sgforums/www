His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, to hammer a nail in the back fence.<br><br>The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Then it gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper.<br><br>The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same.<br><br>When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one.

            <div class='col-md body'>[color=green]Anyway for those who want to try to curb their temper,I  have a way.  That is when you are feeling really really angry, walk away for awhile, count to 20...cool down already then talk to the person again...in this way i think you will not shoot your mouth off and hurt anyone with words you dun mean....i read this in a magazine and it works fine for me...maybe can try it out?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
