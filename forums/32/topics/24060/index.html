            <div class='col-md body'>The lean of your sentence communicates your optimistic or pessimistic tendencies. Your lean indicates that:<br><br>You are even-tempered and extremely reliable. You have control over your emotions, and you like rules. You should be a substitute teacher.<br><br>The spacing of your words communicates how well you get along with others. Your spacing indicates that:<br><br>You are extroverted and spontaneous. You are at ease with people, but often times suffer from insecurity.<br><br>The loop of your "g's" communicates your attitudes toward sex. Your "g's" indicate that:<br><br>You are very creative. Your imagination runs wildly around your head. You also have an incredibly strong libido. By the way, The Great Goosini is free next Friday...<br><br>The bar height of your "t's" communicates your work ethic and ambition. Your "t's" indicate that:<br><br>You are very precise. Organization is very important to you, and you use your self-control to get the job done. The Great Goosini does not want to mess with you.<br><br>The dots above your "i's" communicate your self-image. Your dots tell me that:<br><br>You are meticulous and have supreme concentration. Don't get too cocky! The Great Goosini could out-think you any day of the week. And, The Great Goosini can fly. Beat that!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lines on your wrist are called Rascettes, also known as "The Bracelets of Life." The more rascettes you have, the more years of quality life you will have. This does NOT indicate how many years you will live; just how many of those years will be filled with joy, fortune, and extreme happiness. Your number of rascettes tell me that:<br><br>The Great Goosini estimates that have about 55 - 85 years of quality life in your bones. But before you sign up for that retirement home, remember that you can never beat The Great Goosini at shuffleboard, foolish biped.<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your index finger across your palm is your Head Line. Your head line determines your strength of character and your mental power. Your head line tells me that:<br><br>Your self-will is practically overbearing -- you do what you want to, and no man, woman, or goose can stop you. As a result, you have particularly strong argumentation skills and would make a particularly fine lawyer if you so chose such a path in life. Artistic in nature, you have a particular mental gift for intuition and just "knowing" what people need or want. Hmm... methinks you are related to The Great Goosini...<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your pinky across your palm is your Heart Line. Your heart line has everything to do with love and relationships. It also tells you about your romantic life. Your heart line indicates that:<br><br>When it comes to your love life, you can be extremely demanding -- you tend to get jealous easily, and you crave constant attention. You are also extremely close with your family, and if given the choice, you would like to be near them (or live near them) as much as possible. In fact, The Great Goosini misses his Mother Goose right now just thinking about it... she always told such great stories!<br><br>The line that curves from above your thumb down to your wrist is called your Life Line (no relation to Regis). Your life line is the measure of your life force, the strength of your family ties, and the general happiness you will find in life. Your life line shows me that:<br><br>Unlike The Great Goosini, you do not wish to travel the world; you are content to be where are you are. In order to reach the highest levels of happiness, you should constantly push yourself to achieve and experiment with life. If you change your career path to something completely unexpected, you will be pleasantly rewarded. Perhaps a career as a prognosticating swami goose?...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lean of your sentence communicates your optimistic or pessimistic tendencies. Your lean indicates that:<br><br>You are generally an optimistic person (or goose) and enjoy life to its fullest. The Great Goosini approves -- he is willing to take you under his wing and teach you The Ways of The Goose.<br><br>The spacing of your words communicates how well you get along with others.

You are at ease with people, but often times suffer from insecurity.<br><br>The loop of your "g's" communicates your attitudes toward sex. Your "g's" indicate that:<br><br>You are very creative.

You can't even remember to dot your "i's"!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ARIES     March 21 April 20<br>Nothing seems to ruffle you more than a  lack of discipline, disloyalty and<br>decorum. But Arians are also known to go into a rage very easily when<br>challenged. Those of you who have been  on the receiving end of the Aries<br>temper know that if not calmed down they can even get violent. But one thing<br>is certain if the opponent remains calm and does not react to their outburst,<br>Arians cool down very fast. They are also the first to apologize, which makes<br>them easier to forgive.<br><br>TAURUS     April 21 May 20<br>you are generally quiet and have control over your emotions.<br>It is difficult to predict what will upset you, so when you do lose your<br>cool, people don't know how to react. Your temper is like that of<br>a raging bull, and anyone trying to pacify you will be the first one<br>to get a verbal bashing. You generally get upset when you<br>are cornered or when people accuse you of doing something<br>wrong. You also hate being reminded about mistakes you've<br>made in the past. You also have the potential to be terribly<br>vindictive if rubbed the wrong way.<br><br>GEMINI     May 21 June 20<br>You are recognised by your cheerful disposition and your<br>jovial nature is not easily susceptible to anger. In fact, you<br>are the best person to have around when there is an ugly scene<br>at a party you can bring the warring factions together quite<br>diplomatically. But when you lose your cool, you yell and<br>scream and will not listen to reason. You must have the<br>last word in a wordy duel. Your capacity to argue aggressively is<br>matched only by your seductive charm.<br><br>CANCER     June 21 July 21<br>Considering how charming, caring, and kind you are, you<br>dislike unpleasant scenes, much less creating one yourself. You<br>have great tolerance and rarely get provoked into<br>losing your temper. If someone is unreasonable or trying to create trouble,<br>you are more likely to walk away quietly. But that does not mean you do not<br>have a temper.  When angry, in your effort to control your emotions, you<br>tremble, your hands get sweaty, and sometimes you fumble for words. Tears<br>roll down your eyes easily and the opponent is touched by your innocence and<br>will seek an apology immediately.<br><br>LEO     July 22 August 21<br>If anyone has total control over their emotions, it is you. But then, you can be<br>described as stiff, cold and uncaring. You are known to lack spontaneity but you really<br>don't care about opinions . You don't like to create scenes and will never accept<br>invitations to  a party where you suspect the presence of an unruly lot. But your very<br>presence seems challenging to some and they take vicarious pleasure in your<br>disquiet  When angry you can use very critical language. A dressing-down<br>can humiliate your opponent, causing a strain between both of you forever.<br><br>VIRGO     August 22 September 21<br>Most of you are gentle and have full control  over<br>your emotions, but those of you given to temper tantrums can<br>certainly get violent. When see thing with rage, you yell and shout and tend to<br>break  things lying close at hand. You can even harm yourself by banging<br>your hands on a glass top table or wall. You should never get into any<br>argument, for you are a sore loser. You feel that others are trying to<br>persecute you and don't quite respect your opinions. When hurt, you<br>can also hold grudges forever.<br><br>LIBRA      September 22 October 22<br>Did someone say that you are the charmers of the zodiac? Well, it's true<br>Few have ever seen you ruffled or angry. You are very conscious of your image,<br>and you believe that anger distorts your face and personality. You also think you are<br>above things like anger. But wait before you get into self-congratulatory<br>mood. Your family or those very close to you know u better. You have an<br>unmatched temper amongst all the zodiac signs, and what makes it worse is<br>your capacity to justify it.<br><br>SCORPIO     October 23 November 21<br>Of course you don't lose your cool. But your very demeanour (manner) projects<br>haughtiness (arrogance, pride), pride and grand  disdain (disregard) for lesser<br>mortals(humans). Others are often found saying that anger sits on your nose, and<br>you are raring to give your peace of mind to the first person who tries to act funny<br>with you. You are selective in the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance<br>for the superfluous (extra) types. Your tongue-lashing (attack) is generally in a<br>soft hissing tone, for when you scream your voice tends to get shrill and<br>loud, and you do hate drawing attention to yourself!  When upset, you<br>are angrier with yourself for having shown weakness, for the last thing<br>that Scorpio wants to show is being out of control.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS     November 22 December 20<br>You are insensible and generally have no complete control over your emotions.<br>You do get angry quickly and others marvel at your anger levels even when provoked.<br>Actually, you get tongue-tied when angry and you will remove your anger waiting for<br>the other person to calm down. Then you will reason with your opponent and convince the<br>other person in a very gentle manner that the whole thing was just his mistake. You're<br>also likely to totally sever ties with someone when you're upset with them.<br><br>CAPRICORN     December 21 January 19<br>Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like you is capable<br>of sensitivity and genuine emotions. You project a hard exterior but are actually very<br>sensitive,  a  trait you successfully hide from others. u can be seething with anger<br>but  will not betray your feelings. But then , there are times that even you cannot<br>control your temper. Under such circumstances you can shout and scream,<br>more with frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person.<br>Your outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br><br>AQUARIUS      January 20 February 18 .<br>You are noble and kind and dislike losing control over your emotions. It is very rare for<br>you to get angry. You are also the pacifier in situations that involve arguments. It is always your<br>endeavour to be perfect and socially correct in your behaviour and attitude, but if misunderstood<br>and slighted you can give in to an angry outburst. You will shout and scream and then walk out from<br>the scene. You cannot easily forget the situation and will be bitter about it for a long time.<br><br>PISCES      February 19 March 20<br>The only thing that can be said about you dreamers is that you appear even more attractive when<br>angry. You are very sensitive to others' feelings, so you rarely hurt them. But when others tend<br>to hurt you, then things take a nasty turn. You will yell and use harsh words, and feel inclined to<br>shake everything and everyone up. Your creative imagery is at its best when angry, and you tend to get<br>pretty dramatic. When upset, you refuse to listen to reason and wish to be left alone. But once you<br>calm down, you repent your tantrums and seek forgiveness. So nobody can be upset with you for too long</div>
