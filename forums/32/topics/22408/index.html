            <div class='col-md body'>Jason was with a sales organization for 2 years. It was his first job since college graduation and while at time he found himself highly motivated and anxious to perform his job well, he also experienced periods of high frustration, low motivation, and frequent discouragement.<br><br>In a conversation driven by frustration with his manager, Jason said,<br>"You're not doing your job well. You're my<br>manager, you're supposed to motivate me, and I am not motivated to do this job well. Sometimes I don't even feel like coming to work and you need to do something about that."<br><br>Jason's boss thought for a moment and pointed to a picture of his mother displayed in one of the bookcase. He said, "Jason, do you see the woman in that picture? That's my mother, and you need to realize that she did not go through the pangs of childbirth and give life to me so that someone would be on this earth to motivate you. We are all responsible for our own motivation. I am happy to help you achieve whatever motivates you, but do not expect me to provide your<br>motivation. I have all I can do to keep myself motivated. You either wake up each day with that fire in your belly to do the job well or you don't. Over the long haul no one else can give you that fire!"<br><br>Many people perceive their motivation to be the responsibility of others. Parents, teachers, and coaches may help to provide this motivation early in life, but in today's workplace, the day to day motivation necessary to achieve promotion must come from within.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Your motivation is your own responsibility.</span> If you are relying on others to keep you focused and in a state of readiness to perform, you are going to be sorely disappointed in the long run. Do not give others so much power or influence over you by allowing them to be responsible for your motivation and desire. Doing so makes you extremely vulnerable to the negative intentions and manipulations of others.<br><br>[This message has been edited by zzzzland (edited 04 April 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by zzzzland (edited 04 April 2001).]</div>
