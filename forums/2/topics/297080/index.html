Of course all bosses want their business to continue. But how do they guarantee their employee really do the servicing?<br><br>fyi, a new car less than 3 years whether you service it or not, what is the diff?<br><br>hope you get my point.<br><br>To summarise, I am talking about process. How do workshops assure customers that servicing was done properly when no customer knows how to check and they have no tools to check? How do you know your car wheels got rotated? can you answer me?<br><br>A servicing guy can just sign on the paper indicating he had rotated the wheels.  Can he not? you tell the me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun sign those 5 yr service package. Major servicing go back to AD, other than that and after warranty expire ,go outside w/s service, u can mark yr tyres with black mark , front only. I concern is the spark plug and air filter. If u don't like their service can compliant and bang table. Sometime they take u for a ride, best u go to yr own w/s to service and check for major parts and claim if under warranty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, u r absolutely right that most car owners do not know how to check that the stuff that they have been charged for has been done, and indeed, some things are nearly impossible to prove. So what is important is that u find a workshop that u can trust, or failing that, sit there at the workshop n watch them do it.<br><br>Of course, you can't do it at ADs, that's why there are so many horror stories. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
