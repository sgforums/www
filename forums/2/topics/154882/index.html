            <div class='col-md body'>Mine is the most suay one....it happened about one month adn 2 weeks ago...drove to camp to pack my duffel bag for my overseas training which was next week....upon finishing it started to rain very very heavily....not wanting my dad to wait outside at the campgate in this kinda weather i quickly rushed down to the car and drove off...when i turned right out from my company line it was a gentle left hander....was travelling at 40km/h but due 2 poor visibility didn't notice that my left wheel was on the grass(my camp roads have no curbs) and suddenly my steering felt loose and my car was veering too much to the left...i turned abit to the right and my car's rear end started to break away bit....I countersteered and gave it some throttle and thats where all hell broke loose....my car spun out...and went onto the other direction of the road with its nose facing the correct way but then its continued to slide left straight slammed into the ditch and tilted 45 deg....by then i was in a daze but recovering the car was the main pirority so i turned full lock right and accelerated out.....it looked okay as there was no broken glass and i was hoping that it was only a knock but upon reaching the road and moving my steering was very wierd and i heard a very loud scraping noise...so i went out and had a look...to my shock the whole rear axle was torn out and the left side suspension(both front and back) were ruined...and the rear left driveshaft(my car's 4WD) was torn out too....towed it to the workshop for repairs....damage was:<br>Broken rear axle,broken front left suspension,btoken rear left wishbone/driveshaft, Broken transfercase,gyroscope and g-sensor(basically my whole 4WD system was ruined) and the gearbox needs to be realigned...total cost was $20.3k....luckily i only had to pay $2500 and tan chong nearly declared the veh as "beyond repair" and till this day its not back yet and repairs have just begun as most of the parts need to be shipped from japan...one lesson learnt from this...don't trust your computer aids or yr 4wd system too much....don't wanna go into the details and confuse u guys...</div>
