GT?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Its certainly more agile than the cont. GT.<br><br>As for other factors, I would nail it on the gear ratios, and in-gear accel, low speed road handling,long dist crusing ability, drivability in urban areas, emission standards, and finally, being truthful to the heritage and character of Aston Martin cars. One reason I can think of for a poorer 0-100 than an EVO would be its weight. Afterall, the interior is certainly more luxurious than that of an EVO. I would even say the interior of an Aston outclasses a Ferrari or Lambo any day.<br><br>Stats for Aston cars:<br><br>Vanquish S(V12)<br><br>power: 520bhp<br>torque: 576Nm<br>0-60: 4.6s<br>weight: 1875kg<br>bhp/ton: 277bhp/ton<br>torque/ton: 307Nm/ton<br>top speed: 200mph/320kmh<br><br>DB9(V12)<br><br>power: 450bhp<br>torque: 569Nm<br>0-60: 4.7s<br>weight: 1800kg<br>bhp/ton: 250bhp/ton<br>torque/ton: 316Nm/ton<br>top speed: 186mph/297.6kmh<br><br>Vantage(V<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>power: 380bhp<br>torque: 409Nm<br>0-60: 4.8s<br>weight: 1570kg<br>bhp/ton: 242bhp/ton<br>torque/ton: 260Nm/ton<br>top speed: 175mph/280kmh<br><br>If u compare the cars down the range, u should also see why the stats are thus placed. The vanquish, altho being the flagship car, was introduced much earlier to the DB9 and the Vantage. One of the most impt criteria would be that lesser cars in the company's range should not outperform its flagship car. And altho that may be the case, I would say that is not the primary criteria. A low revving V12 generating per 500bhp and handfuls of torque both fits the image of an Aston, and is pretty impressive. V12s in cars like Lamborghini and Ferrari are very highly strung equipment, and have totally different charactristics. Whats e point of an Aston ending up behaving like a Ferrari? I want my Astons to be Astons, and Ferraris to be Ferraris please. If everybody ended up producing cars that behaved the same way engine-wise, whats the point of having different brands?<br><br>Anyways I'm going to include a Mitsubishi EVO 9's stats for comparism as well:<br><br>EVO 9 FQ-300<br><br>power: 305bhp<br>torque: 402Nm<br>0-60: 4.5s<br>weight: 1400kg<br>bhp/ton: 218bhp/ton<br>torque/ton: 287Nm/ton<br>top speed: 157mph/251kmh<br><br>looking by the stats, the EVO might beat the astons for 0-60, but past 60mph/100kmh, the Aston would leave it for dead. The issue for a standing start is always the weight and traction. An EVO is lightweight and uses 4WD to overcome the issue of traction. Lambos are heavy but use 4WD to overcome the traction issue as well. Ferraris are lightweight and hence do not suffer as much frome a standing start, although its certainly not the most luxurious interiors u could find. Astons, being heavy(on luxuries) and RWD only, would have to use traction control to find traction. As any racing driver worth their salt would tell u, TC saps time. Afterall, the purpose of TC is to cut power to any wheel it detects to be losing traction. When yr car's power is not being laid down to both its driven wheels, 0-60 time must surely suffer some. Once traction is not a problem, it would easily leave most lesser cars for dead.<br><br>And finally, can an EVO move off from a standstill in 4th gear and hit 216km/h all in one gear? I know an Aston can. That tells me a lot about where their design criterias for that engine and drivetrain lies.</div>
