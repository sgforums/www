Those Edition Etc: V-Edition U mention And 3 More Edition S-Edition And the recent one with Red top *Final Edition* Got no diff in Spec! THe only diff are all Exterior or some added-on accs.<br><br>2) MR-S = MR-Spyder or U can call it a MR2-SPyder like what ppl in the US label the car.<br><br>3) MR-S come in 2 transmission , Manual or SM-T , And like wat i said above U can have the SM-T or Manual transmission in any of the Edition including the final edition which come out this year.<br><br>i don think i want to comment on the honda as i have never driven one.

            <div class='col-md body'>I timed 6.93 sec 0-100kmh with moderate weight reduction done on the car.<br><br>Car has basic I/H/E mods with Unichip and a TRD lightened flywheel and clutch on 17inch forged wheels. I don't even have proper launch control or technique. Just a straightened right foot pedal to metal on a clear straight road. And that is with a gearing ratio that requires me to shift up to 3rd just before hitting 100kmh at about 85-90kmh. So that would have shaved off some milliseconds if the gearing could be adjusted to allow 2nd to hit 100kmh.<br><br>For the benefit of those reading whom are not necessarily familiar with this car:<br><br>Weight: 1010kg (stock)<br>Transmission: MT or SMT (although the earlier models do post some gearbox shifting problems)<br>Engine: 1.8l with 140bhp (stock 0-100kmh in 7.5 secs; that was my best timing before adding anything to the car)<br>Layout: MR; engine is located behind the seats.<br>Characteristics: Great turn-in handling but car prone to oversteer due to MR layout for the inexeperienced. Some difficulty in handling for the novice driver on the limits.<br>Engine note is noisier than a normal car because it is a soft top, and there are minimal insulation from the engine bay. This is in line with the ideology behind the design of the car, it is basically a no-frills roadster for those who enjoys driving and getting in touch with the mechanical rather than creature comfort aspect of the car. It is affectionately labelled the "poor man's lotus" by the Spyder community. Reason being it is the closest thing you can get to the actual lotus elise for a fraction of the cost.<br><br>For those lucky enough and petrol-headed enough to acquire such a gem of a car, I hope you would enjoy the ride for its very unique qualities. And just for your information, the first generation Lotus Elise had a 1.8l Rover-sourced K series engine producing 118bhp. That still enable the car to accelerate to 100kmh in about 6 secs. Not bad and totally adequate for a 690kg spartan track car. Sure, the engine is noisy as hell since the car doesn't even come with floor carpets. But you are not a true connoisseur of such fine-driving if you even contemplate bring cars such as a Honda Civic Sedan into the equation are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
