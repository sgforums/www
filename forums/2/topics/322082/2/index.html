              <p>I agree with this, back when I was taking my theory tests I was trying to follow all the theories and instructions on things like Braking/stopping etc with manual cars and i found it pretty confusing, but once you atcually start driving it becomes very clear and you get very used to it quickly.</p>

              <p><br>Can't believe I forgot wikipedia. Okay I have read and would like to pose a few questions. Basically what I have learnt is that engine braking is allowing the engine to brake itself via 'changing-down' aka decelerating due to the limit of the fuel/air compression pressure from each gear.</p>
              <p>So in application, say on a level road where the lights are red, roads are clear and you're a good 100m away at 70km/h at gear 4(someone correct me if I'm wrong).</p>
              <p>Do you</p>
              <p>release acceleration first then depress the breaks; slowly releasing pressure, while depressing the clutch, down gear to 3; release and depress; down to 2; release depress down to 1?</p>

              <p>Thanks Gosu for providing your views and helped me clarify this aspect.</p>
              <p>As for braking, I normally use pedal breaking. I would 1st release the gas pedal, apply intermittent braking and when about 50m, apply stronger braking and at 10 m away, gracefully release pressure on the brakes before bring the car to a standstill. Not much issue for me there. Paiseh, i cannot offer much help. Mine is auto only. But as far as I know, even for manual, my instructor ever said can stop at gear 2 just that remember to move off from gear 1. else problem to car somehow.</p>
              <p>cheers.</p>

              <p>Actually i don't depress the brakes too hard at the start, more like a gentle press of the brakes at the start and then down shfiting accordingly. No need to intermittent braking at all as most cars nowadays got ABS so just keep the right foot on the brakes. As for whether when reach closer to the junction must depress brakes harder, that will depend on other factors concerning driving experience, a bit hard to bring the point across in words. Even when I describe how I brake, it probably will still leave you in a state of blurness. Hard to describe lah, a lot of this is second nature to me and it will be second nature to you in time to come as well.</p>

              <p>lets put it his way... in a manual box.. pple will need to change gear... and when u are in the process of changing gear.. u need to disengage the clutch... at that moment.. u are in neutral and crusing at some speed right...</p>
              <p>and u probably has to do it a few gazillion times in the course of driving tt car..</p>
              <p>so if by going by ur saying is true... then we no need change gear liaoz?? or the gear box needs to be changed once a year??</p>

              <p>yes.. u need to release the clutch to engage the trasnmission to the engine so tt the engine brake can take effect...</p>
              <p>there is no need to go all the  way to 1... 2 will suffice... and then u can slowly brake then clutch in all the way</p>
              <p>rationale being should the light suddenly turn green... u can continue moving with enough torque in gear 2 since ur car is still in motion...</p>

              <p>When you learn driving, they'll tell you to slowly downshift all the way to the 2nd gear. For example, if you're in the 4th gear, you gotta downshift to 3rd gear, then after awhile downshift to the 2nd gear and let engine braking take effect. If you're still travelling too fast, then you gonna depress the brake pedal. And just at the point when the engine is going to stall, depress the clutch and brake to a stop.</p>
              <p>But honestly speaking, many experienced drivers just depress the clutch pedal and let the car free-wheel and brake to a stop just by the brakes itself. Helps to save some fuel, but brake pads wear out faster too. Depends on how you look at it. And if your control of the brakes is poor and you ain't got enough experience, free-wheeling is dangerous and not recommended.</p>

              <p><strong>Mistake<br></strong>I'm not sure about the mechanics but the way I look at it, there should be no damage and if there is it would be directed to the engine due to the high frequency revolutions switching to low, the gearbox/transmitter works to regulate the amount of power transmitted to the engine and thus should allow power(electricity or valve for air/fuel combustion ratio release? not sure.) to transmit without failure and with be able to adhere the frequency of change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry correction, from wikipedia:</p>
              <p>Engine braking beyond normal engine drag (i.e., shifting into a different gear only to decelerate a vehicle) can increase the cost of owning and operating a vehicle:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>It applies stopping forces directly to the <span style="color: #000000;">drivetrain</span>(gearbox and transmitting related parts), transferring wear and tear to parts that are an order of magnitude more expensive and difficult to replace than brake parts.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Firstly it will wear it off and secondly it is far more expensive if it gets damaged and by recklessly engine braking from a high gear to neutrel. I presume you are very prone to such damages.</p>

              <p>acutally engine brake should be used in tandem with normal foot braking...</p>
              <p>why??</p>
              <p>bcos using engine brake along will cause excessive wear to the clutch...</p>
              <p>and using foot brake alone will cause excessive wear to brake pads...</p>
              <p>so they reccomend engine braking...</p>
