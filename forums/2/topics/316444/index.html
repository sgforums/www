              <p>lemme start off with the mazda 3...</p>
              <p>the mazda 3 uses a volvo s40 chassis... so u would be paying a price for jap cars but getting continental quality with regards to the body...</p>
              <p>so as with volvo cars u would expect the handling to be superior than most jap cars...</p>
              <p>however the 1.6 engine lacks the punch when accelerating due to the heavy body and the FC is not as fugal as what u would get in a normal 1.6 litre engine...</p>
              <p>tt being said.. its the oldest among the 3 so u could get it at a pretty good price...</p>
              <p>the lancer EX..</p>
              <p>if are getting it i would reccommend the 2 litre one with rear disc brakes... sporty looks.. cant comment much cos i have nv driven it b4... but common sense dictates that if the body were meant for a 2 litre one.. then a 1.5 litre one would be super under powered...</p>
              <p>the 08' altis...</p>
              <p>i am driving the old pre facelifted altis... and i will have u know that the new 08 altis still uses the same engine found in the old altis... abeit a de tuned version to comply with emmision standards...</p>
              <p>so they played around with gear ratios to make up for the lack of power in the new altis...</p>
              <p>engine is refined at low revs... also a very fuel efficient engine...however... the handling is not good... as with most toyota cars....</p>
              <p>so is up to u really what u are looking in a car...</p>

              <p>We own a Lancer EX,so allow me to comment on the car:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes,the Lancer EX is heavy.Probly due to the newer RISE body which Mit claims is safeter but as a result,a heavier body(abt 100-200kg) compared to sedans like Nissan Sunny(though its old) and older Lancer.</p>
              <p>And for that,its advisable to go for the 2.0/GT as the engine is better matched to the weight and still have good/moderate performance.Its a CVT though so make sure you know how to control it well if not u be having the rubber band effect most of the time.</p>
              <p>To note also is that the 1.5L variant is using the older 4G generation 1.5L engine(also found in the Colt) and INVECS-II with no Tiptronic.The 2.0L and GT comes with the newer 4B11 engine(which powers the Evolution X) equipped with INVECS-III and paddle shifters.Technically,the GT also comes with rear anti-roll bar which is not found on the rest of the variants.</p>
              <p>2.0 Sports and GT variant comes with HID Low/High beam while the 1.5L make do with a halogen high/low beams.HID high beam is very useful in case a taxi/car cut into your lane <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly,the GT comes with all round 16" disc brakes(compared to 15" front and rear drums on the 2.0/1.5L) matched to 18" lightweight rims and have Rockford Fosgate speakers with a boot-mounted large subwoofer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you do not need the R.F speakers and better brakes,can opt for the 2.0 Sports which have the newer engine,paddle shifters and HID but cost 7k less</p>
              <p>The only downside is the rather loud exhaust(more of a sporty rumble) around 2k-3k rpm .But with the Civic 2.0,Altis 1.8 and Mazda 6 priced higher,getting used to it should be worthwhile for the $avings.The Mazda 3 IMO is better to wait for the newer model becase the current one's quite dated already.</p>

              <p>Before bought my new car today, I had actually tested Mazda3, Altis 08 and Lancer EX 1.5A.</p>
              <p>So my order goes to.... Lancer EX 1.5A</p>
              <p>Why? See below...</p>
              <p>1. Super value for money. For just $58,988, I got a very attractive newly designed and larger car that come along with goodies like 16" sport rim, leather seats, factory fitted tinted glass, reverse sensor with distance-to measuring, 3M floor matt, rain visor and others. No disc brake? Doesn't matter as the drum brake was more than enough for a 1.5L car.</p>
              <p>2. Very good looking interior design and the red lighted meters with trip computer was sexy too. Instrument deck, control buttons, especially the doors panel looking better than those on Civic, at least make me feeling cheap.</p>
              <p>3. Good looking, comfort and very supportive seats for the front and rear too.</p>
              <p>4. Good designed engine that built by ex-Mercedes Benz power plant in Germany that provide better power curve at most rpm.</p>
              <p>5. Good steering wheel and corner control when drive hard.</p>
              <p>6. Low noise when cruising. I don't rev unnecessary and if I does, I'm more focus on the traffic instead of the sporty engine noise. Boh pian mah, road condition and safety more important then focusing on the car noise.</p>
              <p>7. Good FC, according sources.</p>
              <p>8. Not bad 6 speakers stereo sound system for in-car-entertainment. I'm a Hi-Fi sound tuning expert, so I've know what  is a good sound, when I heard it. All just don't ask too much for low price ice system but expect it to sound good is enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think that will be more joy for me to discover when I got my key in 2 weeks time. </p>

              <p>Are you okay with the power-to-weght ratio?Due to the same body used on the 2.0 but with a smaller engine a common remarks from 1.5 owners is that the power is not that much.</p>

              <p>It should be okay for me. Was told 0~100km in 11sec (10.8 to be exact). The 2.0 is just for driver for hunger for speed.</p>
              <p>Beside buying a 2.0 is not that adviseable considering the petrol getting higher and higher. A 2.0L car will only suck-up more petrol and your money.</p>
              <p>And also second hand value also lower as demand for 2.0 car very low. Our people here always prefer a 1.6 and below car.</p>
              <p>Btw, if you just look at new '08 Altis 1.6A still with the same old 4speed AT engine</p>
              <p>but still lots of people buying into. The story same goes to Mazda3 1.6A, Honda 1.6A, Subaru Impleza 1.5A, Nissan Latio 1.5A.</p>
              <p>In Singapore who'll need a 2.0? And the answer, Very Few!</p>
              <p>If you compare new '08 Altis and Lancer EX power, then there should be no more doubts about Lancer 1.5A EX.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Before bought my new car today, I had actually tested Mazda3,
              Altis 08 and Lancer EX 1.5A.</p>
              <p>So my order goes to.... Lancer EX 1.5A</p>
              <p>Why? See below...</p>
              <p>1. Super value for money. For just $58,988, I got a very
              attractive newly designed and larger car that come along with
              goodies like 16" sport rim, leather seats, factory fitted tinted
              glass, reverse sensor with distance-to measuring, 3M floor matt,
              rain visor and others. No disc brake? Doesn't matter as the
              drum brake was more than enough for a 1.5L car.</p>
              <p>2. Very good looking interior design and the red
              lighted meters with trip computer was sexy too. Instrument
              deck, control buttons, especially the doors panel
              looking better than those on Civic, at least make me feeling
              cheap.</p>
              <p>3. Good looking, comfort and very supportive seats for the front
              and rear too.</p>
              <p>4. Good designed engine that built by
              ex-Mercedes Benz power plant in Germany that provide better
              power curve at most rpm.</p>
              <p>5. Good steering wheel and corner control when drive hard.</p>
              <p>6. Low noise when cruising. I don't rev unnecessary and if I
              does, I'm more focus on the traffic instead of the sporty
              engine noise. Boh pian mah, road condition and safety more
              important then focusing on the car noise.</p>
              <p>7. Good FC, according sources.</p>
              <p>8. Not bad 6 speakers stereo sound system for
              in-car-entertainment. I'm a Hi-Fi sound tuning expert, so I've know
              what  is a good sound, when I heard it. All just don't ask too
              much for low price ice system but expect it to sound good is
              enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think that will be more joy for me to discover when I got my key
              in 2 weeks time. </p>

              <p>the EX hor, dunno why when i drive it, the speed and stuffs are smoother than the old altis, despite the 1.6 and 1.5 difference</p>
              <p>i only drive before these three, but i'm a noob at cars, haha</p>
              <p>pardon my noobness</p>
