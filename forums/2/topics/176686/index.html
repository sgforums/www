            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>From: 	Emperor (sunny_boy26)<br><br>Dear folks, I got no choice but to put this np plate up on the web. This is a gold colour Nissan Sunny 1991, B13 model. His veh no. is SBT x724 U. It was the first day of chinese new year, 29th Jan. I was driving along the stretch of Choa Chu Kang DR near to Yew Tee MRT Station, This Sunny was travelling on the left lane while I was on the right lane. He suddenly travel side by side with me which I feel very uncomfortable. I try to to slow down, but he did it too. So I decided to drop gear &amp; speed up. He can't catch up. As I was going to my mum's place to have dinner which is at CCK North 5, so I change my lane to left side. To my surprise, he speed up &amp; cut into my lane. So be it as I was ferrying my 5 month old son. But when he saw me turn left into CCK north 5, he also follow me. The best thing is, he follow me all the way to my mum's carpark. He came out of the car &amp; holding a 40cm metal rod &amp; ran towards my car. He try to open my left rear door but failed as I locked up. he immediately use the rod &amp; whack my window. but he did not succeeed. So he procceed to my left passenger window &amp; do the same thing, did not succeeed also. Then follow by my driver window &amp; finally break my rear right window. At this time, I was damn furious, My wife at that time was carrying our son, came out of the veh with me &amp; confront him. He still wanted to use the 40cm metal rod wanted to beat my wife, his friend, at that time shout at him ask him not to hurt the baby. So he quickly run back to his car &amp; drove off. At that time, I was using my Hp to call the police. Now all my 3 windows are scatch with marks &amp; with a shatter window. Thanks to the road bully. Please keep a look out for him as the police is investigating this case. Thanks folks.<br></blockquote><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=sunny_club_sg&amp;msg=35688.1" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=sunny_club_sg&amp;msg=35688.1</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah some drivers purposely finding road rage for fighting just be careful when driving....heard that the high court had changed the law for road rages , road bullies. Quite serious offences - threatening or endanger one lives with an act to hurt someone / with an intention for crime / causing serious hurt with weapon.<br><br>Crime quite similar as rioting with weapons,  causing hurt to inncocent people, heavy crime.<br><br>Me driver too , sometimes taxis just jam brake in front of me to pick up passengers...but i just honk him and carry on driving on loh....just relax loh<br><br>Don't worry our CID will "Take good care of the man when he is in the CID Divisions" i also think the man acted in a fit of anger (rash) but that will land him in big trouble......stupid guy</div>
