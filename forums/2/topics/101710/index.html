Take for an example, in the newspaper, a singaporean drove up to KL during the wkends. He apparently put a steering and gear lock in this car. He left and came back an hour and a half, gosh.... His car was stolen. It's virtually impossible to prevent  car theft esp. in Malaysia. They are, mind u, are <strong>PROFESSIONAL </strong> car theif. So unless u wanna prevent car theft, u can follo Mr. BEan, take out the whole damn steering wheel frm the car...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So, moral is dont drive ur car to malaysia, cos they are all mad thiefs eyeing for ur cars</div>

He was in his car in a Johor hotel carpark when he saw the whole thing. They were trying to open the car door and they even knew my friend was looking at them. They stared back at him, daring him to do anything.
