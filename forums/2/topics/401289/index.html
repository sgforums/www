              <p><strong>By Tamara Thiessen from Sydney Morning Herald</strong></p>
              <p>At the Tanah Merah MRT rail station in Singapore, hundreds of iPhone-infatuated commuters appear to be as oblivious to fellow commuters as they do to the sign strung before them: ”Value Life Act Responsibly”.</p>
              <p>It is the kind of behaviour-regulating message that is thrust down their throats daily, though some observers are cynical about their effectiveness. “This is campaign city,” a marketing specialist says. “There’s a ‘Smile’ campaign, ‘Be on time to weddings’ campaign, a ‘Courtesy’ campaign … there are just too many campaigns.”</p>
              <p>In a country where people are regimentally law-abiding and clean, happiness and civility are also deemed to be in need of outside enforcement. Visitors to Singapore know they will be greeted by spick-and-span public spaces, hoovered grounds and streets free of chewing gum and spit; yet many say there is no such assurance of finding good manners and a caring society.</p>
              <p>
              
              </p>
              <p>In a letter to <em>The Straits Times</em> Sabrina Chen said that ”achieving true kindness boils down to having one characteristic which is missing among us: initiative. Singaporeans lack the initiative to care”.</p>
              <p>Under slogans such as ”Kindness rocks” and ”Be a smile champion”, the Singapore Kindness Movement has been campaigning relentlessly for a more benevolent society. The movement’s second State of Graciousness in Singapore Survey, found ”S’poreans” had conducted themselves better on public transport over the past year, amid hefty state-waged campaigns to improve consideration among commuters.</p>
              <p>But half the respondents were negative about behaviour in public, on the roads, at work and at home, said the movement’s general manager, Teh Thien Yew. “Levels of indifference and unhappiness are still high … we are all concerned about graciousness in our country.”</p>
              <p>Some foreign workers in the city have few kind words about Singaporeans’ manners. “They are the rudest f—ing people I have ever seen; they need some basic training in civic awareness,” said Paul Stapleton, an IT manager from Sydney. “They don’t feel that anyone else exists outside this tiny island.”</p>
              <p>The resounding verdict points to a Singapore rigorously controlled at the expense of humanitarian values. So will more state initiatives such as the Singapore Kindness Movement, whose patron is the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, reap change?</p>
              <p>“The problem is the sole concern of most Singaporeans is money and economic wellbeing,” a long-time British resident says. “The only reason the churches here are packed to the rafters is because people attend in order to network.”</p>

              <p><br>up to you, in singapore also have mah, we wear the white rope, there are courses of man who want to experience a monk life too, hey, many caucasian also join in the courses, it is not about religion, it about life, meditation and healthy thinking..even those christian caucasian gals also join in..</p>
              <p>The fact that i was a very naughty gal since young, because i lost my mother at a young stage, my dad decided to sent me to a nunnery to learn about discipline, every morning wake up 5.30am go ask for foods from villagers, eat porridge and chai sim, sweep the floor, meditate, then afternoon, take a nap for an hour, than listen to Chief Nun or abbot talk about life of different aspect, you can ask question too, then evening prepare dinner, collect woods, then attend to visitor visiting the temple and so on,...light off at 10pm...shhh...use to slip out with my colleague and go drinking.. </p>
