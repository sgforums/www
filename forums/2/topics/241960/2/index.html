Sometimes there are passengers in vehicle who suddenly tell the driver to turn up ahead. These ppl need to change lane pronto. With that in mind, whats the harm in letting some one cut in.<br>Actually if you are in a good mood, you will allow, and feel pleased.<br>If you are in a foul mood, you won't, and feel more agitated for that.<br><br>It's better for you to drive hapily and courteously.</div>
