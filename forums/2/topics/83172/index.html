            <div class='col-md body'>When idling at a traffic light, and suppose you know it's a long wait, do you put into Parking mode and use the handbrake?<br><br>i mean, since auto car can't use engine brake, the braking system is very important and most easily affected by wear-and-tear, right?<br><br>and if you were to depress the brake for such a long time during the traffic light every so often at each traffic light, will it be bad for the braking system in the long run?<br><br>have i just asked a stupid question???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
