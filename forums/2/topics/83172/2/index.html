What will be the problem if one always switch over to use manual trans on Auto gear box? Confuse...</div></blockquote>the tiptonic is just using the computer that control the gear to hold on to the gear longer for u to drag or like manual. it not totally like manual cars. so it does no affect the gear box like the way u shift from D to N. but tiptonic type of shifting also got limit one. eg if u drag all the way to redline or to certain rpm it will automatically upshift  the gear incase u forget to change cos u think it in auto mode.</div>

That's new to me cos i never experience that b4 with the tiptronic in my prev galant, got a few times i actually forgot to upshift and just keep on dragging the gear for quite a while but maybe cos i never reach redline haha<br><br></div>
