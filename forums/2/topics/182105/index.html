But the interior looks worst then the older S2000 .... sadly<br><br>The 2L version is using the F20 engine same like the old S2000 where as the new 2.2L is a new Stroke up version of the F20 called the F22 (the number denotes it) and the 2.2L is called the VGS version with Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGS) System. (Also known as Type 'V' )<br><br>"The VGS system, which will debut in the S2000 type V, varies the steering gear ratio continuously according to vehicle speed and steering angle to provide a heightened "joy of maneuvering." The adoption of this variable ratio system ensures ideal handling performance through a broad range of driving conditions. Agile and exhilarating performance is especially noticeable on winding roads, since the front end of the vehicle turns sharply in precise response to driver steering input. While cruising at high speeds on expressways, the VGS offers a smooth and progressive ratio setup without excessive sensitivity, providing the driver with the relaxed and reliable driving feel of conventional steering systems. Astonishingly, the lock-to- lock ratio* is almost halved to 1.4 turns for better maneuverability in the low speed ranges"    ---- Extracted from Honda Website <a href="http://www.world.honda.com" rel="nofollow">www.world.honda.com</a></div>

Yes. There is still the Standard 2.0l S2000 being sold in singapore via PIs (not sure Kah motors)<br><br>2. Yes KAH Motors brings in S2000 but the waiting time is quite .... long (accroding to my friend)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I know for sure that Garage R is bringing in the 2.2 already. They have sold at least 3.<br>Can go check with them .<br><br>Type V is an option, and my 2.0 one i got with Type V.<br><br>2.2 has same hp as 2.0 but slightly higher torque.<br><br>I am not sure if Kah is still selling the 2.0 but I am somewhat sure that they will not, as all changes to the engine ( 2.0 -&gt; 2.2) have been done across all countries from around the beginning of this year.<br><br>The difference for PI and local is that at least for the 2.0 version, the kah motor's car is rated at 239ps ,. where the jdm one i PI'ed in is about 249ps.<br><br>Also, radio will be japan standard meaning MD player, but you will need a frequency converter to recieve sg stations. Can be done at most audio car shops here.<br><br>Another worry would be parts. Kah motors is sometimes reluctant to release parts for the s2000 to other workshops as it is a low presence car, and will want to make sure they have parts ready for their own customers.<br><br>PI also means you can get more colors, Kah only brings in certain ones.<br><br>PI price depends on options, so check around if you want to bring one in.<br><br>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This is what I found out b4 I got mine<br><br></div>
