FC gd? i dunno...i would think so bah. but i dun like that car. smaller than i tot when i went to look see. rejected the idea once i've sat in the rear. </blockquote>Vios was once on my buying list but the cabin space and the center meter machiam masa put me off at the first sight. Somemore its price quite the same as sunny and lancer at that time.<br><br>Though vios can give a better FC but paying for something small and MIT just not worth it to me.<br><br>I personally feel that it has a high butt as if it invites people to kiss its butt. It also look more like a boy racing car to me. No offense, personal view only.<br><br>At least vios FC is better than sunny and lancer, may be becos of its light weight. That's the only good point I can think of.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm an ex-Sunny 1.6(A) driver, and i seriously don't find the Sunny a bad car.<br><br>Pickup is quite average for a 1.6(A) car, i seriously don't think a 1.6(A) Lancer, Altis or Matrix can do any better. Certainly if one is to look at the specs, Sunny has the same acceleration (0-100km/h) figure as the Altis (both 11.7sec), and is in fact better than the Lancer (12.0sec) and the Matrix (14.2sec).<br><br>It appears that some people are very concerned with the Sunny's higher FC. But take it in perspective... 10+km/L for the Sunny vs maybe 11+km/L for the Altis? That's less than 10% difference! And how much do you spend on fuel per year? The difference in the purchase price between the Sunny and the Altis more than offsets the slightly increased fuel spending when driving the Sunny (unless of course you are driving the Sunny Luxury Edition or are a super heavy user)!<br>Hence I really don't think it makes much sense to pick on the fact that the Sunny has a higher FC.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
