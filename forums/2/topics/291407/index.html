            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>From Their Exhaust . . .  To Your Lungs!</strong></span><br><br><strong>Did You Know...</strong><br>It used to be that cars and trucks had separate fresh air intakes that allowed air to pass directly from the front of the vehicle to the passenger compartment. Today, other than through windows, there is usually only one way for fresh air to enter your car--through the auto ventilation system, which includes the auto air conditioner. Therefore, all the air that enters your car flows through an evaporator core very similar to the one below.<br>When you run your ventilation system either for heating or cooling, air passes through the evaporator core.<br>When cooling, moisture from the air is removed by the evaporator core. This moisture accumulates in the evaporator core chamber where most of it is dumped to the ground through a drain. However, some water may still remain. In other words, the chamber and the evaporator can stay wet. Because this area is dark, wet and inevitably dirty, these are IDEAL BREEDING CONDITIONS for mold and mildew to flourish!<br>When heating, although you have dry conditions. Spores and other fine debris that have accumulated are continually being blown into your enclosed driving environment. In addition, external air carries all kinds of material with it as it enters your vehicle including dust, oil droplets, exhaust vapors, insects, mold spores, pollens and bacteria. This debris accumulates on the evaporator core. Under such conditions, mold and bacteria colonies are nurtured and further contaminate the air in the vehicle. Look at the accumulation of debris in the illustration below. This can happen in a very short time!<br><br><span class="normal"><strong>DWD2 Refresher</strong></span><br>A 7 oz. can of cleaning solution much like the Evaporator Cleaner. Designed for the purpose of allowing you to maintain a cleaner evaporator environment after the initial cleaning with the 9 oz. cleaner. You can do this easily by injecting the Refresher Treatment through the adapter that becomes a permanent fixture with the initial cleaning. The adapter is placed at a convenient location under the dashboard or under the hood (depending on your vehicle) where you can easily use the Refresher Treatment as often as you need. A single can will last up to 6 months, depending on use.<br><br>Image : http://www.dwd2.com/docs/images/before.jpg<br><strong>Before DWD2</strong><br>If your vehicle smells like dirty socks or a damp basement, your personal environment is CONTAMINATED. When you or a mechanic sprays air freshener into the vents or inside the vehicle, you only MASK the odor. The contaminants still remain. Nothing has been solved.<br><br>Image : http://www.dwd2.com/docs/images/during.jpg<br><strong>During DWD2</strong><br>The cleaning solution must be able to reach the entire evaporator core starting from the intake side. To accomplish this you can?t just spray something into the chamber. The cleaning material must fill the chamber from top to bottom. In a liquid form this is impossible. The liquid would flow through the bottom of the evaporator and out the drain. Therefore, we must use foam. The foam fills the chamber when it is injected and then the fan blows the CLEANING FOAM through the entire evaporator and pushing the debris along with it.<br><br>Image: http://www.dwd2.com/docs/images/after.jpg<br><strong>After DWD2</strong><br>It is quick and easy! The photo is the same evaporator as above after being cleaned with DWD2 Evaporator Cleaner. ItÂ’s obvious, if your evaporator core doesn?t look like this, you and your passengers will be breathing contaminated air. You may only smell it while using the air conditioner, but until you flush it out, it can affect your health all year long. Protect yourself, schedule a cleaning with DWD2 Evaporator Cleaner at least twice each year.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions: </strong></span></span><br><br><strong>How often do I have to get my evaporator cleaned? </strong><br>This depends. If you live in the Midwest where mold concentrations appear to be the highest, then you may need to have it cleaned more frequently Â– about 3 to 4 times a year. If you live in the southwest, where it is dryer, then twice a year is probably enough. Take a look for yourself by pressing the CNN.Com button to the right.<br><br>I can't seem to find someone in my area that carries your product and I need to have this service done to my car, what should I do?<br>Please feel free to contact us directly. You can buy the product from us complete with instructions that you can give to your mechanic. Have them take a look at our web site or contact our sales department for information about how they can obtain this product for all their customers. We are building a national distribution network, but we don't have every area covered yet<br><br><strong>Can I clean my own evaporator? </strong><br>We recommend that a mechanic or A/C technician do the installation. Although Installation is simple and most vehicles use similar systems, there are differences. Part of the installation requires drilling a 3/16 hole in the casing between the evaporator and the fan. It is important that the installer be familiar with the location and design of the ventilation system in your vehicle. Once the DWD2 SYSTEM is installed, however, you can certainly clean your own evaporator.<br><br>What about injecting the cleaner into the evaporator drain hole?<br>DWD2 Evaporator Cleaner system is designed to reach the evaporator between the fan and the evaporator. This is where the greatest accumulation of debris occurs. If you inject the foaming solution into the drain hole, all the solution may not reach the contaminated side of the evaporator and only do a partial cleaning. Once the injection system is properly installed in your car, future cleaning is very simple. We also provide a DWD2 Refresher cleaner that can be used through the same injector system.<br><br><a href="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/DSCN3324.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/th_DSCN3324.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/dwd2_pg1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/th_dwd2_pg1.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/dwd2_pg2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/th_dwd2_pg2.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/dwd2_pg3pptx.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd166/lubeoil328/th_dwd2_pg3pptx.jpg"></a><br><br><span class="large">*Double Click On Image To Enlarge For Reading !!!!</span><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Usual Price @ S$35.00 , Now @ S$30.00</strong></span><br><br><span class="large">SMS @ 98572328 or PM to : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">lube.oil@hotmail.com</span></span></span><br><span class="small">Interested in making Extra Income, Distribution, Export,  send your enquiry : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">sfm3723@hotmail.com</span></span></span><br><br></div>
