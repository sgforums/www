            <div class='col-md body'>From Straits Times Forum:<br><br><strong>AS A driver commuting daily, I cannot help but feel pressured and stressed driving on our roads these days.<br><br>It has never been so stressful on our roads<br><br>The reason?<br><br>After the recent increase in speed cameras around Singapore, I have been booked twice for speeding.<br><br>Now I have to be extra-careful, to the extent of being paranoid.<br><br>I have never felt this way before. Prior to this, I have never received a speeding ticket though I started driving seven years ago.<br><br>Previously, I had to look out for only other road users and pedestrians and cyclists. Now I have to look out for bushes and overhead bridges to check if there are any Traffic Police officers lurking with their speed camera.<br><br>Not surprisingly, many of my friends who have been booked for speeding feel the same way too.<br><br>I understand that the authorities need to make our roads safer, especially with so many accidents due to speeding. But the hidden speed cameras have affected our way of driving.<br><br>It has never been so stressful.<br><br>I travel quite a fair bit every day. So trust me, it is not easy to live with this kind of stress.<br><br>Of course, there is the argument that if you stick to the rules, you do not have to worry at all.<br><br>I tried driving within the speed limits and all I got were stares, honks and bad vibes from other road users who had to go out of their way to overtake me. Many times, even commercial vehicles, be it big or small, overtook me.<br><br>Also, there are times when I look desperately for the speed-limit sign and, when I do not see any on a particular stretch of road, I begin to feel pressured, worrying if I am speeding or not.<br><br>On certain roads it is very difficult to stick to the speed limit. For example, on a road with a downward slope, like when entering a tunnel, the car's speed will increase even if you ease off the accelerator. In such instances, I start to brake only to receive high beams from the vehicles behind.<br><br>I hope the officers overseeing traffic regulations have tried driving around Singapore within the speed limits. If they have, they would have found how impractical it is to drive this way.<br><br>It may be better for all vehicles, including cars, to have some device like a speed limiter, so everyone travels within the speed limits.<br><br>That way, at least, I do not have to worry about speed cameras and pressure from other road users.<br><br>Teng Chee Khoon<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/forum/story/0,5562,295730,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/forum/story/0,5562,295730,00.html?</a></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahaha.. actually i do agree with some points with the writer... cars are getting more powerful and it is hard to stick within limits like 50 or 60... my point of view is that minor roads should have increase from 70 to 75. and expressway should go to 95... But then those roads in housing estates should still remain at 50 for safety reasons..</div>
