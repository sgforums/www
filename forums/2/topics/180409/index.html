            <div class='col-md body'>thanks bros for ur views....<br><br>sad to say, i dun agree with u that after they get license they drive like crap. when i was learning way back, my instructors told me, all the Learners are from crap drivers turning to bigger crap drivers once they have their license. even before their TP test, they still can get so many IF (immediate failures) &amp; also after they pass, they dun dare drive out or cause more accidents.<br><br>but for my case, this driver is born in 1976 &amp; do not have a P plate with him. honeslty i still dun understand how can he bang me so hard causiing my rear bumper to be cut by half &amp; my passenger doors cant be opened. it was red light for christ sake &amp; the red light has been there for like 20s?<br><br>yeah, i hope i dun have to pay a single cent. on the contary, that jerk should have paid me back with an EVO. kayu drivers.<br><br>lastly, to all my frds here. i'm currently driving a Mitsu Colt on loan from the workshop, if there's any outing, feel free to still call me out. however my colt wont be as fast as my lancer, so... let me be the last car but dun leave me in the lurch..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chill dude. I once stopped my car to help a White man push his car up the petrol kiosk ramp out of kindness because his car ran out of fuel but the devil got into his car instead of helping me with the push. Ended up his car rear-ending the side of my ride.<br><br>At the end of the day, I have to pay for my own damage. Hmm... it's expensive to be kind.</div>
