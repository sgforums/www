Not the best I have seen but considering the power and tune compared to my old rides, it was acceptable.<br><br>In higher states of tune and the occasional revving, I am getting 7+<br><br>AFAIK, the redlines are the same for 8 and MR. Should be same for 7 as well. 9 is anybody's guess since it isn't out here yet.<br><br>Fuel tank is 45l for E7, and 55l for 8/MR. Expect 9 should have same 55l<br><br>Traditionally Evos come with 2 specs: RS and GSR.<br><br>GSR has all the nice frills for daily driving: aircon, Sports ABS, power windows, sports rims, Recaro seats. Comes with SAYC and 6 speed gearbox. Standard turbo for 9 GSR is titanium turbo.<br><br>RS is the full stripped down version meant for track/racing. You don't get aircon, no ABS, no power windows, no sports rims, no Recaro seats, no AYC, 5 speed gearbox (supposedly stronger). Also coems with the new magnesium titanium turbo as standard. This is optional for the GSR<br><br>Most teams go for these and then quickly replace them with far better components anyway, eg 6 pot brakes, racing LSD, even lighter forged rims, full bucket seats, clutch etc<br><br>GT is something new for E9. It is an intermediate spec. Think of it as an RS with some GSR amenities.. aircon, Brembos, ABS, Recaros etc.<br><br>Best part of it is that it is Group N homologated already. Also available in full range of colors like the GSR. RS is limited tow hite.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So Evo only can go some 400 or less km.<br>By right evo shall have a fuel tank of 70 or 75l like normal 2.0 or 3.0 saloon car.<br>But to make it competitive and reduce weight it was just a mere 45 or 55l tank.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was thinking, if someone is able to drive it below 3500 (assuming that the turbo kicks in during this rpm), will he be able to control effectively the FC? because i am really fascinated by the engine, 2 litre, yet it can produce such wonderful statistics that i cannot find in other cars? i dont know much about subaru WRX sti's engine, but i assume that it is equally as good. but i am slightly bias towards EVO. heeheehee!</div>

Usually its betw 7+ to 8+ (9 is a rarity). This is urban driving. you can try and ask around in the sg evo club if anyone is selling his/her MR... however, the 9 is going to be out REALLY soon.
