            <div class='col-md body'>what i did when i got my car (94 integra) was check the basic stuff like the suspension stability, the steering, wear and tear in the car , and since my meter wasnt electonic, i had to make sure that the digits were not winded back illegally<br><br>and other than that, the other stuff was just checking the body work to make sure the car wasnt involved in a major crash, the smoothness of the body, listen to any werid sounds while test driving it<br><br>dont take my word for it, that was just me checking up on my first car <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never buy off a dealer.  They are masters at concealing exsiting faults of a car.  E.g. releasing tyre pressure to conceal bad suspensions, adding certain fluids to the engine to "whiten" the fumes, reversing the mileage counter etc etc.  Sometimes they even use temporary paint to conceal scratches which surfaces only 3 to 4 weeks after you bought the car</div>

If theres nothing wrong with the car, and taking into account the bloody economy now.they sure will agree one.<br><br>hope this helps.<br><br>cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Best is to send it for an thru assessment by a workshop or inspection centre. Usually dealer would be obligated upon your request and if they dun, is as good as telling you the car got problem.<br>No matter how you check on the spot, you will miss out something and problem only come in 1-2 weeks after you collect your car.<br><br></div>
