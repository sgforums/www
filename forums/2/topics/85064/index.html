I think the normal one used is 3800BLU. Philips bulbs have different BLUs for consumer choosing... The bad thing is the bulb may 'burn' more easily since the temperature is higher as the BLU goes higher</div>

If you did not adjust the lamp angle lower, then i think the front driver will sure be affect.<br><br>Also you need to pray that the TP could tell the difference between the brighter Halogen bulb and the real HID...
