I gave this reason to the judge and got a S$100 discount as almost all others got S$900 as standard.<br><br>You can pay by Nets, Cashcard, Cheque or Cash and the police (holding to your IC)  lead you (with many others) and walk down the stairs from level 3 to the counter to made payment (in front of everyone visiting Sub court, much like a parade of convict!s)<br><br>2 lady was amongst the 80 or so speedsters today and one was fine extra S$500 for having a radar detector in his car. Can beg for installment as one motorcyclist did and judge agrees.<br><br>Anyhow, sharing to you all and this is behind me now.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best bet when you are caught is to plead guilty on the spot and ask for leniency. Unless you are quite sure you were wronged. Most TP also humans doing their job and can sweet talk them one. Once, I was caught doing 94km/h on a 50km/h road. Suppose to go court but the TP reduced to the lesser penalty - $200 and 6 demerit points.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I been to court 21 this once... and I told myself it would be my last!<br><br>I was riding my brother new Husky 125cc on my 21st birthday on the way to meet my friends at Tampines. Traffic was slow on PIE... just as I passed the Paya Lebar exit up the flyover, I was signalled to stop by TP17 on his motorbike (I will never forget!)<br><br>He claimed  that I was swinging in and out of traffic at 92km/hr. I apologized (what a dumbarse anyway). I begged for leniency and told him that it's my 21st birthday. In turn, he said! "Okay, Mr (surname), I am going to give you a big birthday present, follow me". He took my license and wanted me to follow him, I suppose it was to Maxell Road; to compound me and my vehicle. Made an U-turn at Eunos exit back into PIE. Then half way thru, I saw him talking into his walkie talkie and he stopped. Gave me a ticket (dangerous riding) and left me stranded on the highway; I actually felt relieved.<br><br>A few months later after countless appeals; there I was with about 80+ offenders waiting for judgement. 50+ offenders infront of me all got a fine ranging below $1,000. Came my turn, a very long statement was uttered (which I could hardly hear nor understand; due to the indian accent of this officer). A got a shocking $2,000 fine and 12 demerit points!<br><br>That was 6 years ago... I have not got caught breaking the law on the road since then. Err... I try to be discreet when I have no choice... you know what i mean...<br><br>When I get to drive my first car (Picanto) in Singapore, I pray that I will be spared like I have been for my past six years. Anyway, I am accident free so let it not happen even when I start driving my Picanto. Thank you God!<br><br>Vincent<br></div>
