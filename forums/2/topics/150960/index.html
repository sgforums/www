Just think that you are owning say a rough estimation of $15 plus car a day inclusive of 3rd party insurance and a whole year road tax as in my case. When you scrap car also got some money la Bro. I heard scrap company has a certain price for  a scrap car. Then cut it apart before they export out to 3rd world countries.<br><br>As a matter of fact, when a car's COE was renewed for only 5 years, no extension for another 5 years is optionable, (what to dooo...LTA ruling leh).  As far as I know the lifespan of a car in Spore is at 20 years..then off it goes to the scrapyard.

Everybody has the same sentiments about public transports. Its fu*cking boring, troublesome and tiring. The question is not whether YOU WANT a car, but whether YOU NEED a car. GIven that you are probably 21yo, just started working (just an assumption, my apologies if i'm wrong), you better think twice before committing to a car. Cars aint a chick magnet, its a bitch magnet, cos if you need a car to attract the ladies, then i think you are climbing up the wrong tree, or you're one insecure guy. Reason why i'm telling you this, is i've seen a lot of guys being declared bankrupt due to incapabilities of servicing their loans.. Peace out !</div>

I am not so shallow to know that cars are not for attracting materialistic bitches. I am not one of the small little bois online... with flirthy rich parents buying car for them. I know what are the pros and cons of owning a car clearly. If i am thinking of it... it means i can afford it to some extend. Dont be so judgement.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether i'm being judgemental or not, i've already stated that i'm basing everything on assumption linked to your nick. You asked for advices pertaining to affordablity of the car, and i just pointed another aspect of it worth considering. If you're taking it personally, and that its impolite, then so be it. Like u said, this is a public forum, not an election. We should just come straight to the point, and give advices and opinions for the better of others. It may be judgemental, it may be touchy, but at the end of the day, if the intentions are good, then who cares. We're not a SDP forum anyway.</div>
