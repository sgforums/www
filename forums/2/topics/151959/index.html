And he simply do not pick up his calls, sent a registered letter, he did not collect.<br><br>So after 7-8 months...his insurance company happily write me a letter saying they closed the case and repudiated liability in this case.<br><br>So i am being left in limbo after paying the excess for my repairs? His ins company can just conveniently say repudiated liability?????<br><br>what kind of system is this?????????</div>

TP is only asking him based on the authority TP has.  well... TP kind of make him go his ins company.. but that is AFTER his ins. company repudiated liability.... so still i don't get a single cent. hahaah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alamak...  the situation is this....   he already signed a statement agreeing that he reversed onto my vehicle. but if he die die do not want to report the accident to his own insurance company... his company will not pay out of his policy because they cannot anyhow just pay out without hearing his side of story.<br><br>i am just pissed on the fact that how come insurance company can just convenienly say they close the case because he did not report thus its a breach in the insurance policy's terms and therefore repudiated liability.<br><br>if like that, in future, i open insurance company... whenever got accident, i just say i repudiate liability becaue he got into an accident which because in the terms of the policy i stated that he cannot be involved in the accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah, looks like you may have to resort to legal actions. at least you got evidence that he bang you with his signature, so can sue him for incurring damages. hopefully someone can advise you on this. good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, my lawyers (engaged by my insurance company) say that given the situation, it's better to just close the case and i suck thumb on the excess i already paid out<br><br>because the legal fees is over the excess i have paid and have no guarantee i can claim legal fees against the other party. even if court ruled that i can claim, he might not have the ability to do so also. like that i double suck thumb.<br><br>i just super pissed lah..... insurance company can fly aeroplane just like that.</div>
