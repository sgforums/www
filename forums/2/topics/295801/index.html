            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple,<br><br>I've decided to get my own car after getting my license in 2003. My driving experiences were with these cars which belongs to my family members:-<br><br>1) Ford Orion 1.6l (manual)<br>2) Volkswagen Bora 1.6l (auto)<br><br>I've noted down some cars which i may consider buying (new and pre-owned). I know its easier to call up agents or go down to showrooms for test drives but i feel its better to ask around before i make my decision.<br><br>The 2 cars that i have short listed so far are:-<br><br>1) Subaru Impreza WRX 07' model (Auto) 85k<br>2) Mazda RX8 1.3 (Auto) slightly above 90k<br><br>I need opinions from this car forum especially from owners who actually owns one of the above cars.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys,<br><br>personally i find that these 2 cars are the most appealing to me, suits my budget well. i want to drive a car that:-<br><br>- is an AT japanese branded sports sedan/coupe of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>- is only for myself to drive.i rarely ferry pple around.  (dunt really fancy 2 seaters)<br>- doesn't stand out too much yet unique, simple looking yet classy.<br>- a car with respectable road holding and safety features.<br>- has various parts/spare parts that can be found easily. (justin case if anything unfortunate happens to the car)<br>- most importantly the boot fits a golf bag and 20+ pair of shoes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>honestly, i like the wrx and i like the rx8 too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but i cant afford both. im thinking if i get either one i will regret for not getting the other one instead. that explains the number of shoes i have to keep in my car alone.<br><br>appreciate the help and comments guys.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The rex, assuming your talking about the new one, has a poor ass boot. Highly doubt that you can fit your golf clubs in there. It's not small, it's just really shallow. You can fit your Imelda Marcos shoe collection in there just fine though, I think.<br><br>The 8, has a rather big boot, if I remember correctly. A member here has one, though it's the manual version. Very deep boot, just not very wide if memory serves. May just fit in the clubs. Try, to be certain.<br><br>I gather that your female, and looking for an easy to drive, quick-ish car, hence the choice of AT. You flipping a coin and buying whichever car, would serve you just as well. The 8 shades the rex in looks though, by my reckoning.<br><br>All said, my money would be on the rex. MotorImage doesn't have the best reputation for after sales service though. So it's a hard one to call. If I were in your shoes, I would go for some other choices, with MT. But I not making the decision today, so I would recommend you go test drive both cars, to see which one your comfortable in. The rex will be a little difficult, but worth a shot.<br><br>Side note. There are other cars, which are probably not as fast, but might fit into your requirements too. 1 which comes to mind is the 2l version of the new Honda Civic. Need to see if they pass your looks test and drive test. Shoes and golf clubs test, pretty sure they pass just fine.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i cant seem to appreciate the design of the civic.<br><br>anyway i went to take a look at both cars; yesterday evening, I test drove the auto wrx. earlier today, i viewed the RX-8.<br><br>finally i can decide on which car to choose from.<br><br>- RX-8's boot space is not as what you've mentioned. it's pretty small.<br>- RX-8's interior is quite nice.<br>- Rear seats are big enough to sit comfortably but leg room is not so spacious.<br><br>Didn't proceed to test drive the RX-8. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>After which i went to book the WRX.<br><br>- I like the boot space.<br>- Comfortable STI bucket seats sits me nicely.<br>- Almost 2k+ discount for the price. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>- The practical rear wiper which is extremely useful for rainy days.<br>- I can't describe any more. I just fell in love with it when i test drove the car <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>normalboi, tks for ur useful inputs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why choose auto? I mean that since you'd want to drive a sports car the experience would be more shiok if they were MT instead of AT. Of course, controlling the clutch can be a bitch at times but once you get the hang of it, driving the car will feel much more exciting than the auto version.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth of opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether the RX8 or the Rex will be a better buy for u will also depend on your age due to the cost of insurance. If you are young, insurance for RX8 will be cheaper since it is considered 1.3 rather than the rotary engine. If you are young and buy Rex, be prepared to pay heaps for insurance.<br><br>Also pls look at the cost of maintaining the car...RX8 maintenance and FC not cheap.

Which company's insurance and how much is it? Sorry for sounding like a kaypoh :X Ball park figures will do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Intakes, exhausts, bodykits, basically anything that you can put into the car, that didn't come with it when you purchased it. Be warned though, MI is prone to void the warranty of the entire car if you so much as change to an aftermarket air filter.  Then again, I heard their service centre sucks anyway so maybe servicing your car at external subaru specialist workshops might work too. You gotta think about that one yourself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
