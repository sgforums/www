              <p>Good day,</p>
              <p>I like to share some interesting videos to discuss why alternative fuel takes so long to develop.</p>
              <p>Why depend on Oil? Heard about Global Warming? Heard about Going Green? Heard about saving our planet?</p>
              <p>There is no need to depend on petrol or diesel to run a car.</p>
              <p>Look at the oil company's astonishing profits with their endless hikes that the world of  consumers can do nothing about.</p>
              <p>Hydrogen is said to be too difficult to produce such that it is not viable economically. But how can anyone explain the videos I shall be showing you ? </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water Car</span> :  many years ago (about 20), a philipino engineer found a way to dehydrolyse water to get hydrogen to power the engine. He talks about the numerous hurdles he encountered and political aspects relating to the use of alternative energy.  </p>

              <p>i forgot in which book i read this from. here's the gist of it.</p>
              <p>scientists have already found out how to use the earth's magnetic field to generate energy. energy can be generated anywhere, anytime, at no cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sounds like atlantis though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and to TS, so what energy do you think can replace oil? so far, it is still not economical to use other forms of energy.</p>
              <p>look at foodbase ethanol. i don't think i need to say here whats the problem is.</p>
              <p>nuclear energy. unless you can somehow use them to power cars (bear in mind that there need to be safeguards preventing abuse by terrorists), nope, they are useless.</p>
              <p>and FYI, most hydrogen nowadays are still derived from fossil fuels. even if you can produce hydrogen from water, (seawater as such, you don't want to have a water shortage crisis, when we are alr experiencing the side effects of foodbase fuel), energy is still needed to power up the process of producing hydrogen. you can't get energy from nothing.</p>
              <p>and where r u going to get that large an amount of energy, to make a switch to alternative energy feasible? even wind mills take up space. they take up alot of space to generate just a bit of energy. where are you going to find so much windy and vacant land?</p>
              <p>conclusion: we are hook onto fossil fuels, and there is NO other feasible substitute at hand presently.</p>

              <p>I like your paragraph.</p>
              <p>Anyway I shall share what I learned from my final year project in NUS. I did a project on energy harvesting, and in summary, I can say that there are a lot of energy that are wasted, in the form of heat, sound, vibrations. I looked into the mechanical vibrations.</p>
              <p>If we can harvest these vibrational energies using either of 3 methods, electromagnetic, electrostatic or piezoelectric, we can be more efficient =&gt; use less energy overall. This is energy scavenging.</p>

              <p>Hello Deathmaster,</p>
              <p>To answer your question, I like to remind you that CNG is already replacing Petrol. This is a baby step but a proven step no doubt. The fact is OIL is being replaced since some time ago but due to some reasons, the focus on R&amp;D and mass production of green cars and alternative fuel is not great enough to lower substantially the reliance on OIL.  Many companies rely on Oil to earn money. These will not like the idea of course. Given the power of OPEC, do you think OPEC will promote the demise of its industry?  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An interesting thing i notice is that no government is able to lower the oil price for some unknown reasons.</p>
              <p>Australian PM Rudd has announced he will try to talk to OPEC.</p>
              <p>My prediction : status quo.</p>
              <p>I am not sure why is oil not controllable by governments of the world combined?</p>
              <p>Could anyone tell me which leader has stopped any oil price hike  in the last couple of years?</p>
              <p>Who is the mastermind ?</p>
              <p>Is it Money? </p>

              <p>But why 20 years down the road one might ask. Don't ask me - ask the power that be. If all these technology is available and "people" are not putting this to solve the oil prices problem it makes us believe that politics controls science and technology availability to the core !  So for all the freedom expressed by western press I say .. try and get a decent reply to just this issue and we ( I mean me) would give you the respect you people deserve.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong - I am not saying that the western press is responsible for this hold back of this technology, I am saying that at the end of the day if something we (I mean people who think like me on this issue of alternative energy) cannot get this alternative energy into the market says it all. They (the free press) are not that strong a force, it is beaten by another power (that be).</p>
              <p>Someone or who can rally this on to deliver this tech (if it proves to be true, seems so to me, who am a beliver of things till proven false) to solve our problem?. I don't think I am too harsh and I write with lots of ignorance to the many geo-tech-political-reality of things - but to get it off my chest I must say "Shame"( for want of a better word) on the power of the free press and bow down and surrender to the other power(s).</p>
              <p>ps: I'd love to have this free press of the west (or whichever country's free press ) stand up and be counted to bring this tech to us - the consumer! Now is there anyone out there? "Only by results shall we know the actual strength.-me"</p>
              <p>results: means deliver that tech to us; overcome all obstacles; convince us; convince the governments, bring in the business people who dare to stick their heads/hands out into the project (literally !), combat with the oil power owners/businesses.</p>

              <p>Hello Deathmaster,</p>
              <p>To answer your question, I like to remind you that<strong> CNG is already replacing Petrol</strong>. This is a baby step but a proven step no doubt. The fact is OIL is being replaced since some time ago but due to some reasons, the focus on R&amp;D and mass production of green cars and alternative fuel is not great enough to lower substantially the reliance on OIL.  Many companies rely on Oil to earn money. These will not like the idea of course. <strong>Given the power of OPEC, do you think OPEC will promote the demise of its industry?</strong>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An interesting thing i notice is that <strong>no government is able to lower the oil price for some unknown reasons.</strong></p>
              <p>Australian PM Rudd has announced he will try to talk to OPEC.</p>
              <p>My prediction : status quo.</p>
              <p>I<strong> am not sure why is oil not controllable by governments of the world combined</strong>?</p>
              <p><strong>Could anyone tell me which leader has stopped any oil price hike  in the last couple of years?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Who is the mastermind ?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Is it Money? </strong></p>

              <p>first, before answering your question, i would like to point out something.</p>
              <p><strong>"CNG is already replacing Petrol</strong>. "</p>
              <p>May i know where is CNG derived from? it is gas from the same oilfield that are slowing drying up. what makes you think that it is/ will still be in abundant supply? also, since CNG produced less energy per unit as compared to oil, more gas will have to be burnt to sustain our current level of energy usage. that means that if we were to fully switch to CNG, it still wouldnt last long.</p>
              <p>CNG, is at best a short term solution. now now, it appears to be cheaper than petrol, but using the price of diesel fuel as a case study, we can see that it will soon reach the price of petrol. so, using CNG may not really solve our current problem of sourcing for cheap alternative fuel.</p>
              <p><strong>Given the power of OPEC, do you think OPEC will promote the demise of its industry?</strong> <strong>... no government is able to lower the oil price for some unknown reasons.</strong></p>
              <p>the point is that OPEC is now fully exploiting the current global thirst for oil. they knew that their supply of oil is dwindling, but they still wish to make immense profits before their oil runs out. so what do they do? while demand is increasing, they delibrately cut down on the supply of oil, so as to drive up prices. that way, they get more money from selling less.</p>
              <p>that's also the reason why you see middle eastern oil rich countries are growing richer than ever. Russia, having nothing to offer but oil and gas, thanks to the oil crisis, is now having an economic boom, with us seeing the re-emergence of russian power.</p>
              <p>abt ur 2nd pt regarding governments trying to lower price. that's impossible. let say, if you are the ruler of an oil exporting country, would you lower ur profits buy selling more oil at a lower price? bear in mind that once that oil is gone, ur flow of wealth will also stop. so sane person will do that. oil dependent developed nations are pushing hard to lower oil prices, but they, as consumers, but do anything about it. they are held at gunpoint by OPEC. look what happen in Iraq. they had tried to take over Iraq's oilfield, but in the end, it resulted in decreased production, the opposite of what they had intended.</p>
              <p>I<strong> am not sure why is oil not controllable by governments of the world combined</strong>?</p>
              <p>there's an organisation responsible for this. and that's called the OPEC. they are only interested in increasing the price of their products.</p>
              <p>no oil, no talk. the USA, being a nett consumer of oil, has no say in the fixing of the oil price. the power to fix price all lies in the hand of OPEC.</p>
              <p><strong>Could anyone tell me which leader has stopped any oil price hike  in the last couple of years?</strong></p>
              <p>no one. the leaders of the world can't do nuts about it.</p>
              <p><strong>Who is the mastermind ?</strong></p>
              <p>OPEC</p>
              <p><strong>Is it Money? </strong></p>
              <p>Yes.</p>

              <p>regarding hydrogen. please don't be affected by government propaganda and oil-companies propaganda.</p>
              <p>it is NOT a practical source of fuel. rather, if you ask anyone knowledgeable in hydrogen fuel tech, they will tell you it is more of a form of storage than an actual fuel.</p>
              <p>you can't obtain hydrogen naturally. they have to be "manufactured", and the manufacturing process will still require energy input. so where do you get this energy for use in hydrogen production? right now, scientists spoke of having large scale wind plants out in the sea and using photovoltaic cells to generate the energy required.</p>
              <p>but think logically, is that feasible? you need several sq kilometers of land for windplants, in an effort to generate enough hydrogen to power one car for how many days?</p>
              <p>to power all the cars the world, you would alr have ran out of land to install wind plants. same applies to solar panels, with them being even more space-inefficient. not all places on earth are suitable for solar panel (light intensity etc), thus, some places need a even larger area for solar panel to power one car.</p>
              <p>nowadays, hydrogen is still produced from fossil fuels, not from water as the advertisers would like you to believe. hydrogen is just a scam.</p>
              <p>nuclear power plants can actually solve the problem of finding energy sources, and hydrogen can be used to store energy generated by the nuclear plants. but the problem is that i don't seem to see Shell nuclear plants popping up everywhere.</p>

              <p>Hey Brudder!</p>
              <p>I am glad we are on the same wavelength on most aspects of the issue.</p>
              <p>they say adopting CNG technology is about going-green. As long as it can replace oil...</p>
              <p>I guess its still work-in-progress for the green movement.</p>
              <p>Use of Electric cars can definitely lessen the reliance on oil. Fortunately, free energy like wind can generate electricity via windmills which supplies much of Holland's electricity needs. This generated electricity can be used to charge an electric car.</p>
              <p>I think though obvious many in the world, even educated ones, do not understand or come to realise that a fast and powerful car need not run on oil. Oil-engine-car concept is a few hundred years old technology that only kept being improved or innovated but the core  is still the same old technology.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, i am glad to know that you also agree that no superpower in the world , even when all of them combined is more powerful than an organisation called OPEC. This is the fact , and this fact is actually $ and self preservation and GREED.  I would agree that DEMOCRACY can be controlled/destroyed/dictated by $ also.</p>
              <p>Hydrogen and electricity - how many hundreds of years ago were they discovered? Why no progress in this aspect for so long ? What happened to the inventors of electric motor and hydrogen car? Why was the american inventor murdered? </p>
