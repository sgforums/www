VEry EX right ?  But said got what promo deduct $6K subject to 4 COE bidding ?  Don't understand.<br>Then see Aveo5 which i scare something wrong ? As seldom see on road.<br>CAr bad or service or spare  parts ex/problems.<br>Then saw the New Aveo Sedan, look cool with a custom cd/radio. the feel is different.  they say its only $1K or $2K more than Aveo5(HB).<br>But now can see back price is just under $50 (A) so ya like u said can consider Vios/Lancer etc.<br>Headache.<br>Also have this freind who brouhght me to these 2 (Kia, Chevy) showroom , &amp; he's keep asking me to buy.

Also price from Kia goes up &amp; down with COE.  As for Hyundai worse, got bidding price which can be $6k-$8k lower than listed price.<br><br>Aveo comes with ABS, 1 airbag &amp; fog lights which Rio doesn't provide.<br>And you Must go to Chevy &amp; Kia showroom to see the interior, &amp; tell us what your opinion after that.  &amp; Rio u must be careful as the one in showroom is Not the bare version(which u will get) but with all the add on which u must pay to upgrade.<br><br>You can read it up at May issue of Torque - Aveo vs Verna vs Rio.  Sorry not Motoring my mistake, that just have the review on Aveo.<br></div>
