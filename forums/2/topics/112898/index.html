            <div class='col-md body'>According to parf value, your car is only about 35k now. According to the second-hand industry, it is about 50k.

Easily 2 mountain bikes  without the need to take out the front wheel. Anyway, you are driving a hatch now, so it should be about the same. Or if you don't mind, you can try City, the boots space is definitely the biggest of all the cars I see so far, unless you are talking about lorry. Bottom line for me is, if you have the budget, go for Honda, Honda's engine have had the best ratings in term of fuel comsumption.<br><br>As for the interest thing, you might want to check with your loan agent or the SE who sell you matrix. They can give the the extra information. Now there are some matrix on sale at the sgcarmart web site, might want to take a look to monitor the reponse of buyers there. Like how long it takes to sell off 1 matrix.<br><br>From feedback here and there, you will be having a really hard time selling off your matrix, too much hard comments about it.</div>

Unless, the price of 1st hand car goes up by a lot. But then...... even if you want buy a brand new car, you'll need more money.<br><br>I will say, hold on at least 7-8 yrs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, new to this forum.  Regarding the Matrix, this is my opinion.<br><br>Based on my assumption, if loan at $65k @ 2.45% for 10yrs, the P+I = $80,925. If assuming u settled after 2 yr, the settlement amt is abt $54,511(est).  Current MV for matrix assuming yr Jan 03 maybe around $40k, tat means u have to topped up $14511 to bank in order to settle the outstanding. Even if stay for 5 yr then settled will also not break even. Just my view. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It is safer.<br>Good6</div>

Of course those are the lucky ones who gotten the better cars from their lots. If you are into productions and stuff, you would know 99% yield isn't something you can be proud of.</div>
