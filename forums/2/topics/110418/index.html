            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if this is related. But my brother took up some bank loan 4 years ago to repay in one year. The deal is similar to what you wrote and I don't think I heard any complain from him about any hidden conditions. In his case, he was able to borrow $$ from people around him to pay in full but took the loan intentionally since the rebate is more than the interest.</div>

Whether u take 1 year or 7 year loan, conditions are the same - that means u still get $1500 discount.<br><br>All they are interested is to make sure u get the loan even though u hv the money to pay all at once.If u are good at negotiating, u can still get the $1500 rebate w/o obtaining loan.<br><br>Once, my cousin walk away in frustration when the SE told him that he hv to take the loan to get the discount (he wants to pay whole amt). SE saw him walk away, change his mind, then say he can get same discount w/o getting loan.<br><br>It is only call HSBC discount in name only. It was more of car dealer marking up its prices by $1500.<br><br>Its like bank will pay car dealer incentives for every customer that take up its loan.<br></div>
