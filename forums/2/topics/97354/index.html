            <div class='col-md body'>Since your fren has successfully bidded for the COE and paper states that he should be receiving by this month, than he has the favour of winning this "case". Ask your fren to go screw that agent of his.. Go tell him that he has bidded and got the COE and paper indicates that he should receive the car by this mth..<br><br>There is no such thing as forefit... If he insist on one, you can bring matters to court.. Where the court, will in this case go in favour of you.. Due to the reasons and evidence that is present... I have not heard in my life where a downpayment is forfitted if a buyer wishes to back out due to valid reasons like the one you mentioned above.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
