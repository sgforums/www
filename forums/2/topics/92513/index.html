Which I feel is important, so you signal, you turn your head to the mirror, to the blindspot, but must really got check! Not for show, you turn ur head for a reason one not for only showing to TP only. Make the judegement to lane change or not. Some ppl are drill until they became automatic to just swerve in even there is car behind.<br><br>Ease in according to your speed. Based on your speed, ease in nicely, speed is important or else, you can be judge into making a abrupt lane change or late lane change.<br><br>My 2 cents!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I find that if the guy in front signals that he's gonna change lanes, i can at least be warned and hang back a bit, and let him in. often find myself having to jam on the brakes when someone cuts in suddenly. so far, when i signal i haven't had the problem of ppl speeding up to cut me off, so i think its ok. when I was L plate, i had a lorry carrying gas cylinders run right up behind me in spite of having signalled early on. oh well. the roads r unpredictable. u win some, u lose some.</div>
