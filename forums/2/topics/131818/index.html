Loan of $32K to be paid over 4 years still must come up with $734 per month. Somemore got carpark ($65) and petrol charges ($100).. in total about $900 a month. This excludes road tax, maintenance, and miscellaneous.<br><br>Lets say $1k a month. For an individual who earns $2k, after cpf will be $1600. less car payment will be $600.

            <div class='col-md body'>besides earning power, it will very much depend on one's priorities.<br>i know of some people whose household income is over $10k pm, but doesnt even want to have a car, bcos they think cars are a sure-lose-money liability rather than asset; and they rather save up the money for investment.<br><br>so it depends on how much $$ u place on the intangible benefits like convenience (availability as and when u want it, compared to no taxis/public transport) and status symbol etc.<br><br>i know some people who earn &lt;$3k and still buy car, bcos they don't mind no savings at all. They believe in seizing the day and enjoy while it lasts!<br><br>so, to each his own. for me, i think my threshold would be to spend at most 10-20% of pay on car pm. and that's it, no more than that.</div>

OPC still 700 per month, either full loan and a petty decent car.<br><br>But of course saving 1 k would be impossible if you own a car at such a salary.

Honestly, if you're the type like me, who has to travel out of Singapore often, you'll realise how ridiculous the cost of owning and maintaining a car in Singapore is.<br><br>As more and more SIngaporeans, start realising this, I'm sure there will come a point when the car showrooms will be left vacant.<br><br>I read recently that despite the hefty taxes, COEs, and the ridiculously high prices for cars and petrol, certain popular brands like Toyota are actually marked up by more than 10% per car by the distributor!! That too for made-in-Thailand cars, which are dirt  cheap everywhere else. Have Singaporeans lost their heads, or have we just accepted the ridiculous price tags as norms You decide....</div>

It will be cheaper in some sense. If maintain well it will serve to you and your family well. Alternatively you might also consider choosing an OPC.<br>Owning a car is always enjoyable but have your sums done well before you commit.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
