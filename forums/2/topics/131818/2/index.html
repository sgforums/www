            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"></span><br><br>Hi,<br>I'm new here. Just to share my views on having cars in sg. I've been owning cars for more than 10 years now and have changed cars 5 times. Not because of luxury or status but I have to use it for work. I travel a lot everyday to do my work as a serviceman.<br>What everybody said  is true. If  your paypacket doesn't hit 4k per month try not to buy car. Public Transport is much better.<br>Im earning  just above 2.4k and it's totally not enough even for my monthly expenditures. Thanks to my wife for supporting me all these years.<br>Think about this:<br><br>monthly inst : &gt; $700<br>petrol  : $350 ($65 / 400km) incl. weekend.<br>parking : $90 (multistorey)<br>parking coupons : # about $30 plus cash card parking.<br>( a must every month).<br><br>servicing every 10,000km ( synthetic), or 5,000km (normal oil): $95 : $65++<br>and per year Road tax about $1k<br>Insurance ( as in my case 50% NCD ) about 1k.<br><br>What about breakdown?<br><br>my 2nd hand 1 1/2 yrs old car brokedown just after guaranteed period of 3 yrs. I have to fork out about 1k for repair. (engine wobble, radiator leak)<br>what about consummables?<br>change tyres<br>change brake pad<br>auto transmission oil<br>change belting<br>service air-con ( not hot enough)<br>etc.<br><br>Other than that fines  like parking and speeding also have to take into consideration since I 'm always on the road even though it does not always happen.<br><br>I have 3 kids, 1st  in poly, 2nd  in sec 4, 3rd  in pri 4.<br>so, How do I survive?<br><br>I dont smoke<br>I dont drink<br>I dont buy 4-D<br>I dont eat lunch, but bring some sandwich homemade just to stop my worms from grumbling. no bfast.plain water  brought from hm.<br>weekend, less travelling. ( at least save petrol)<br><br>Its a nightmare to own a car in sg. I am trying to get rid of the car end of the year when the price permits and carry on with my job like old days riding an old bike just to keep budget low since I really dont need it anymore when my kids are all grown up and independant.<br><br>I  spent alot of money on the cars and cant even save a dollar.<br>Its a burden to me now for having a car .<br>So, think twice b4 buying a car.<br>Is it necessary????????? unless you have lots of savings in the bank after selling your house. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>(Hyundai 1.6, Auto).<br><br></div>

Vios is reliable compared to Lancer and the Petrol you save would be about S$20-S$50 per month. Road tax about S$5-S$7 more. Or cheaper cars like Aveo, Accent, Rio will give you a lighter load, of about S$120 per month. Or best, Picanto for only S$400 per month.<br><br>I am always glad I got Kelisa. Cause now that I have a car, my activities increases and need that little bit more to spend. Key point here is you will spend more than just those spend on cars. And how long did you spend in your car per day in the end? Think about it!</div>
