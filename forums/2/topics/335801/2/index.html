              <p>Brake pad compounds are made of varying materials, however, the heat integrity is only as good as the compound with the lowest melting point. A good example would be phenolic resin, used commonly as a binder in brake pad material. However, at temperatures of more than 450 deg c, the resin will char and evaporise, causing the entire pad to lose its structural integrity.</p>
              <p>So say a normal, basic brake disc made of cast iron (Fe, Si, Mn) has a melting point of more than 900 deg c, so tell me, do you think under extreme braking conditions which cause the brake disc itself to warp, scar, crack or melt, will the pad give way first, or will the disc give way first?</p>

              <p>Yes I agree that you should get a brand new one. With the base GTR about 260k++, why not top up 20-30k more (considering the fact you're already prepared to spend upwards of 200k), and get yourself a brand new GT-R that look, smell and feel new, and have the peace of mind?</p>
              <p>Besides, with the interest rate for used cars marginally higher than used car loans, you might actually be better off getting a brand new car, and with COE Cat B prices so low (8k +), even lower than Cat A , now's probably a very good time to buy the Cat B car you've always wanted.</p>

              <p>i'd rather u get a brand new GTR, i mean, its going to cost a little bit more than a 2nd hand right? i mean, since ure going to pay such a big price for the car.. and im sure u can afford the brand new one.</p>
              <p>the 6 series has about the same fuel consumption as the GTR. and for the similar price tag, the GTR out performs the 6 series ANY time.</p>
              <p>to seiKai:</p>
              <p>u sure brake pads cannot melt under harsh braking? normal brake pads are able to wisthand 400-500 deg.</p>
              <p>trying using them on a performance car and go 10 laps on pasir gudang.. u see what will happen. obviously, i know my facts before i dare to post.. if not, i would just ask people if i am unsure.</p>

              <p>Obviously, manufacturers of reknown brake kits have designed their brake rotors to achieve optimal heat ventilation, and secondly, the brake pad and disc material of racing level application are designed to take up to much higher temperatures of up to 1000 deg c or more. Ever heard of carbon-ceramic disc brakes? Ever heard of slotted/cross-drilled rotors? Ever heard of, Endless YS445? Project Mu Max900i?</p>

              <p>erm, yes, u do not need to have bigger brakes if u have more horses.. u just need to brake earlier.. however, by braking earlier, u allow the stock brakes to have longer contact thus building up heat.. hence, dangerous to drive spiritedly..</p>
              <p>eh? since when i own a performance car? i only drive a 4 door mid-size family sedan.. 1600cc.</p>
