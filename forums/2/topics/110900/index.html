For a new car, usually a person need to fork out about $600 for monthly payment for 7 year.<br><br>For the dealer that offer you the nissan presea ! Forgot it, you are paying 404  for a old car , but you be paying a lot more for petrol . The worst, it is a almost 8 yr car, the maintenance cost will be super high with expensive parts needed to be change. That a total crap deal that will kill you.<br><br>Would advice you to  be save up for a few more years, before you get a new car.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey the advice is clear and right, DONT BUY A CAR. U defintely cant afford it. Yes true the monthly can be just 500+ for a new car, but do u know it will cost abt 1.1-1.2 k per mth to maintain a car, including those car park, insurance and road tax, not adding the maintenance charges. And if you think u can just dispose it when u cant afford, think again coz nobody will want to buy a used car given the low price now. Unless your pay is 3k and above, dont commit suicide. Take your train or bus and though is 200+ for that, there is no other maintenace or extras. Trust me, your pay wont be enuf, get this idea off your head!!!</div>

Monthly installment only constitutes about half the expenditure on a normal 1.5-1.6 car.<br>FYI, even a van would cost you about $700 for expenses. Not to mention a car. Ride a bike or take public transport lah. Dun be seduced by low installment.<br>And NEVER buy COE car!</div>

Sure can kill you know, even though i don't have instalment to pay. your transport cost of 223 mthly is quite ok what, imagine you have to pay much more to convert to car. my operating cost is 400pm, taking insurance n road tax divide by 12 plus the monthly parking n petrol. so think twice b4 u commit...<br><br>cheers</div>

It will be quite safe to add another $600-$800 on top of your monthly instalment to calculate how much you will be paying for a month. Older car, you might need to add more for the higher fc and maintenance.<br><br>As for $500 a month instalment, you can check out cars with that cost around $50k and see if they give you 10 year loan with 0 downpayment or not. As for COE car, it really depends very much on your luck, If you really have to get a COE car, get a qualified and experience mechanic to check for potential problems.<br><br>But like other say, unless you cannot live without driving a car ( like for work, other commitment) then try to live without a car, you will be able to enjoy life more.<br><br>Well, onit, the decision is up to you.

That's why I keep restricting myself not to rent so much. The free mileage is definitely not enough. And if you rent during the weekends (Fri 7pm till Mon 8am), it would be very expensive as the free mileage is only 100km!!!<br><br>I do agree that car sharing is convenient. For car rental, I need to take a bus down to town and get the car, and the same when returning the car.<br><br>Free4ever, you mentioned there is budget rental, can PM me? Thanks.<br><br></div>
