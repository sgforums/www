            <div class='col-md body'>I looked at Hyundai's website <a href="http://singapore.hyundai-motor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://singapore.hyundai-motor.com/</a>, the ARF nett price for Getz 1.6 GLS 5DR AUTO is $41,273 while its On The Road Price With COE is $52,888, so the COE offset is $11,000. If I buy OPC does it mean that the $17,000 rebate would also be used to offset the ARF?</div>

Reliability and low price doen't always go together.  IF you have 30k cash, then you might want to consider a new car but take 10 to 20k of loan. depreciation wise is pretty close to 2-3 yrs car, plus you get factory warranty for the next 3 yrs. Maybe you can consider the two cars below :<br><br>1. Toyota vois 52k - argubably one of the most reliable budget car, but annual depreciation is about 4.7k<br><br>2. Kia Picanto 41k - one of the cheapest, but being korean, its reliability is not as reputable as a toyota. dep &lt; 4k<br><br>with your budget, you might want to consider opc if your usage is more for evenings and weekends. go pick up a free copy of "Carbuyer" guide from the nearest petrol station. you'll get lots of info to elp in your search<br><br>anyone with mor recomendations ??<br><br></div>
