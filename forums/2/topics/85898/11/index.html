Anyway by lowering your suspension, will your chassis not hit those high humps or when your car is fully loaded? Or are the shocks hard enough to damp out the motion? After changing the suspension, does it significantly improve your cornering at higher speed? Sorry abit inquisitive and i have so many things i wanna ask, hee hee. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TEIN, HKS are all coilovers which are height adjustable. If you set it to a decent height of say 30mm down, it is unlikely to scrape the undercarriage. But please know that coilovers are pretty hard, they might re-wire your neuro-connections.<br><br>There is the Nismo or Impul suspension which is just a normal upgraded set.<br><br>Lowering springs are still quite comfortable, handling would be 7/10 tenths of a full suspension change, but still a lot more sporty with minimal body roll than the standard suspension.<br><br>If anyone decides to upgrade your car's suspension. This is my advice.<br><br>If you are not into having a lowered car but just want something substantial in improving car handling.<br>Shock Absorber Upgrade<br><br>If you do not drive hard but want the K12 to look gorgeous without a major financial outlay.<br>Lowering Springs<br><br>If you want the full monty cause you want a looker plus improved handling.
