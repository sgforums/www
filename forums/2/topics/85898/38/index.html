I believe we should not be deprive of anything lesser right ! NNM CLUB !!!!<br><br>I guess I would try to put in what I had picked up during my skool days ... and put it to use ! hahaha ! Do we have a theme for our club, designs can be intimidating to "OtherS" at times.... ! I suggest we can have a theme and work on the designs, it will be better in case "others" would try to start some sparks and opinions abt the decal. I guess the theme can give us the fundamentals, "kool" "fun" club and etc......! gentlemen and ladies time for your contribution to the best decal design award !!! hohoho !<br><br>I will be looking forward to see your "decal" design tomorrow!<br><br>I come in peace !!!<br><br></div>
