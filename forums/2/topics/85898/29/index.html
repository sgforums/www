            <div class='col-md body'>Hey all,<br><br>Sorry to side track from cars a little but today I just got given a brand new digital camera but i don't need it. Was wondering if anyone wanted to buy it from me? Its still unopened, with warranty, memory card, with accessories like wrist band and funky sporty pouch, batteries, EasyShare software etc. The model is Kodak EasyShare CX7300. Anyway, make me an offer if anyone is interested. I think its going for $299 in the shops?<br><br>Thanks! Addygirl.</div>
