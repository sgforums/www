Should give a wink <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So pple when are we meeting?<br></div></blockquote>Hi Everyone<br>I can understand how RoyCindy feel, as when i went to BT-TC to see the first march that was 4months ago, I encountered poor attitute from one of the SEs. Not only he got a stuck up look but also a c ah beng face.<br><br>He thot i cant affort to buy a car cos i was wearing quite casual. t-shirt &amp; jeans with sandal and gave me a look that can tell "u can't buy one lah, so dun waste my time ." I asked him what will be included as the price was steep. He replied "no bargain- the price is like that". He didn't even want to offer me any other things.<br><br>I got fed up with him and thinking beside your March I can afford others car like Jazz, Vios, Colt, Mazda 2 &amp; etc. So why should I see his face and buy from him.<br><br>I was direct and went to the reception and said for another SE to service me. Here came a fXXking face. He said he was the AM. I told him I am interested in the March but his staff seems not interested in servicing me. He can tell that I was keen and he offered me the price $72,500 with a reverse sensor. He said that was the best he can do. In fact before I went to the BT showroom  a friend of mine who purchased a Sunny from TCM gave him a gd package which includes a) reverse sensor b) alarm c) V-Cool sunshade, d) full leather e) $500 Com from the SE at a lower price than a March and more perks.<br><br>I told him off that why other customers can get a better package and he gave me that stupid look. He said in his company there is so many SE offering different items based on their own willingness and he cannot interfere. You are lucky if u can meet one that offer better. He will not force me to buy. I find him crazy but he gave me a great hint. The true colour of buying car from TCM in future I must ask many SE for items and freebies before i purchase These kind of so called AM act like shit, I cannot stand it when we are paying but yet got to see their stuck-up face. It is true that some of the SE maybe good but why do I have to bother and find time to get the best SE.<br><br>That company actually got such staff really ... no eye. I can remember his name was Ken-damn lousy salesperson.  What kind of standard?<br><br>With these kind of happening, I also dropped the idea of buying March. Luckily smart enough, went to a dealer. They are of better service, polite and willing to do business with me. " I rather pay willingly and happily then to pay to those c ah beng"<br><br>My car is now with me for 1mth plus. Wow really shiok. The engine is ok and very smooth. Initially i thought with 1.4 cc not powerful enough but so far not bad. I fetched before 4 big size women from airport to Tuas still manage to reach destination with no different.<br><br>Wow heng, never bear too much grudges jus because of the SE, the car is innocent.<br><br>I wanted to join you guys in Nov but I will out station.<br><br></div>
