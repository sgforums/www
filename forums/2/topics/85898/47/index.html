            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Addygirl:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi tweety<br><br>You have to go with your heart. All cars have their pros and cons. Its like choosing your wife or husband right? You just know thats the one you want cos you feel he or she is right for you, not only because the person has all the right traits? Usually its a particular something about person that you feel so attracted to that you absolutely want him/her in the end. Same as the car. For many of us, its the cute looks, or its the large interior/yet compact outlook, or its the unique design, or its the six airbags, or the special saftey features, or plasma cluster or its just feeling you get when ppl stop and stare to look at this gorgeous car. It really is a personal emotional decision. Whatever you choose, pick a car that you'll feel proud of to drive everyday cos its a long term item, not like a shirt or shoes that you change every few months... For me, i still get this feeling of butterflies in my tummy every morning when i see my car (had my car since june)! And not only that, i love this car even more now because of the club..the ppl who drive this car...admit it, we're a fun, cool, funky and friendly bunch!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Hi Tweety,<br><br>I sympathise with your test drive experience.  I tested a kiwi-green coloured one at Ubi and was very disappointed with the ride.  Over humps and potholes, I also felt the car 'crash' landing.  I walked away from booking it.  Then I went to test the C3 and Peugeot 206.  These two were great hump and pothole takers!  I was equally charmed by their great looks.  After much difficult deliberation, I gave the March another go, this time at BT.  I felt better and booked after that.<br><br>Why I booked it?  The March's design is an impressive retro-art form blanded with the latest technological offerings (I booked the elegance).  Just look at the back seat, eh, bench.  It looked like the back bench in the cute little 2-door Fiat 600 of late 1960s.  It's hard against the back and not contoured to hold the passenger in place.  You can literally roll around there when the car is on the move twisting around.  Then again, it was also like that  in the late 1960s of rock and roll!  I suspect the engineers were trying very hard to bland this piece of great retro-art.  In this sense, they have done a great job to retain some semblance of the ride that was like that then.  In making my decision, I followed my heart in choosing the design and my head in recognising value in the technological offerings vs. for example, the Peugeot 206.<br><br>As for the engine, I think its a little bit noisier than similar cars from the inside.  The test car was probably not well-maintained and causing you further discomfort.  At the end of the day, it depends on what you really want.  At this point in time, you are locked on between the March and Sunny.  The March will always turn heads, like a beautiful girl.  The Sunny is a reliable workhorse you see everywhere.</div>
