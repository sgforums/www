            <div class='col-md body'>Hello KamenRider, Kkt, tedz, KingMariot, forumtsungchian and Everyone.....<br><br>A big thank you to all of you for your objective feedback on the K12 March. They certainly help me to reach my decision a lot faster...... I am initially very surprised that you all, especially KamenRider, have provided me with so much feedback which are very objective and fair. Its heartening to know that someone like Tedz can still bother to log on to this forum even when he is away in LA...<br><br>I would have like to wait a little longer and pray for the price to drop a little but unfortunately, time is not on my side. I expect the price to rise further. I view the car on last Tuesday and fell in love with it at second sight. Was contemplating on whether to buy it especially when it was only the first car that I have seen. Two days later, the price shot up by 2.5K due to the slight COE increase and appreciation of the Japanese Yen. Was cursing my luck as it means a great difference of 2.5K within a short span of 48 hours. So I will probably sign the purchase agreement before next Tuesday before the price of the March appreciates again and out of my reach totally.<br><br>I certainly can't wait to lay my hands on my March and join the big Marches family. Wanna rub shoulder with King Mariot and get more tips from him as well as from the rest. For now, I just have to spend some time to think of the colour that I want but I know that no matter which colour I choose, it will still be the one and only March that I truly love. Will also need to bargain hard with my agent on giving me an extra VKool and rear sensor. The long wait till next Feb/Mar is killing me......<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety<br>'PS: Agree with nOrmalbOi that Tweety and Big Frame do not click but hey...Tweety's head is BIG....'<br></div>
