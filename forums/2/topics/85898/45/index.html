It used to be sold in this region until recently when its prices were reduced to the S$60K region. If only if I have a little more money then I can afford to take this gamble and see if the price will remain this way or lower.<br><br>Yeah! Some SEs like to make us think that they are not getting fat commission but in fact, I think they do get quite a fair bit.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

I dun want to wait too long because the last wait cos me extra $2.5K. Somehow, I felt that the price of the March may go up further. I will check with one or two Nissan authorised dealers tomorrow and see what the price difference would be.<br><br>Will keep you posted once I have signed the papers. I just wonder if there are anyone out there who failed to get their COE after 3 bids and have to top up some amount to secure the COE.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>Hi Tweety,<br><br>No worry as long as you didnt sign the paper ...but the min you sign the contract ...u cant change. Tat happens to my fren , she is also in this forum. But she was sp unhappy with the SE tat she complain to TC n finally they allow chg of SE  but must b fr the same branch.<br>I suggest u call my SE ...he is quite good. Very nice n professional and I heard his after service is also very good....His mobile : 91113113.  No harm checking it out with him<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Gorgeous March12s..<br><br>Again i have to apologise for rushing off again.. It was great tho speaking to some of you and esp driving in the convoy! My friends at the fullerton were out on the balcony if anyone noticed and were waving furiously at us!! They all said it looked so awesome!! all the colours..they were sooo impressed. I was soooo proud!<br><br>Anyway.. thanks all of you for making this happened.. And i promise JAN 15th.. Let's make it happen! I'll be in australia from next thursday till 30 December. So NYC, Kamen and Tedz... can you help drum up the enthusiasm...and think up of suitable locations where we can have bbq or a pot luck? (suitable locations can be those that have bbq pits or picnic spots near the carpark..etc, so that we can eat and admire our cars at the same time!) I feel that we have a great bunch of ppl and I can't wait for us to become great friends!<br><br>Tedz, well done on coming up with designs on the logo.. lets have more of us come up with some designs or ideas too and then we'll have a process where we can choose one, combine a few or whatever that can make this logo "ours". We'll all have a part of making this club happen!<br><br>Rock on and peace out!<br>Addygirl<br><br></div>
