She just replied that she can offer the V-kool classic or Huper Clear to me as well as the Reverse Sensor...I will have to top up a few hundreds if I opt for the Huper Optic or the V-Kool Mirage.

My SE tries to smoke me by telling me that the Vkool Mirage is top of the range and cost something like $900 to $1000 so she could not give it to me. She also mentioned that the Huper Optic cost $800 so its not possible unless I top up the difference. She said she could give me the cheaper VKool if I insist I want the Reverse Sensor as well without any additional cost. Actually, I am not trying to be unreasonable but I thought she would get a good commission (maybe $3 to $5k but she seems to give the idea that she is only getting $1 to $2k for my purchase). I wish I know roughly how much she will be getting so at least I can gauge if my demands are reasonable or not.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

If I got it correct, it seems from some of the correspondence in this forum that March is not available in Malaysia. Is that true? But how did you get it in the first place? Through parallel importer? My friend who is a Malaysian, swore to me that it is not available in Malaysia. One of the plus point for me to purchase the K12 is the fact that it is not available in Malaysia so it will be a lot easier for me to drive there with lower risk of being stolen as there are no market for it in Malaysia/Thailand/Cambodia. Those car thieves will have to think twice before stealing it cos it may be a lot easier for them to be nab while driving the March especially if it is rare in Malaysia.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Paul</div>

She also mentioned that the Huper Optic cost $800 so its not possible unless I top up the difference. She said she could give me the cheaper VKool if I insist I want the Reverse Sensor as well without any additional cost. Actually, I am not trying to be unreasonable but I thought she would get a good commission (maybe $3 to $5k but she seems to give the idea that she is only getting $1 to $2k for my purchase).
