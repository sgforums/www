(it is very "leh chey" to put back the airbags)so they are not doing it for elegance series anymore. plus, TCM has actually checked with japan n the reply was that it is not advisable to do anything to the seats for the elegance series....so.....u elegance owners can forget about getting leather for ur seats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>anyway,.....so i was there at jackspeed leather,....they showed me pics of the leather seats, design's not very nice. this is the 2nd time they change the design of the seats already. the old design was worse. initially, i was thinking i don't mind doing it....something different ma....but then....when i ask the sales guy if the leather seats will look nice in the marchie, from that sales guys expression, i can tell that it won't look very nice lor. he was like saying..." it's ok la....individual lor!" he then go on to say...."actually it's better u come down n see the actual made up leather seats of other march first before deciding if u want to do it or not." as i was going oversea the next day, he said when i'm back there should be one guy bringing in the march to do leather seats n he will let me know but he didn't get back to me....anyway, from his expression, i know the answer that don't think it will turn out nice lor....so...forget the idea liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>this is my experience to share with u guys! the choice is still urs! cheers!<br><br>so has anyone here done up leather seats for there marchies? care to share the experiences?! thanks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

For me, that(Thug) sound happens when i park on a slope..<br><br>*Installing a Tachometer-check with boring silver during the meet-ups...I heard Defi BF(Amber/Red illumination) has a Tachometer now but only available in Japan..damn it!!!<br><br>*Petrol consumption- I still clocking 380k-400k on full tank leh.....<br><br>*Car servicing- TCM cost a bomb for both minor(15,30,50,70 etc etc) and even more so for a Major service(10,20,40,60,80 etc etc)... Go to Autosaver they are good and friendly... After my 3 free service with TCM i started servicing elsewhere..<br>Autosaver-Kaki Bukit branch is super friendly and helpful, furthermore they do consult and flushing when they service your car...look for winson and tell him you wanna join the Nissan Club ($15) and he will give you a discount after you join the club...super worth it... and i do not work for them hehehheheheh... don't flame me hehehheheheh... use 5w-40 Fully syn oil....<br><br>K&amp;N Filters-Hiyo what you guys/gals waiting for, go get one..<br><br>Denso Iriduim Plugs- IKH 16 or IKH 20 both heat range can be used in that sense..<br>Change and feel the difference...<br><br></div>

(i'm still hoping for my dream of a group of marchies going for a drive together to sentosa or maybe even JB - even tho it may be a logistical nightmare with coordination of schedules!

RATTLING.. when i first got the car, i was puzzled by the sound too... finally (with the help of the workshop ppl during the first service) I found out it was due to the two strings that are connected to like little knobs that hold the back board.

Do you realise that when you open the door while listening to music (IE when the engine is on), the beeping comes on and it is so annoying!

It's about time eh.<br><br>This rattling business has been driving me crazy for the longest time. Its been banging on my ears since the first day. Have tried indenting new bump stops, pasting household rubber stoppers. But the tailgate still rattles over every hump. Short of replacing the entire thing, I've exhausted most of my initiatives. If I do not turn on the radio when i drive, it sounds like a concert in the forest with crackling and rattling all over. Nissan better wake up their ideas.</div>
