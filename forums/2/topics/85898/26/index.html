You mentioned servicing, my free servicing are up and was wondering if you bros and sis here goes back to TCM for servicing. Was warned that if do not go back to them warranty void. So LL must go back? How much on average is one servicing say at every 10000km? They have this $800 plus package for 4 servicing dunno if worth it.

Thats how most auto cars work these days.  There was once I rented an auto vehicle and I didn't realize that I needed to step on the brake to release the gear.  I kept pulling the gear and just couldn't get to D...started sweating in the car.
