            <div class='col-md body'>Hi KamenRider<br><br>I am driving an prapika orange March. I also agree with you that it is underrated and got lots of questions from friends and relatives on my decision to get one small car with a relatively big price. Could actually get a spacious Korean car like the Matrix or a Japanese Lancer. Was actually contemplating btw the Thai made Altis and March. Altis being the 'SAFE' bet, Toyatas reliabilty, space, low fuel consumption, blah, blah blah... but i settled for the 'RARE' one or at least then. Was trying then to find out  more about the car performance but there were not much information and first hand experience from fellow drivers.<br><br>So anyway, the experience is still very refreshing even though i am hitting about 15000km already, car's pickup is not bad, driving at speeds of around 130km/h is no problem, still quite stable.  But i tot the car sounds/feels really good at around 90-100km/h.<br><br>I once ferried  5 'fully grown' adults (average 90 kg/passenger)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> and the car performs admirably but of course the space in the rear is a tad tight  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> with all the big guys in the car.<br><br>I am hitting about 15km/l of petrol and that is very important to me with the price of petrol going up and me traveling long distance every day. One problem i have is cornering (90 degrees at traffic juntion) at high speeds, you really have to know the limits, so i was thinking of 'improving' certain things in the ride.<br><br>But its sure is a head turner and when i happen to see a fellow K12 March driver, i will try and wave <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So i was hoping that one day the K12 could have a meet up, take photos, drive around, makan, drive North, or whatever...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

The yellow is Funky...not loud! it suits the car real well. Bean is nice too..However with crystal blue, i see too many Mini Coopers with that colour. Don't worry about your car being vandalised..so many funky coloured cars nowadays.....<br><br>Looking forward to meeting other Marchies!</div>
