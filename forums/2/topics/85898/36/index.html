I think a few month ago i checked with them, they quote me half leather 650+ full leather 900+<br><br>I saw some of us had the intention to change the seats to leather. I tried to enquired the price from Jackspeed, MRZ and Tomo. Every company quoted me 1000 plus. I saw the previous thread that someone can get around 780+. I would like to know whether include the side panel or just the leather seat itself? For the price of 780+ should be for only dealer/agent pricing, i don't think we can get such a price from Jackspeed cos Jackspeed quoted me 1000 plus over the phone which only include the leather seats only without side panel.<br><br>I did some check out on the price for full leather seat and side panel cover with leather. I got a good lobang from MRZ Car Seat Company. This saleman told me if i organised a group purchase (min 5) can give me a better price. If anyone interested just in half-leather (50% pure leather, 50% PVC leather), they also can do it. It will be cheaper than full leather.<br><br>Just to let everyone knows that both model, Elegance and Comfort can have leather seat done but Elegance may cost slightly more, around 20 bucks than Comfort model due to the thread used for the 4 extra air bags compare to Comfort model only have 2 air bag. This what the saleman told me.... correct me if i'm wrong. Thanks!<br><br>Just wanted to share this good bargain among us, i'm not doing sale here. Pls don't mistaken cos i'm not earning any profit from it.  I wanted to change my seat to leather but too expensive, but if can get it done by group purchase, i can save few hundreds....right.... hehehe.....<br><br>Pls let me know during the meet up on 11 Dec at West Coast Mac or just post in this forums to discuss. Thanks!</div></blockquote></div>

When i first started this forum early on, you asked me to go to your forum and asking me to join it. To be honest, when i went over i felt the culture there did not suit me. So i decided to remain in this forum. But i think you kept "paging" for me.  I wanted this forum to be different in that different ppl are attracted to different things. It was not because i didn't respect your forum. I felt that your forum is already established with a certain identity which does not represent me. Your forum felt to me (and its really good for the die hard fans) very male dominated, structured, and very informative about Nissan technical stuff. I wanted to be in a more relaxed, simple and more girls and guys fun site. So thats why i feel its healthy to have different forums to cater to different ppl. I don't think its fair to restrict ppl to this or that site. that's why when you posted your site (in our very first few pages a long time ago) i decided to check it out.. and even recommended many ppl who chanced on this site to go over to consider that site too. But i feel now that it is unfair to say we snatch ppl from your site. I don't think we all own these sites, the ppl who log on make it happen. And they have to feel comfortable and have an affinity with it to make contributions to it without feeling forced. it should happen naturally. I feel sad that there are all these unhappiness between ppl that have not even met in person. live and let live.</div></blockquote>Ok,noted of wat u said...<br><br>Btw,my partner moderator is a lady by the name of Shirley "Marshi"...<br>We marchies do always meet-up but we seldom tok abt cars,even the other active members in NEC do noe abt it...<br>Our gatherings used to consist of KTVs,JB trips,steamboat parties,kopi sessions,drinking sessions,movies etc...<br>As for technical advise,Its usually my fellow ex-marchies who reply the audience.<br><br>Btw,the idea of "snatch" has never came across my mind;if i do have that thought,initially when u started up this site,i wldn't be chatting over here then.<br><br>Actually,up till this point,i felt there's no need for so much explainations.<br>If i've offended u in any ways,pls accept my most sincere apologies,thx....<br><br>Happy Foruming<br>Mr Biscuit</div>

They may have noted it down in their diary. We can decide to change locations at the meeting for the next meet..get an indication of preferred locations face to face!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
