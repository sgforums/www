            <div class='col-md body'>Wow lau, Got the COE but now still have to wait till the shipment to arrive in December. The issue is I haven't got the car of have the smell of it but the COE keeps dropping. This really torturing. From $70,500 to $65500.<br>Paid so much wait long long<br><br>Me will not be pai seh, recently saw the accessories column in the website of  http://www.nissan.com.sg/ Just called that stupid salesperson to seek for better bargain so I dun feel so heartpain and her reply makes me mad.<br><br>She said has done alot for us liao. The drop of COE will only benefits the government and TC but not the consumer and her. We ask her to seek approval from TCM / her manager on our behalf but she keep saying NO No No. The reason she gave was TCM will not entertain to our request as we have already committed the package. Is that true?<br><br>My wife was so mad with her feel like changing another salesperson to handle.<br>Any opinion as we have committed to these salesperson at the first place, can we call in to TCM and ask for a change of salesperson. Seems like paying $$ but not feeling comfortable dealing with her and got to endure her till we get our car. very xian.<br><br>RoyCindy<br><br>Aiyoh no choice lah i also got it for around that price, since you bought it high, you should have gotten the COE right? maybe don't have to wait till Dec. Maybe can squeeze the SE for more freebies since the price dropped so much.
