            <div class='col-md body'>hi Capi good of you to join us ...I've attached some past posting by Tedz on leather seats and if you want more details on the exchanges between the few of them, you can go to page 28 of this forum. I am also driving an elegance version and have given up on getting leather seats, coz of the 6 air bags thingy and i do not wanna mess around with them. Might cost a bomb to replace them if they are activated. Hope this helps.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tedz:</div><div class="quote_body">ok....talking about leather seats.....<br><br>i went down to jackspeed leather (they are one of the best leather seats maker) n ask about leather seat for my marchie. one thing to note! only the comfort series can do leather seats. reason being.....the elegance has complicated seats because of the 6 airbags. there was a case when they tried doing it on a elegance version n the airbags got inflated. (it is very "leh chey" to put back the airbags)so they are not doing it for elegance series anymore. plus, TCM has actually checked with japan n the reply was that it is not advisable to do anything to the seats for the elegance series....so.....u elegance owners can forget about getting leather for ur seats. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>anyway,.....so i was there at jackspeed leather,....they showed me pics of the leather seats, design's not very nice. this is the 2nd time they change the design of the seats already. the old design was worse. initially, i was thinking i don't mind doing it....something different ma....but then....when i ask the sales guy if the leather seats will look nice in the marchie, from that sales guys expression, i can tell that it won't look very nice lor. he was like saying..." it's ok la....individual lor!" he then go on to say...."actually it's better u come down n see the actual made up leather seats of other march first before deciding if u want to do it or not." as i was going oversea the next day, he said when i'm back there should be one guy bringing in the march to do leather seats n he will let me know but he didn't get back to me....anyway, from his expression, i know the answer that don't think it will turn out nice lor....so...forget the idea liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>this is my experience to share with u guys! the choice is still urs! cheers!<br><br>so has anyone here done up leather seats for there marchies? care to share the experiences?! thanks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote></div>
