I personally prefer crystal blue over yellow. Seen a crystal blue on the road and tot it is quite nice and reminds me of the crystal clear seas in the carribean. Might also look quite good at night  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> . However among those colours you've mentioned, i will pick chocolate. maybe becoz i like darker shades <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> . Seen it once on the road and was quite impressed. Looks like a coffee bean moving on the road. And if you polish it you can use it as a mirror. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I think Kamenrider is right, you might be charged additional for the colour change, if you want you can actually change colour a few years later when you are tired of it, should not cost too much. But if you still prefer yellow and the SE can accomodate that then why not.<br><br>Fabric wise the lighter shades might get dirtied easier and a brighter fabric will give the car its character and liveliness. Those are my tots and hope to see you on the road soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

BTW, have you decide on the colour? I'm opting for citron yellow or opal lavender. I went to test drive on this model today, find it easy driving ( though my husband is the driver ) and light. Which version you had chosen, comfort or elegance? I chose comfort since their mechanical features are the same.<br><br></div>

However one observation is that Shell really gives you extra mileage. I am a Smiles card holder so has been pumping Esso/ Mobil, changed to Shell once or twice and realise it goes further. I used Exxon 98 most of the time but recently goes to 95 due to the expensive fuel prices and also limited discount. 98 gives me the feeling of more power and easier for me to ram the car and overtake, 95 feels a bit sluggish, however 95 seems to give me better mileage, i wonder why? I travel 75% on highways and that explains why i might be hitting 16km/l.<br><br>I think the 'older' K12 comes with 14" rims. Comfort also comes with 15" right? But I realise the show room ones in TCM BT has no alloy rims, comes with a plate/cover.<br><br>My usage is about 120km per day and i am already past 10000km.<br></div>
