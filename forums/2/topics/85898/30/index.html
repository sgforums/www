            <div class='col-md body'>Go back to TCM for the 2nd and 3rd free service but bear in mind that they are using mineral oil for the Three Free Service and  NOT Fully Syn oil.You can request them to change to fully syn oil but you must pay additional $40 for that lousy fastflo oil alternatively you may bring in your own fully syn oil in which they will minus of $15 from that $40..Advisable to change to fully syn oil after your engine break-in/running in..<br>Moral of the story hehehhehehhe is that bear with their FastFlo fully syn oil till your next service(20k) if you scared to so called void warranty and then bring your own fully syn oil(5w-40) eg shell, Mobil, Castrol, Rev 1, Elf(Highly Recommended)... when you next service ya car with TCM at 20k...<br>I will say void that warranty(Varies from individual ya) and go to Autosaver for all future servicing cos you will save heaps of money and then spend that saved money on modding ya car hehehehehheheh ... anyhow i have been back to TCM only when i have defective parts eg Rubber Linning on our roofand still they LL have to change...<br><br>Don't Flame me, me just trying to help ya....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kkt:</div><div class="quote_body">hey fellow marchies,,,,juz a few question hoping that some of you guys can enlighten me....heard that if you do not go back to TCM for servicing, warranty void?????and if for the 1st servicing, i went to TCM and not for the subsequent ones, will i still get my 2nd and 3rd servicing free if i were to go back there????tanks</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi addy,<br>Tried doing what ya say about the rattling hiyo still no luck with it man still have that high pitch frequency from mars coming from the back..sigh... just thought i let u know....<br>oh yes about that beep...beep...beep...beep sound.. hiyo super annoying i was actually thinking of going down to my friends workshop to dis-engaged that wiring from the beeper when i have the time..will update you soon hopefully when we meet up on the 11th Dec..<br><br>Anyway, wanted to share my experience with :<br><br>1. RATTLING.. when i first got the car, i was puzzled by the sound too... finally (with the help of the workshop ppl during the first service) I found out it was due to the two strings that are connected to like little knobs that hold the back board. Now by placing some heavy things on it and pushing it down whenever i can (and tightening the knobs - workshop did it for me), there is no more rattling!! (i have already removed the heavy things and stopped pushing it down).<br><br>2. Sensor Beeping.. Do you realise that when you open the door while listening to music (IE when the engine is on), the beeping comes on and it is so annoying! Sometimes you want to listen to cool music and open the door..either for fresh air while waiting for someone, or just wanting to look cool heheh, but the beeping noise is so loud! Does anyone know if it can be switched off? I don't want it removed cos its useful for other times (like if you really forget to turn off the engine or lights when you leave the car) Help!<br><br>Addygirl (Mango Orange K12)<br><br>[/b][/quote]</div>
