If not wun be able to join th gathering. So far haven't even ask for IC for registration even thou the stock arrived last week. SE say TC is putting March as the last car to clear custom (priority given to high vol seller like sunny &amp; cefiro) BTW SE is collegue's relative so i c no reason why he should take me for a ride. Just can't help feeling impatient, tat's all lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone in Sgforums Car Forum<br><br>As a "Membership Moderator of Nissan Enthusiast Club Singapore, I feel that i should say some things... Sunny Club Singapore was founded in 2001... All of us members of SCS went ard giving pamphlets and inviting people to join us...<br><br>By 2002, We were renamed as Singapore Nissan Club because we were no longer restricted to Sunnys... By then we had a database of more than 200 cars, which include silvias, Marchs, Sunnys, Preseas, Pulsars, Cefiros. As of 2004 We managed to build up a car database of more than 1000 registered car owners... During the last meet up, we managed to bring in about 500 cars for our mega meetup at turf city. Due to some "problems" we rename ourself to Nissan Enthusiast Club Singapore, and we are still working hard and trying hard to recruit more nissan cars into NECS.<br><br>We would like to invite you all to join us in NECS and share our lobangs and all our "membership discounts" with some of the retail joints.<br><br>It's ok if you all do not want to join us in the big "Nissan Family". But pulling our new members away from us the moment they join NECS, don't seem very ethical and it is making us feel pretty uncomfortable.<br><br>It is just like how Nick felt when he edited my thread when i put in the url name and i stop doing so.<br><br>I hope we can solve this problem peacefully. And not end up like a certain make of cars with more than 10 different subforums and all hating each other. Maybe we can meetup and discuss about this over some coffee?<br>Hope to hear from you soon.<br><br>Chua MingHong aka MH<br>Membership Secretary<br>Nissan Enthusiast Club Singapore<br><br></div>

True that K12 is newer. But how do you feel if people is to condemn your ride as "Not appealing", "old march", "4 old worn out tyres", "not chio", "not as HIGH END , HIGH TECH, HIGH PRICE, HIGH TASTE".<br><br>How would you feel if someone is to say all these about your K12 ? Please do think about it.<br><br>K11 micra fully modded is a very fun and lethal car. This is another topic all over.<br><br>Seriously, I do believe that we should sort this out together.

Why at the first place u provide us with this website for FUN YA??!!!! U should know that u initial us to go over but Seems that we are not that welcome by the NEC, then at the first place, U shouldn't even come over this website. U are damn LanPaPx Lxn<br><br>Felt that pple in the NEC web is very ridiculous, where on earth is so called their March club???  Got copyright license meh??? No Shy. What is so good about their old march? appealing??? not for me.<br><br>Perhaps someone can enlighten me what does an old march have and what is good abt old march?? usually can identify them down the road with 4 old worn out tyres, that is most of the easy identify trademark for OLD march.<br><br>Haha.. We should be proud of our March k12. Friends, bro and sis, do stay faithful to this web. I guess we are very comfortable and should be proud.<br>We can also design our own logo which different from others. Since other wants to Draw a line, let it be because i think they have inferior complex car not as "chio", not as HIGH END , HIGH TECH, HIGH PRICE, HIGH TASTE, compared to ours. K12. . he.. he...he really do us proud.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Sunny Club Singapore was founded in 2001... All of us members of SCS went ard giving pamphlets and inviting people to join us...<br><br>By 2002, We were renamed as Singapore Nissan Club because we were no longer restricted to Sunnys... By then we had a database of more than 200 cars, which include silvias, Marchs, Sunnys, Preseas, Pulsars, Cefiros. As of 2004 We managed to build up a car database of more than 1000 registered car owners... During the last meet up, we managed to bring in about 500 cars for our mega meetup at turf city. Due to some "problems" we rename ourself to Nissan Enthusiast Club Singapore, and we are still working hard and trying hard to recruit more nissan cars into NECS.<br><br>We would like to invite you all to join us in NECS and share our lobangs and all our "membership discounts" with some of the retail joints.<br><br>It's ok if you all do not want to join us in the big "Nissan Family". But pulling our new members away from us the moment they join NECS, don't seem very ethical and it is making us feel pretty uncomfortable.<br><br>It is just like how Nick felt when he edited my thread when i put in the url name and i stop doing so.<br><br>I hope we can solve this problem peacefully. And not end up like a certain make of cars with more than 10 different subforums and all hating each other. Maybe we can meetup and discuss about this over some coffee?<br>Hope to hear from you soon.<br><br>Chua MingHong aka MH<br>Membership Secretary<br>Nissan Enthusiast Club Singapore<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

In fact we meet up very often, and even have Need for Speed Underground Session too!... Like last night, few of us just met up for imprompto supper... When free, we meet up for coffee, Lunch or dinner, talk abt mods, go to workshop together...<br><br>Sometimes our regular workshop also majiam mini meetup one...<br>coz in life there is more than cars that we can talk abt. We are all human, regardless of wat car we drive or if we don't drive at all... In fact, One of our moderator doesn't even have a licence yet, But he has extreme interest in cars, Chatting with him, we felt comfortable n invited him to join us in bringing the club further.<br><br></div>
