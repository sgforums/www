Which TCM branch did u go to? Wat's the name of yr SE, perhaps can refer the next time?<br><br>I called my SE last week and she said the latest collection date for my Opal Lavender Elegance will be around 20 December'04. Thats too long man. Today I pressed on  her again for date of collection as I will be away in the mid of Dec.Then She said will be around 12 Dec'04.<br><br>Before I called my SE, I actually check with my friend who fix some items for TCM car in TCm workshop. On 8 Nov, he just fixed a batch of March comfort. Just on the 10 Nov, Melbee posted and said her collection of car will be next week. This is to say it should be around first few days of Dec.<br>I asked my SE why in Oct there was ex stock for Opal Lavender and she claimed that it is not possible. So who is telling the actual fact for the stock. I only know that I can't trust TCM staff anymore. I already swear I will never buy any car from TCM again. Got $ also spend on good and right service. Bargain and Bargain in future. Let those stupid crocodile beg for sales target and turn them down . ha ha ha!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>I shall see what TCM will be up to if I did not receive my notice of collection by end of Nov'04. I get ready to fire them again closer to date. All these batch of shitty people, earning our $$ without any guilt and for my case I experience worst and stupid excuse and unreasonable attitute from their FxxK management with the poor service. Wow lau ya so T.L.<br></div></blockquote>Hi RoyCindy,<br><br>Think u better check w them cos Kamen Rider also booked early August, later he chg to Opal Lavender E , he got his car end of the mth . How come yrs extremely long? Is it COE issues or ?? Dun understand leh.<br>Yup my SE is rather helpful . Like i said he handle all the compian cases , he was assign to handle my fren OngLye Lavender cos she had a terrible nightmare w her earlier SE . The she made a big scene at TC , even wan to chg to other branch to let frens' SE hadnle . TC disallow branch swooping thus assign tis SE to handle her case. Next time if u wan to book then I pass u his contact lah.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi RoyCindy, think there's no reasons for TC to bluff you on the delivery dates lar, there's no benefits in doing so for them. so must cool down and take it easy. dun spoil your very nice march experience just becos of some bad sales pple, not worth.<br><br>just ask nicely why the long wait, exert a bit pressure and see what they can do about it.<br><br>my experience was this:<br><br>when i chose the bean they said it gotta be shipped from japan and the shipment hapened to be 1 to 1.5 month ETA. this is provided it was planned for the shipment initially (else God will know when), the SE said there have been cases of long shipment wait like 2-3 months. upon arrival, it will still require 2-3 weeks for paperworks and registration.<br><br>the SE advised me to take ex stock if i could not wait. so i changed the colour. the day i confirmed the colour the COE was already secured, from then on it was like 2 weeks plus wait for the other registrations and paperworks. so a total wait of about 1 month for me (for ex stock).<br><br>sometimes this kinda thing is "heng / sway" one.<br><br>consider yourself lucky, if you check the kia picato forum, they have many pple waiting for like more than 6 months (!) becos of a worldwide shortage. the price dropped significantly since and in the end the urge and interest turned into anger and frustrations. quite a number changed car or forgo their deposits (still worth it).<br><br></div>

Anyway unless you really need (touchwood) 6 airbags, keyless entry, body kit then go for Elegance. However i think the aircon is of different controls. The comfort version comes with knobs but the elegance comes with digital control (unless i am wrong) but that is also cosmetic. You can fix your own body kit like what tedz has said. From my personnal experience when i am laden with groceries and have no hands to lock the car door, the keyless lock is really useful. No need to fumble with keys and look for the key hole, jus press the back button and car will be locked or open. All this time the key in your pocket. You also need not use the physical key to start the car. So the choice is yours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Furthermore we are paying so why let them made full use of use.<br>My unpleasant experience with TCM at BT branch already reflect a bad impression. A few weeks later, I went over to Ubi with a friend. The SE there was more helpful they knew I was interested to but a March and kept sms and call me to update and negotiate package with me. I was having Red or Lavender March in mind but they said I have to wait for 2mths at least but when I said I can't wait for that long, they called me within an hour on that particular day say they have the stock and can be taken within 2weeks.<br><br>My friend who got a sunny from TCM was the worst case I have heard of. He waited for more than 3mths for a black sunny. he was told to wait for anotehr 1mth so bad till he made a complaint to his top management and within 2weeks after 3mth plus of waiting he got the sunny.<br><br>My client who got a Cefiro from them has a better treatment. He commented the headunit for Cefiro was lousy and not classy so ask for a change. They got one better model but did not deliver to him when he collect his car. They placed the existing model. They claimed that they made a mistake and the stock was not available when they need to change. he has to wait for 2weeks for his requested headunit.<br><br>He made complaint and was proposed a $900 more for anotehr latest model of headunit. When he made a comparison price with Kenwood sole agent in BT, they quoted him $550 based only. $350 different for a same model. Wow the knife of TCM was so sharp.<br>He created a big scene when he knew the difference and complaint. TCM knew he was from government sector so don't dare to play play.<br><br>See all these suckers. Must make them pay for service.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey people!<br><br>let's face it. different pple has different personality. in service industry, it is the person's personality that make that person a nice sale agent. it's really a matter of heng/sway who u get.<br><br>regarding the shipment of cars.....this is just my ten cents worth of comment.<br>from what i understand....initially the elegance version is not doing very well due to the high price, so TC only brings in a few per colour. they brought in more comforts. then suddenly the COE dropped n prices dropped n demand went up faster then they expected....so u guys will have to wait lor. i was luck to book a not so popular colour n the comfort series...so i got my car about 2 weeks plus after i got my COE. so cannot blame anyone really. every salea agent will want to deliver their customers their car ASAP.<br><br>hope this info helped.<br><br>remember.....there's a saying that good things are worth the wait! haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
