            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AngPow:</div><div class="quote_body">I remembered I was told Opal Lavender has ex stock on 30 oct 04 from Tan Chong. I was even advised if I liek ELegance n cant wait for my AngPow then take Opal Lavender . My fren OngLye Lavender ( she drove a E Opal lavendeR) even said join in n hv the same color as her.</div></blockquote>Hi Ang Pow<br>Seem like your SE is very the helpful. Which TCM branch did u go to? Wat's the name of yr SE, perhaps can refer the next time?<br><br>I called my SE last week and she said the latest collection date for my Opal Lavender Elegance will be around 20 December'04. Thats too long man. Today I pressed on  her again for date of collection as I will be away in the mid of Dec.Then She said will be around 12 Dec'04.<br><br>Before I called my SE, I actually check with my friend who fix some items for TCM car in TCm workshop. On 8 Nov, he just fixed a batch of March comfort. Just on the 10 Nov, Melbee posted and said her collection of car will be next week. This is to say it should be around first few days of Dec.<br>I asked my SE why in Oct there was ex stock for Opal Lavender and she claimed that it is not possible. So who is telling the actual fact for the stock. I only know that I can't trust TCM staff anymore. I already swear I will never buy any car from TCM again. Got $ also spend on good and right service. Bargain and Bargain in future. Let those stupid crocodile beg for sales target and turn them down . ha ha ha!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>I shall see what TCM will be up to if I did not receive my notice of collection by end of Nov'04. I get ready to fire them again closer to date. All these batch of shitty people, earning our $$ without any guilt and for my case I experience worst and stupid excuse and unreasonable attitute from their FxxK management with the poor service. Wow lau ya so T.L.<br></div>
