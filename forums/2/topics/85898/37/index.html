Sent my car to IDAE for assessment and back to tan chong for repair.<br><br>NTUC surveyor assessed the damage and the repair cost 6K+... luckily claims insurance or else....<br><br>Tanchong said it need abourt 10 days to repair the damage, i can only collect my car next week.. really miss my marchie.<br></div>
