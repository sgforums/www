            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.... here's my March story.<br><br>after making the booking for the bean coloured march. couldnt wait for its arrival as have to wait for more than 1.5 months for its shipment from Japan. so went down to change to green cos its ex stock spore. later changed my mind and changed again to lavender. paid total $400 to replace the colour, twice. the sales rep at Tan Chong Ubi was nice, she took some of the damage for me and paid $100 on my behalf. i had to wait for about 3 weeks for the COE and registration, damn that was long! agent pushed and it was finally ready for collection, 1 day earlier than promised.<br><br>the day has finally come.<br><br>Thursday 4pm.<br><br>I drove my old horse of 11 years (Nissan Sunny) and flew down from Pasir Panjang Science park II, spewing thick white smoke along the way. the car has served me faithfully and finally is giving in, breathed her last when reached tan chong Ubi. kissed my old car goodbye and handed her to the second hand car dealer who waited patiently and then went up third floor to receive my new March (sorry darling my love, have to part somehow). Wonder if the second hand car dealer is going to dismember her or sell to another innocent buyer.<br><br>There she was. my new lavender March. washed and polished, eagerly waited for me with opened arms, on her sides are other cars waiting for delivery. the march stood out from the rest like a blooming lavender (it has a taller body than many other cars).<br><br>the sales rep went thru with me the documents, manual, service booklet and other details. i wasn't listening, only looking out the glass door where she was. my mind thinking how it was going to be like steering the car, the "legendary" drive-by-wire steering and throttle, how will she perform? can she carry the many adults and still move quickly as claimed by the many literature pple put on the internet, etc etc... can it go up the Vigilante Drive (a very very steep slope along the 13 bends on your way to science park II) with 5 fat adults?<br><br>finally, the briefing was over and we went (I dashed) to check her out.<br><br>Ah... my new March......my new Lavender March....!<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first, the exterior.<br><br>i ran my finger across the body few rounds, carassing it like what you see stars do in a porn movie. inspecting every nooks and corners. almost licking it (hey its like a candy). the curves and shapes are really nice. the main reason for buying this car is the retro look of it (like Giant Robo and their gadgets in the jap anime). all Marches are fitted with the body kit and 15" alloy wheels standard if you get from tan chong. along with it is the fog lamp, not that i bother, i never use them unless i go to the in laws far north in malaysia. if you drive in the very early morning, the fog on the road is really very thick and the fog lamp will come in handy.<br><br>hmmm...no scratches. good. cant feel the wax on it like the show room one, think they were rushing and saved up on the waxing. no problem, i will give it the best polishing myself. i only trust Autoglym stuff and i will give it a good body work later on.<br><br>now the interior.<br><br>went in and closed the door.<br><br>took a deep breath............ahhhh......new car smell...... waited for this moment for a long long time.....smells really good.....and i am going to smell this smell for the next few months. my wife scolded me when i stuck my head into the box of my new apple computer notebook to smell the new smell. sometimes i really think i am a freak.<br><br>hmmm.......all the retro dials and gauges (again like giant robo stuff).... dont be fooled by the purposely designed old fashioned instrument, hidden in it are the latest and greatest technologies. keyless entry and ignition, plasmacluster air con (3 times more ex than ionizer add on stuff), auto activated lighting, speed sensing wiper, drive by wire steering and throttle, 6 air bags (hope i dont need to use them), ABS, Electronic Brake Distribution, other assisted braking (so that the weakest leg of a petite female still can stop a car carrying 5 heavy weight adult properly), clever compartments etc etc... will say more when i discover them in time.<br><br>dont feel the cheapness with the plastics though there are plenty, the surface are like the jap tatami look and feel, they are in matching colours of milky off white and grey. the leather steering wheel is also nicely coloured.<br><br>the only complain is the ah beng look kenwood stereo which is silver in colour. it really stands out like a soar thumb. why cant they put back the original stereo which has the matching dials and colour? with the onboard computer removed (suppose it is not applicable in spore), there's also a hole in the middle, now its become a storage (black hole). i also cannot find a clock in the car, which, being a road warrior, living by the seconds, constantly need to check on time. nevermind, can tune the ah beng stereo to show time instead of the scrolling mp3 filenames.<br><br>(to be continued)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i only had the chance to test drive the March for a lousy short distance from the Bt Timah showroom. the sales rep was like non negotiable half suspecting if you would buy the car.  it was a loop along the small road around residence nearby. i felt pissed and that was why i went to Ubi.<br><br>i received 1 keyless remote (RFID), 1 weird key to hide in the remote and a spare full size key in total.<br><br>turning on the engine, you just press in the ignition and turn a knob like ordinary car (without the key inserted). good sound proofing, at idling you cannot hear the engine. the light turned on by itself as it is in "auto"mode. the dials look very nice and cool with orange illumination. auto climate control also has the aircon fan runnning at high. (the dials look super retro man!)<br><br>the internal space is surprising spacious given the petite look from the outside (ComPacious - micra talk - meaning Compact yet Spacious is really true). I pushed my chair very far back as i have the habit of driving almost lying down pretending i am driving a sports car (could not afford one so have to pretend). looking back at the backseat there's still decent space left for rear passengers, hmmm... good... it will be 10 more years before my kids outgrow this space, by then i probably would look for other cars already.<br><br>the steering is adjustable for up and down. i must say the drive position is very good.<br><br>i must clarify that i have owned a Volvo 940 before for 3 years, my old man has a Jaguar Daimler which i occassionally drive. in my life i have owned for a reasonable period an old nissan sunny (the last one), Honda Accord (early 90s), Toyota Corona (mid 90s). so my assessment of this March will be in comparison to these past experiences.<br><br>the steering certainly feels very smooth, too smooth to not feel any feedback. hardcore racers will not like it cos they cannot feel the road. the steering is fully power assisted at slow drive, but will gradually tightens when you speed up like on the highway (a computer senses the car speed every 0.04 seconds and adjust the steering assistance accordingly). this is the advantage of drive by wire steering, its all electrical, there's no hydraulic to spoil or maintain (wait till the electrical spoil then you'll know).<br><br>i promised the sales rep i would buy her a drink when i get the car, so, off we went out of tan chong ubi to the nearby Burger kings.<br><br>the suspension is very good, tight yet spongy, can feel the road reasonably ok, like the Volvo i have owned before. seat is reasonably firm but not wrapping. i kind of worry for the fabric materials the seats are made up of, they look too nimble for a careless man like me.  should i spray on 3M scotchgard to protect them from my kids spilling of milk or coca cola? hmmm... must do some research first....heard not all materials are suitable for 3M. i like the clicking sound of the turn indicator, sounds like the Jaguar ones, not those cheapo ones from old cars which goes tick-tack-tick-tack.....<br><br>heard some reviews that the car cannot manage big humps very well, havent tried that. maybe will try it in one combat engineers camp one day, it has what pple called the "mother of all humps",  they really have huge humps of all sorts.<br><br>the lights went off when i left the building, automatically, as it was still bright daylight outside, cool.....<br><br>the brakes, indeed met up to its claim, very responsive and feels very assuring.<br><br>no chance to try the air bags though, dont intend to.<br><br>(to continue)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hurriedly swallowed the food at Burger Kings wanting to go back to the parked car asap. hoping no bird dropings or other careless drivers will hit my March parked in the open space outside heartland mall.<br><br>chit chat with the sales rep and got to know her more. she's a new grad in business ad and said somehow she has a flair in selling Marches, so far almost all that she sold are Marches and she would buy one herself when she collected enough commission from selling Marches. I tend to agree when she said so far the buyers are hardcore pple who have an intense feeling for Marches. the response to controversial  artistic pieces are usually either you'll love it or hate it, there's no in betweens. For me, its wanting to be different, i dont want to be "just another car on the road". I have chosen this car despite pple advising against, I could have bought a Toyota corolla, VIOS, Sunny or a bigger Hyundai Sonata etc. there's plenty of choices in the market but alas, i could not bring myself to look at others no matter how hard i tried, i just cannot explain this (this is a typical case of "purchase by feeling, justify by logic later", no, not true, i have researched for many months).<br><br>I sent the sales rep back to tan chong and went around testing further. quite a nice young and gentle lady, full of hope and aspirations towards life, would woo her if i have been single. mom said dont go home straight away when get a new car, must go around 1 loop then go home, superstitious her.<br><br>i went up along tampines and headed towards changi airport.<br><br>looked out for TP and pushed the accelerator further when the coast was clear (recently kanna fined $800 for speeding). the car effortlessly went up 140km/h without complaints, it was smooth and no vibrations, not surprising for a new car. it went on for only a few seconds cos i did not want to damage the new engine, i did not get the chance to floor the accelerator. (anyway the manual says to "break-in" the engine, avoid driving at same speed for long distance for the first 1500km, also not more than 4k revolution). so i tried different speeds for short periods. my volvo sounded very rough when went beyond 120km/h cos i know it was not "broken-in" properly in the early days. it was always going below 120km/h under spore traffic conditions for many years!<br><br>(to continue)<br></div>
