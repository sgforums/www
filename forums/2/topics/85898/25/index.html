I believe he wasn't smoking me cos he did mention that the ETA will be in mid to end Nov and at that time say no shipment from Japan till nov (3mths away). It's only when i read this forum that i realize tat people r collecting their E model in between this so-called "dry period". Now where did all these stock come from???  Best of all he said he has placed my order on priority shipment!!!<br><br>And i tot 3 mths shouldn't be tat long time, but turn out to be a painfully slow wait. Like i said, another few more weeks of waiting is nothing compared to 3 long mths, so ren ming liao.</div>

I would say i travel 70% on expressways. What shipment is yours? For mine, it comes with 14" rims and those that you guys are getting now comes with 15" i think. Probably that makes a difference.<br><br>However I am not light footed and likes to see my Marchie pull ahead of others at traffic lights, hee hee. i think lennie knows what i mean. try turning off the aircon and the result would be better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I think the fuel consumption can still be improved if i do less of that and travel at less than 100kph on highways and go easy on the gas.</div>
