            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I have been looking around for my first new car over the past two weeks and due to budget constraints, have narrowed down to two models: Nissan March and Sunny. As at now, I am still unsure which car I would definitely buy but I think there is 80% chance that I will buy the Nissan March because I love it at the first sight. I have several reservations of March because of the following reasons:<br>1. May not be suitable for a man like myself who has big frame.<br>2. Car boot may be too small but I think I can still live with it as I am still single.<br>3. Its more expensive than other bigger cars like Sunny, City or Vios.<br>4. Not sure if I am able to sell off the car in future if I am not able to upkeep the car as I can see that there are few advertisements for 2nd-hand March in the market. Not sure if its due to its lack of popularity among car buyers.<br><br>I have considered the Sunny because it is S$6.5K cheaper than the March now. It is more value-for-money due to the additional 2 years maintenance program, rear sensor, leather seats and 1.6cc engine. However, I think the current batches of Sunny are going to be phrased out very soon which is why it is selling so cheaply.<br><br>I guess I will most probably go with my feelings and pay a little more for the March Elegance model. Would like to ask a few questions though:<br><br>1. On average, how much will the full tank of petrol cost in Singapore?<br>2. For those who have the March for at least 1 year or longer, what was the average monthly maintenance expenses (other than the fuel, road tax and insurance) that you spent on the March?<br>3. Any comments on whether the March would be able to fetch buyers if the need to sell arises?<br><br>Thanks for your feedback. I will most certainly like to meet up with you all once I have got my March next year.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi tweetie, cant help being excited when pple wants to know more abt the new marches, so here's my imput.<br><br>first thing first, be very careful when you purchase things by feelings, esp you only do your research for 2 weeks, its a big investment we are talking here (at least to a poor guy like me). i took months and i still got sleepless nights over it then.<br><br>first the "negative" bits:<br><br>1. for the price of this march (plus / minus) you can have many other choices, and i mean many, have you considered them thoroughly?<br><br>2. be prepared to get whacked by friends / relatives / family / colleagues that you are getting something "not value for money". of course shallow sporean's perspective of value is "big", "fierce", "sporty", "resale" and always judging a book by its cover. many cars at this price range are "big, fierce, sporty and better resale".<br><br>3. stock marches dun have leather seats, rear sensors, and......and......thaz it?! and also its not a 1.6L of course.<br><br>4. "the marches trying to look like VW beetle" - this is murmured by the losers<br><br>5. the handling needs to be improved if you are a sporty guy<br><br>6. boot space is small - cannot deny if you compare with non hatch back cars<br><br>7. TC service is crap - some (not all) said<br><br>8. 2005 got more new cars coming out, dun want to wait and see?<br><br>thaz abt all that i can quickly think of. and if you are still not frightened off, read on, cos the following are the good stuff:<br><br>1. the march is NOT small, its a visual misconception, go in one and sit and try it, you will know why i say this. its Compact yet Spacious. the new march is shorter than the old march but the wheel base is longer, it is also taller and wider, all these translates into more spacious interior and leg room. it was designed for european market in mind, ang moh reviewers from reputable magazines also say the space is commendable. lastly check out kingmariot, he's a big guy, ask him.<br><br>2. the new march won the prestigious 2002 designers award in the paris car show, awarded by 100 over professionals and designers. some criterias were originality, creativity, clever and practical design, characters, features etc. so if you find that you cant explain why you are so suddenly hooked on this car, the look, the inexplicable warmth and the sense of homeliness, do not be alarmed, most of us here have somehow felt the same in various degrees. its an "x-factor".<br><br>3. the march has the most powerful 1.4L engine in the market. at 98bhp, it even beats the ass off many 1.5L. with minor mod, it can be on par with some 1.6L, this is what i call value for money.<br><br>4. the elegance has features that can shame many bigger cars, its the rolls royce of the superminis. just in case you havent done the research, it has among its array of toys, keyless entry and ignition, auto climate control, plasmacluster, auto lighting, speed sensing wiper, clever compartments, active and passive features like ABS, EBD, Brake Assist, 6 x air bags, reinforced body etc among others.<br><br>5. good FC average between 13 to 16 km/L among the marchies here. this is the result of new alloy materials piston and block which are lighter, jointly developed by nissan and renault. and.... whatever they do to the engine.....the full tank, i think its 41L, so at $1.4/L currently, it costs $57 and can run you off for abt 600km +/- depending on how you drive.<br><br>6. head turner on the roads, a good form of ego booster and for picking up girls (i dunno what young chicks like nowadays, maybe bigger cars?), but exercise with caution if you already have gf.<br><br>7. not sure about buying/selling second hand, the car is abt 2 yrs old in spore, maybe you dun see many pple selling its becos they dun want to part with their marches? but franky, if you want to buy this car already with the intention of selling so quickly, i suggest you first choose your purchase wisely and cautiously. again dun buy on impulse. or be safe, buy one with high resale value.<br><br>8. lastly the new march has a lovely community which is growing healthily. the pple here are lovely and helpful and somehow they always come in peace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tweety74:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>I have been looking around for my first new car over the past two weeks and due to budget constraints, have narrowed down to two models: Nissan March and Sunny. As at now, I am still unsure which car I would definitely buy but I think there is 80% chance that I will buy the Nissan March because I love it at the first sight. I have several reservations of March because of the following reasons:<br>1. May not be suitable for a man like myself who has big frame.<br>2. Car boot may be too small but I think I can still live with it as I am still single.<br>3. Its more expensive than other bigger cars like Sunny, City or Vios.<br>4. Not sure if I am able to sell off the car in future if I am not able to upkeep the car as I can see that there are few advertisements for 2nd-hand March in the market. Not sure if its due to its lack of popularity among car buyers.<br><br>I have considered the Sunny because it is S$6.5K cheaper than the March now. It is more value-for-money due to the additional 2 years maintenance program, rear sensor, leather seats and 1.6cc engine. However, I think the current batches of Sunny are going to be phrased out very soon which is why it is selling so cheaply.<br><br>I guess I will most probably go with my feelings and pay a little more for the March Elegance model. Would like to ask a few questions though:<br><br>1. On average, how much will the full tank of petrol cost in Singapore?<br>2. For those who have the March for at least 1 year or longer, what was the average monthly maintenance expenses (other than the fuel, road tax and insurance) that you spent on the March?<br>3. Any comments on whether the March would be able to fetch buyers if the need to sell arises?<br><br>Thanks for your feedback. I will most certainly like to meet up with you all once I have got my March next year.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>Hi tweety, i wud say go for the March man, even though it looks like a gals car (if you check the drivers side visor there is a mirror in it)we guys here dun mind. And yes i fit well into the car, although i must say my seat is all the way back already. There is still plenty of headroom though about 5 fingers before my spikey hair touch the roof. I also tried the Sunny before i confirmed my purchase of the March but after adjusting the front seat to my own driving posture in the Sunny, i can't seemed to fit into the passenger seat behind. But with the March i can slide in. Maybe psychological (die die must fit in) as i like the car a lot. But to fit 3 'fully' grown adults like myself behind will have problem with shoulder space. Boot space is really nothing to talk about so if you need to lug bulky things (like furniture) around very often, think twice. As for fuel consumption, some of the guys here still do not believe i can hit 15km/l. they think i drive with air con off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">. It also seems that my fuel consumption is still improving, some times can hit 16km/l. This is really good for me as i drive around quite a bit and it reduces the damage to my wallet with rising fuel prices. So I wud encourage you to get a March.</div>
