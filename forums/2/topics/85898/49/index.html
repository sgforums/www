So that why when i use my hand and push against the door then the sound is gone.<br><br>Impul Service center in KL su**k . They know nothing except take money from our pocket . As this car came with immobilizer(keyless) so ask them if i forget stop my engine and went out what will happen to the car. They cant even answer me. And the radio problem they also cant give me an answer.<br><br>Very pisses off with them. Dun think i will give them service. I rather went out to other service shop then going back there. Ask them can i add in supercharger they give me grandmother and father stories.<br>Then my car wasnt come with reverse sensor and alarm. They ask me not to install in other accesories shop and call me go XXX accesories shop which didnt even provide with nice alarm system and expensive.<br><br>So i dun care about them and install my viper alarm in other accesories shop which is much more cheaper.<br><br>Anybody know japan impul email address need to write a mail to them and complain.</div>

I did it once two weeks ago. This time round, I was rather disappointed with the March cos the engine sound was far too noisy and the entire trip was rather bumpy. My SE did comment that I stepped on very hard at the accelerator for too long period of time unlike my first test-drive. I did remember that I didn't drive too fast in the first test-drive. She commented that I stepped up on my accelerator too hard even before the gear was changed from first to second. No matter what, the noise from the 6-months old March was really uncomfortable for me. My friend who happened to sit in the back seat commented that the suspension of the car was not too good and the entire ride was very bumpy.<br><br>To make a better comparison, I test-drive the Sunny thereafter and I did the same, slamming my accelerator hard and similarly, there are some noise from the engine but it was not too loud as compared to the March. My friend commented that the ride was much more smoother than March.<br><br>I did not intend to use my new car to travel at high speed for long period of time but I cannot imagine myself driving it at the speed of 60km/hr most of the time cos it seems fine at this speed.<br><br>Nevertheless, I still like the March very very much though I notice that the car may not have good suspension. Do you all have problem driving through road humps. The bottom of the car seems to come very close to the road surface as compared to Sunny.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>The March &amp; Sunny have similar suspension set-up, so ride comfort shouldn't be too different. Between March &amp; Sunny, it all boils down to style over functionality or vice versa. But like tedz said, dun buy a car that u will regret. For the rest of us who chose March, i guess emotion rules over rational, but so far no one seem to be regretting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
