I was actually deciding between the beans green and the citron yellow and finally decided to go for the latter when the SE told me that I had to wait longer for the beans green...<br><br>anyway, i fixed my tachometer at Yap Brothers Motorsports at Ubi. Spent $97 on it including the gauge, gauge holder and installation. Well, it doesn't look ugly (in fact, I think it looks pretty cool!), and the only complain that I have is that it's not as responsive as the tachometers that come pre-installed in cars. The guy told me that it's normal, but I'm not really sure if that is true...<br><br>but doesn't really bother me anyway... just wanted to know my rpm to make sure that i'm not too heavy-footed... save $$ on petrol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
