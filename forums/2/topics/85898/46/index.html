            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Fellow Marchies,<br><br>I am glad that some of you have enjoyed yourselves in the gathering on Saturday.... Today is a mixed and confused day for me. I was supposed to see my SE and sign the contract but somehow, the meeting didn't turn out the way I expected.<br><br>I test-drive the March for one final time. I did it once two weeks ago. This time round, I was rather disappointed with the March cos the engine sound was far too noisy and the entire trip was rather bumpy. My SE did comment that I stepped on very hard at the accelerator for too long period of time unlike my first test-drive. I did remember that I didn't drive too fast in the first test-drive. She commented that I stepped up on my accelerator too hard even before the gear was changed from first to second. No matter what, the noise from the 6-months old March was really uncomfortable for me. My friend who happened to sit in the back seat commented that the suspension of the car was not too good and the entire ride was very bumpy.<br><br>To make a better comparison, I test-drive the Sunny thereafter and I did the same, slamming my accelerator hard and similarly, there are some noise from the engine but it was not too loud as compared to the March. My friend commented that the ride was much more smoother than March.<br><br>I did not intend to use my new car to travel at high speed for long period of time but I cannot imagine myself driving it at the speed of 60km/hr most of the time cos it seems fine at this speed.<br><br>Nevertheless, I still like the March very very much though I notice that the car may not have good suspension. Do you all have problem driving through road humps. The bottom of the car seems to come very close to the road surface as compared to Sunny.<br><br>I have proceed to sign up for the March though I still have strong reservations about this car. I have up to Tuesday noon to decide if I want to change to Sunny instead. I am still confused cos my heart tells me that I should go with the March cos I still have very strong feelings for it though my brain tells me that I should go for the Sunny which is more value for money.<br><br>Do you all have any  negative feedback on the engines and suspension of the March? Care to share? Thank you to you All.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

Today is a mixed and confused day for me. I was supposed to see my SE and sign the contract but somehow, the meeting didn't turn out the way I expected.<br><br>I test-drive the March for one final time. I did it once two weeks ago. This time round, I was rather disappointed with the March cos the engine sound was far too noisy and the entire trip was rather bumpy. My SE did comment that I stepped on very hard at the accelerator for too long period of time unlike my first test-drive. I did remember that I didn't drive too fast in the first test-drive. She commented that I stepped up on my accelerator too hard even before the gear was changed from first to second. No matter what, the noise from the 6-months old March was really uncomfortable for me. My friend who happened to sit in the back seat commented that the suspension of the car was not too good and the entire ride was very bumpy.<br><br>To make a better comparison, I test-drive the Sunny thereafter and I did the same, slamming my accelerator hard and similarly, there are some noise from the engine but it was not too loud as compared to the March. My friend commented that the ride was much more smoother than March.<br><br>I did not intend to use my new car to travel at high speed for long period of time but I cannot imagine myself driving it at the speed of 60km/hr most of the time cos it seems fine at this speed.<br><br>Nevertheless, I still like the March very very much though I notice that the car may not have good suspension. Do you all have problem driving through road humps. The bottom of the car seems to come very close to the road surface as compared to Sunny.<br><br>I have proceed to sign up for the March though I still have strong reservations about this car. I have up to Tuesday noon to decide if I want to change to Sunny instead. I am still confused cos my heart tells me that I should go with the March cos I still have very strong feelings for it though my brain tells me that I should go for the Sunny which is more value for money.<br><br>Do you all have any  negative feedback on the engines and suspension of the March? Care to share? Thank you to you All.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>Hi Tweety I agree with you that the March gets a bit noisy when you ram it but trust me you will not be traveling at 60km/h. Initially when i got the car (1st 1000km), the car feels rather noisy when i hit 80km/h and i tell myself (oh o) Coz i did not even test drive the car at all and i bought it. It seems like a drag to get it moving beyond that. But now, the engine seems smoother and i can easily reach above illegal speed and it does not feel so noisy as before. Maybe psychological or maybe too deaf already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Strangely someone ask me this question during the last meetup, regarding my choice of this car. I was contemplating between the Altis and March. Altis being a toyota which is well known for its reliability, some of my friends say its fuel consumption is good, its solidly build (doors closed with a thump), spacious, quiet, leather seat and its a very safe choice with so many of them on the roads. So many pple cannot be wrong and the list of advantages goes on.  To me the Altis is an "engineer's" choice and so is the Sunny. But in the end i followed my heart and got a March and i never regretted my decision. Although a lot of pple questions it and still think that a big guy like me should get something more substantial. Whenever i see my car, it never fails to put a smile on my face. And when i am in it i feel so glad that i've made this choice. Even though the car looks small parking next to Sunnys and Altis. (Not elaborating on the pros of the March as Kamen has done a great job before and trying to do so will make me look pale  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> by comparison)<br><br>Anyway you gotta be comfortable with the car before you decide to commit to it. Depends whether you follow your head or your heart  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi tweetie, agree with tedz, dun get influenced by pples enthusiasm, its afterall a very personal decision.<br><br>let you know first, the march indeed cannot handle bumps or humps very well with the stock suspension. it is quite "tight" as it is designed for city driving which usually has good roads. if you go country sides, you will have sore arse, and may even need a barf bag.<br><br>this is most obvious if you make a turn and manouevres a hump at the same time, when you have one wheel (eg. front Left) over the hump before the other wheel (front Right) comes in. you really can get thrown around in the car, depending on your speed.<br><br>also high speed turning, the handling is quite challenging.<br><br>the above shortcomings however, can be improved thru some mods. our boys here will be able to help.<br><br>as for the engine noise, i wonder. mine was very quiet, especially when you are seated in the interior.<br><br>however it is only noisy on the outside when the cooling fan kicks in, when you idle for too long. but all these cannot be heard when you are inside. at speed the engine noise can only get obvious when you go above 120km/h, but like kingmariot said, the engine sounds most pleasing when you go 90-100km/h.<br><br>my 1 cent worth.</div>

I felt that march is a mix of both C3 and IST, as mention a mix feeling... ! I choose March becos of the looks and the potential of the engine specs...! I dun feel the shocks are soft...! "SORRY". I agree with Tedz, you should test drive it one more time, we hope you can conclude and come to your final decision making...!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tweety<br><br>You have to go with your heart. All cars have their pros and cons. Its like choosing your wife or husband right? You just know thats the one you want cos you feel he or she is right for you, not only because the person has all the right traits? Usually its a particular something about person that you feel so attracted to that you absolutely want him/her in the end. Same as the car. For many of us, its the cute looks, or its the large interior/yet compact outlook, or its the unique design, or its the six airbags, or the special saftey features, or plasma cluster or its just feeling you get when ppl stop and stare to look at this gorgeous car. It really is a personal emotional decision. Whatever you choose, pick a car that you'll feel proud of to drive everyday cos its a long term item, not like a shirt or shoes that you change every few months... For me, i still get this feeling of butterflies in my tummy every morning when i see my car (had my car since june)! And not only that, i love this car even more now because of the club..the ppl who drive this car...admit it, we're a fun, cool, funky and friendly bunch!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
