When i first started this forum early on, you asked me to go to your forum and asking me to join it. To be honest, when i went over i felt the culture there did not suit me. So i decided to remain in this forum. But i think you kept "paging" for me.  I wanted this forum to be different in that different ppl are attracted to different things. It was not because i didn't respect your forum. I felt that your forum is already established with a certain identity which does not represent me. Your forum felt to me (and its really good for the die hard fans) very male dominated, structured, and very informative about Nissan technical stuff. I wanted to be in a more relaxed, simple and more girls and guys fun site. So thats why i feel its healthy to have different forums to cater to different ppl. I don't think its fair to restrict ppl to this or that site. that's why when you posted your site (in our very first few pages a long time ago) i decided to check it out.. and even recommended many ppl who chanced on this site to go over to consider that site too. But i feel now that it is unfair to say we snatch ppl from your site. I don't think we all own these sites, the ppl who log on make it happen. And they have to feel comfortable and have an affinity with it to make contributions to it without feeling forced. it should happen naturally. I feel sad that there are all these unhappiness between ppl that have not even met in person. live and let live.</div>
