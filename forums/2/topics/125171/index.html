            <div class='col-md body'>whooooo! spiritual experience today. 1st I saw a silver Enzo gunning its engine down a road today. Very incredible sound. Then later at night, saw this Rosso Red F430 drive down the road. another BMW 3 series coupe was behind it, probably friend of the F430. They stopped at the lights, then they had a friendly drag. But OH MY SATAN! it was AMAZING! the BMW went off 1st, and it sounded incredible. then then F430 flared it's revs, dipped the clutch and WENT FOR IT with BLUE FLAMES SPITTING from the quad exhaust and tyres squealing!!! OH MY  ARRRGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>by now im hyperventilating, when what should I walk by, but a parked Dodge RAM SRT-10. and as im totally entering a trance-like ecstasy heart attack whatever, a Gallardo blasts by. I'm now still trying to resume breathing and stop my hands from shaking and tears from flowing. THIS, was a truely spiritual experience for me.<br><br>but i still like the 288 GTO the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
