            <div class='col-md body'>Hope the tips below would help you achieve a more reasonable FC level.<br><br>With petrol prices sky-rocketing, one wonders whether there will ever be any reprieve at all for the normal road-users. Even with the current island-wide discounts, the volatile prices seemed out of our hands. Well... not really, it is actually still in your hands. Here are some fuel-saving tips.<br><br><strong>Plan your route</strong><br>Planning the route you are taking before embarking will greatly help to reduce fuel consumption. When a car is stalling in a traffic jam, it is not utilizing its petrol. With less traffic, you will also be able to maintain a steady cruising speed on clear roads when avoiding the rush hour.<br><br><strong>Do not Warm Up your Engine</strong><br>Drive off immediately at a low speed after starting your car. This way, the engine will warm up faster and lubricate better.<br><br><strong>Steady Speed</strong><br>Engines burn up more petrol during acceleration than at any other time.<br>Keeping the engine speed at a steady 2000 rpm even when moving off in 1st and 2nd gear, cuts down on fuel consumption,<br><br><strong>Driving with the Windows Up or Down?</strong><br>If you're driving pass the 80km/h mark, the windows should be wound up to prevent drag or resistance. Fuel consumption improves with better aerodynamics.<br><br>but... when you're driving slower than 80km/h, you may want to drive with the windows down. Turning off the air-conditioner significantly takes the load off the engine and reduces fuel consumption.<br><br><strong>Fill up at night</strong><br>In Singapore's high humidity and hot climate, it's advisable to fill up your tank at night, because in the day petrol evaporates very quickly.<br><br><strong>Good Driving Habits</strong><br><br>Avoid fast starts and sudden stops.<br>Do not excessively hold on to the brake or clutch pedal, because this increases fuel consumption.<br>Check that the tyres are correctly inflated. If the tyres are soft, their rolling resistance will be greater and fuel consumption will increase.<br>Remember to check on proper wheel alignment. As overcoming improper alignment wastes fuel.<br><br><strong></strong><br><br>Reference:<br><br>http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/motoring/dreams0/smart_driver0/fuel_saving_tips.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My vios (auto) was also consuming fuel like 'proton', about 10-11km/litre. I contacted my sales engr, and as expected he was very defensive abt the car. He mentioned that it could be due to my driving habits, the car was yet to run-in...etc.....  I've been driving for the past 10 years, and I was pretty sure that I can't be a 'that-poor' driver. On top of the fuel issue, I also had problems with starting the vehicle (at least minimum 3 attempts), and faulty fuel gauge. I was a vehicle technician during my active army, and I was quite sure that something was not right with the vehicle. The technology could be different between a military and commercial vehicle, but the fundamentals cannot go wrong!<br><br>During my first svcg at Ubi, I informed the svc engr abt the problems. They did OBD checks and according to the results all were ok. To my astonishment, on the issue of the engine starting problem, they only checked the battery. Since the battery was supposed to be new, so  i was wondering why they only checked the battery and not on the starter circuit.<br><br>The problems were not resolved, and I decided to switch from Ubi to Pandan svc ctr. At first, the svc engr also mentioned that my driving habits could be an issue and also because of my 15' sports rim, but, he too had problems starting the vehicle (at least 7 attempts). He realized that something was definitely wrong with the vehicle, and did an OBD check. The result revealed that the 'fuel pressure regulator' was faulty!The faulty regulator was replaced, and now my fc is abt 12-13km/litre.<br><br>I also realized that substantial fuel can be lost if the fuel cap was not secured properly. The proper way is to close the cap until you hear a 'second click'. If not, then fuel may escape from the cap gaps via evaporation.<br><br>I'm still monitoring my fc since it's been only close to 2.5 months after I bought the vios. 12-13km/litre is still not gd. My friends can go till 14 in their vios (auto and 15' rims). There were occassions where we switched vehicles, and the results were the same. Thus, I can safely say that I'm not a 'poor' driver after all!<br><br>The starter problem has been resolved with the replacement of the fuel regulator. But, the fuel gauge is still faulty. They have already changed the 'fuel sender' once, but unsuccessful. They have now ordered for a new dashboard sensor mechanism from Thailand.<br><br></div>
