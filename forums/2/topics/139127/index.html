            <div class='col-md body'>the car park is usually not very crowded...and there's a reason, it's mother far from the rest of the uni. unless you're in science/med, you'll have to take a shuttle bus back down to the uni. otherwise you can walk down a slope (very tiring to walk back up) and end up behind med faculty.<br>an alternative (which is heavily practised) is to park at the car parks, but tailgate vehicles coming out so the barrier has no time to close completely.<br>otherwise just come up with 70 bucks per semester, it's not too ex if you park everyday....comes up to a dollar plus? full day. plus can park all over the campus.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Daniu 82:<br><br>For Science Faculty, it will be quite a distance if you park at Kent Vale and walk to your faculty. As for me, I am in Engineering and my lectures are within the Engineering Faculty therefore it's quite convenient for me to walk. If you want, you can leave your car there and talk the shuttle bus which is free. You can take the Internal Shuttle Bus C which is the most direct from Kent Vale. Hope that helps and all the best for your studies!!!<br><br>Cheers:<br>Fellow NUS undergraduate</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>daniu, sorry for mistake, Kent Vale is nearer Engine. the car park im talking abt is the one near King Edward 7 hall, called the CRISP or satellite car park. It's closer to science/med (coming in from back toward science lect halls) but like i mentioned earlier gotta walk a bit. however it's still doable, parked there for coupla months while saving money for season parking, plus got some exercise. usually quite empty. otherwise just do what my friends do and tailgate. but i must warn you that the car park in front of science gets very crowded (esp ard early afternoon) and sometimes gotta circle ard. double park and u get clamped.</div>

This is absurd man.. It's like saying you haf a car and you r so damn rich.. so sunday you also put parking coupon?? since it's only $1?<br><br>Anyway I've been parking in NUS for over a yr. Kent vale is free for all only thing is the distance.<br><br>Abt the License Number parking system. It doesnt work all the time. Only places I noe that allows the 'trick' to work is the carpark at Temasek Hall. Most carparks now either haf longer barriers or they've narrowed the road to prevent ppl from out-smarting the system. If you wanna hiong and use newspaper to cover carplate..den dun get caught<br><br>If you are from engineering..jus beware..the 2 entrys (the one at engine and the one at SDE) are totally independent..meaning if u enter from one and exit from the other..you'll get free parking too.. BUT..if during the day u happen to exit from the gate you entered from...you might be charged big time...this is a screw up in the system..I've called them and i hope they have taken proper actions</div>

Still needa take shuttle bus (Its paid for whether u use it anot so u mite think y not juz tk it, but the bus drivers are seriously lousy drivers with no respect for pedestrians and passengers)... For me I drive to NUS so that I can juz go rite to the doorstep with total convenience... Although I'm in Eng, I juz pay $20 a mth for the season parking so that I can park anywhere in NUS and go anywhere I like haha</div>
