            <div class='col-md body'>yes its the driver. but what about other people that smash into your car? for such reasons consumers would want a car that can protect the occupants. Surely the driver cant do everything? it will be inevitable that accidents will happen and it may not be even both driver's fault. due to poor weather or suddenly the tree fell and causing motorists to swerve then causing an accident. If the car cannot protect the occupants, its as good as buying a motorised coffin isn't it?<br><br>I for sure would rather buy a vehicle that can offer the occupants good protection because anything can happen and s h i t happens</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quote: its the driver not the car<br><br>yeah its the driver but hmm even if the driver drives safe, that doesn't mean all the OTHER drivers will drive safe around this safe driver<br><br>also lets sae ur vehicle is stationary and thus u are not "driving".<br><br>for example you are on a 4 lane road (2 going north 2 going south). u are going north and stop behind another car at the red light of a 4 way traffic junction. in front, on the left and behind u are other cars tat also stop for red light. however on ur right is open except one white line on the road separating u from south-bound cars.<br><br>note: you are a safe driver who thinks "doesn't matter if my car is rated the most unsafe as long as i'm a safe driver i'm safe"<br><br>since u are at the red light the perpendicular road (east-west) traffic light is green. one westbound car with a drunk driver attempts to turn into this south bound road but loses control of his car and is headed straight for ur car. now lets see.. you're a safe driver. you're going to get a collision from your right. you're not even moving. what are YOU going to do? i dont think there's anything you can do except to depend on your car and whatever the manufacturer stuffed into that "not important" door of yours. so yeah i'd still prefer side air bags.<br><br>thats just one of many examples that show that the car itself plays a crucial role in safety and its not JUST the driver. what if a tree falls on ur car when u are at a traffic light? what if some drunk/stupid other car decides to swerve out of his lane and force u to the side? sigh.</div>
