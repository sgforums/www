Having only gotten off carburettors and moved to fiuel injection recently, I can't speak much about FI systems.  However, for carburetted systems, the obvious way to improve the flow of the fuel-air mixture is to go to a larger or more free-flowing carbie, like a Weber.

            <div class='col-md body'>That's ridiculous - engine capacity is not a limitation to mods.  I had a mechanic who used to race Minis - he managed to get 100 kW on the bench with a 1000 cc Mini engine, using extractors and Webers.  Sure, you couldn't get as much gain out of a 1000 cc engine compared to a 1600, but with the Kelisa's weight, whatever gains you're going to make are going to be noticable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the picture looks like a basic setup to me....anyway CAI is just changing the pipes... maybe the pick-up is slightly better.. and if your car does over 6K RPM then there is a good effect... if you want can change to open pod as well..</div>
