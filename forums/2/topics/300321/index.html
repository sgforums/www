It is all factored in to your loan. In most cases, you end up paying more.<br><br>2- Bank loan below your loan amount, some items in car only can get when you top up, basically them trying to get you to pay more for items that actually come with the car anyway. Breaking promises made to you is normal is the above cases. Try to get everything in black and white.<br><br>3- OMV is basically the value of your car as/when they buy from the factory. Different fittings/options as well as the exchange rate of the currencies will play a part in your OMV level. This will also be ultimately where your scrap value be calculated from (If I am not wrong, not sure, but think not far from this).<br><br>4- This is the price that the dealer gets you to sign for in order for them to get the COE at the first bid. This is normally only worth it if the car's price has dropped drastically from super low COE price, or if you want your car in the next 5 minutes.<br><br>5- Depending on how you see this really. But IMHO not important. They will tell  you that you will need to go back to their affiliated workshops to keep your warranty intact. And this labour free is bull. It will just be you paying much higher for parts.<br><br>6- Not familiar with PI workings. But you are buying a Honda, I would think that many workshops will be able to ably service your car. And stockists would be able to provide you with original parts at slightly lower costs.<br><br>7- The fee you pay LTA for them to put your car into the permitted list.<br><br>8- Most will be comprehensive I think, with (I think) AIG being the easiest to claim from, but also the most expensive. Sit down with your dealer to find out what the insurance they are getting for you would cover.<br><br>9- If they have ex(isting) stock, you can get your car a week from a successful COE bidding. If not, then depending on the factory, 1-6 months. Should be in that range, unless your buying a super exclusive car like a Koenigsegg or AMG SLR 722, in which case waiting times might stretch to more than a year.<br><br>10- Just go to any of the bigger PIs and you should be fine. They may not always be the cheapest, but I think its worth it. Especially if you hold warranty dearly.<br><br>Bring along someone with car buying experience. Ask the SE to write everything that is promised to you in black and white, on the sales agreement. Buy the car only if your comfortable with all the terms and conditions. If not, walk away, to the next big dealer.<br><br>Above is my POV only. Might not be zhun, but it is probably there or thereabouts. Have fun shopping.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PI huh? Good luck.<br><br>Dun good for those claim to be cheaper then others, later tell u no COE,no stock, loan not approve and must top up.<br><br>Basically they need u to loan 90% and 7 yr min. Check out their workshop, spec can be different from other PI cos they bring in themself.<br><br>I like the Crossroad very much, but the sale noe nuts about the car. Infact it's like a Stream and Civic.<br><br>Was told additional 1k plus can get HID,leather seat etc. think they locally fit some of the stuff.<br><br>1 thing bad -no test drive unless u made a booking.</div>
