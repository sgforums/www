Hmmz.. Fierce.. hee.. Anyway, since you mention that it is by the side of the car, the claim will only be very minimal.. As there are only dents and scratches.. What you should have done, is you could have taken a pic of it.. Be it you using a digital one or one with your hp.. As long as there is an evidence.. You should be able to make claim..<br><br>Finally.. A reminder that the claim will BE Little.</div>
