              <p>Alright this incident happened yesterday at 10th of April 2011 at around 10.30pm at the Singapore immigration centre.</p>
              <p>As some of you guys may know, there would be this slight incline upward slope after which you will reach a place where there are diagonal lanes that are angled at a rough 45 degree angle for drivers to slot in and wait for their turn to get their passports inspected.</p>
              <p>Each lanes can facilitate up to 2 cars and the rest would have to wait at the main vertical lane.</p>
              <p>Ok so my car was right after the upward sloping incline and i was waiting there for the cars to move. There were 3 lanes in front of me which were occupied by 2 cars each. Full, in other words. So i didnt move to the lane that was at the most in front, i merely waited there for one car to clear on either 1 of the 3 lanes to clear so i could slot in without having to entertain this scenario (waiting up at the uppermost lane, and what if the last lane, namely the 3rd lane clears and I have to end up waiting longer).</p>
              <p>Alas, there was this malay driver behind me that has been tailgating me since the start of the jam, i do not know if it was deliberate. When I didnt move, he started honking at me non stop. In the end he wound down his window and shouted at me, I shouted back. Exchanged a few unintelligible words and we moved on. Later further up at the checkpoint, we met again. He stared at me and I threw him a vulgar sign.</p>
              <p>His expression changed from red to scarlet from an instant. Got down from his car and confronted me He looks like 40+ and stared as if I killed his whole family, wanted to punch me, but he didnt. Keep shouting, follow singapore law la! Move in front la! That was pretty much what he said throughout the entire exchange. When my friends moved out from my car, he backed off instantly.I think he was scared to carry it further. But he still pointed that universally understood sign at me while backing off, kinda like a dance. He drives a Toyota family car that is horrendously modded to look like a racing car wannabe and he obviously do not own enough money to buy a normal regular plated car. His is a red plated car. I suppose he has gone to Malaysia to enjoy the tax free driving.</p>
              <p>I would have enjoyed a lovely showdown with him if he punched me. I consider myself rather built but he was much fatter, taller, older than me. Still, i suppose it would be quite a spectacle. Its a lucky thing that he didnt, else he would be in a hospital now, with the help of my friends ofcourse.</p>
              <p>Fantasy aside though, i was wondering if there is this kinda law, and it doesnt cause any jam if i were to wait for a car to clear first. In fact, it would make things faster for everyone if they adopted the same thing. We wouldnt have to wait aimlessly.</p>
              <p>By the way i consider myself a rather safe and pleasant driver, I give way when i have to and i dont drive dangerously and I am 20. I wonder what kinda person like that has no life and would stoop so low as to argue with a person thats half his age.</p>
              <p>So anyway the purpose of starting this thread would be that I want to know if i was at fault?</p>

              <p>Lol trust me, he would be the one in a hospital is he started the brawl. Anyway, the question was that if i should be the one moving forward.</p>
              <p>There's no law stating that people should move inside. Lets use the "waiting for toilet logic".</p>
              <p>When all cubicles are full, u would queue and wait at the entrance and see one empty lot then move in am i right? Who in their right minds would go wait at the first stall, which could potentially turn out to be the longest of all, and especially if you have a tummyache? </p>
              <p>Look at the female toilets that usually require so much queuing. They all wait at the entrance rather than going to take their places at cubicles. Same thing applies for guys.</p>
              <p>First come first serve basis I'd say.</p>

              <p>You are right to wait for either of the lanes to clear before deciding which to enter. Just stay cool in such situations in future. Lock the car doors if necessary. Today you meet a sheep in tiger skin, tomorrow might be vice versa.</p>
              <p>Anyway, no need to give whatever hand sign or what lol. Just move on. It's just another day of driving.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the input. I consider myself a rather hot headed teen but I do know when to stop. What to do? Still so young and brash, giving a middle finger is considered mild amongst my group of friends considering what he did lol. Cant take it lying down ya know?</p>

              <p>ok fair enough, some youthful brashness. But you might one day realise it's also a form of respect for yourself and speaks volumes of your maturity and coolness to think in dire situations.</p>
