            <div class='col-md body'>It could be due to the wiper arm. It may be slightly bend out of proportion which you can't see with naked eyes. First of all you may try considering change the arms. Look carefully at the rubber of the wiper, is there gap allowance on either end of it? the rubber should be in place n not be able to move with your hand. Try to change it at CC. show them it makes noise. if they say no need change only juz service, try it infront of them after the service to ensure there is no sound.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had this irritating problem too and dread everytime it rain. I change my wipers almost monthly and before I go long trip to m'sia. A friend recommended me to Tan Chong MOtors servicing centre as they have a package of treatment for windscreen and change the wipers to silicon ones for @$60.<br>It worked. No more ruddering and irritating noise and lines. NOw i change only once a year.<br>wipers are standard part even if your car is not nissan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it some irritating sound when wipe for too long ?<br><br>- Heard from my dad is the dirt on the windscreen that is accumulated causing friction and also sometimes without dirt also got this sound, Use newspaper to clean your windscreens as it wipes off oils or dirts from the windscreen, use little bit water to wipe the screen then later use the newspaper to clean the windscreen. Use a wet cloth to clean the rubber wipes also as dirt is normally accumulated there when the car is dirty. That what my dad tell me after his car serving at Borneo Motors.<br><br>Newspaper remove oil well from screen, after every ride when you think it is suitable to clean ur screen just do clean it.<br><br>Observing the petrol attendent using the solvent to clean the windscreen, they dont really do a good job though, leaving behind some water stains on the screen when your car is *bling bling* !<br><br>Some advice before cleaning your windscreen:<br>-&gt; Wet the windscreen a little moist<br>-&gt; Use newspaper, dont use a newspaper with stapler on it and please check the newspaper for sands , grinds and stuf . REMOVE the sands and grinds as it will scratch ur screen.<br>-&gt; Clean your wipers with a little water<br>-&gt; Do not use so much strength on clean the dirt frm ur wipers as it will cause a tear on it, or spoil the wiper.<br><br>Hope this 2 cents of advise will help you guys on ur windscreen<br><br>All i can that this is a cheap method to clean ur windscreen and to prevent those irritating *woop woop* sounds on ur screen upon wiping on wet days.<br><br>Enjoy<br><br>DRIVE SAFE, i also wanna drive but 3 more years..lol<br><br></div>
