              <p>It seems like my car is a magnet for others to bang into.</p>
              <p>2 cases in the same month which the drivers just bang into my car and just drove off!!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st case</span></p>
              <p>Happens at the taxi drop off point of Taka shopping centre.</p>
              <p>Was driving behind another car when a white car with no. plate SFM 106* E, just turn out of his parking without checking. Cause a scratch along my left side of the car. Although came out to check for damage, the driver just gave his no. to me and drove off.</p>
              <p>Although not serious, i only tried to get him to pay for my polishing at workshop. But seems that he is not going to pay after numerous sms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd case</span></p>
              <p>Happens today at neil road.</p>
              <p>Driving behind a bus, a black mazda with no. plate SJD 17* U, just tried to cut into my lane and as a result hit my right side of the mirror. Bloody idiot drove off as though nothing happened, even though i horn and highbeam him.</p>
              <p>Tried to get the driver to stop when i pull over at his side at a red light, but he ignored me and continued to drove off. Lost him at the heavy traffic at chinatown!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although both cases are not serious accident, but never aless its still an accident. Was damn pissed out now. I know there is no point making any accident claim report, as the damage is just some scratches. But just mad at this 2 reckless driver, both in their 20s. So ppls out there, do be careful driving, you will never knows.....</p>

              <p>New general motor insurance rule is that all accidents, no matter how minor must be reported, even if no claims are intended. Failure to report risk having your policy revoked. Photographs of both vehicles are the strongest evidence that you can give.</p>
              <p>NPNT. Thats why they run.</p>

              <p>Actually i did a online report on sat night, sun early morning they call up to confirm my report already. Quite surprising actually, but told me go down NPP to do a traffic police report.</p>
              <p>Go NPP they ask me why i come down make report. WTH?</p>
              <p>Anyway manage to log the traffic police report. They say TP will look into it.</p>

              <p>Maybe.... if i can see his signal light when he came in from my blind spot to my side.</p>
              <p>Even if signal.... you have to see if it is clear before you cut into others lane.</p>
              <p>Even take it that you assume that i don't let him come in, an accident no matter what, should stop 1 side. Or do not move the vechicles if there is any injury, i remember.</p>
