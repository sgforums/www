                  <p>A TWO-MONTH-OLD baby girl miraculously escaped death in a horrific car crash on Thursday morning that killed her parents, grandmother and brother on the North-South Expressway.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>She was flung out of the seven-seater vehicle the family was in when it skidded and slammed into two trees along the the 150 km stretch of the expressway near Muar.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The crash happened at about 7.30 am. The road condition was said to be dry then.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Jolene Bong, who was flung more than 10m from the wreckage, was unscathed but her grandmother Pang Chee Seng, 68, mother Kor Yee Lin, 36, and brother Justin Bong, two, died on the spot.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Her father Bong Kwang Hong, 37, a travel agent, died shortly later at the Tangkak Hospital.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The seven-seater Mitsubishi vehicle was a total wreck.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>The baby and her father, who was seriously injured, were rushed to the Tangkak Hospital but Mr Bong died shortly after arrival.</p>
                  <p>Mr Bong's youngest brother, Kwang Sheng, 27, a civil servant, said he was shocked when told of the tragic accident.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>When interviewed at his flat in Sterling Road on Thursday afternoon, he said he did not know of his eldest brother's trip to Malaysia with his family.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>'We have been told our little niece is fine and being taken care of at a hospital in Muar. We have not decided how to deal with her,' said the younger Mr Bong, who left for Muar later on Thursday to bring back the bodies.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>As he spoke, his distraught mother, said to be in her 60s, was weeping inside the flat.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Mr Bong described his dead brother as a 'good son who took care of our mother.'</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>'We are close to each other and all the family members will meet every month to have dinner together' he added.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Muar police said they would investigate the crash and urged eyewitnesses to come forward.</p>
