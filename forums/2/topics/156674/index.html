FC in the end depends on the driver as in how much they floor it... eg... A drive at around 2.5-3k rpm... B drive 5k rpm.. who use up more petrol? but den again.. if u comparing ralliart with camry... camry should b lower FC as ralliart uses mivec engine which is thirsty for blood wherelse camry uses vvti by right should be more economical.<br><br>1.8 turbo charge car... how many types r there in sg... i only kno of ralliart.. lolz...<br><br>Get hybrid car... even save more on FC... 13 km on battery+ 13 km on petrol = 26km/liter...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u really want to compare , it will depend on how u drive. It u say driving normally both cars.. they consume around the same petrol. But newer model of cars have revolutionalised engines to try to save petrol. Thats why u can install Air-Controllers to tune between rich air or no. It just basically means the more boost ur turbo..the more petrol u burn. U boost the turbo to 18 pounds.. its gonna dry ur tank like no tomorrow. If u drive normally and change gear at the right time .u will save petrol. its like driving a 2.5 litre Diesel turbo is as much as a 2.00 litre luxury car. They burn petrol like there is no tomorrow. But for every turbo car.. standard boost is 7 pound. so yeah.. i dun think it wastes much petrol. Does that answer ur question ? or.. my answer not even relevant to ur question. Oh..n those Ralliart , Nismo bs... man.. if its really tuned by them... then put on thier logos.. other then that.. its just a slap on sticker. Its like me slapping ona  blitz sticker but having no blitze components at all.</div>
