They dun want to move in onboard aircon buses as it is comfortable.. End up, the bus stop at the bus stop for 5 mins... Still no one move in... Though there are only 75 passengers onboard when allowed capacity is 86.<br><br>Wheras for non aircon buses, as it is hot, ppl will just move in to get to the destination fast as it is like in a oven...<br><br>So, it takes 2 hands to make a clap on providing better svs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While what you pointed out is true, public by and large are selfish and inconsiderate, but I feel it is more their mentality of "I've paid quite a bit for this ride, I'm gonna make sure I feel comfy."<br><br>It's the feeling of discontentment I  believe, that's making people selfish, impatient, and inconsiderate in general.<br><br></div>
