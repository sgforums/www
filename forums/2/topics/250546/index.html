All in the quest to succeed GM as the No.1 car manufacturer in the world in terms of number of cars built..heard about the recent major recalls for Toyota cars? That a great example of reliability dropping a few notches..and quality no longer being top-notch? Just go to any Toyota showroom and feel the plastics of the more recent Toyotas like the new Vios and Camry..it's no longer soft-touch plastics..it's just crappy hard plastics just like any other korean cars, especially the Vios..BUT people will still flock to buy Toyotas simply because Toyota is still the No.1 in Quality and Reliability in most people mind..I just hope after winning GM, Toyota start improving on their Quality and Reliability again..</div>
