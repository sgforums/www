            <div class='col-md body'>Honda City is equipped with the improved CVT. So far, it is very smooth going, with no jerk whatever, as with the problems you have described. Even with urgent need for speed and you depressed the pedal hard, you can feel the car picking up speed fast without any jerk.<br><br>I have sat in my friend's Vios which is equipped with so called super auto but I felt a slight jerk with each gear change, even though I am sitting in the rear. His car only 2 months old.</div>
