(No offence to all who drive auto) I must admit that i am lazy thats why i choose an auto sunny over the manual one ... and it actually cost more .... but for some cases there is no choice over Auto or Manual.<br><br>1. If you are at the traffic light and want to switch to 'N' .. no problem ... it lightens the engine load especially if your car is fully loaded ... Dun put it to 'P' that will be stupid ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2.if you want to engine brake , i agree with the rest use the O/D off switch ... it will go to high rev and wear the engine ...<br><br>3.Never Engine brake by going from 'D' to '2' ... it will MOST proberly over rev your car<br><br>4.NEVER rev high at 'N' then jam into 'D' if you want to wheel spin ... if you do that ... you can say 'bye bye' to ur gear box faster.<br>IF and it is IF you want to wheel spin ... throw your car to a reverse till it reaches about 20kph then jam it to 'L' or '1' for some cars, it saves the 'bye bye' from coming too soon ...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>*my $0.02 again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> *</div>

And which mode is more fuel-efficient? When should i use OD off, and when should i use OD on?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> thanks in advance lar <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div></blockquote>Hey hey hey Mer ... dun keep your OD off unless being challange ... O/D off means over drive off .. your gear will change at a higher RPM and that gives power packed acceleration ..... but kills your pocket (to petrol kiosk often) the other way if you want more pick ups and power when T-lights turn green is by shifting manually ... e.g. go to '1' then '2' then 'D' .... that will give slightly more power .... (dun be suprise u can even win a Lancer MR with this simple step!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey hey johncooper!<br><br>hmm i see...i always drive with the OD off...unless im going up slopes etc. i find that the sunny with OD on is not very good at its initial pick up...<br><br>hmm i heard of that manual shifting, but i remember being told that i should try not to switch gears when the car is moving (for auto cars) cause it'll wear down the gear box faster. is it true?<br><br></div>
