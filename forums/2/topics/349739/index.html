              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I was travelling along clementi road going from maju camp heading towards Ngee Ann poly. I was negotiating the left hand bend after maju camp coming towards the SIM entrance/exit slip road(slope).i was riding in the center lane out the 3 lanes. from about 150m I could see 2 cars waiting to turn into clement road from SIM slip road. Anticipating the 1<sup>st</sup> car will turn into the left most lane I kept slightly more to the right side of the center just in case the driver makes a wide turn.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So while the 1<sup>st</sup> car made a proper turn into the left lane,the 2<sup>nd</sup> car(Honda) was impatient and made turn right into the center lane trying to overtake the 1<sup>st</sup> car.<span>  </span>At this point of time I was directly behind the Honda just inches away from hitting the car and sounded my horn. i never thought that the driver will make such a reckless turn even without looking at the traffic.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">At this point of time I had to react so quickly to avoid an accident I had to take my chances and swerve into the right lane even without looking as there was little time to react and look into my mirror. Luckily there was no other vehicle on that lane. Even after all this happened the Honda driver did not even acknowledge his mistake by at least putting his/her hand out to say sorry. Instead the driver sped up. Outraged by the drivers actions I followed the car and came side by side to have visual with the driver. I managed to look at the lady driver but she intentionally looked away and drove even faster now. I so furious by her actions now and followed behind her. She had to stop at the junction near albert park. I went beside her and said “hello” at least 3 times. But she refused to look at me. I then knocked her window. Now said looked at me and unwillingly lowered her window.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I asked her,” don’t know how to drive is it? how can you turn into the 2<sup>nd</sup> lane? My wife and me could have got into an accident!”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then came the most annoying reply from her, “Why cannot is it?!” and closed her window with her music so loud. She failed to realize that she could have got us into an accident and at the same time be so arrogant. My blood was boiling by now and used vulgar words and pointed my middle finger at her. Come on she had the cheek to argue her lost case and not even courteous. How can I remain like a gentlemen figure and say nothing? These type of drivers are dangerous on the road with their reckless driving and don’t seem to value other people’s life by driving in the manner this lady driver did.</span></span></p>

              <p>Nope no bus lane. But because the turn is very sharp, from the SIM slip road to Clementi road, I've seen quite a few incidences of drivers who overshoot into the middle lane and kenah horn.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I was travelling along clementi road going from maju camp heading towards Ngee Ann poly. I was negotiating the left hand bend after maju camp coming towards the SIM entrance/exit slip road(slope).i was riding in the center lane out the 3 lanes. from about 150m I could see 2 cars waiting to turn into clement road from SIM slip road. Anticipating the 1<sup>st</sup> car will turn into the left most lane I kept slightly more to the right side of the center just in case the driver makes a wide turn.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So while the 1<sup>st</sup> car made a proper turn into the left lane,the 2<sup>nd</sup> car(Honda) was impatient and made turn right into the center lane trying to overtake the 1<sup>st</sup> car.<span> </span> At this point of time I was directly behind the Honda just inches away from hitting the car and sounded my horn. i never thought that the driver will make such a reckless turn even without looking at the traffic.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Her offence,</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2.</span><span>    </span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Violated traffic rules by trying to overtake the 1<sup>st</sup> car while making a turn from a minor road to a major road.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3.</span><span>    </span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Violated traffic rules by not even checking against the oncoming traffic whether its safe to turn.<span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">At this point of time I had to react so quickly to avoid an accident I had to take my chances and swerve into the right lane even without looking as there was little time to react and look into my mirror. Luckily there was no other vehicle on that lane. Even after all this happened the Honda driver did not even acknowledge his mistake by at least putting his/her hand out to say sorry. Instead the driver sped up. Outraged by the drivers actions I followed the car and came side by side to have visual with the driver. I managed to look at the lady driver but she intentionally looked away and drove even faster now. I so furious by her actions now and followed behind her. She had to stop at the junction near albert park. I went beside her and said “hello” at least 3 times. But she refused to look at me. I then knocked her window. Now said looked at me and unwillingly lowered her window.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I asked her,” don’t know how to drive is it? how can you turn into the 2<sup>nd</sup> lane? My wife and me could have got into an accident!”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then came the most annoying reply from her, “Why cannot is it?!” and closed her window with her music so loud. She failed to realize that she could have got us into an accident and at the same time be so arrogant. My blood was boiling by now and used vulgar words and pointed my middle finger at her. Come on she had the cheek to argue her lost case and not even courteous. How can I remain like a gentlemen figure and say nothing? These type of drivers are dangerous on the road with their reckless driving and don’t seem to value other people’s life by driving in the manner this lady driver did.</span></span></p>
