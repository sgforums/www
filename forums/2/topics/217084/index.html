If yours is an auto, make sure you have to step on the brake to shift out of Park, and the car can only start in N or P position.<br><br>17. Glovebox<br><br>18. Handbrake<br><br>19. Carpet (check if it is dirty or not)<br><br>20. Seats (check for stains or holes)<br><br>21. Speakers<br><br>22.

(205/55 R 15 etc etc XXXX).<br><br>XXXX is read 0620 equals to.. tires made in the 20th week of 2006.<br><br>or 0501, 1st week of 2005. Tires before 2000 has only 3 digits, e.g, 950 (50th week of 1999).<br><br>So you should have your tires made about within the year or at most 18 months prior.<br><br>anything over, try not to accept it regardless what salesperson say it is new.<br><br>Yes the tires maybe unused, but tires have to be frequently rotated (used) and not stored in the same position long term.
