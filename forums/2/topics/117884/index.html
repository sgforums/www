Cause I was met Lady SE from Mitsubishi and Subaru before and they seems knowledgeable. The Subaru's SE even commented about the handling like she has push the car herself before. Anyway, the buyer is my brother's friend, and they already know those cars by hard. They only posted question to confirm the answers. But BM's, ......ask her anything is like standard answers. Comparatively, I am had much better treatment else where. Too bad the car sells itself, so the SE never learn.</div>
