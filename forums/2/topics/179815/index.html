I have MY friends staying in Singapore driving SG car, only goes in JB during weekends. So all it goes down is can you afford the money. S$600 per month including car installment, I would say it is tight. Very tight unless a OPC car.<br><br>To avoid Jams, can either come in early and go back late. Or use second link which is slightly more ex because of extra toll. Usually those who travel JB-Singapore everyday is because of family. For me, I rather use that S$600 to rent a room close to my workplace.</div>
