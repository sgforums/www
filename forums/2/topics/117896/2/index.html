My blind spots were perfectly clean as i keep turning my head left<br><br>right. A bit nervous and excited before the TP, actually went to buy a can of<br><br>red bull to keep me awake. On the road which i kanna test route 7, traffic<br><br>weren't heavy, quite easy to drive. Except that towards the end of driving<br><br>back to the centre, my TP tester starts to scold me for dragging my gear.<br><br>Quite weird sia, i was at gear 2 and driving exactly 30. I just make him happy<br><br>by changing my gear loh. At the end of test, he just told me to watch video<br><br>and get my license then give my back my paper. No need to walk upstairs to<br><br>listen the result.<br><br></div>
