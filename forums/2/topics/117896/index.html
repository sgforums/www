            <div class='col-md body'>i took my tp pass 2 days ago, i failed.. but i got 0pts in circuit,<br><br>the tips i do in circuit<br><br>1. is stay focus/take note on the road floor, visualize the road map in your circuit, which way is out, oncoming vehicle or so on.. etc. p.s dont confused yourself and then turn into oncoming lane. imediate failure not worth it.<br><br>2. even u are driving u bo tai bo ji, keep on checking blind spot for fun, he wont care too. its good,.. i got 0pts on blind spot for the whole driving test. i like to check my rear/left/right mirror every few mins for fun. lol<br><br>3. sometimes the tester talk softly, u bo bian u try to hear in what he say, but dun ask him question.<br><br>4. seriously most of the testers seldom minus too much marks inside circuit, main thing they look into is your parking, i got 0pts for parking, others just relax and go through it, most testers love to minus marks outside on road. =.= like me... inside 0pts.. outside on road 40pts.. got four 8. =.= nbz..<br><br>5. STAY FOCUS, RELAX, and outside on road drive slowly as in 30-40km/h so u can react to situations. remember : inside cirucit is "depend on your own", outside circuit "depends on traffic and other vehicle"<br><br>but then final conculsion is sometimes it is based on a bit of LUCK.<br><br>the things i hate is outside vehicles sabo u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> even they horn at you, you also kanna.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> and pedestrain and cyclist they always anyhow cross the road  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

TP hates it when you keep putting yr left foot on the clutch pedal even when at 2nd gear coz it shows you hv no confidence in yr driving. well, that was wat my TP said to me on my 2nd attempt.</div>
