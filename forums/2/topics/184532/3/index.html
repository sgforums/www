And it seem you don't own a car, or at least doesn't need to pay for one. Imagine someone who drove in and out CBD area and even parking within. The parking fee can be damn high. Someone doing sale can clock near 4000 to 6000km per month easily. I did 2000km per month on my FC friendly Kelisa, it is already S$150 for cheap shell 92.<br><br>What I want you to say? Think like "please explain why the road tax can be so high", about S$3-4k per year even when a 1.5L car is only 1k per year. Even though it seems like I know nothing, but still I am putting up a point for discussion. And you don't just look at the whole cost per month, you need to focus on the details within which makes it expensive. The installement is already 2k.<br><br>Put your point through in a mature manner and people will explain to you nicely. Your 2 pervious comment sounded child-like.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My view.<br><br>As Mr. Wong is running his own business, the car might be bought under the company's name, and that he do not need such a high take home pay like 8k or 16k. Just my view.<br><br>A bigger cc or bigger car can be much cheaper to maintain per month base on the following few points :-<br><br>1) Petrol consumption. My 1500cc car petrol hit abt SGD400.00 per month cos i am in sales (getting abt 13km/l), why can't a BMW330Ci uses SGD800.00 worth of petrol per month? Easily, or even more.<br><br>For example yr house own a Merz S class for example which cost $300,000, and you just use it to fetch yr mum to market everyday, i think the petrol will only be abt SGD100-200 per month, depending on where is the market. SO, here there's already a 600.00 difference (as an example).<br><br>2) The loan amount. The BMW might cos $220,000 only and the Merz $300,000 for example. But if the BMW downpay is only 10% he still take a loan of $198,000. The Merz owner might downpay more such as 50% and his loan is just $150,000, which you work out per month, will be another 300-400 hundred different at least.<br><br>So petrol plus monthly installment, the cost of maintaining the BMW is already abt 1k more liao.<br><br>Other factor includes insurance (NCD, age etc). And of cos, if you are in sales, yr car tend to wear out faster, so maintenance definitely a few hundreds more per mnth ( taking abt original spare parts for BMW etc).<br><br>Conclusion? Sorry for being blunt, but i dun see how to compare the amount of money use to maintenance the car per mnth is base on the the size itself.<br><br>I am quite confident that the statement as given by Mr. Wong is true. If you work out, my 1500cc Jap car almost take up 1.5k to maintain a mnth.  Let alone a 3000 cc monster with close to 200k loan (which = to 3 times more than the value of my car).<br></div>
