              <p>Interesting discussion. Just to clarify, I thought all Civics are made in Japan? But I could be wrong.</p>
              <p>I think among the koreans, Hyundai has been silently upping their ante. While everyone is familiar with the Sonata, I think even allegrita (was it you?) who praised the Sonata taxi for its comfort - it does not lack too far behind it's german counterpart. The i30 seems to be doing pretty well, despite the lack of apparent publicity, as compared to Forte's budget blowing GUESSWHATCAR campaign, additionally, the new Santa Fe V6 is also gaining ground among the luxury SUV segment.</p>

              <p>For Toyota &amp; Honda, most of the models are made in Thailand. for JDM models, you will have to approach the Parallel Importers, whose after sales services rumoured to be not be as good as the agents. The purpose of Toyota setting up a plant in Thailand is to cater models for tropical SE Asia use. Cars for temperate countries use may not be suitable for tropical countries. Driving habits also varies from countries to countries, thus the purpose of regional plants.</p>
              <p>There are a few models which have the same specs but different names, because it is produced in different factories.</p>
              <p>Honda Jazz (Thailand) = Honda Fit (JDM)</p>
              <p>Honda City (Thailand) = Honda Fit Aria(JDM)</p>
              <p>Thailand Accord, 2.4L, 3.5L, Japan Accord, 2.0L &amp; Accord Euro R.</p>
              <p>For Toyota Vios, there's no JDM model. Except that the same 1.5L VVTI engine is used for JDM models like Toyota Vitz.</p>
              <p>For Lexus, all models are made in Japan. Because Lexus has to maintain a uniform standard to ensure the strictest QC.</p>
