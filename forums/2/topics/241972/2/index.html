But if she really spends $85k, -sigh- the years ahead will be nothing but saving here and saving there.<br><br>Think about it. Don't buy car. Invest the money. Leave some extra and she can take taxi to clubbing and spend $200 on drinks and still have enough to spend.<br><br>Buy the car, don't even know still got money left to drink or not.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the good advices.<br>I tried to reason with her to save teh money and take bus/mrt instead.<br>Last night we had a small argument over this matter!!<br><br>She said her taxi cost daily is about $8 + $8(if I did not pick her up at night)<br>So monthly is already 16*25days = $400 (just going to work and back)<br>She factored in another $100 taxi fees for her disco/meet up with girlfriends events.<br>She factored in the waiting time and time wastage if taking a bus/mrt and on raining days getting a taxi!<br>She factored in the dirty seats and smelly mrt/taxi.<br>She factored in the dirty old man stares(bus/mrt) and chee-ko-peh taxi driver(talking and asking for her tel number,etc)<br>Since she is alreayd paying $500 for transport each month, what is paying additional $500 to get a nice sport car. Now that she can afford it with the $50k.<br>She said since all car drivers faces the same petrol cost/ parking charges/ insurance fees, so that is NORMAL for car owner. Those things cannot be used as argument she said. As a car owner, those things are Standard, not like she is paying more.<br><br>Her final word to me before I decided to end the argument was....<br>"You got no dreams. You only like to tinker with your bike forever. You think I like riding in your bike when it rains? My cosmetics/purfume all messed up each time. You life not important, bike is dangerous, my life is important and I want to be safe."<br><br>I told her "I give up, you win loh. Buy whatever you like. I will sponsor you with a nice sport rim for your car lah"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey bro, seems like your gf can't think rationally leh, sorry if u feel offended for wat i had said.<br><br>Buying a car in Singapore is very easy nowsaday, can say that most of the working adults in sg are able to buy but maintaining it is very tough, mayb ask her do the maths again, calculate the total cost of the car and the amount of $ paying just for the interest, just the interest alone can oredy go up to 20 over k liao, still got season parking, outside parking, servicing, petrol, road tax, ERP, insurance, etc...<br><br>That is not all sometimes kana summon, or even more suay kana accident leh, must set aside some cash for emergency or unexpected things like this de.<br><br>Mayb just ask her to check how much she going to pay for her insurance first ba, at 23yr old, getting a sport coupe(2 doors) MX5, i think will cost her ard 2 to 3k ba. unless she want to buy under her father's name.<br><br>If she feel that after the calculation she can afford it comfortably then by all means go ahead. Wat i mean comfortably is without have to adjust one's lifestyle and spending habit. Good Luck.</div>
