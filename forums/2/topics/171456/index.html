            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2051228.002/2051228.002.1M.jpg"><br><br>Â·         In a class of its own<br>Â·         The worldÂ’s most powerful series-production car<br><br>Exclusivity and dynamism in a wholly new dimension: the new Mercedes-Benz S 65 AMG<br>in a nutshell. The compelling top-of-the-line model of the brand new S-Class delivers 450<br>kW/612 hp and reaches peak torque of 1000 Nm Â– more than any other vehicle in this<br>segment. The use of the new, innovative AMG high-performance composite brakes with<br>twin sliding callipers at the front further illustrates the unique technological prowess of the<br>powerful AMG Saloon. The standard specification of the new S 65 AMG includes a new<br>AMG sports suspension based on Active Body Control, the unmistakable AMG bodystyling,<br>multi-piece 19-inch AMG light-alloy wheels, DIRECT SELECT gearshift with AMG steering-<br>wheel gearshift paddles as well as the new AMG main menu with RACETIMER. The<br>powerful AMG Saloon stands self-confidently ahead of the competition, testimony to the<br>outstanding role of Mercedes-AMG GmbH in developing extraordinary vehicles and<br>powerful drive systems.<br><br>The new Mercedes-Benz S 65 AMG is celebrating its world premiere at the North American<br>International Auto Show in Detroit on January 8, 2006. Its ultra-powerful AMG 6.0-litre<br>V12 biturbo engine delivers performance that many sports car drivers can only dream<br>about: it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h in just 13.3<br>seconds (provisional figures). The top speed is 250 km/h (electronically limited).<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2051228.002/2051228.002.Mini1L.jpg"><br><br><strong>Twelve-cylinder biturbo engine with know-how from motorsport</strong><br><br>This exclusive performance is made possible by the 5980-cc V12 engine developed by<br>Mercedes-AMG. The engineÂ’s credentials are outstanding: maximum output of 450 kW/612<br>hp is maintained from 4750 to 5100 rpm, while the maximum torque of 1000 Nm can be<br>called on from 2000 to 4000 rpm. Even as low as 1000 rpm, the AMG V12 biturbo engine<br>already delivers 570 Nm of torque to the crankshaft, while 750 Nm is on tap at 1500 rpm.<br><br>When designing and building the V12 engine the AMG designers drew on the vast know-<br>how amassed over many years of motorsport involvement. The AMG V12 engine has a<br>precision-balanced crankshaft made out of high-strength materials, forged pistons made<br>out of special material which is extremely resistant to temperature and pressure, a more<br>effective oil-spray cooling system with a separate individual nozzle for each piston plus<br>larger piston pins. The main and big-end bearings are also made out of improved<br>materials to compensate for peak temperatures and pressures more effectively. The<br>charge cycle in the cylinder heads benefits from optimised combustion chambers and<br>longer opening times of the intake valves. A modified oil pump ensures that all lubrication<br>points are supplied with oil - even in highly demanding conditions. An engine oil cooler is<br>integrated into the AMG front apron, with an additional engine coolant radiator located in<br>the wheel arch.<br><br><strong>Highly efficient charge-air cooler </strong><br><br>The charge-air cooler has also been redesigned with a low-temperature radiator in the<br>front of the vehicle that is around 70 percent larger. The system works on the principle of<br>the air/water heat exchanger for particularly effective cooling of the intake air (which has<br>been compressed by the turbochargers) before it enters the combustion chambers. The<br>increased surface area of the low-temperature radiator provides a 25 percent reduction in<br>intake temperature and guarantees high power and torque output under all operating<br>conditions and regardless of the outside temperature, even when the engine is operating<br>at full load. The housings of the compressor and turbine in both turbochargers as well as<br>the turbine and compressor wheels have been enlarged to cope with the maximum charge<br>pressure of 1.5 bar.<br><br>The electronically controlled fuel supply with newly developed components operates with a<br>variable system pressure between 3.6 and 5.0 bar. Depending on the power requirements<br>and outside temperature, the fuel pressure is variably controlled almost instantly. The<br>engine management system translates the command from the accelerator within<br>milliseconds, delivering an extremely fast response from the engine in all load situations.<br><br><strong>AMG sports exhaust system for typical AMG twelve-cylinder vocals </strong><br><br>The AMG sports exhaust system with two twin chrome tailpipes in the new V12 design<br>provides the telltale AMG twelve-cylinder vocals on the new S 65 AMG. The new tri-<br>metallic coating used in the catalytic converters provides a faster response from a cold<br>start, improved emission control as well as longer life. Naturally the S 65 AMG fulfils all<br>standard exhaust emissions limits such as EU 4. The ultra-powerful twelve-cylinder unit<br>takes the specific requirements of the U.S. market such as LEV II, Â“On-Board Diagnosis<br>IIÂ” and oxygen sensor diagnosis in its stride.<br><br>The special position of the AMG V12 engine was singled out at the Â“International Engine of<br>the Year Awards 2004Â”: in the Â“Best Performance EngineÂ” category the jury chose the 450-<br>kW/612-hp AMG engine as the winner, beating off a field of 70 renowned competitors from<br>Europe, the USA and Japan. In the AMG engine manufacturing facility, each engine is<br>traditionally hand-built according to the Â“One man, one engineÂ” philosophy. That means<br>that each complete AMG V12 engine is assembled from start to finish by a single<br>technician Â– documented with the technicianÂ’s signature on the AMG engine plate.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2051228.002/2051228.002.Mini4L.jpg"><br><br><strong>World first: newly developed AMG high-performance composite brakes</strong><br><br>The completely newly developed AMG high-performance composite brakes based on the<br>ADAPTIVE BRAKE system set new standards in terms of stopping distances, sensitivity<br>and durability. A new twin sliding calliper is used for the front brakes, the kind of<br>innovation people have come to expect from AMG. This new, unique technology combines<br>the advantages of a floating-calliper brake Â– lower heat transfer to the brake fluid and<br>significantly improved ride comfort due to the way the brake pads are located Â– with the<br>performance of a large fixed-calliper brake. At the rear a large sliding frame-type calliper<br>provides the braking. Composite brake discs at the front and rear with a diameter of 390<br>and 365 millimetres respectively ensure the shortest stopping distances, remarkable<br>strength and outstanding sensitivity. The dual-circuit hydraulic braking system is<br>controlled electronically and supports numerous driver assistance functions that improve<br>safety and comfort. Multi-piece 19-inch AMG light-alloy wheels with mixed tyres provide<br>the contact with the road. 255/40 ZR 19 tyres are fitted on 8.5-inch-wide wheels at the<br>front, while 275/40 ZR 19 tyres combine with 9.5-inch-wide wheels at the rear.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2051228.002/2051228.002.Mini2L.jpg"><br><br><strong>AMG SPEEDSHIFT 5-speed automatic transmission with steering-wheel gearshift paddles</strong><br><br>The drive power is transferred to the wheels in the new S 65 AMG via the AMG<br>SPEEDSHIFT five-speed automatic transmission with AMG steering-wheel gearshift paddles<br>and DIRECT SELECT gearshift. The conventional automatic selector lever in the centre<br>console is replaced by a lever on the steering column, which the driver nudges to select<br>the transmission settings Â“PÂ”, Â“NÂ”, Â“RÂ” and Â“DÂ”.<br><br>The driver can use the Â“S/C/MÂ” mode button in the centre console to select from<br>the Â“SportÂ”, Â“ComfortÂ” and Â“ManualÂ” shift programmes that not only change the<br>transmission characteristics but also the accelerator response and the spring/damper<br>settings of the AMG sports suspension based on Active Body Control. The gears can also<br>be shifted at any time using the silver-coloured aluminium gearshift paddles on the AMG<br>ergonomic sports steering wheel.<br><br><strong>High torque requires a reinforced powertrain</strong><br><br>The unrivalled 1000 Nm torque requires a systematically reinforced powertrain on the S<br>65 AMG. In the automatic transmission this includes newly developed clutch plates with a<br>high-quality metallic coating and the modified shift and torque converter logic. Redesigned<br>drive shafts, larger hub carriers as well as strengthened steel spring links supplement<br>these measures.<br><br><strong>AMG sports suspension based on Active Body Control </strong><br><br>The AMG sports suspension with the Active Body Control system is the perfect<br>complement to the sophisticated drive technology. The active suspension reduces almost<br>all of the body movements that occur when moving off, negotiating bends and braking.<br>Bends are negotiated with far less roll; the body roll with fast evasive manoeuvring is<br>effectively suppressed. Compared with the previous model, the second-generation Active<br>Body Control is even more effective, for instance in reducing body movements in any<br>given driving situation. Thus the S 65 AMG opens up new dimensions in dynamic handling Â–<br>while offering appreciably improved ride comfort.<br><br><strong>Unmistakable AMG bodystyling creates a distinctive look </strong><br><br>Hallmark Mercedes elegance coupled with distinctive sportiness Â– the first impression you<br>get from the new S 65 AMG. The new AMG bodystyling is combined superbly with the<br>pronounced flared wheel arches, providing a markedly poised and assured appearance. At<br>the front the redesigned AMG front apron with enlarged air intakes adds an athletic touch.<br>The two slanted struts and integrated round fog lamps set in chrome rings make the S-<br>Class look even wider and lower. The side skirts take up the line of the AMG front apron<br>and emphasise the dynamic feel of the side view; all reinforced through the Â“V12 biturboÂ”<br>lettering on the front wings.<br><br>The new multi-piece 19-inch five-spoke AMG light-alloy wheels with a star on the centre of<br>the wheel painted in titanium grey blend harmoniously into the overall lines and represent<br>additional highlights. The powerful AMG bodystyling design of the rear apron and the AMG<br>sports exhaust system comprising two combined twin tailpipes in the new V12 design<br>provide the perfect finishing touches.<br><br><strong>Exclusive interior appointments with multicontour seats and Â“RACETIMERÂ” </strong><br><br>The exclusive interior appointments fit in perfectly with the dynamic exterior: open the<br>door and the S 65 AMG welcomes the driver with a large AMG logo in the AMG instrument<br>clusterÂ’s central display. The integrated custom AMG main menu constantly displays the<br>gear currently selected as well as recommending when to shift up to the next gear. There<br>is also a choice of engine oil temperature, the battery voltage or the Â“RACETIMERÂ”. This<br>new function enables the driver for the first time to calculate lap times in the AMG model Â–<br>on a private racetrack, for instance. The RACETIMER stores the time of the fastest lap, the<br>average and top speed as well as the lap distance; all the information can be called up<br>conveniently using the thumb-operated buttons on the AMG ergonomic sports steering<br>wheel. The AMG instrument cluster with its 360-km/h dial discreetly indicates the<br>performance of the S 65 AMG.<br><br>The extensive burr walnut trim, the Â“Exclusive PASSIONÂ” leather upholstery and the AMG<br>dynamic sports seats with their own distinctive design add that touch of distinctive flair.<br>The AMG ergonomic sports steering wheel with its specially sculpted rim and the AMG<br>aluminium gearshift paddles with Â“upÂ” and Â“downÂ” lettering is a joy to hold and behold.<br>One of the most eye-catching features in the interior of the new S 65 AMG is the exclusive<br>analogue clock with its Â“IWC IngenieurÂ” design in the centre console. High-quality AMG<br>door sill panels provide the finishing touch for the interior</div>
