            <div class='col-md body'>I just wanted to warn fellow car buyers to take note of this so that they will not suffer the same distress that I went through...<br><br>I went to Automobile megamart at Ubi to shop around for a second hand car. So went around the different levels to see what is available. Came across this big car dealer by the name of Cars Motor on the 4th floor and they were quite attentive to me, recommending me their current best buy for second hand car etc. I felt quite happy with the car and hence went into more in-depth of the car prices, and my current car trade-in value.<br><br>We agreed verbally that the trade-in value will be $45k and the new car price will be $71k. I signed the agreement and other necessary documents there and then.<br><br>I went back afew days later for the car exchange, and to my horror, the prices stated on the agreement was $44,500 instead of $45k! I was quite mad as that was not our agreed price during my first visit! I have myself to blame as I didn't see the agreement clearly when I signed on it that day!<br><br>$500 is a small amount, but I was more distressed by the company's integrity or lack of it... That car dearler whom I talked to denied that we had agreed on $45k and even the manager by the name of Eric, interfered and insisted pretty harshly that I take the new car and proceed with the transfer as I have already signed on the agreement. I believe as a car dealer, some form of customer service has still needed to be practiced. I was horrified by Eric's attitude as he used an arrogant and threathening attitude to pressure me to continue with the deal.<br><br>I knew that as my signature is already on the agreement, there is no way I can back out.<br><br>As the dealer wanted to rush for month-end target, he didn't do up the solar firm for me either, which was supposed to be part of the deal. He asked me to bring the car in again and he'll do it for me. I wasn't happy with this as I had initially told him that I am not in a rush for the new car and wanted him to get the car completely accessorised before I make my trip down to collect. I don't want to make so many trips down as it is very inconvenient and disruptive for my work.<br><br>As I am writing this now, I'm still waiting for him to give me a date to bring the car down for the solar firm.<br><br>I really hope that none of you will have to go through these kind of unpleasant experiences. After this, I really doubt the integrity of car dealers and the things they say and promised. Afterall, I'm heard so many bad experiences and I had experienced it myself!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

I'm not a big fan of forums, as can be seen from the number of times I log on to check.<br><br>If this helps, the trade-in price was scribbled and cancelled and written over again. I didn't bring the original copy with me as they only informed me on the same day that they wanted to take my old car for export. I only saw the carbon copies which the car dealers kept... I'm not blaming them, as I've put it clearly that I can only blame myself.<br><br>Or rather it was the bad service attitude of the manager that prompted me to share my experience.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did they ever mentioned anything about football money? I think its a pretty standard practice with PI in Singapore. But at least they should had made it clear to you in the first place. There are always a few bad apples in this industry.<br><br>My bro got his WISH from Hup Loong, and when he went to get his car, the SE said there's a S$500 football money. We were like:" Huh???? What football money" Made a big scene until they give in. Bloody suckers are always trying their luck to squeeze a little more dough from your pocket.</div>
