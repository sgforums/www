You need to be able to afford a car... sheesh... that's already a very huge hurdle...</div></blockquote>yah no one ever said motorsports is cheap<br>the cheapest form of it is go karts. i'd recommend it as it teaches u the purest of racing skills and hones your reflexes in more ways than simply driving a sports car like a WRX and EVO can. This is the basic building block of learning how to race. Many of the world's top racing stars all started out in go karts. many people think driving sports cars is enuf, but to be better, u 1st have to get your basics right, and people who simply pooh pooh karting as a serious form of motorsports, are the ones who cannot face up to the fact that they lack the most necessary and basic skills needed to race and thus they are much lousier drivers than they think they are.<br>so if u would like to start, take u go karting. it helps more than you could ever imagine.</div>

That game is simply too unrealistic to be compared to racing in real life. The threories learnt there, are mostly not ture, with the exception of the in out in rule. To us, that rule is simply a small part of the topic we call racing line.<br><br>As for go karts, u can go to jurong. there is a circuit there. the kallang car park circuit is no longer available ever since LTA took the land back for MRT works.<br><br>If u want to know more about racing techniques, can contact me.

Usually we call is sparring. yes it looks like racing, but it is not. no rules, no marshallers, no procedures, class limitations, scrutineering, how can it be called a race?<br><br>anyway, one important thing that u mentioned and i agree is that, besides practice, u have to go and talk to the more experienced drivers. U can practice a lot but if u do not know what you are doing wrong and what is right, then no matter how much you practice, you will not improve. A racing driver has to constantly be thinking about how to improve, and also to learn as much from others as possible when they are just starting.<br><br>anyways, ya, go and sign up for autotests, where the cars are mostly stock, and compare your times against those more experienced ones, and against fellow rookies, to know where you stand. from there, you should be able to decide if you want to take it a level up and take part in sprints and rallies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">yah no one ever said motorsports is cheap<br>the cheapest form of it is go karts. i'd recommend it as it teaches u the purest of racing skills and hones your reflexes in more ways than simply driving a sports car like a WRX and EVO can. This is the basic building block of learning how to race. Many of the world's top racing stars all started out in go karts. many people think driving sports cars is enuf, but to be better, u 1st have to get your basics right, and people who simply pooh pooh karting as a serious form of motorsports, are the ones who cannot face up to the fact that they lack the most necessary and basic skills needed to race and thus they are much lousier drivers than they think they are.<br>so if u would like to start, take u go karting. it helps more than you could ever imagine.</div></blockquote>Hmm... racing license sounds so expensive, rich men's game, like golf. I guess I have to give up on tat idea, just stand 1 side and watch pple drive at kallang and collect freebies. There goes my dream. T_T How much can Boo do in a goo? Thanks for the info Heng@.</div>
