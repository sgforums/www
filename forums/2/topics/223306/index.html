It is believed that the first driver was trying to slot his CashCard into his in-vehicle unit.<br><br>He stopped his silver Mitsubishi just before the ERP gantry near the Braddell exit, going towards Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>The ERP charge at that time was 50 cents. The charge ends at 8pm.<br><br>The driver in the car behind braked hard.<br><br>Miss Tiong Zhen Cheng, 32, who was riding her red 400cc Honda motorbike, couldn't react in time.<br><br>The IT officer was flung into the air.<br><br>She landed in the middle of the road - 20m away.<br><br>Thankfully, she was not hit by other motorists, who managed to avoid running over her.<br><br>The police said that Miss Tiong was unconscious when she was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was put in the intensive care unit.<br><br>Miss Tiong had finished work and was on her way to her Woodlands home when the accident happened.<br><br>Her mother, Madam Ding Zhen Zhi, 55, told The New Paper that her daughter suffered blood clots in her brain and had also dislocated her pelvic bone.<br><br>Said Madam Ding, a housewife: 'The doctor said that she also suffered from temporary memory loss because of the impact.<br><br>'Her first words when she regained consciousness this morning was 'Why am I in hospital?''<br><br>Miss Tiong's bike. -- GAVIN FOO<br>Madam Ding said that her daughter does not even remember that she had been involved in an accident.<br><br>'She was complaining about pain in her pelvic area. The doctors are still monitoring her condition before deciding if she needs to undergo an operation,' said Madam Ding.<br><br>'We don't want to ask her too many questions about the accident because we don't want to upset her.'<br><br>Madam Ding said that Miss Tiong had been riding a motorbike for about seven years, despite her family's objections.<br><br>She added that her daughter also has a car licence and preferred to drive a car, although she doesn't own one.<br><br>'She doesn't like riding a motorbike. But she was in the sales line previously and her job required her to travel to meet clients often, sometimes late into the night,' said Madam Ding.<br><br>'She couldn't afford to buy a car, so she chose to ride a motorbike because of the convenience.'<br><br>Madam Ding added that just about a month ago, she and her husband had again tried to persuade their daughter to stop riding and sell her motorbike.<br><br>'She had just changed her job to a desk-bound one, so we told her there was no need to ride a motorbike,' said Madam Ding.<br><br>'She is very independent and has a mind of her own. But I think that after this accident, she would not mind taking public transport.'<br><br>Miss Tiong has been separated from her husband for five years and is in the process of finalising her divorce.<br><br>Her boyfriend, Mr Sean Lee, a shipping executive, was in Kuala Lumpur on a business trip and rushed back to Singapore late Wednesday night when he heard the news.<br><br>Mr Lee said that the family has not been told by the police how the accident happened.<br><br>Said Mr Lee: 'So at this point, it's not fair to blame the driver of the first car.<br><br>'We also want to know how and why it happened. But she's still in ICU and we don't want to press her too much about the accident.'<br><br>The drivers of the two cars travelling in front of Miss Tiong are both men in their 40s. Both had stayed on at the scene to help with the police investigations.<br><br>There are about 360,000 instances of motorists passing ERP gantries without a CashCard or sufficient money in it each year, according to the Land Transport Authority. The figure includes both cars and motorcyclists.<br><br>Motorists who pass ERP gantries without a CashCard or have insufficient money in it are charged a $10 administrative fee and the outstanding ERP charge. But if they fail to pay up within 14 days, they will be fined $70.<br><br>Witnesses of the accident should call the Traffic Police Hotline at 1800-547-1818.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I feel that there is no need to make such an attempt to slot in your cashcard last minute if you forgot to do so... Safety first... The fine is not a lot anyway... and you dont get any points deducted....<br><br>However, I do feel that the LTA should do something about this... Like place a reminder board somewhere long before the ERP gantry to remind us to slot in our cashcard and if possible, they should have a short road shoulder for motorists who forgot to slot in their cashcards to stop there and do so...<br><br>Sometimes it may be an easier solution to permanently leave your cashcard in your car... but there have been cases of car cashcard thefts, so it's not advisable to do so....</div>
