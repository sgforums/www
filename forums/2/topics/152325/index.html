Cause usually, CAI by directing inlet hole toward the front, behind the grill, also means more air. So since your ECU mis air/fuel at a certain ratio, so more air, more fuel, more power.<br><br>Second think it low-end torque suffer from the usual CAI mod practice which even increases the orginal air tube or shortens it. You can minimum this effect by ensuring the lenght/diameter of the tube remains similar. Cause if low-end torque decrease, means more heavier the foot is when moving off from a stop point, thus resulted in high FC.</div>

From my car club, most of my bros feel that CAI has improved low end by quite a fair bit.. but when talking about FC, some of them has improved, some decreased, some no change. but it is the open pod air filter that removed their low end..<br><br>CAI allows more cold air to be combusted thus allowing the fuel to be combusted fully as compared to original. Thus more petrol can be combusted it means fuel efficiency thus providing more power than the initiated footing or ur right feet. Because of this, we tend to step softer on the pedal, hence better FC.<br><br>This is my knowledge or rather, what i have been told la.. Maybe im wrong.. correct me if i am.. thanks~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kena smoke by bunch of jokers over on my side here.<br>in general i believe CAI will improve FC because u need to press down less on your acceleration to get the same power. morever fresher cooler air also means ur fuel is better combusted.<br><br>so it makes no sense at all to me tat modding CAI for better air intake leads to higher FC.<br><br>but there's a case where the guy modded his inlet to a bigger hole so more air is collected. as such, he have a higher fc but his torque is now much better</div>
