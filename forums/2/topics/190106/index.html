            <div class='col-md body'>Since you will only be reaching a break-even point, I would like to know the main reason for your intention to change your car. One important point to note is the fact that interest rate on loan is currently 3.5%. I believe the interest rate of your Vios is 2.7%, which is much lower, isn't it? Thus, without forking out more money, I believe it is not likely for you to maintain the current amount for your monthly installment.<br><br>If the Vios is still serving you well, I would advise you not to change to an Altis. The Altis offers bigger legroom in the rear and a bigger boot. Other than that, I do not see how the Altis is a better car than the Vios. Unless you like the steering wheel mounted audio control and split-fold seat back of the 2006 Altis.<br><br>So as you can see, I am not really for changing your Vios. But then, it is your ride, and no one can stop you from changing if you just feel like it. But if you are willing to wait a few more months, there will be more choices. Since you are going to commit to another 100% loan, why not wait a few more months? You may just find new models more enticing than the Altis.</div>

But I must remind you of the high interest rate currently. Like I mentioned before, you must be prepared to have a higher monthly installment if you do not intend to pay any downpayment.<br><br>With regards to the new Ford Focus, here's the models available.<br>1) 1.4 3-dr (Hatch-back)<br>2) 1.6 5-dr (Hatch-back)<br>3) 1.6 4-dr (Sedan)<br>4) 1.6 Estate (Station Wagon)<br><br>The Focus is a good car. In fact, this 2nd generation Focus is better than the previous one in terms of handling. In terms of looks, some may prefer the previous generation though. There's nothing special in the interior, unless u appreciate the Sony Hi-Fi system which is specially made for the car. Some will even consider the interior design to be bland and not as radical as the previous version. It's a matter of personal preference.<br><br>Go for a test drive and you will be impressed with the ride quality. The car will go where the steering wheel directs. The steering is very precise in that sense. However, being continental build quality, one can't help but lament the lack of horses in the 1.6 litre engine. 100bhp is not very impressive. Expect moving off to be slow even if you floor the throttle but the car is really quite ok the moment it is on the move. The engine sounds refined but it is really not as frugal as Japanese cars. You must learn to accept figures like 9-11km/litre, which is not quite the fuel consumption promised in the promotional catalogue.<br><br>The tiptronic function is fun to play with, though the kick down is a bit slow after you input the gear you want. Change up at 3500rpm and you will feel how spirited the car is, but then again, it is at the expense of fuel consumption. So if you are really concerned about the fuel consumption, be prepared to live with sluggish move off when you dictate the gear to change up at around 2500rpm.<br><br>Personally, I feel that the sedan is nicer-looking than the hatch this time round. The estate is for people who really appreciate the additional boot space. The 3-dr Hatch is really an entry level car. You will have to make do with manual adjustment for the wing mirrors and it comes with a manual gear shifter to squeeze the horses out of the 1.4 litre engine. Until the Focus ST arrives on our shore, the 3-dr Hatch is really the next best thing you can own from the Focus family if you want a hatch that is sporty-looking. Do note that entry to the rear bench can be quite cumbersome and that is precisely the reason why we see more of the sedan and the 5-dr Hatch on our roads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ying,<br><br>Just curious, what is your monthly installment like? Really $620? Cos if it is, I think your calculations went wrong somewhere... Why I said so?<br><br>Because:<br><br>Supposed it is $620 per month. And you admitted you are on 10 years loan. So total payable is $74,400. The other guy forecasted the right %. Actually your interest rate for 10 years is 2.6%. How I know? Cos my City is also just passed 3 years old and my rate was 2.6% at that time. Coming back, without interest chargeable, your original payable amount is $74,400/1.26 = $59,000. This amount is roughly the price for a Vios (ard 60~65k depending which month of 2003 you bought...) at that time with about 4~5k (maximum) downpayment. With that, yours is typical of low downpayment high loan characteristics. So with some more mathematics, your breakeven point should only occur at the 8 &amp; 1/2th year...<br><br>My conclusion is: If my assumption above is correct;<br><br>KEEP YOUR VIOS.<br><br>If not, please do let us know your monthly installment premium. That will help us to give you better advices. We must first solve your problem of getting rid of the Vios, instead of focuing what you would be buying after you gotten rid of the Vios...</div>

I am paying much less than that a month, and looking at a 10-yr loan, I can only breakeven on my 6th yr.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i seriously think you have your calculations calculated wrongly. A 10 year loan car can never break even in 3 years.The 1st 3 year you are only paying for the interest.<br><br>Unless of course you paid a huge sum of deposit (&gt;$10k).Then it will be likely that you can breakeven in 3 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to all, I have been busy with my work, that's why I didnt come in.<br><br>Yes, it's true. we also cannot believe we breakeven. A lot of our friends also cannot believe it. for the beginning, as usual we paid 10% deposit, nothing more than that. However, I did go for refinancing 2x in the past. my current interest p.a. is about 1.8%. Our Vios's DOB is Jun2003.</div>
