But as U know, the banks will mark-up the value of your car and put the excess $ as "cash deposit" which was never did. I realised mine is also like that after my colleage told me about his.<br>{ e.g. agent and buyer agreed price 60k. Full loan from bank 60K. H/P contract state total car value at 69k with the 9k as deposit and 60k as load. }<br>Big org. like banks are playing punk with the system/rules made by MAS..  "openly". What a joke or am I being too naive.<br>Let's make the best of today as tomorrow is still another day.</div>
