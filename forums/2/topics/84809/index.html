If you are truly unsure about the conditions, please dun go. Firstly, you must know the area very well so as to know where to park and where are the danger spots i.e. where muggers are likely to appear. Looking at your situation, no offence but i dun think you have the slightest idea what you are up against. If you really want to do it, go with someone who is seasoned with the conditions over there for several times before attempting it yourself (even then, it's dangerous and not worth it). Plus 3/4 tank go in, how much can you save? Minus the hassles at customs (unless you know where it's jam-free), the time spent travelling, the efforts of travelling, the petrol you spent going there and the dangers you will be facing, not worth it lor. (Unless you, like me, live ultra near the checkpoint  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) Just my 2 cents worth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you own a flashy car, or luxury car, it's better to stay home for the moment coz we are hearing more robbery (worse leading to murder) news from JB. Nothing happened to me so far over the last few trips I went, probably bcoz I drove an astra (I guess nobody like to rob this car coz it's got no value in the "smuggling industry"). I also went to more open and crowded places like Carrefour, Giant. But in general, just be more vigilant (no point act cool lah) and lock your car, whether you are driving or parking. And look out for suspicious figures...<br><br>Oh, and about petrol, if you just travel within JB, there's no significant saving bcoz you hardly hit half tank (unless you keep circling til the low-fuel light appear  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). But if you do go it, no harm pumping oso b4 return (you are there oredi mah!). I don't worry about "low grade" fuel as long as the RON is higher than your car's minimum. Anyway you don't go to JB every now and then, right?</div>
