But alarm/remotre is installed locally.<br><br>The deal given to me was, either Sports Edition Lancer, or GLX or GLX +$1600 of features.<br><br>I took basic GLX but talked the SE to give me alarm/remote sensor and Alloy rims.<br><br>As for the Sunny, my sunny was a 2001 SS, and yes, mileage since then have been like that. 3/4 of full tank yields 300km.<br><br>For you to yield 460km, it must be on your driving habits. haha Because I achived 600km myself before, but's thats daily commute on ECP without aircon and during 5AM and 8PM traffic. So naturally the yield is high.<br><br>but on city driving, i hardly get beyond 325km.<br><br>You got quite a good deal from your Sunny purchase.<br><br>For me i can never get good freebies but i usually get very good pricing. and because i don't take loan and their insurance, so the SE usually don't get extra commission therefore unlikely to give me freebies. haha.<br><br>just a far idea what pricing i got, when the Lancer was $54888 in Nov 05. I got it for $49888. So...  that pretty much leave very little for the SE to give me the freebies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, sidetrack a bit, since we are on the topic on Sunny's FC, just want to let you guys know that I have been achieving a constant mileage of 13-14km/l these few months... Which means that I usually top up full tank at 1/4 level, and distance travelled is ard 440 - 500(!!)km. Amt topped up is usually 33-35 litres.<br><br>So, i believe its the driver.. not the car.. its realli a common misconception that Sunny is a drinker...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i do agree with you it's the driver. In fact, if my dad drives the car, the FC is worse.<br><br>But i can tell you i have did my best in maintaining FC, i rarely go over 2500 rpm most of the time staying at 2000rpm, and i try to maitain a constant speed.<br><br>but in city driving, it's almost impossible if so many start-stops driving.<br><br>The only thing that i have not done to prevent lousy FC is that i use the air-con.<br><br>otherwise, i do send for regular servicing, i rotate tires, maintaining its pressure.<br><br>I dunno if this matters but mine's a 2001 Sunny SS. So i dunno if this makes a diff. but even the Nissan SE tell me i cannot compare Sunny's FC with others because Sunnys are the heaviest in the 1.6 litre class but it gives a stable drive.<br><br>now that i switched to Lancer, i do notice a better FC, but i compromised lah. My insurance more ex. dunno why. $110 more in fact.</div>

It all depends on your needs.<br><br>What's the point when you have aircon and you don't use it just becos you want to save more on the fuel?

My 2001 SS seems to have lots of things found on 2005 EX.<br><br>How I ended up with my Lancer was that because I am going to "part-time" migrate soon, so I just need a car that moves but I won't be using much of it.<br><br>So my choices were Nissan Latio, Sunny, Mazda 3 or Lancer.<br><br>Latio was really my first chioce but i gotta fork out extra $20k to top up from my PARF rebates. So considering that i will not use the car often. This choice is out. Same reason for Mazda 3.<br><br>So it is a decision between Sunny and Lancer. Sunny was out because my previous car was a sunny. it's stupid to go from Sunny SS to Sunny EX.<br><br>About the Lancer engines, yep. it's really outdated SOHC and i have a feeling it is the same "technology" that powers Wiras and Accents.<br><br>I actually feel that this Lancer is "downgraded" to be a cheap alternative in the market.<br><br>I remember when buying my 2001 Sunny, the Lancer then was the 3rd most expensive in its class (after Civic and Corolla). My sunny was $78k and the Lancer $88k.<br><br>But back then Lancer had a Mivec Engine and 4-spd auto trans. The CVT was on the 1.8l.<br><br>As for the throttle and transmission problem, i am already experiencing that now. this feeling that the engine is going to stall.</div>
