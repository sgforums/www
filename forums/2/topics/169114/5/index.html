            <div class='col-md body'>I'm neither related to any1 over here but just to make a fair comment...<br>To Huoye: Boi86 did misuse some1 else's car pics and he ought to apologize for that whether or not the owner decides to sue him. That is basic courtesy. How wld u like it if some1 post a pic of your gf and say that this is the prostitute that he slept with? (Juz an analogy) I'm sure u wld want him to apologize too. And I believe u are straying further and further away from the main topic.  Btw do u not know it is an offence even to use a pic from somebody's website and post it somewhere else? Not to say using the pic of some1 else's car.<br><br>To timq and bananasg (hope i din get the nicks wrongly): Stay cool, u 2 are getting a bit overly-worked up although i tink its not entirely your fault cos some ppl here juz dun understand the crux of the problem.</div>
