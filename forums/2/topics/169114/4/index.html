And yes i would like to have an evo too but if cuz of the evo i haf to endure more stress at work or have to tighten my purse strings on other things for eg: drinking juz to haf the evo den i would rather not haf it.... as for affording an evo, not many pple can but den again if u add up all the TC and luxury cars in SG u be surprised at the ratio....<br><br>i knew my sentence would offend some pple but maybe its juz how i interpreted what timqz has said in a harsher way. as u know in words u cant feel the tone and it sometimes get misunderstood.<br><br></div>
