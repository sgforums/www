Actually, the real HID lamps are not so glaring. Its those after market bulbs that are causing the problems. And with those who do not install it properly, it is worst. Which is why we have white lamps that are shining into the car in front.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fog lights depends on the height of the car. For me, eg. just yesterday when driving near tampines ave 10 which has street lamps on the right side of the road only, a SUV from opposite me using ultra white HID with the blue base + fog lamp whitish with a bit yellowish is damn super bright. As it was drizzling, when the SUV shine from in front of me, it over-powered my car head light beam thus causing the road in my eye view to appear pitch black. In the end made me hit the kerb in the divider.. kNn.. if use white light is ok.. but dun use those with super brightness as it will blind drivers on the oncoming. The one i saw is those of white with blue base, for what i know it is 1 of the brightest type i ever seen. somemore still use fog lamp making my view of the kerb to be pitch black. These is 1 hazard for those idiots who did'nt think of other drivers. LTA should come harder on those idiots who din compliant with the regulations. Another thing, Fog lamp is to be use in hazy or heavy shower whether. In singapore that will be quite hard to get. Even with haze.. dun tell me only 70psi wan to use already... that is stupid.  The LTA or TP should come up with a proper guideline on the proper usage and types to be use. Secondly, they should come down harder on those who disregard the rules and regulations.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually LTA must specify what is FOG light and what is DRIVING light.<br><br>FOG light are lights that are built with bulbs specially made to permeate through fog during such conditions. They are usually yellow colour or white of a different light spectrum. They are usually install at the same level as the headlight and are required by law in singapore to be covered when not in use.<br><br>DRIVING lights are those installed under headlights and use bulbs of the same spectrum with headlights. They are used to light up the area which is cast by the shadow of the bumper by the headlight. This is used for driving in dark conditions (doesn't happen in singapore except if you are in lim chu kang, etc).<br><br>However, because people here modify anyhow, fog light go and install at driving light area or vice versa.<br><br>This cause people to get blinded or irritated by the lights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whether foglights are allowed or not doesn't matter here......what matters is that if there is a new law so serious that it warrants 3 months' jail, then it should be publicised well so that everyone will know.  And if there is obvious confusion at ground level, then the guys in the clouds and heavens should make attempts to clear all confusion.<br><br>Right now, it seems that some people have heard of it, some people haven't, some people maybe have, others maybe haven't.....we're just depending on hearsay, reporters, etc.  I read in some other forums that some even have specially written to LTA to ask for clarifications if its true.<br><br>I get utterly frightened by the thought that if I accidentally press the foglight button (its quite near my ignition), I may get to sit inside for 3 months.<br><br>By the way, are jail terms commonly implemented for traffic offences?<br><br>Actually, after so long driving this thing, I just noticed today that my foglights are as big as headlights in some other cars... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">.  Die lah, maybe I kenah 6 months instead of 3 lah.....twice the size, twice the price.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA can make sure all manufacturer take out fog light bulb or other if those wanna sell here then no much hussle liao loh. Those still caught in this case will be those illegal fixing the bulb back so fine is definetely loh.<br><br>LTA is lazy to do such check then wanna blame motorist. Spore road is bright with all the road lamp and all the while we aint using it so doesnt make much different. Lazy then blame us.<br><br>Collect the bulb and sell back to bulb maker or car manufacturer.... and earn some $$$ also.... kekeke</div>
