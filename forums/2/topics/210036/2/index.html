Cozzz they 1 to 1 exchange. This is a production error but its a minority. I was lucky to spot it within 6 mths driving the car. It happens to maybe 1 out of 10 productions for the Pre F/L CS3. But anyway, the OEM suspension system is not that good. Wanna change to aftermarket but no $$.... sad sia. Some times things like this happen, a production error. But if the agent is willing to do something about it and me not having to pay a single cents, its ok.<br><br>Production errors tend to happen as there may be a mis-caculation by the engineers during the planning stage. Just like what happen to Lexus when it was first launch out. The toyota wish steering problem, corolla(G7 or G6) fuel pipe problems. But if the producer are willing to settle it, it shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>No matter how bad the management may be, it's all up to the consumer to decide whether they want to buy their products or not.<br>If you hate mitsu management for what they did.

But how come during the past 5 yrs, its been closing, retrench etc. They cover up quite a number of death of drivers saying that those drivers die due to their inability to control the car which was lie. It has something to do with their directional pivot or what that shaft is called. The part from the ending of the steering wheel to connect to the wheel base to control the directions. It was not officially publish out. But by words of mouth spreading among the consumer, no one dare to buy their cars. Resulting in very very bad sales. Its so bad that General Motor who was part of the share holder using another company name decided to pull out, resulting in instant cash strap. Short of $$ and the rest I believe alot of people know what is happening to it now.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mitsu-hater,<br><br>Just curious, what car do you drive? It would be certainly be better than any Mit car. BTW I drive a CS3. So far after 3 servicing at C&amp;C, I have no problems with their CS. But I've heard some Mit owners kao pe kao bu abt their service. Maybe I just don't let small things get into my head as there are more important things to me than cars.<br><br>Happy driving.</div>
