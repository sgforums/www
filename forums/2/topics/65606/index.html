            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>My friend and I also trying to get a van using this method.<br>But currently i am aiming at the partner, oso 1.9D...ya true, diesel is cheap and the partner i am aiming, according to the sales personnel, full tank can go 700+ km, some more diesel cheap cheap... aim is to travel for point A to point B. After all, a car is still a car..ooops, we looking at van.. kekekeee<br><br>My friend did register the company so now may b i am trying to use his company or i apply myself also but we check with the sale guys, he told us the company must be 6 months like that... anyone out there have any information?<br><br>Think the van cost ard 30k+, i guess we can pay out instalment at 300 to 400 depend on the downpayment + fuel may b 100 + parking 100. So monthly on car is aroud 500 to 600 rather than owning a saloon which i think need to spend 1000 per month minimum.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ibook:</div><div class="quote_body">I am new to cars.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Yup its easy to register a company, but I don't think your idea of using a new company to buy a van actually works.<br><br>Do you know that you have to submit yr yearly statement in your income tax report?<br><br>If you report too much, then you will have to pay quite a sum in income tax. And if you didn't report any, how are you going to justified your company/business buying a van?<br><br>I do believe they will check on you after the 1st yr. Do you wanna take such risk??? The person who set this rulings sure know what he/she is doing.<br></div>
