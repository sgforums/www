Rumour that a completely new version will replace this model in March 06<br><br>Both VERNA and AVEO are in the compact car category. If u have a few thousands to spare, u can also consider VIOS<br></div>

Review says that it has the same interior as Verna, only the lack of ABS and driver's air-bag.

Anyway, OPC car in the eyes of those dealers is still priced like a normal car. It just seems like you did a S$17k downpayment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Aveo is a nice car, I would have gotten it if it was this cheap when I got my car.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by skthk:</div><div class="quote_body">My friend bought a OPC Lancer , he said Vios is small &amp; expensive.<br>I dun know how true. <span style="color: orange;">Performance is slightly better for Vios, plus better Fuel consumption.</span><br>As compact car - let say if I got a family of 4 - two kids 5, 7 &amp; maid (now) , will a compact car be ok ? <span style="color: red;">Depends on you, I have friend squeezing his family into a Kelisa and say it is good enough, bring your whole family to test-drive the cars and subsititude your maid with the SE.</span><br>Anymore example of compact cars ? <span style="color: orange;">Liana, Swift, March, Siron(best), YRV, IST(PI), Passo(PI).</span><br>Honda Jazz are 1.4 &amp; is about 60K ? how to justifty that. <span style="color: red;">Build quality. Size of the engine isn't everything. Else you should consider a Matrix.</span><br>Getz 1.1, 1.4, 1.6 the size(room) inside &amp; outside is the same ? <span style="color: orange;">Drop down the showroom. Anyway, the answer is yes. You can't really tell the difference between them by just taking a glaze.</span><br><br>when buy car the car audio/cd player system is included ?  Sound system can test how good ? <span style="color: red;">Included, but most stock sound system are crap if you are looking at budget cars. I do know civic's stock sounded quite OK. But still my brother is upgrading.</span><br>For leather seats will they get spoil easily ?  I had leather sofa &amp; after 2 years some parts dry &amp; tear. <span style="color: orange;">Need to apply leather care and stuff. So far mine is still OK, will feedback in 1 year's time.</span><br><br>IF OPC no need wait till 3pm sat will be very good<br>What exactly do u save on a OPC , how much ?  <span style="color: red;">Other than S$17k, About S$800 per year and since you don't get to drive it often, lesser fuel used and lesser parking else where. If that is not enough, you can consider BMW.</span><br><br>Insurance/road tax pays monthly ? <span style="color: orange;">Ranges from &lt;1k to &gt;2k. Depends on your age, driving experience. No-one except the agents can give you a definite quote.</span> </div></blockquote></div>
