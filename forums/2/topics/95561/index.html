Just don't do stupid things like purposely blocking people. Drive NORMALLY.<br><br>What the motorcyclist is doing is that he's probably waiting for you to accelerate. Because if a motorcycle wants to overtake, they can overtake you anytime. So like i said, make a mental note of where vehicles are around you, but just drive normally.<br><br>I always check my mirrors constantly whether i'm driving or riding. Do not reach a point where you just look straight and you only know the of the vehicles ahead of you. You gotta look out for those at the back and your side also. Develope the habit of checking your mirrors and blindspots and improve your SA (situational awareness)</div>
