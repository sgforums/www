It will have complete arresting power of an out of control vehicle including trucks.<br><br>======================================<br><strong>More bus stops may get safety bollards<br>By Dawn Chia </strong><br><br>May 04, 2007<br><br>ALL bus stops will be reviewed to see if they need to be fitted with safety bollards, says the Land Transport Authority (LTA).<br><br>Safety bollards (1m high) are made of steel sections filled with concrete, and are used to absorb part of the impact if a vehicle runs out of control, reducing the impact on anyone waiting at a bus stop.<br><br>The review comes after the accident on Tuesday.<br><br>Spokesman Naleeza Ebrahim said safety bollards have been installed at 1,500 bus stops since 1999.<br><br>The safety bollards came after three women were killed and four others seriously hurt when a car ploughed into a crowded bus stop at Bendemeer Road in May 1998.<br><br>The LTA spokesman added: 'By mid-2008, another 400 bus stops will be fitted with safety bollards.'<br><br>The current LTA guidelines for installing safety bollards at bus stops are:<br><br>1. At bus stops along roads where the speed limits are at least 60kmh and above.<br><br>2. At bus stops located along bends with speed limits of 50kmh.<br><br>3. At bus stops facing turning traffic from the side road, for example, at T-junctions.<br><br>About three to four safety bollards are installed at such bus stops.<br><br>The bollards are about 3m apart to sufficiently block any runaway vehicle while still providing adequate space for commuters to board or alight the buses.<br><br>In September 2003, six people were injured, three critically, when a car slammed into a bus stop in front of Jurong Camp in Upper Jurong Road.<br><br>The driver, then 26, suffered neck injuries.<br><br>In June 1997, one man was killed and two others were injured when a car rammed into a bus stop at Lavender Street.<br><br>The driver, then 41, was fined $7,000 and disqualified from driving for five years.<br><br>On New Year's Day in 1991, one woman was killed and four others were injured when a car crashed into a bus stop in Queensway.<br><br>The driver, then 23, was fined for negligent driving and banned from driving for six years<br><br></div>
