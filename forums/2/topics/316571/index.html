              <p>they will pay you the market rate of the car at the point of the accident, and if you have loans exceeding what the insurer pays you, then good luck. you are on the receiving end.</p>
              <p>my car was stolen in KL some years back and NTUC paid me the `market rate' after 9 friggin' months of ding dong-ing. luckily my car was fully paid up then. and by the way, they will `own' the remaining COE that your car is being written off which they will auction. i also lost my bidded number plate becos for stolen cars, LTA would not allow one to re-register the car plate number for new car. so, i got a double whammy here.</p>
              <p>for sure you get the short end of the stick here becos:</p>
              <p>1. their assessment of the so-called market value of your car will be based on the lowest quote they get. this one sure kelong one...</p>
              <p>2. they will sell off via auction your COE and pocket them to offset what they paid you, so their nett payment is a lot lesser than the face value of the payment.</p>

              <p><br>Being the last car, only your front will be damaged. How extensive is the dammage? If it is only a fender bender, with smashed head lights, they have no reason to write it off as total loss. They will do so, even if your car is repairable, as long as they think it is to their advantage to write it off than to repair it.</p>
              <p>Find out if your car is really a total loss, or is  NTUC Income shirking the obligation that you have been paying for all this while.</p>

              <p>3. i m still financing the loan, say if write off, do the bank need me to return the balance loan 1 shot, ie, asap or in stalment basis?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. say if i write off, n have returned all loan. will it be easier for me to get loan again? say even frm the same loan company?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. car will nv be the same again right, even after repaired?</p>

              <p>Sometimes it is really quite irritating when people in front brake a lot earlier than anticipated, especially on expressway. Especially taxis. Some of them brake so early that the space in front of them can park 2 cars.</p>
              <p>I also knocked the ass of a taxi before on the PIE. Luckily I braked hard enough so the damage was minor and settled it on the spot with some $ and I didn't have to replace my bumper. Of course there were a few scratches on it but not very visible from afar.</p>
              <p>I asked the taxi uncle on the spot why the hell he brake so suddenly and in his defence he said there was an accident right in front. I could see the accident also but it was 3-4 car lengths away. We even had space to move forward onto the chevrons at the PIE (Tuas) Dunearn Road (the infamous exit on lane one) exit there to thrash things out.</p>
              <p>I was really pissed with that fella on that day and somehow I felt he was trying to pull a fast one on me. After all, taxi fares now so ex nobody wanna take taxi, their income drop. He also wouldn't want to go to a workshop as it would mean less passengers for him during that day.</p>
              <p>Sadly, in driving, once you knock somebody, you are at the disadvantage. It is one of the only few things in life when you are to blame for the ineptness of another person sometimes.</p>

              <p>unfortuntely, even if someone do an e-brake on the highway and you followed at least the 2 second rule, you would have been safe. I try my best to do that although of cos sometimes, i also singaporean driver, try to follow so close haha.... but most of the times i really keep at least a 2-3 second rule though i have been driving for 9 years and i change good brake pads and whatever they say improves your braking performance lah...but i still trust the best way is to keep 2-3 seconds distance.

              <p><br>Well the 2 second rule is fine if there is light traffic. In a situation of relatively heavy traffic, imagine if you keep too much distance between yourself and the car in front, especially in lane 1, and therefore allow too many cars to cut in front of you, imagine how the driver behind feels. He/she sure have some anger towards you for allow so many cars to cut your path and thus slowing down the travel time. It'll be quite inconsiderate on your part as well. I am sure many of us have faced such a scenario before...</p>

              <p>How much time can you be delayed to be honest? How many people have seriously been affected so much by keeping to the 2 second rule or by letting a few cars cut in front of you? If it is a jam or relatively heavy traffic, how fast can you go anyway...geez whats the issue with letting a few cars cut in front of you.</p>
              <p>as potmynutsy's comments...everyone will be safe but what time will you reach the destination...are you suggesting then its more important to reach your destination fast than the safety of everyone? Seriously in Singapore, last time I work in Boon Lay and I stay in Simei. EVery morning, the jam at PIE is notorious. But how long would the journey take me? 30-45 minutes depending on the jam. Now I work in Toa Payoh, there still is jams but it can still will only take me 15-30 minutes. How long can travelling be? Will really keeping to the 2 second rule delay your travel that much?</p>
              <p>Having said those things, I am not saying I am an angel on the road. I do speed sometimes. I do cut in and out sometimes. I do follow closely sometimes. But I do dare to say most of the times I follow the 2 second rule. At the end of day, when I bang into somebody's ass, I can explain until the cows come home and blame the other party's incompetence, we will still be the one paying for it and maybe the one who is incompetent is the one who cannot understand the rationale behind the 2 second rule.</p>

              <p>Well, if one lets too many cars cut in front of him, at least in lane 1, imagine the car travelling behind trying to filter left trying to exit the expressway. Without sufficient speed, filtering left is going to be a problem and this can lead to lane 2 or 3 cars having to jam brake etc to allow the lane 1 car to filter in. I just feel following the 2 second rule as though it is a religion may be inconsiderate to other drivers on expressways.</p>
              <p>I agree, not much time can be saved, but imagine being the car behind the fella in front that keeps allowing cars to cut his lane, especially when in lane 1. It gets quite infuriating at times, even if one has a lot of time to spare. Seriously, at least as far as I feel.</p>
              <p>Yah sadly when we bang into someone's ass it is unfortunately our fault in the eyes of the law, no matter whether if the driver in front was actually in the wrong in reality or not. I understand that, thats why I paid the taxi uncle. However, I am just saying sometimes, in fact most of the time, it is not the total fault of the driver that banged and perhaps the person in front that braked abruptly needs to take a portion of the blame as well.</p>
              <p>On a sidenote, does anyone actually count 1000, 2000 while driving? It seems like some final theory BS. Hey face it lah, most of the stuff you learned for final theory would sound like BS in reality lah.</p>
