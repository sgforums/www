            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, before u commit. Work backwards with your budget. How many years are you gonna loan? My advise will be to avoid 10 years loan for such small cars. Secondly, the resale for both these cars are extremely low. So dont expect to sell them. You will most likely scrap it. Therefore, see which one has a better PARF value at the end of the day before u decide.<br><br>Picanto versus Getz.<br><br>Picanto will give better FC. Getz's FC is not great. Hyundai cars are known to be guzzlers. Picanto could do betwen 14-16km / L. Its proven.<br><br>Getz should give higher PARF over Picanto. Then again, I am sure the savings in Petrol over the years of usage will offset this marginal advantage.<br><br>Picanto is not known to be a powerful car. In fact, it runs out of breath easily in a fully loaded car. The Getz will perform more perky.<br><br>Honestly, many people here have relegated the Proton. IMHO, the GEN3 does not look 1/2 as bad as the hatches mentioned. Amongst the 3, it performs better. But in terms of FC, I really dont know.<br><br>Do your maths and due diligence. Dont let people misle u in anyway. Some comments here are pretty far fetched and are from kids. Best bet, go to Getz and Picanto forum and get your answers.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joanne:</div><div class="quote_body">vios is over budget (from wat i know).  anyone can enlighten me the comparison between picanto &amp; getz?
