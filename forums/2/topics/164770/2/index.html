Its more of a 'who dare to squeeze who more' mentality and whether you value your car a not.... got kana someone bump my front bumper purposely many yrs back at JB customs just to squeeze in... only got few cm space still wanna cut in. But I admit I bumped him back cos he didn't say sorry until his wife scared make a 'peace' sign. My car about to scrap the week after so i didn't care. See how far you wanna go. By the way he was a Singaporean.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

But nowadays, more singaporeans are getting more civilized and mature. We only fight for the significant things. Other things like queues, most singaporeans are less aggressive. Only the losers out there are still fighting for the unimportant things in life. Sometimes, I really like to shook them awake. Can you imagine after I was not able to cut in, the sunny drivers are thinking: "haha, loser. Want to cut me, fat hope. Polish up your skill first!!!"</div>
