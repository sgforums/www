Usually, those cars that want to send me to meet my maker are the sunnies(sometimes i ride MC).

Besides, signalling does not give you the right of way. It is polite yes but if signalling to people gives you the right to come in, then if you signal to someone you want his wallet/house/car, he must give you meh? Relax la.. I usually give way to people who signal BEFORE they come into my lane, though I will close the gap if they try to swerve in  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Remember, a signal is to inform or request, not a bane of power or authority.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, I am a Sunny driver. Read ur problem and need to clarify...it is not ALL Sunny drivers who is an asshole. Please do not categories them as such. I for one is always courteous on the road. On a normal road, if the car signals properly, I will give way, whether the change of lanes is due accident, the car wanting to turn, etc.<br>I also travel very frequently to JB and during the journey back, I always take the extreme right lane although it looks to be the longest queue. Unfortunately, in this circumstance, I will never give way because of those drivers who thinks that they do not need to queue and will follow the left side and cut in at the front. Is it fair to say that I am not being courteous not to let the driver cut in?<br>In ur case, I will give in as it is not ur fault.<br>Another great example is on the BKE turning to the PIE. Anyone who travels on that road will know of all those assholes who turns in to the middle lane at the very last minute instead of following the queue. Are we wrong if we do not give way to them even though they have signalled?<br>In ur case, it is just unfortunate that both cars that did not let u in was Sunny's but it does not mean all Sunny drivers are like that.</div>

But it is courtesy to do so. Especially for the 2nd sunny when he already saw that the first one lan lan din give way to me, so he should have been more courteous by giving me. But he didn't also.<br>Furthermore, it's not only me that is stuck, but a whole queue behind me. Normally, if you are in such circumstance, you will allow alternate cars to cut in. That is common sense and courtesy, tio boh?</div></blockquote>I understand why you are agitated, though both of you did nothing wrong in the eyes of the law, it is considered impolite of the other drivers not to let you filter in. Sad to say, you can see our local culture of kiasuism showing its head on the road. At a red, if there's two cars: one in lane 2, one in lane 3, and a car comes up behind the first one in lane 3, I see it ALL the time that car will always try and move his car all the way to lane 1 so that s/he can be first in the lane. This gives you the impression the guy in lane 1 wants to be first because s/he's rushing somewhere and doesn't want to be stuck behind a possibly slower vehicle in lane 2/3. I see taxis and civilian vehicles doing this all the time. Problem is I always end up behind the new guy in lane 1 who then decides after the light turns green, that lane 1 is now for slower vehicles.<br><br>I'm sure you're a very even tempered driver and I think that the way you expressed your unhappiness is much more mature than can be said for some drivers I've seen on the road.<br><br>About the alternating giving of way thing, the problem is sometimes when you give in to one, the one behind tends to try to rush in too. This is something I have noticed. My way is to give the driver I am giving way to, enough room to come in, then ease into the gap gently so the next one understands it's not a free for all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

That's why my title specifically stated "SOME". But my experience told me that quite a number of attitude drivers drove sunnies. Of course, there are other cars that pose problems. But more often than not, I noticed it will be a sunny. It is my observation.<br>But if I offended you, I apologise. I don't mean you.

He moved right abit and then move a little more forward so thathis nose is inches infront of me.(To help visualizing, I am cutting to the right...). So with him inces in front, i can't buang him.
