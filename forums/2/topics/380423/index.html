              <p>It depends on whether you wanna go all the way with manual. I took a manual license more than a year ago, and my dad's car is a manual Kia Picanto. Hence I drive manual 95% of the time.</p>
              <p>At the beginning I also have the same problems. Concentrating on the road conditions while changing gears, accelerating, steering and braking and the same time. I thought it was too much information for my brain and I thought driving an automatic can let me concentrate better.</p>
              <p>But after 1 year and 5 months, I've gotten used to driving a manual. So much so that the added steps in driving (when compared to auto) won't really distract me from concentrating on the road conditions. Shifting gears becomes second nature. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>This stalling engine problem you just have to practise more. You need to learn to master your left foot to control your clutch properly. Worse come to worse, take more revision lessons before the TP test.</p>

              <p>to me, and many others, its really not a problem. once u get used to it, u will be concentrating on the road just as well, if not better than auto car drivers. also, doing many things at the same time works your brain a bit more, so likely u will be "sharper" in the mind too.</p>
              <p>just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Eg. when changing to up gear, we just release the acclerator pedal, follow by depressing the clutch pedal and shift the gear, then (fast or slow) release the clutch pedal?</p>

              <p>But they are called "DSG", "Clutch-less Manual", "S-Tronic",
              "Tiptronic", "Sports Mode", "Selespeed".</p>
              <p>Hope I never use any wrong abbreviations here. Feel free to
              correct me and add more. I wanna learn.</p>

              <p>there are no clutch-less manual gearboxes. manual cannot be clutchless. at the most you can say it's a gearbox with an automated clutch. that's equals to lamborghini's e-gear, alfa's selespeed, bmw's smg, etc. it can be quite jerky. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>I will prefer manual transmision. Total control (abuse) of the car. Can play with free wheeling also as well as launch. As well as skipping gears during down shifting.</p>
              <p>As for clutchless transmission, layman call it clutchless because there is no clutch pedal.</p>
              <p>In technical details, BMW's SMG &amp; Lambo's E-Gear is in a class of it's own because it is still a conventional single clutch gearbox except that the shifting mechanism works on a electro hydraulic system.</p>
              <p>For Alfa's selespeed, it is still an normal torque convertor based automatic gearbox except for the steptronic function. Subaru, Toyota &amp; most other Japanese makes uses this system because they have yet to develop a dual clutch system. This explains for the jerky feel in the shifting. Except that Lexus have the system so refined that they do not need to develop a clutch based automatic transmission system.</p>
              <p>Lastly, the infamous dual clutch system. Volkswagen is the 1st carmaker to incorporate this system &amp; they call it DSG. It is a double clutch system where the odd number gears are connected to one clutch &amp; the even number gears are connected to another clutch. This explains why the shifting takes 0.5 seconds &amp; below. Up to date. this is the most advanced transmission system.</p>
              <p>After Volkwagen's DSG. Audi came out with Sport-Tronic, Porsche came out with PDK, BMW came out DCT. Nissan used this system on GTR35. Mitsubishi used this on EvoX &amp; they call it SST. So far other Japanese carmakers have yet to catch up with them.</p>
              <p>Hope that you're not confused with all these technical mumbo jumbo.</p>
