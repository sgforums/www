            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, was travelling on ECP on 30th sept around 4pm. Was heading to prince Edward exit for a 5pm deadline. Was travelling extreme right lane above 90 below 120 when i spotted 2 TP bikes approx 50 metres on my left hiding under tanjong katong flyover. Managed to slow down to 90 when at shoulder length with them. They looked at me. But did not chase me. They were only holding out a notepad with a pen and scribbling other things. Or something like that. I Already know the rough estimates if i possibly get a fine. Question now is will i get fined as they did not stop me?<br><br>Comments?</div>

I was fully aware not to go 40km/h faster then the speed limit. I'm not really worried. As long as i don't have to go to court, it'll upset my schedule a lot. Rushing between 2 signing of contracts with seperate datelines. Secured the important one first, then made it just in time for the other. Just asking for curiosity.<br><br>Do TP officers carry the handheld gun or do they have it attached to the bikes? i clearly did not see them carrying any mobile laser guns as both had little notepads in the palm of their hands, both scribbling things.</div>
