Appreciate your feedback. Really considering buying a march....but had a lot of bad experience with second hand car dealers,  but seems like in the classifieds, mostly all dealers.<br>Hey is there much maintenance to be done on the march? Besides the regular servicing?<br>Anyway, I know march should be quite a solid car. Wa driving the old sunny. Renewed COE. 1.6SS. It had 280000km on it. But the engine still damn smooth! Went to 160km/h no problem.....I had always thought nissan and toyota to be reliable, but fuel economy wise, should be toyota. Wanted to get some feedback before I really get into finding one. Too bad toyota don't have the starlet in EFI engine.<br>Yes Sugar Daddy is right. There is a new march is  in town. I think it is 1.2 and 1.4 models. All come in auto. Looks a bit like the beetle though. And the price is 73k. Saw at the showroom. Same price as a sunny 1.5EX. Too ex man.<br>By the way wei, how much did you get your car for? Did you get it brand new?<br>Thanks again for your reply! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Enjoy the car and hope you get rich soon! Then can pass me the car! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> haa haa......<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi guy25,<br><br>Yah, my friend did encountered some bad experiences when buying a 2nd care from dealer too. Seems like no1 can be trust nowsday, haha. Yup, agree that most on classified ad are dealers, so do watch out if buy from them.<br><br>Anyway, I didn't get it brand new, bought it from the owner direct! Therefore, was cheaper than those on the 2nd hand car market. Got it last Oct, exactly a yr ago, at 47k flat, parf at 9.5k. When I bought it, there's still 6 yrs 8 mnths left. So by calculation, in 80 mnths I lost 38.5k, which work out to a depreciation of not more than 5.7k a yr without interest.<br><br>Beside the normal servicing, the car is alrite, didn't spend much unneccasry things, except that i change the tyres and brake pad the moment I got the car (Wear out by previous owner). I change the two suspension mounting (Wear out by previous owner also) too, and to my relief, it cost less than $200. Guess one advantage of March is the easy to get spare part. Other than these few items, the rest are okie so far. No major problem so far.<br><br>My car mileage is currently quite low still, heh, so I dunnoe how it will be when it 200,000km or more. But of cos, I'm sure you cannot compare a 1000cc car to a 1600cc. That's just too much different. And from my personal pt of view, cars like toyota, honda, nissan and mitsubishi should not have any problem lasting 10 yrs even if they're cc are small.<br><br>Yup, the new nissan march is a 1260cc bettle-like shape cutie. Looks cute, haha, and best still, its stated 1L of petril is able to travel 19km! How's that!!! Me hope my March is like that too.<br><br>Maybe you can test drive the car 1st b4 deciding further. Like i say, a good 1000cc car except for the fuel consumsion. You might not get used to it too as you are used to driving a 1600cc car. When I 1st drive it, not use too, but after a few mnths, got very use to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope you find one car that you enjoy driving soon. Need for infor feel free to ask me, I'll try my best to assist or help if I can.<br><br></div>

But sometime really have to depend on situation, like the quality of the car. A few other factors to consider is insurance and road taxes etc. Bigger car will increase the cost for these 2.<br><br>And also, maybe the petrol consumsion. If you add all these up it will be quite a big sum, no joke. Of cos, if can afford it, heh, i'll go for a bigger car 2, but on a budget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys and Gals,<br>*sigh* no luck in locating a march! Saw a few ads in the newspaper. Depreciate about 5K plus.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guy25,<br><br>Actually, if you are sincere in looking for a car, the best way is to go down personally to car mart. Test drive and go for a price. Cos now, new cars are relatively cheaper than last time, and they will let go if they still earn. Normally they mark up by a lot, abt 5-6k. So, dare dare slash their price, they'll normally let go one. The reason is, the longer they hold the car, the more they lost! So they will let go if even if they earn a bit.<br><br>That's the problem with newspaper. Always give wrong infor. Dun ever trust them.</div>

One guy won't even let me test drive until I confirm the price ! Then I told him I need to see how the car handles before I decide. He not happy!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I'm driving a Nissan March/M (09/95 version) which I bought in April 2002. Overall, I think the car itself is good e.g. powered steering, powered windows (front 2 only), 4 cylinder fuel injection engine, single disc CD player etc.<br><br>I heard of those notorious 2nd-hand car dealers.<br>They keep telling you that its good value for money and that its a good car. And when you really decided to buy the car, they will tell you some sorts of additional charges that you will need to pay for (hidden costs). Luckily, I bought it from my cousin who is selling 2nd hand cars. He tested and chose the car for me without any hidden costs.<br><br>Like what Ah Wei said, the engine is good. I tried 110km in S'pore and 120km in JB Malaysia. Its a good 1000cc car with a good engine with good fuel consumption.

Mine is quite bad for a 1000cc car, 11-12km per litre at most if driving in Sg.<br><br>Also, you just drove yr car for abt half a yr, if u sell it now, u must be prepare to lose a bit of money. Care to tell how much u bought the car at? $30,000k? Though yr cousin helps you, but I'm sure his company still will want to earn a little. What's yr depreciation like a yr? Care to share?<br><br>Like i mention earlier, think I'm still going to live with this March for some yrs to come, unless in need of money, heh~<br><br>Cheers~</div>

Mine was an auto too, so maybe i can give my piece of advise, hope it helps. When you r mentioning abt the jerk, is it between gear 1 and gear two? abt 20km/30km hr normally will switch from gear 1 to 2.<br><br>Mine have this problem too. And in the 1st place, I thought its the gear box problem. Later i realise the car itself is like that. However, it only happens when we step on the accelerator too hard (when in gear 1). So, later on, I learn that when the car is abt to switch gear, release the accelerator for a second, like the gear change then step on the accelerator again, for a smooth gear change. It don't happen at gear 2-3 or 3-4. I'm not sure of the exact problem but do believe it got something to do with the lack of power in auto mode for this car. You will get use to it in no time, like me now. Automatically will release the accelerator.<br><br>The pick up is slow, its a fact. Afterall its a 1000cc car and AUTO somemore. The horse power for the car is only 58. So it sure lacks power. The rim size make a slight different too. It will be slightly slower if it gets bigger. Ideally for such a small car, 13 inches are just fine. 14 a bit lack, ermmmm 15 I'm not sure can fit in or not, heh. So what size is your tyre? Although i prefer a bigger sport rim for my car, I got no choice but stick to 13 inches for my March.<br><br>What do you know abt maintaining the car? Such as what? Maybe i can help if you r more specific. The easliest way, send to a meachanic every 10,000km. They'll know what to do and what to change. Of cos, get some1 to recommend u a good mechanic. If you are talking abt maintaining it yourself, I do know some basic staff but not too chim as I myself worried that I might end up in more trouble than I ask for    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Enjoy yr march~!<br></div>

I do have the car menu, but seldom refer to it.<br><br>Anyway, to ans yr qns, its theoritically okie to add water to the coolent bottle, but its better of you just go and buy a bottle of coolent (which is very cheap) and pour it in. Water is normally added to the radiator tank. Top it up if the water is low. But do not open the radiator cap if the engine is hot. Remember. There're chances that it will split. During normal services, they'll normally top up the battery water for you. But its easy to top it up yrself as well. Think a bottle of engine oil cost only abt $1.20. If all these are in okie level, you can wait till the servicing.<br><br>You can check the engine oil (There's a gauge in the "stick" that will you can read from). If the reading is low or the oil is thick and milky, its time to change engine oil. Engine oil is something i don't do it myself cos i dunnoe how to. One good engine oil is shell helix ultra (try to use good one can last 10000km, lousier one cheaper but normally advisable at 5000km).<br><br>Others like brake fluid, power steerling fluid I don't add myself cos I dunnoe what brand is good. But normally, these can last for a very long time, so I think it should be okie not to check. If you are worried, can always take a peep. Not sure if its advisable to change yrself though. Oh yah, during normal servicing, spark plugs are usually change. Good spark plugs usually gives u more power, but that's always in the beginning part. Last for a few weeks only usually, then u will feel the power loss.<br><br>Haha, talk so much, actually i only know the basic. Very basic in fact. Hope the above helps. Once you got hold of yr car thoroughly, u'll know what's wrong when u drive next time, like some extra sound or uneven handling of the car.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>I am driving a '96 march(M) for 2 years now. But i must say fuel consumption is high for 1.0. However I must say this car is a small car with big features, considering its 16valve twincam DOHC, ABS and powersteering which a lot of small cars doesn't have. Its easy to drive but it tends to accelerate slower in the higher gears.</div>
