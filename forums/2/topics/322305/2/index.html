              <p>previously, i had an old plate too which i intended to recycle to my future car purchases. the plate # was E*6828*. it was on my honda accord until the car got stolen in KL, malaysia.</p>
              <p>i asked LTA to allow me to register this car plate on my new car, but LTA told me plate on stolen car cannot be used to register, even if i am the car owner. i damn TL that time.</p>
              <p>my last car, which i sold recently, is a sb* X128*.</p>

              <p>Well, the majority of people having these old plates are usually their very own treasure which they had when they bought their first car.</p>
              <p>Either that or that it was passed down by wealthy merchants in the past to the next generation and it goes on.</p>
              <p>A fact - the older the number plate, it will appreciate in value and many such owners would not want to let these number plates be transferred despite the high intangible valuation given.</p>
              <p>The older the number plate, (numbers that are affixed to these rare series) and which are on the road are typically bidded numbers and it customary showcases and reflect's the owners's accomplishments.</p>
              <p>Take for example, I've got a a neighbour around 3-4 houses away which have so called established a tradition - they own an entire fleet of mercedes benzes marques which all carry the identical numbers, with the S and E series. It's more towards a status symbol and sense of identity among their entire family.</p>
              <p>Number plates which are on sale in the market bearing these rare affixes are usually not bidded numbers and are demanded by buyers who just want an old number plate.</p>
              <p>Well, as for my dad, we've had a few enquires before but of course - it's not for sale! Most probably it's going to be passed down to my sis. It also has had a fare share of being in the top three prizes of 4D Draw. 3293:)</p>
              <p>For my car number, probability that it will never come out is extremely high - given the 3 factorials of "2" in it. (I've never stepped into a 4D outlet and never will - coffer donations to me! :P)</p>
              <p>Hope it has helped you in gathering some information for your project study!</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info. It's actually really interesting that these old license plates are owned by the established people of society because it really is so rare. I'm very curious to find out what happened to these old license plates... who owns them and why they would die die not sell it of to anyone for any price.</p>
              <p>Does a number 1 plate even exist? I don't suppose anyone would know who owns it right? But it would be really interesting to find out who is sitting on such a antique item. Just a thought. :) </p>

              <p>because such plates are rare, of course people would not want to sell them. But depends.... some people might, though, if the quoted price is high enough. But how high is high? Well.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>I asked my dad yday, his plate was bought &lt; 1980</p>

              <p>Heys Lorry, sorry I should have been more specific.</p>
              <p>What I meant by I think it would be interesting to find out "why they would die die not sell" their plates is that sometimes, some families have interesting antidotes to share. For example, one family collects the number 10 (just an example) license plate in every series because that number is important to the family because the grandfather's feng shui master said it was a prosperous number for the family. </p>

              <p>The next closest would be the owner of EA 5 Y aka the acronym EASY of a Olive Green Lexus LS460. (This guy frequents the Guan Yin Hood Cho temple at Bugis so you might want to spot him there on Sundays)</p>

              <p>Part of your explanation makes sense. However, these car plates are no longer entitled to the rich/famous in Singapore. It is easily accessible to anyone/everyone.</p>
              <p>One point to note TS, is that be prepared to face any future implications if you are to carry on the number</p>
