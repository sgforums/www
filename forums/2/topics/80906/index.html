Makes the owner "a man"?<br><br>You got to be fucking kidding me.<br><br>Today's F1 cars are tricked out with electronics, traction control etc and they are much faster than F1 of 40 years ago. They sure are much easier to drive, but they're also safer, at the same time. It can be verified that the current F1 drivers experience higher G forces than ever. Does that mean that we should ignore the achievements of the drivers in the past? I sure don't think so.</div>

In fact I feel that today's drivers are better, skillwise, and possibly in terms of physical fitness as well. The reason is that although technology has improved to allow average drivers to be better, it has also allowed good drivers to be legendary which is simply not possible with older technology. In other words, technology has raised the bar and on the whole, everyone is improving.<br><br>In the 1920s, it's not possible for a combat airplane to pull 9Gs because the airframe will simply come apart. Later on with the advent of better material engineering the plane can do 15Gs but the pilot will probably die first.<br><br>So, in that sense, if you apply it to motorsports, it's similar.

In fact I feel that today's drivers are better, skillwise, and possibly in terms of physical fitness as well. The reason is that although technology has improved to allow average drivers to be better, it has also allowed good drivers to be legendary which is simply not possible with older technology.
