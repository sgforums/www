There is an automatic mode where the traction control is left to the computer.

I've always thought of Evo's as being harder edged than Scoobs and therefore quicker. The battle has been going on for ages and Evos had tended to win. Unless you were going to use a T25, which isn't a real production model, then I think it would be a lot closer. Got to say that the WR1 really didn't look good on some of those corners. The understeer was looking terminal! The Evo looked very composed, although it too was suffering from understeer at times.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by brisance:</div><div class="quote_body">DCCD is Driver Controlled Center Differential, a feature exclusive to STi. It allows the driver to control the power distribution between the front and rear wheels. i.e. it's possible to direct more torque to the rear wheels and have the car behave more like a FR instead of an AWD. There is an automatic mode where the traction control is left to the computer. Technically speaking this system is more difficult to implement than the SAYC on the Evo since the latter only controls how long before the center differential opens. In other words, the STi has even more electronic assistance than the Evo.<br><br>Another example is AVCS, which is a Subaru-developed variable valve timing. The 4G63 engine in Evos do not have any variable valve timing.<br><br>Yet another example is the USDM STi which uses electronic DBW throttle. The list goes on.<br><br>So... to your friend who says Evo drivers can't drive due to electronic assistance, please go back and educate him. I would be very interested to know what's his excuse for back pedaling.</div></blockquote>Hi. I think the DCCD concept/system was introduced by Audi in thier WRC Quattros. except that i dun think it is auto, the driver need to adjust it .still damn cool in those day..Audi actualli came up wz lotsa stuff that Subaru/Mit claiming big time. Anyhow, .having electronic aides/gadgets is one ting,u still need to know how they work to fully utilised them. I think it's a bit quik OFF the mouth to say EVO/REX/OPC drivers are "char bor's ".u can't generalise. Although the publicty of these brands are trying to  say their  High performance cars are so easy to drive ,even ladies can drive them!<br>But then again..some ladies can drive competitively too!</div>

But since we're on this topic, 4WD systems have been in existence since at least the early 1900s, so I don't think you can claim that Audi invented it either. One particular example: GM's Jeep that was used extensively in WW2.<br><br>What I said was that DCCD was an STi-specific implementation.
