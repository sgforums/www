            <div class='col-md body'>The original thread starter is wrong in the sense that it's possible for a modded car to beat a stock car, I'm not disputing that. But if we're comparing stock to stock, which is what he's alluding to, then it's highly unlikely. That's all I'm saying.<br><br>So bringing in a 2'32" EG6 as an "example" of "beating Evos/WRXs/GT3s" etc is off-topic. Cos it's not news for modded Evos/WRXs/GT3 to be in the 2'30" timing. Hell a stock GT3 can be under 2'30" if driven wel.<br><br>As for the thread starter, don't look down on other car makes. Just because you drive an Evo, doesn't necessarily make you a better person, or means you're the best driver on the planet. I've seen many heavily modded cars running slower than stock on the track.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

I chose a MODDED civic because I overheard ppl saying my stock evo is lousy compared to his civic. Sorry if I offended anyone. </div></blockquote>This is what I mean... it's totally meaningless to compare stock vs modded vehicles. Can a modded Civic beat a stock Evo? Of course. Hell I can take a COE car and mod it to beat a Ferrari if I'm sufficiently motivated/have enough money to do so. Does it make the Ferrari the lousy car? Of course not!</div>
