Keep the car.. the B16A4 is realy good.  For a 1.6l, it's got a lot of punch.  Hell, it's even got enough punch for a 1.8 or 2lit.  Forget that i-Vtec stuff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advise is, keep the SiR. Unless you are going to consider a more powerful car, like the Type R or something. Or, the least you can settle on is the Vti-S manual, which had reasonable power, but can't compare with SiR.<br><br>Yup, its a pity that SiR is no longer in production, and I would gladly like to own one as well (Manual one), even if its 2nd hand. But then, its just too expensive and not worth it.<br><br>If my memory never fails me, the SiR manual should have 170bhp and the auto 155bhp.</div>

Kind of took it for granted.<br><br>Been having this dilema about whether to change or not mainly because the price of car is low and my Honda is going to depreciate faster once it hits beyond 5 years.<br><br>As for budget, should be able to afford to change to a $80-90k+ vehicle because the current car still has some value. Did see some postings about the Honda Euro-R but think it should be very expensive and only has manual version. And as for Integra, think there are many versions around. Quite confused over the various types (R? S?). Then recently read that Honda should be coming out with a new Honda Civic in 2005 or 2006. So many factors... *confused*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
