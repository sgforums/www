A Del Sol is 2 seater, 2WD sporty car from a pretty reliable manufacturer. In the US, it is something a father would buy for their daughter when they graduate from high school so that they can look good cruising down the boulevard. How is that the same target segment as an Evo? I'm NOT saying you can't make a Del Sol a drag monster that pulls 9s in the quarter, but that's not my point.<br><br><blockquote><strong>A target segment is not the same as a group of people who did research into something.</strong></blockquote>I would expect the target segment i.e. automotive enthusiasts, to be more well-informed than the average Joe who cares only about whether any particular product which has been recalled, insofar that if said person is truly an enthusiast, he would find out within mere minutes (i.e. research) if a Lancer and an Evo are the same thing.<br><br><blockquote><strong>That problem wihich caused the Evo6 to be recalled was rectified with the second release.

Don't go around thinking that the 2% you know about cars are everything.</strong></blockquote>No one claimed to know everything, so don't even try putting words in my mouth.<br><br>To my knowledge, there have been 3 major recalls for Evos, one affecting the AYC system for Evo IV through VI, an O2 sensor recall for Evos I through 7, and the other affecting the gear shift selection mechanism affecting only Evo 8. In the US, there has been a few recalls where several cars were affected by paint and weight label, minor issues. Nothing major like crankwalk in the DSMs.</div>

I'm NOT saying you can't make a Del Sol a drag monster that pulls 9s in the quarter, but that's not my point.<br></strong></blockquote>Then what exaclty is your point?  Is it what's mentioned above?

Even in the performance car segment, there are different classes. In your own mind maybe you believe your Del Sol is in the same performance segment as an Enzo, but I sure don't think an Evo is in the same category.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Then what exaclty is your point?

How was that smug and arrogant?</div>
