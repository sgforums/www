            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by PuB_Evo:<br><strong>Hi there people, I would like to hold a discussion about the [b]Mitsubishi Evolution.</strong><br>Well i personally like the Evo 6 alot followed by the Evo 8. I have got the intention to get an Evo 6 as well. I need more info on these cars. Please feel free to post ur comments &amp; views about the pros &amp; cons... etc etc here. Thanks [/b]</blockquote>Speaking as a new Evo owner here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>From what I know, the older Evos (I-VI) were based on the original smaller Lancer cars in Japan. For VII and VIII and MR, Mitsubishi switched to the larger Cedia class (but also called Lancer here) as the basis.<br><br>A lot of Evo purists don't like the Cedia based cars, but in all honesty, I don't think they are being objective. Sure, the VIIs and VIIIs are heavier cars, but Mitsubishi has also been tweaking the engine and the handling with each generation, and the newer cars drive faster, turns faster and handles incredibly well. Admittedly, the older Evos are also much more raw cars (Brisance calls it visceral <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">) in their delivery. The newer Evos are tamer, relatively, but no one would call them pussy cats either.<br><br>Look-wise is a more subjective issue. You may prefer the bulging lines of the older VIs with protruding frog, I mean fog lights <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Personally, I prefer the more discreet foglights embedded in the headlight cluster of the current Evos.<br><br>The major problem with the VIs and older Evos in Singapore are that they were registered in the old PARF schemes and the paper value of these cars are just incredibly high, that it makes it hard for new buyers NOT to make the financially logical choice to buy a new Evo instead. This is why most older Evos are scrapped or exported. Such a shame. Just learnt today that one of the Tommi Makinen Edition (TME aka Evo 6.5s) would be exported soon. This, contrary to what some of the posters suggest, is not because the cars are unreliable. Heck, you see Mercedes and BMWs of that vintage regularly scrapped too for the same reasons.<br><br>In the UK, VIs and esp the TMEs are still very much sought after, as they should be. They are much lighter, and there are many aftermarket modifications that should beef up the engine to more than match the newer incarnations of the 4G63 engine.<br><br>Driving Experience<br>This is something that IMHO is why Evo owners love their cars so much.<br><br>It isn't just performance per se. Though the extra punch from the engine does deliver oodles of torque in the low end, helping you make the gap from thought to action very very VERY quickly.<br><br>It isn't just the very quick steering rack. Though that helps too in getting the car to head exactly where you want to go.<br><br>But it is in the way everything comes together. The way the car handles. The surefootness in taking corners. Always, always exhilarating. There is a connection between the driver and the car, as if the car can read the driver's mind and go exactly where the driver wants to go.<br><br>I guess this is where most of the criticisms are usually levelled about the Evo. Some other car owners find the electronics like AYC and ACD intrusive.<br><br>Yes, admittedly, the AYC and ACD computers are incredibly sophisticated, but underlying them are principles on which mechanical systems like LSDs and even DCCD are based on. The AYC and ACD just puts computer smarts behind them to make them work more effectively. In combination, the cornering abilities of the Evo often invite comments like breaking the laws of physics, since it feels the car has unbelievable amounts of grip.<br><br>As a daily car, the MR is an incredible joy to drive. The stock clutch action is light, and even start-stop peak hour traffic can't rob you of the joy of driving the car. Suspension is a little stiffer than a regular sedan, but the MR's Bilsteins are already far softer at low speeds than the earlier VIIs and VIIIs. But take a fast corner and the suspension holds with nary a roll.<br><br>Are there faster cars than the Evo at the end of the day? No doubt about it. Better handling? Of course. But as a total package taking into consideration price, performance and handling, it is an unbelievable steal! You'd be hard pressed to find cars in this class (*hint* Spec C*hint*)<br><br>WRC Lancer<br>There are a few misconceptions about Mitsubishi's rally racing versions.<br><br>There is a Group N category which is where Mitsubishi has competed traditionally with the Evo cars. And Evos continue to be leading the pack in this category.<br><br>In more recent years, WRC has a new World Rally Car category, which I understand, requires a larger base of homologation production cars. The Evo unfortunately only has a production run of about 3000 cars or so and doesn't qualify. So the new WRC car is actually based off a Lancer. Just check out the rear light clusters. Those more discerning can easily tell it is based off the regular Lancer. Of course, this WRC car still borrows some components off the Evo and a lot of the parts are still custom-built specifically for the WRC and not found in either the Evos or road-going Lancers.<br><br>As for the recalls, if you read most recall notices, they are very specific to a model of a car. For instance, there was a Ford Focus recall that only affected the 2.0l SVT in the US, but not the 1.6l variants, etc. So a recall involving the regular Lancer doesn't automatically apply to Evos, or for that matter ALL Lancers either.<br><br>Running Costs<br>Are there any downsides to owning the Evo? Sadly yes.<br><br>First, the turbocharged engine does drink a lot of fuel to get that power. If you are comparing it to a regular Japanese 1.6l saloon, you are going to be horribly disappointed. And if you are heavy footed like me, prepare to be heading to the pumps regularly. But if you are used to some 2.4l MPV class machines, then the Evo consumption is surprisingly comparable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Secondly, the insurance for this class of machine is HEAVY!! Only slightly lower than an Integra Type R for the same driver, I believe.<br><br>And of course, there is a perpetual worry that you may lose all your Driver Improvement Points (us mortals know it by the more worrying DEMERIT Points) on your licence when driving exuberantly. It doesn't take a lot for the Evo to break the speed limits here.<br><br>Just my two cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
