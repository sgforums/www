              <p>sorry. i'm a newbie car owner. Can someone please explain to me the different grades of engine oil and their comparision? eg. 5w30, 5w40...</p>
              <p>I read on mycarforum that a mechanic in thomson charges oil change labour for $15 only. includes basic fluids topup and air-con filter cleaning. Just bring your own oil and oil filter.. in recession times like this... must save... haha :)<br><br>I'm driving a Honda Crossroad.. so which grade of engine oil is more suitable? Thanks! :)</p>

              <p>Most places charge at $10 for labour if you bring your own oil n filter.</p>
              <p>Basic fluids like wiper water, battery water, brake fluids etc you can also top up yourself</p>
              <p>And a Xroad is still quite new on roads, so I don't think you need to top up batt water, brake fluids, radiator etc ..</p>
              <p>The <a title="Society of Automotive Engineers" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Society_of_Automotive_Engineers"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Society of Automotive Engineers</span></span></a>, usually abbreviated as SAE, has established a numerical code system for grading motor oils according to their <a title="Viscosity" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Viscosity#Kinematic_viscosity:_.CE.BD"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">kinematic viscosity</span></span></a>. SAE viscosity gradings include the following: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 or 60. Some of the numbers can be suffixed with the letter W, designating their "winter" or cold-start viscosity, at lower temperature.<br>Viscosity is graded by measuring the time it takes for a standard amount of oil to flow through a standard orifice, at standard temperature. The longer it takes, the higher the viscosity, and thus higher SAE code.</p>
              <p>Note that the SAE operate a separate viscosity rating system for transmission oils which should not be confused with engine oil viscosity. The higher numbers of a transmission oil (eg 75W-140) do not mean that it is necessarily higher viscosity than an engine oil.</p>

              <p> I read today sunday time they do teach us DIY(HOW TO CHNAGE ENGINE OIL)</p>
              <p>Ypu should change your car's motor engine oil and oil filter every 5,000KM or every 3 mths..Getting a mechanic to do it would cost $60-$200, so leran to do it yourself...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What to do:</p>
              <p>1)Locate the oil drain plug under your car.</p>
              <p>   Place a container under the plug to collect old engine oil.</p>
              <p>2)TURN PLUG COUNTER-CLOCKWISE WITH A WRENCH TO REMOVE IT.</p>
              <p>   Be ready to grab the plug as it comes loose.</p>
              <p>3)Allow the oil to drain completely into the container.Check the sealing washer on the plug before re-installing it.If thw washer is worn or broken, get a new one.</p>
              <p>3)Remove the cap from oil the oil filter hole at the top of your engine.This is</p>
              <p>  usually located around the oil pan of the engine.Unscrew the oil filter by turning it   counter-clockwise with large locking wrench.</p>
              <p>After remove the oil filter, empty the oil into oil drain and container.Always wear protection glove and eye wear.</p>
              <p>4)Open a new bottle of motor oil.With your finger, apply a thin layer of oil on the new filter's gasket.Install the new filter by turning it clockwise with both hand, until tight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5)Add engine oil (above)to the oil fill port which is usually located on the valve corner of</p>
              <p>   the engine.Most car and light truck will require 4 - 5 quarts of motor oil.</p>
              <p>6)To check the engine oil level, replace the fill cap and let the engine run for one minutes, then turn it off and let the car stand for 2 minutes.</p>
              <p>7)REmove the oil dipstick level indicator to inspect the oil level.Make sure the oil level is between the specified lines on the indicator or add as needed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8)USED engine oil is classified as a toxic industrial waste under the environmemental public health regualtions and must be taken to licensed industrial waste collectors for proper recycling or disposal</p>
              <p>.Check the list of licensed toxic on NEA websites :</p>

In winter weather, the respective ow,5w and 10w flow accordingly when the engine warms up. It is important that one must understand the numerical values given to these various weight oils are strictly empirical numbers. Ex, 0W doesn't mean that the oil has no weight. </span></p>

Viscosity is a measure of the oil's flow characteristics at certain temperatures.

The lower this number, the more easily the oil will help your engine to start in cold weather. <br><br><span style="color: blue;">But bear in mind Singapore is so hot, so </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">" W "</span></span><span style="color: blue;"> is not important.
