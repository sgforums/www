              <p>But if your loan is below 5 years, u can still afford to change to another car, <em>at the expense of depreciation of course</em>, should you feel unsatisfied with your current Picanto....</p>
              <p>If your loan is above 5 years, better to stick with it....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>u may not able to get the full 17k rebate. the 17k is use to offset ARF and coe. assuming the picanto ARF is 7k and coe is 6k, thus the total rebate u will get is 13k.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the price is 37k, then the opc picanto will be 24k.</p>

              In singapore, no one will drive a car for ten years. It's a constant pressure with all those new models out everyday.
              
              And based on LTA's scrap laws....it's more advisable to scrap before the 5th year is due. And there u go, every car owner is bound to pay back more money to the bank 'cos they scrap early.
