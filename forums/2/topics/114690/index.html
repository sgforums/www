The first owner had suffered the frist drops for you, meaning the super drop in value the moment you get the new car.<br><br>As for monthly, 300 will be for road tax, season parking and petrol. Are you including your insurance? Which so, another 100-200(young drivers). Meaning you installment for car will goes about 300-400. You will need to take the full loan period for new car not exceeding 41k. Since it is OPC, add 17k, you have 58k budget for a car. Get a car magazine, circle those car that you can afford. Then study them. I guess looks should filter quite a quite away. Take your time and slowly work things out, it can be fun.</div>
