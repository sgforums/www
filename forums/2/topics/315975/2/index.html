              <p>Why would any lawyer representing the victim comment on the accident objectively? If 1 is entirely responsible for the entire accident, why is 3 (who suffered severe injuries and trauma), made to pay 50% of the damage? <br><br>Why isn’t anyone here bashing the judge for an unfair sentence?<br><br>And 1 said he decided to pay the $200 out of convenience even though he does not believe that he should be responsible for the accident. <br><br>So much emotions here, have you been in an accident? Would you contest the claim or close your own case at $200? What was he supposed to say? Volunteer to cover medical fees incurred by the victim? Volunteer a jail term and commit to the press saying he is completely responsible?<br><br>What’s so bad about voicing genuine thoughts for a change? <br><br>So 2 extended his sympathies and proceeds to sue 3 anyway but everyone here is caught up hurling the idiot word at only 1 person. Monkey see monkey do?</p>
              <p>Only 2 other forumers here are asking questions and giving things a thought. Why isn’t 2 suing 1? Why isn’t 3 suing 1?<br><br>Give me a break. Between both, who is the one with short end of the stick here?</p>
              <p>1 who stopped his car on the right lane, commits an offence, gets away with 9 demerit points, $200 fine and 50% damage? Or 3, who travelled on a right lane, got flung off, hit a rear windscreen, land on the floor, broke a pelvic bone and is made to account for the same amount of damage as 1? If traffic was indeed fast moving that moment, why didn't any car run over 3 when she landed on the ground?</p>

              <p>No offense kentheman, don't mind if I ask, if the bike braking distance is definately longer than a car, then why would any motorcyclist want to take the risk of travelling on the extreme right lane, where the speeds are definately higher than lanes 2 or 3?

              <p><br>because to be on a bike on lane 2 &amp; 3 is very slow unless you wanna be with the vans/lorries on lanes 2/3 going at 60 or 70km/h.<br><br>miss tiong is riding a honda super 4(correct me if i'm wrong), a bike in the 2A Class. such a bike can out-accelerate any normal 1.6L car.<br><br>moreover, we have already learnt in our basic theory(oh, this mr lim took his 25+ years ago, if there was such a test then) that we are not allowed to stop on the expressway(were expressways built 25+years ago?) unless in an emergency(which a lot of drivers do not follow, particularly mr lim).<br><br>i dont get it why mr lim cant just go thru the erp gantry and pay the $10. he can just blame it on his stupidity for the day and sleep over it. but no, he decides to brake to a stop. he should be given a harsher penalty.<br><br>with the numerous warnings on signboards and the EMAS system informing motorists of an ERP gantry ahead, why couldnt Mr Lim insert his bloody cashcard earlier on?</p>

              <p>This is precisely the reason most motocyclists straddle between 2 lanes. They attempt to travel between other four-wheeled vehicles hoping to stay within range of the side mirrors of the car in front. Class 2A bike or not, having a vehicle come to a complete stop in front of you is a potentially lethal situation. The bad thing about straddling 2 lanes is the blindspot issue. Either way drivers should be more aware of our two-wheeled counterparts.</p>
              <p>I agree that the fool should have gotten a stiffer penalty. You don't jolly well stop on a highway, unless you're trying to avoid an accident. That idiot is a self-centered bastard... excuse my French. Forgetting to insert his cashcard is an <strong>excuse</strong> but not a good enough <strong>reason. </strong>I for one think he should be strung up and made an example of... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

              <p>I heard this on radio a few days ago. A caller gave an analogy which I felt was quite interesting. He said lets say if you urgently need to pee, do you just stop halfway in the middle of public and pull your pants down to relieve yourself? The same logic in the dick head that suddenly stop to put his cashcard in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem here is at the root. Many Sg drivers have rubbish driving attitudes. They wouldn't survive driving for 1 day in many other countries I can tell you. The bum said he has 24 years driving experience. Sometime I hate those unreasonable older drivers saying that I have been driving before you were born etc. Bloody hell, that means you have been terrorising the roads for more than 20 years. To these people, all I can say is that if you want to get yourself killed, go ahead, the world would be a much better place without you. But in that process, do not implicate innocent people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry I digressed from the main topic. And yes, I have only 3 years driving experience. But I feel its not how long you've driven, but how well can you drive.</p>

              <p>Keeping a safe distance using 2 or 3 second rule is not going to guarantee adequate braking room all the time. Conditions vary from time to time. To gauge and maintain the right safety distance relative to traveling speed is a pain in the ass. If and when you do, somtimes you end up road hogging. It really is a no win situation. It's not the habit of most drivers to adhere to this practice.</p>
              <p>Why was the motorcyclist traveling on the extreme right lane? Braddell exit should be a two lane exit.</p>
              <p>How come the 2nd car immediately behind 1st car managed to stop in time without bumping into its rear but the motorcyclist third in row slammed so badly into second car?</p>
              <p>Were there safety distance, delayed reaction and speed control issues?</p>
              <p>What are the chances of any driver doing a jam brake on an extreme right lane? </p>
              <p>He probably switched on hazard lights and came to a halt within a matter of seconds. If second driver stopped his car and didn't sustain minor injuries but the motorcyclist behind him got flung and landed 20m away, who was the one speeding? Pardon me but it's common sight for young motorcyclists to travel at high speed, weaving in and out of traffic, take on extreme right lane even when they are clearly not supposed to.</p>
              <p>In the first place, the headline for this article is one sided and very misleading. It could've been Motorist charged for traffic offence approaching ERP gantry. But hey it's TNP afterall. Tabloid paper.</p>
              <p>To be honest, if I were in his shoes, I would have adopted the same views and attitude. If he were sobbing in court, readers would have that action as tears of guilt. It's a real no win situation.</p>
