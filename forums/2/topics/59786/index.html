            <div class='col-md body'>The worst thing is that I didn't receive any mails or anything. Absolutely nothing. Its been half a yr or more since the 1st offence. If I did, would have cleared the summons long ago.<br><br>If not for my brother, I'll still take it that there are no summons for me, as been told by the website. Imagine the shock I'm in for when I drive into JB next time!</div>
