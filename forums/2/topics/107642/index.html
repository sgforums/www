            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately, the airline is not 100% perfect. This issue needs to be seriously addressed. First, letÂ’s start with the cons of the trip:<br><br>Singapore Airlines Pte Limited was not perfect on my flights<br><br>The seats on Megatop 747s need to be revamped. It is unacceptable to have differing seats to those on the new Jubilee ERs.<br><br>The toilets on the Megatop 747s need to be revamped. It is unacceptable to have different toilet configurations and styles to those on the new Jubilee ERs.<br><br>Aviance staff at London Heathrow need to be issued with neutral-appearance pens or pens with Singapore Airlines insignia when checking-in Singapore Airlines passengers at least. I recommend such pens being used to check in any passenger<br><br>Singapore Airlines should take care of passengersÂ’ wishes on the ground. Specifically, if a booking is not to be amended by the airline itself or a third-party, the passenger should have that right and that right be enforced.<br><br>The safety video is out of date, cheesy and the part where they show the emergency exits and positions is unprofessional. This must be replaced.<br><br>The amenity kit in Economy Class is unimpressive. The plastic wallet is shabby compared to the airline experience and the style of amenities has not changed. This shows lack of adaptability and if one does not adapt, one will be assimilated. The toothpaste needs to be improved to normal high-quality retail outlet standard. The colour of these amenities should match the colour of Economy Class Â– the advertised purple. The socks are of poor quality and need to be redesigned. In addition, there is no eye mask (though it is a bit understandable as youÂ’re in the dark when sleep time comes around). In essence, the whole thing needs to be replaced.<br><br>Singapore Airlines have a habit of pouring portions of beverage into those little plastic cups and smaller wine glasses. This is unacceptable and can convey a sense of over-dependence on Singapore Girls and/or stinginess. This needs to be rectified Â– specifically in the case of cans where the sharing of cans seems unprofessional and again, depicts stinginess and the passengers will be thirsty.<br><br>The sanitary napkins / towels have not changed as have not the covers that contain them. The sanitary napkin has developed since the 1990s at least and Singapore Airlines must provide higher quality amenities of this sort to female and intrigued passengers. Such a simple design simply does not cut it in this area<br><br>Duty-free shopping must be conducted more slowly and with more grace and charm. Calling out, Â“duty-free anyone, duty free?Â” is unacceptable. This must not happen.<br><br>Flight stewardess DPK failed to say, Â“Thank youÂ”, to every passenger when collecting hot towels on board SQ317 on 14 December 2002.<br><br>The supervisor at Tan Son Nhat International Airport representing Singapore Airlines did not smile back at me. He was racist towards his own people and is a scar on the Singapore Airlines Group. He is to be Â“releasedÂ” from the airline and given a negative reference. We do not have time or money to waste on such people. I am not impressed at his lack of courtesy.<br><br>Though Tan Son Nhat International Airport Ground Services staff do not wear Singapore Airlines uniform, they represent the airline at check-in. These staff are to be retrained if Singapore Airlines continues to use them. They are cold and do not smile. They do not portray the ethos of the airline. They anger me.<br><br>Flight stewardess LSL did not smile when delivering me by beverage of Coca Cola on flight SQ/SQF/VN173 on 13 January 2003.<br><br>It is not acceptable for passengers who do not know of all Singapore Airlines products and services and are not knowledgeable in this area of intelligence to have to ask to see the second bottle of red wine. If there is a choice, it should be openly-made available. Hiding the other bottle and hoping people do not notice is not the way.<br><br>Singapore Airlines in general need to improve upon the quality of bread at all airports. Bread should be soft on arrival on the passengerÂ’s tray and not easily-broken, hard or crumbly.<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ KrisWorld system is confusing to operate for people that skipped the instruction video of how to use the system. A button on the KrisWorld start screen should allow passengers to re-visit the video<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ KrisWorld systemÂ’s instructional video should be in parts and contain parts to all of KrisWorld and WISEMAN. These include, how to select video and audio, how to navigate to games, how to view FlightPath, how to navigate to multiplayer games and more recently, how to use the in-seat SMS / e-mail features.<br><br>Singapore AirlinesÂ’ comment forms distributable on board the aircraft need to be enhanced appearance-wise. These are currently bland and do not exude a feeling of warmth that should come with any compliment or complaint received.<br><br>Sanitary napkin absorbency test:<br><br>Tested were the Singapore AirlinesÂ’ sanitary napkin and the Kotex brand sanitary napkin provided by Vietnam Airlines.<br><br>The Singapore AirlinesÂ’ sanitary napkin absorbed 0.25 pints / 118.25ml of water. The Kotex brand Vietnam Airlines sanitary napkin absorbed 0.3125 pints / 147.81ml of water. Hence, the Singapore Airlines sanitary napkin has failed against its competitor. It should also be noted the inflexibility and lack of wings on the former napkin compared to the latter.<br><br>So here after a total of 36 pages in Microsoft Word, editing time of 2001 minutes, 302 paragraphs and 15890 words, you have come to the conclusion of my trip report!<br><br></div>
