              <p>With reference to my previous thread, I've said that i've decided on a manual lancer 1.6 glx. My dad have given me the budget of 40k to get a secondhand car of my choice. I've done a search on sgcarmart for manual cars within my budget and most of the cars i got are between lancer glx and impreza 1.6 and I quite fancy the impreza as well. So I would like some enlightment on which car I should go for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would like to enquire on these factors of comparision.</p>
              <p>1) FC (read on some magazine that impreza 1.6 actually runs at 13.3km/h, how true is this?</p>
              <p>2) Horsepower/pick up speed</p>
              <p>3) Interior space for drivers and passengers</p>
              <p>4) Cost of maintanence.</p>
              <p>5) Comments on the engines used</p>
              <p>6) How zhg-able are they, cause I plan to mod here and there, legally thought :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any inputs will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! (:</p>

              <p>Hmmm. I think 13.3km/l is magical number that is quite difficult to achieve on impreza. I get only ave of 10.5km/l. The best was 11+km/l. Pick up wise, the car don't have much power. Its pick up is slow. Even lose to a picanto. =) The back seat for the back passengers is quite cramp. Not really very spacious though.And one more thing, insurance for subaru is quite high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can only comment on impreza. =) Maybe other owners can comment on their ride.</p>

              <p>The 'strip' on the rear axle, I think only applies to the STi, the WRX and TS don't have that feature, IIRC.</p>
              <p>Actually the simplest way to differentiate a TS and a Rex is to see the road tax disc <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But yes, the stability of the TS is more or less undisputed, because of the SAWD drivetrain.</p>

              <p>It actually very much depends on what you are looking at. I had
              the same delima like you when I was deciding to get a  car and
              was considering lancer and TS. I then went to rent with a company
              and try it out.(comapring stock to stock)<br> <br> 1) Handling + Speed.<br> <br> 2) Maintainence + FC<br>  <br> 3) Overall outlook.<br> <br> 1a) Speed + Handling.<br> <br> Lancer- Lancer will start "floating" when it hits 150km/hr mark.
              Handling really poor in the context of higher speed. Was doing
              160km/hr on a slight bend, it feels as if the car will flip
              anytime. Top speed 170-185km/hr without passengers.<br> <br> TS- TS will not float even when it is at it's top speed. It's very
              glued to the ground. Handling is awesome in the contect of higher
              speed. Was doing 160km/hr on the same slight bend, it feels very
              much rooted to the ground. Top speed 170-180/hr without passengers.
              However, Ts is a 4wd, thus explaining in the loss of power. Pickup
              is not as fast as Lancer, but not too far away as far as
              transmission is concern (MT). If it was AT vs AT, I think TS will
              lose out slightly.<br> <br> 2a) 2nd hand TS- As we all know, Ts is labelled for the "ah-beng"
              car for a reason. People esp bengs don't really know how to
              maintain the car after they loot them. After a track session, there
              are many things to do to recover your ride. Similarly after a race
              at AYE, there are many things to maintain so that the car wont be
              hurt. Sad thing is these beng only know how to loot and not
              maintaining. So when buying a 2nd hand subaru esp those MT ones,
              you have to be ready for a lumpsome of bucks. FC is real bad, the
              best my TS did was 9km/L for the way I drive.<br> <br> 2nd hand Lancer- Lancer GLX is also known to be the bengs car esp
              to the malays. In my opinion, compared to TS lancer will have less
              maintainance because it is less looted. But no still its 50/50%
              chance. Not like buying a toyota altis which will not be loot. FC
              for lancer is way better , achieve 11km/L for the way I
              drive.<br> <br> 3a) Overall outlook for Lancer- Lancer will always be a lancer. No
              matter how hard we try t o mod it, one look others can tell it's a
              lancer. It will be way far away from a evo look. Instead you will
              get named "poser." If talking about engine swapping etc of high
              performance modification, lancer chasis will not be able to take
              it.<br> <br> Overall outlook for TS- TS can be a WRX. Simple modification of
              changing to sports rims, hooded bonet,exos and a WRX label at
              the boot will transform your TS to a WRX. There is only 1 way to
              find out by the outlook which is the axle that holds your back
              wheel together weather if there is strip or not.(for those who know
              how to differentiate from outside) If talking about engine swapping
              etc of high performance modification, TS chasis will definitely be
              able to take it. I'm already driving one of bhp near 400.<br> <br> It's what you want. If you want a high profile, a TS will make
              it.<br> <br> If you want budget yet sporty, a stock lancer will be good
              enough.<br> <br> I've posted my car's spec back then in this forum, if you would
              like to try how it feels for a transformed TS, can ask me out for
              kopi (:</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>just puzzled.</p>
              <p>I tot jap cars "floats' due to  them being lighter and hence the need for spoilers and etc to help "push" the cars down. hence the better fuel consumptions as compared to heavier european cars.</p>
              <p>Is this "floating" related to AWD or etc? I tot that's only down to cornering or turning cause in a straight line, with or wo AWD is not a big factor?</p>
              <p>Hoping to clear my confusion, thanks for enlighting.</p>
