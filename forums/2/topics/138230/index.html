            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I'm interested in this question as well. My car hasn't been sent for servicing for quite awhile and based on what I've heard so far, car servicing quality in JB isn't much different than when done here. It's much cheaper even. Anyone has recommendations of workshops I could check out in JB? Pls include directions as well.<br><br>Thanks,<br>moddie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i go to Jb for my services...There is this place called permas jaya...<br>It's like a whole congregation of car workshops there.. Yes the price there is almost half.<br>A fully syntetic oil change cost m3 only RM$138...<br>Plus what makes me like most about going in there is that the mechanics there are much more honest when u ask them for their comments...they really try their best to explain their recommendations...and they don't try to exploit your ignorance even if u'r a first time owner and domn't know much about cars.<br>My friend bought a 2nd hand car ...went to check his car in S'pore and was told by a SXXXXXXX tyres co. workshop that he must change the car brake pads...but i brought him to my workshop in JB..the mechanics went to the trouble of comparing a brand new pad to his and showed us that they can at least be used for another 20000km.<br>Also.... i feel the human warmth there ...not everything is mearsured in dollars and cents...when u ask them to check for certain things or change accessories...they will do it and just a drink or a cigi is all u need to show gratitude...<br><br>Not claiming all of them are so nice...got to know mine through friends recommendation too...just could be my good luck.<br><br>On the whole..don't like singapores workshop...feel that they are out to slaughter....i try to go jb for all my car related matters..unlkess it's emergency..<br><br>BTW...a car wash in JB cost RM8 and it INCLUDES a manual shampoo wash  ,tyre shine and vacuum too!   SIngapore car wash how to mcompare?</div>
