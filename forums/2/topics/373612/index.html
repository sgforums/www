              <p>This morning, I was driving along AYE in peak hours. As you know, peak hours, the traffic as usual was heavy, cars occupied all lanes and moving slowly,  50/60 km/hr at most. Under such heavy traffic, lane 1(rightmost lane) is no longer meant for faster cars or for over-taking.All lanes would be fully occupied.</p>
              <p>I was driving in the 1st lane, closely following a long chain of cars infront of me. Up came a very impatient guy, he was pratcially tailgating me (driving at a distance that almost kissing the back of my car). For close to 5 mins, he was doing it. I know he was impatient, and wanting me to change lane so that he could move ahead. But please, all lanes were equally jammed (Under normal traffic,  if I'm slow, I'll , of course, I'll move to the left/middle lane to allow "you", the faster car to move on). He tried to switch to the left lane once, but couldn't get any faster (as the traffic was heavy), so squeezed himself adruptly back and then then honked at me. I couldn't do much at the situation but to ignore him. Come on, this was peak hour heavy traffic, nobody was road-hogging. Finally, he had a chance to move to the middle lane, and immediately, dangerously and adruptly cut in front of me. I let him. Cos' it just another nut case, no point getting worked-up. But he was again stuck with the car (that was previously just b4 me) but now infront of him.Again, he followed the car closely and sounded the honk. Not sure, how many more time he would do it to all the cars infront.</p>
              <p>I guess he must be hopping mad at everybody, but really thiis is not his grandfather's road. Just damn impatient, and wanting everybody's to give way to him. </p>
              <p>Not sure, what you guys feel about such a situation.</p>

              <p><br>U got 3 options</p>
              <p>1- Jam yr brake. If he kiss yr ass. U are in no wrong, cos he tailgate u and in driving, anybody hit from back is always wrong.</p>
              <p>2- Road hog him and teach him the lessons. Step up accelerator and block him. If he manage to overtake  and stare/hurl abuse at u, show him the finger.</p>
              <p>3- remember his car number. If u manage to spot it next time. Scratch his car with words ' stupid impatient driver' or punture his 4 tires.</p>

              <p>look at things on the bright side. There was once while driving, there was a driver behind me that honk at me. I was immediately pissed off and murmured "WTF impatient driver". Once that driver overtook me, he pointed his finger down the road. I immediately slowed down and stopped at the road shoulder to check my vehicle only to discover that I had a puncture tyre.</p>
              <p>He had meant well but my first reaction was WTF!!! Thinking back, I was so grateful to him once I knew he meant well.</p>
