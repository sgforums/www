              <p>I am putting my story up for fellow forums members here just in case you encounter a simliar driver like what i did today.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was driving on PIE towards CTE. As there as road works on the 3rd lane, cars have to filter to the 2nd or the 4th lane. I was on driving on the 3rd and was filtering to the 4th when a lorry with the number for GZ2848M sped from the 5th to the 4th lane, cutting abrupting in to my lane. I have to apply my e-brakes or risk hitting to him. I gave the lorry a horn before moving on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is going to happen next is almost unimaginable. As I move on further to CTE, i can see the lorry in front on me. Out of nowhere, the lorry just jammed brake AGAIN, and I need to brake my vehicle to prevent a collision. Thank goodness another vehicle behind me managed to brake in time to prevent a tragedy from happening. This childish and reckless act occurs another time @ the merging lanes moving towards CTE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wanting to avoid further trouble with the lorry, i decided to slow down and not keep up following the lorry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have made a police report on this incident. I know probably no action could be taken. Nevertheless, wanted to put my story here so that forumers can be careful of the above side driver </p>

              anyway.. glad that no collision happens....would have been a huge disappointment if the accident happens under such circumstances

              it just a short tap rather than an aggressive horn to invite trouble... totally agree that a horn should not be abused other than to prevent accident.

              <p>too bad horn is not unidirectional....so I guess as a driver...U will have to know ur own driving...like U hear a short horn...check ur car position,mirrors and blind spots...most likely U are straying into another lane or going too close to another car/bike.</p>
              <p>if U hear a long horn...then check and see if U are at fault...if U are...just wave a sorry to the other party also wouldnt die mah....a lot of drivers I see on the road...make mistake neber mind...dun want to admit they made the mistake...dunno what they thinking.</p>

              <p>70% of lorrys on the road will speed. just stay away from them and give way. in a collision, car drivers will always be the ones on the losing end. </p>
              <p>what irks me most is pick ups and vans on lane 2 and 1 who tail gate even in heavy traffic. imho those are the trouble makers in god knows what kind of hurry.</p>
              <p>true, sounding horn can be very distracting to innocent car drivers but sometimes taxi drivers and certain road racer wannabes are just asking for it. if they cause me a near accident, i won't hesitate to give a long and loud one until they scram out of sight.</p>

              <p>Sometimes it is better to take evasive action than to horn. To horn takes away a precious second of your reaction time. Each have to decide there an then which to do.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, maintain you stopping distance from the vehicle infront of you. Granted that there will definitely be idiots who cut in and fill up that distance. In Singapore, tailgating is the norm. So maintain at least half the stopping distance and be extra alert.</p>
              <p>Give a wide berth to lorries, primemovers, and busses, either infront or the back of them. Never know when their brakes might fail.</p>
              <p>The heavy lorries are known to leave their parks with good brakes, stopping successfully the first few stops, each time pumping out their brake fluid through a leak, then comes the time when the all the fluid is drained out. Woe to you if you are infront of that truck at a traffic light.</p>

              <p>there is a reason why vehicles leave a gap between each other -&gt; it's called braking room.</p>
              <p>leaving a 1-2 inch gap between your bonnet and my trunk is definitely not a norm.</p>

              <p>let's just say, people have less patience nowadays when it comes to the road. I don't know if it's because the world is becoming more stressful to live in or what, but i find drivers honking is bad, kinda rude.</p>
              <p>as for this topic, i would say, whether rude or not, but if you are feeling angry, there is still no need to endanger personal or other drivers lives, it's just plain childish. and speaking of that, perhaps the driver may be lowly educated, because not everyone will think in a matured way.</p>
              <p>i say, forgive and forget. God is looking even if the sg police are doing nothing. sg police usually do nothing, i despise them to some degree because of my previous encounters with them, not once, not twice, but a few times. From simply playing soccer in a school pitch to fraud cases, they are simply retards at handling problems, not all, but some of them.</p>

              <p>As ur nick suggest, lifeisbeautiful. I think there is more to life than to get angry. I was no doubt angry during that moment but i was also glad i didn't caused any accidents to surrounding vehicles around me because of the jam braking lorry in front of me.</p>
