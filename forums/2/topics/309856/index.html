              <p><br>nowadays drivers think signalling is a powerful tool/light - once signal must give way.</p>
              <p>drivers like to chiong on the fastest lane which is usually the extreme right, then at the very last min signal, cut multiple lanes and in between safe gaps to exit. if every driver does that and i have to give way then i don't know i'll have to brake how many times. furthermore what if zun zun the front car jam brake? it becomes my fault if i lang ga into their backside. they should learn to plan and change beforehand, doesn't mean the driver signal i have to give way. also they like to signal at the moment they turn the wheel and not a few seconds before.</p>
              <p>unless the lane is closed or blocked ahead or the traffic condition forced them to be in a difficult position, i won't give way.  </p>

              <p>It depends on the situation, especially at peak hour.</p>
              <p>What happens outside of the expressway?</p>
              <p>When you travel from a 2 left turn lane and enter the next junction to a single left turn lane, signaling your intention way in advance and observe the kind of consideration on the road.</p>
              <p>Take the 3 lane wide road yesterday, my signal (along with 2 other cars behind mine) had been blinking for more than 5 minutes, and not a single vehicle gave way and I had to move along further up front to avoid blocking traffic going straight. Until the very tip of the  left filter lane, nobody gave way as well. 3 minutes later one taxi driver finally relented and I gestured thanks.</p>
              <p>More than 30 or 40 cars must've passed by.</p>
              <p>I could've just  chosen some smaller car and jutted in abruptly and very rudely, leave it to the reflex of the unfortunate driver I'm cutting. Afterall I signaled. Traffic is fucking slow. And he probably turned into this road a lot later than I did. </p>
              <p>If he is one second too slow on his accelerator or brake, that is his problem.</p>
              <p>If he bumps into my side door, that's his goddamn problem.</p>
              <p>Looks like I should be adopting this habit soon, after all, most Singaporeans drive like this.</p>
              <p>It really speaks about the local culture here.</p>

                      and in between safe gaps to exit. if every driver does
                      that and i have to give way then i don't know i'll have
                      to brake how many times. furthermore what if zun zun the
                      front car jam brake? it becomes my fault if i lang ga into their
                      backside. they should learn to plan and change beforehand, doesn't
                      mean the driver signal i have to give way. also they like to
                      signal at the moment they turn the wheel and not a few seconds
                      before.</p>
              <p>unless the lane is closed or blocked ahead or the traffic
                      condition forced them to be in a difficult position, i
                      won't give way.  </p>

              <p>If they chiong at night, I can understand. No cars on the road so go chiong the right lane, who cares. Drive between 2 lanes markings also can.</p>
              <p>But lane cutting dangerously at peak hour traffic is another matter, then no need to give face. If got time to spare,  then tail gate and high beam all the way until he turn blue.</p>

              <p>edit: my colleague once had this experience after rochor exit along ecp at the short flyover where it always jam at peak hours. this car signalled and wanted to cut in my colleague's lane and he gave way, then behind came another vehicle tailgating the overtaking vehicle and cut in also. my colleague almost knocked into him. so he high beamed the car and the driver in front pointed middle finger. arseholic man these drivers.</p>

              <p>certainly, it varies in situation. from the look at their front wheels, may tell how much they wanna cut. those a bit a bit, i will give way cause they might be planning to exit somewhere ahead. those turn a lot, most likely gonna do multiple lanes change, standing by to shoot out one arh, then no way.</p>

              <p>It depends on the situation, <strong>especially at peak hour.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What happens outside of the expressway?</strong></p>
              <p>When you travel from a 2 left turn lane and enter the next
              junction to a single left turn lane, signaling your intention way
              in advance and observe the kind of consideration on the road.</p>
              <p>Take the 3 lane wide road yesterday, my signal (along with 2
              other cars behind mine) had been blinking for more than 5 minutes,
              and not a single vehicle gave way and I had to move along further
              up front to avoid blocking traffic going straight. Until the very
              tip of the  left filter lane, nobody gave way as well. 3
              minutes later one taxi driver finally relented and I gestured
              thanks.</p>
              <p>More than 30 or 40 cars must've passed by.</p>
              <p>I could've just  chosen some smaller car and jutted in
              abruptly and very rudely, leave it to the reflex of the unfortunate
              driver I'm cutting. Afterall I signaled. <strong>Traffic is fucking slow</strong>.
              And he probably turned into this road a lot later than I
              did. </p>
              <p>If he is one second too slow on his accelerator or brake, that
              is his problem.</p>
              <p>If he bumps into my side door, that's his goddamn problem.</p>
              <p>Looks like I should be adopting this habit soon, after all, most
              Singaporeans drive like this.</p>
              <p>It really speaks about the local culture here.</p>

              <br> <br> last night was rushing my wife to hospital due to some emergency and
              come across a young lady driving her old 95 model merc at average speed

              will end up sending her to the nearest hospital NUH instead of KKH

              <br> <br>I just dont understand why cant she just give way to me or go

              <p>so to those who wouldnt want to give way to such you-think-they're-rude drivers, please think again. because i too have been in such a situation &amp; there's just way too many road-hoggers on our expressways, roads, bend or no bend. lane 1 is the overtaking lane. not a strictly 90km/h lane.</p>

              <p>The discussion was lane changing in slow traffic. You're citing severe examples on the highway. Different principles apply.</p>
              <p>As for you, so much so for tapping on that key without a second thought.</p>
              <p>Sorry to hear about the wife though, did they make it in time to the hospital?</p>
              <p>What happened to that right lane hogging punk in the end?</p>
