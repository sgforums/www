              <p>yes the man involved did make it in time to the hospital fortunately. the right lane hogging punk is an old woman. i believe she still is hogging the overtaking lane now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> the husband overtook from left at the first possible chance available.</p>

              <p>Heh, that doesn't invalidate my entry about lane cutting in slow and heavy traffic.</p>

              <p>If drivers on the left turn lane barely leave any braking space between their
                  vehicles and the car in front of theirs, I take it as a signal no one is
                  prepared to give way. In my situation, I did not muscle my way in. The

              <p>Sure you can be decisive and swerve right in, but somethings in life you can do doesn't mean you should try.</p>
              <p>Especially with very hotshot drivers like you around Singapore who can accelerate expertly through gaps, switching lanes, muscling your way about before hitting your brakes to a rib breaking stop. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br> ur lack of intelligence amuses me.<br> <br> soleachip, to put it simply, the reason why you have such
              tremendous difficulty changing lanes(or should i say, driving in
              singapore) is because you are not a good driver. anyone agrees with
              me?</p>
              <p>if you need to switch to a lane on your left, DO NOT SLOW DOWN.
              what you should do is just speed up, find an opening, signal &amp;
              go in smoothly. some may have difficulty doing this smoothly due to
              cock-up nervous system and brain activity. you, maybe?<br> <br> you should be out of this forum. and out of self-driven vehicles

              <p>well if i do encounter such lousy drivers, i dont really do anything. i prefer to be more extra careful in my driving when i see they look potentially hazardous. blast horn for what? such drivers will have no reaction to such actions one. where it is possible to pass them, i do so safely. then when you're beside them, you realise that the driver...<br><br>a. is smsing on his/her hp<br>b. is talking on his/her hp thus not fully concentrating on the road<br>c. is a driver who doesnt look at her rear view/side mirrors every few seconds. head glued to the front.<br><br>finally, you can ascertain why they're hogging the lane. yes you can say speeding kills &amp; speeding is bad. but i find road-hogging to be much more dangerous because it insinuates uncertainty in his/her driving, leaving people behind clueless just what he wants to do. do take note, i'm not condoning speeding.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> afterwhich, i feel much more "safer" driving, knowing that i've passed him/her. it's an inexplainable psychological effect of some sorts. i'm sure you have done it too havent you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont own my set of wheels, but i pay for petrol, clean &amp; pamper the car(daily wash by banglas, interior vacuum every week, professional polish every 6mths). that's more than half of the monthly car expenditure anyway. it's an asset to me. i drive minimum 110km per day from tampines to jalan bahar &amp; going all places before i get back home.<br><br>are you trying to say that such drivers are not worth to drive on the roads?<br><br>i'm not a racer. why would i race in singapore? there's nowhere to race! but at 2am maybe when i just want to drive alone down the empty expressway.. of course i still give way to those who want to go faster at 140/150km/h.<br> it's the way they want to drive &amp; risk their lives. i dont have a right to stop them.<br><br>to those who think i'm trying to be a show-off &amp; only care about being fast, -________- my point is for all to drive safely, plan your route well, signal to change lane promptly(not signal but stay there &amp; blame motorists for not giving way)<br><br>to you, soleachip, i really have no grudges against you... but surely, if you really face a lot of problems driving, maybe you would like to relook into how you execute certain procedures? just a suggestion. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/lightbulb.png" alt="lightbulb.png"> you do not have to put me down for this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>well if i do encounter such lousy drivers, i dont really do
                                      anything. i prefer to be more extra careful in my driving when i
                                      see they look potentially hazardous. blast horn for what? such
                                      drivers will have no reaction to such actions one. where it is
                                      possible to pass them, i do so safely. then when you're beside
                                      them, you realise that the driver...<br> <br> a. is smsing on his/her hp<br> b. is talking on his/her hp thus not fully concentrating on the
                                      road<br> c. is a driver who doesnt look at her rear view/side mirrors every
                                      few seconds. head glued to the front.<br> <br> finally, you can ascertain why they're hogging the lane. yes you
                                      can say speeding kills &amp; speeding is bad. but i find
                                      road-hogging to be much more dangerous because it insinuates
                                      uncertainty in his/her driving, leaving people behind clueless just
                                      what he wants to do. do take note, i'm not condoning speeding.</p>

              <p>i'm not a racer. why would i race in singapore? there's nowhere to

                                      stay there &amp; blame motorists for not giving way)</p>

              i dont own my set of wheels, but i pay for petrol, clean &amp;
                                      pamper the car(daily wash by banglas, interior vacuum every week,
                                      professional polish every 6mths). that's more than half of the
                                      monthly car expenditure anyway. it's an asset to me. i drive
                                      minimum 110km per day from tampines to jalan bahar &amp; going all
                                      places before i get back home.</div>
