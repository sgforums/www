I am just not willing to throw $15k away. hehe. so u can say my threshold is $7-8k max.<br>my car is Honda Fit 1.5l. OMV ~$20k....Very hard to find a 1.5l Fit now and a lot of pple have shown interest. I am just asking to see whether this can be done, b4 i get these pple excited...<br><br>if anyone heard it's been done b4, ie. transfer the loan to someone, and he continue driving, pay the loan every month --  mind sharing?</div>
