              <p>its too late to switch now..she will need to get used to another new car, new instructor, teachching style etc.</p>

              <p>there is no logic when she has completed all her lessons and to pull out of the school just to save that few tens.</p>

              <p>iirc, your friend would have to close her BBDC school account and create a private candidate account at BBDC instead using the NIRC number of your instructor.</p>
              <p>which instructor is your friend going to? I can PM you my instructor's contacts if your friend is interested.</p>

              <p>Hey, not trying to hijack this thread but sharing my experience.</p>
              <p>I was under a private instructor with the TP test at ubi. I thought can save some $$ because they charge less then school. But i failed twice, quite miserably and left me feeling very dissappointed. Took 2 years off and went to enrol with SSDC. Started Feb this year and I just got my license on the first try last July.</p>
              <p>If I had enrol with SSDC instead of going to a private instructor, I may not necessarily passed on the 1st attempt but I found school lessons are more proper and in order so you know what you have learned and what you need to know. I suggest to continue with the lessons, the extra 2 can be considered revisions and the time to rectify any mistakes or ask any questions about stuff you are not sure.  </p>
              <p>Anyway, thats my two cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I do not think it's necessary for her to close the BBDC account before the private instructor can teach her...unless rules have changed...there is no regulation saying that centre's students cannot engage a private instructor to teach them(something like private tuition lar)...</p>
              <p>I think the reason is that the big money for the private instructor is the car rental for TP test...so if she terminates with BBDC...then she will have to use the private instructor's car.</p>
              <p>As far as TP is concerned...as long as U have valid PDL and insurance...they dont really care where the car comes from.</p>
              <p>But do take note that not many private instructors are willing to take these kind of "tuition" cases...for the reason mentioned above...so ur friend might need to talk to a few more private instructors and see how.</p>

              <p>ya.if not where U get a road-worthy vehicle with sufficient insurance for the test?</p>
              <p>for those thinking about using family car...do remember that when U take the test...U are not a qualified driver...and for person driving without valid licence...insurance dun cover one hor...</p>
              <p>think only centres and driving instructors cover...</p>
