            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>i am currently on the lookout for my 1st set of wheels and i have streamlined it to the Ford Focus hatchback 1.6 A. I test driven it along with other cars including the Pug 307 and Renault Megane. But the dyanamic of the Focus edges out the rest.<br><br>Does anyone in the forum own this model ? Any comments will be great.<br></div>

However the megane and 307 offer better equipment and frills. Still, since you enjoyed the focus drive i encourage you to work your finances out becos the focus is quite value for money. Forget what people say about its reliability; i havent encountered any with mine albeit its the previous generation model.<br>Please visit <a href="http://madsumm.org/smf" rel="nofollow">http://madsumm.org/smf</a> to know more on the MKII focus or ask any technical questions. The guys at Frod Club SG are very friendly.</div>

Thats why i initally drove the Alfa 147, the drive fantastic, sounds glorious but the car seems to be coming apart after a while ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ford's pretty a reliable car IMO.My friend's dad Mondeo been ard for 5 yrs and its still pretty well fitted. So i'm not too concerned abt the pricing.<br><br>But itseems that not many ppl in sgforums do drive ford cars aye ? Their new Focus is blazing down the WRC tracks ..the car to watch ...</div>
