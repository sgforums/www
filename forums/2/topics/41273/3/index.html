            <div class='col-md body'>good to hear tt u hav a reliable mechanic, believe u should hav since u hav 2 other cars at home.<br><br>the 75% ARF scheme start in 2002 and i do agree it is very depressing, especially when u compare with the previous scheme.<br><br>I know tt for the 1st 5yrs, the ARF is 75%. u r right to say tt this cost can be spread over a 5yrs period. Thus ur rebate after 5 yrs would be 42k, and the diff of 87k means ur car cost 17.5k per yr over 5 yrs. Much better than the 27k per yr for 3yrs.<br><br>Reasons tt I use 3 yrs is not entirely on cos but more of other concerns,<br><br>1. most cars have their warrenty run out after 3 years and tt's the time when most problems and issue start to surface, such issues could drive a person up the wall and a very common solution is to change car.<br><br>2. From ur previous post, u mention abt driving it for 4-5 yr and u also mention abt getting sick with a car, which is a high possibility, so i guess u would want to change car, a yr or 2 makes not much differ especially if u combine "sick of car" and those small irritating problems after warrenty expires.<br><br>Personally from wat i see of my frens and myself, 3.5yrs is the average time frame before the itch to change starts...Especially so when new models appears every 3-4yrs....<br><br>hope the above is useful...<br><br>the weekend is here again, i would assume tt u will be going to test drive some cars...<br>have u narrowed down ur choices???<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tough choice.... but firstly i will eliminate to 2 cars, I would drop the BMW.<br><br>Reason being that assuming its 2 yrs old, I reckon the condition might not be of top grade as compared with a new one. Secondly, I find the interior of the BMW too bland, standard gear and the same orangy colour lights for the dashboard.<br><br>Now the difficult part, btw the Saab and Audi.<br>Both look quite similiar, and their interior has their own plus point.<br>I especially like the Audi's with its display... looks cool..<br>The Saab has nice finishing to their steering wheel and gear...<br><br>Tough Tough Tough....<br>Most of the ladies i know prefer the Audi, while the guys like the Saab's quick response and pick up...<br><br>Have you test drive the Audi?</div>

If you like Saab, just go for it.<br><br>If for me, I personally like German car more. But didn't keep tract with Audi, so not too sure if the A4 did have some changes from the old one or not.<br><br>My vote goes to Audi.<br>But for you, think you better stick to the Saab.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I have test driven the audi a4...when I tried to step on the pedal to pick up speed the sales lady told me to ease into it cos audi's take time to accelerate. I was like, "huh?" also only let me do a small round for test drive and no freeway test so didn't get real sense of car.<br><br>you are right, think the saab is a more good looking car and fun to drive although I do think it feels a little too light compared to say the beamer which you can feel road handling better.  but for the price, I guess I am ok with the Saab. I would say I am 70% sure that that's the car I'll buy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right that the Audi does take time to accelerate as compared to the Saab.<br><br>I have seen some new Saab on the road and I am quite impress by its performance. I once see a driver zip in and out of the lanes with ease, overtaking most of the other cars. It actually has quite a good grip of the road. Of cos, that driver was pretty aggressive in his driving but the response of the car is quite amazing.<br>Surprise that you feel its lighter than BMW.<br><br>If what you want "performance" car, then Saab it is. And its Turbocharge as well...<br><br>So I would be expecting to see a new Saab on the road soon??<br>or do you want to give Audi another drive, this time to really try it out?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when you say other car prices, do you mean the Saab?<br><br>The Audi, I believe should not be going lower further, its OMV is around 37-40k.

            <div class='col-md body'>But i do agree that some cars are wider than others but only by abit. I am not too sure about the Saab's width...<br><br>The best way to know if you might have trouble parking is to try it when you test drive, all your queries on what you can do and where you might have difficulties should be address and test out then.<br><br>Saying that, the ability to park or not should not be hindering your decision unless you really can't see or gauge.<br><br>Everyone needs time getting use to a new car, as each car's handling is different, even for parking.<br>After sometime, when you have gotten use to the car, you will know by heart how big the car is, what can or cannot be done and thus your driving/ parking will improve accordingly. The "difficulties" that you experienced earlier will deminish and would no longer cause you concern.</div>
