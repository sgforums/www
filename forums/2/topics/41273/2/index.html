            <div class='col-md body'>hahaa... well, since u have test drive quite a few cars, my 2 cents worth base on personal preference...<br><br>307 - looks stylish, if u feel its under-powered, try the 2.0 version or the SW.<br>Rav4 - quite like it as it looks quite cool, especially in black colour, since u have look at a Toyota, ever look at the Toyota Voltz?? It's amercia designed, give it a try, but only from parallel importers and abit long, it SUV like...<br>BMW3s - it's as u said it is... but maintenance might swallow u up<br>Saab - always feels tt its overprice, cos do not really like its "boxy" feel/ looks<br><br>so personally, from how i view it, ur family already has 2 cars, you dun need a "family/ saloon" car to ferry many ppl, unless u want one...<br><br>so if its just a car for urself, and an easy to park, why no try the "smaller" cars,<br><br>Renault Megene Coupe or the new Megene II Hatchback (coming soon I think), Peugoet 206, 306 &amp; 307.VW Beetle, Golf.<br>These being the continental cars... of cos selection will be wider if u want Jap..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Duey,<br><br>Before any1 of us proceeded further on deciding which car to buy, I got an advise for you.<br><br>When buying a car, other than budget, maybe you can choose to, maybe you can choose something more suitable of yourself.<br><br>What do I mean from that, ermmmmÂ…Â…. To be simple, if you are comfortable, you can roughly tell us the following.<br><br>1) Your age range (No need exact lar, I know ladies age are secret, maybe e.g 20-30, 30-40 etc)<br><br>2) Are you the outgoing type of person or homely type (E.g Outdoor type normally go for SUVs,  and homely one MPVs).<br><br>3) WhatÂ’s your profession? (E.g. Managerial level, self employed or???)<br><br>4) Need to ferry children etc? ThatÂ’s where safety always come 1st<br><br>It may not be for all, but it does help if you consider the above factor. One such cases are when a 40 yr old plus is inside a Ferrari, normally pple will go Â“ WOW, uncle driving Ferrari, sad Â“ kind of comment. So in order to portrait the correcnt image, maybe you did like to tell us more But like I say, only when youÂ’re comfortable.<br><br>Anyway, if given a choice, I wonÂ’t buy a SAAB cos resale value not very good. BMW more expensive, but you can also see that many pple donÂ’t mind buying 2nd hand BMW. But, BMW maintenance very expensive!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Duey,<br><br>Points taken so far:-<br>Relatively young<br>Outgoing (Enjoy fun &amp; sporty)<br>Family 3rd car (That mean seldom have many passenger)<br>Prefer Continental Car<br>Pricing best ard 125k<br>Easy to park<br>Spare part not hard to find.<br><br>Go for the VW Beetle (2.0) if you feel 1.6 is under power. Always got a feeling that the car is most suitable for yuppies single lady.<br><br>Last time when I saw Â‘ZhuZhuÂ’ from Â‘Gan Gan Zuo Ge Kai Xin RenÂ’ , her name is Irene Phua (correct?) drives a VW Beetle in Bishan abt 2 yrs ago, I start to have this feeling this car are made for ladies like her, hahaÂ…Â…Â…Â… Furthermore, think the design of this car can last for quite a long long time to come.<br><br>Heh, just my point of view. Cars too big in sizes might not be suitable for lady driver, as it made them look smallÂ…Â… of cos unless you are very tall. Think the price should be ard 120k for 2.0l, need to check this out though. Some mnths ago, a 1.6l VW Beetle cost 100k plus a bit only.<br><br>You can save some cash for insurance and rd tax etc. Worth considering.<br></div>

Of course I aggree that re-sale value will be an issue...but is it worth paying close to $30K extra for? that's my dilemma.</div>

Why would you get sick of it though? I still love my Xtrail so far...it's black and I advise you not to go for a black car, it's a really hard color to maintain and it soils easiest. You can purchase Japanese authentic parts in Malaysia cheaper, but I'm not sure about the honesty of European car part sellers there...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you are right to say tt new car prices is "low" as compared with 2nd hand... especially so now with the 100% financing scheme.<br><br>given a choice btw a new and 2nd hand car, wat would you choose?<br>Your choice would most likely be a brand new car, the same choice as other singaporeans facing this question.<br><br>resale market also depend greatly on many other factors, so if you really wanna calculate how much you can get for your car after you have "loose interest" in it, then why not look at the scrap value. That would be the lowest price tt you will get for your car...<br><br>Thus assuming you get the Saab 9-3 with an OMV of 30k and COE of 27k, after 3 years, the scrap value of the Saab would work out to be 48k. For a price of 130k now and its worth of 48k in 3 yrs, the difference of 82k means the car cost you around 27.3k, not taking into consideration your car loan and interest payable.<br><br>consider it from this angle and see if you think its worth it....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for maintenance, you could always go back to the distributor, which will cost slightly more than the other pte workshops.<br><br>it's all about being able to find a workshop tt's trustworthy, fact of life, these workshops are run by businessman who main aim is to make $$$, hey who isn't?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>but personally i do not think tt going to workshops Malaysia make tt huge a difference... with lower price comes the need to cross the broder if the workshop does not do a good job, thus costing you your time....<br><br>sorry, no offence intended, just tt i have frens who had suffered under the hands of some of the workshop across the borders. but i do not disagree that not all the workshop are bad thus the need to find a trustworthy one...<br><br>just my 2cents...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for your 2 cts<br><br>the mechanic part post the warranty period is pretty much settled. already know a reliable one...<br><br>the issue of value of car...I agree, its depressing that cars drop in value so much. the new scheme w. 75% of ARF vs 130% OMV makes it less worthwhile...I would have thought that car prices dropped more but I don't think they have. I think the govt should come up with a less complicated system in the first place!<br><br>I guess it really depends on how much one is willing to lose and the X amt that you are willing to put on the satisfaction of driving a car, the convenience and at a price that you can afford (more economy lunch for me...)<br></div>
