            <div class='col-md body'>that time i was so confused abt whether i should be labelled a 'bloody driver' myself. was on the last lane abt to leave the expressway. then this cab which was directly on my front right diagonal cut in, only signalling after he was halfway in. i horned, not just tapped but held it there. then flashed high beam. after that, my dad knocked sense into me, and i think i indeed overreacted. well the cab's signal came so uselessly late, but at least he did signalled. perhaps it was my prejudice towards cabs that bugged me; perhaps it was morning sickness bugging me. haiz... was kinda guilty afterwards...</div>

Remember the article from the New Paper talking this guy who was having some trouble with some SAF regulars at Jalan Bahar while driving?

But I'd say more, do not know how to enter onto an expressway.<br><br>I usually ease back on my accelerator when approaching the entrance ramp onto an expressway, letting all the others around me overtake and squeeze into one tight gaggle of cars, vans, and motorcylces, all trying to merge onto the expressway. It's always entertaining to lay back behind and watch the dramas that unfold.<br><br>In my opinion, this behavior is sheer stupidity. It's the same with boarding a bus, or the MRT at any station during peak hours or weekends.
