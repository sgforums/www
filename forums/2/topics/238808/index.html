Or muz the other have to wait<br>to see whether he will move.<br><br>(B) Even if the vehicle saw a empty parking lot, is it wrong to not look out for<br>approaching vehicle or even signal to warn other vehicles before parking.<br><br>(C) Can ppl ASSUME that since there is an empty parking slot, &amp; their vehicle<br>is slowing down, it is clear that they want to park? By right, <strong>no matter<br>where u are</strong>, isn't it a rule to show ur intention to park?(the driver did<br>not show)<br><br>I have described the above to the ppl handling my case.
