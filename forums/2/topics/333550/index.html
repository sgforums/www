              <h1 class="clr">The Ferrari is the first to go as high-flyers feel the crunch</h1>
              <p>SYDNEY (AFP) - - Luxury car dealer Normal Elkordi has never seen it
              this bad -- financial high-flyers feeling the pinch of the global
              economic meltdown scrambling to sell their Ferraris for a loss.</p>
              <p>"We're not talking Holdens or Fords here, we're talking Aston
              Martins, we're talking Ferraris," he told AFP. "I've never seen it like
              this before."</p>
              <p>As anxiety grips world financial markets and stock
              prices crash, the Sydney-based dealer is seeing increasing numbers of
              young executives come into his showroom, hoping to offload their
              near-new prestige autos.</p>
              <p>"These blokes have probably lost a lot
              of money in shares, their bonuses come on shares. Their expenses are
              through the roof," Elkordi said.</p>
              <p>"A lot of them are upfront. I'm
              not saying they can't make the repayments and they are going to get
              repossessed, it's just they have to get rid of that debt."</p>
              <p>Indications
              are that the mood will also infect Asia, a significant market for
              luxury cars, as the full impact of the financial turmoil stemming from
              the United States is felt.</p>
              <p>"I would say it (the crisis) has not
              reached Asia... as it has reached America or Europe, but it will," a
              figure in the regional luxury car industry, who asked not to be named,
              told AFP in Singapore.</p>
              <p>"The question is: will it be as big here?"</p>
              <p>Luxury
              makes have been targeting Chinese customers both in Hong Kong and
              mainland China over the past few years with spectacular results, but
              there are signs the crisis is beginning to bite.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong has
              more Rolls-Royce cars per capita than anywhere else in the world, but
              the super-rich have stayed away in the past few weeks, a period which
              is normally busy for the famous marque.</p>
              <p>"Our customers aren't so
              much directly affected by the economic downturn but they are putting on
              hold luxury items like seven-million-Hong-Kong-dollar
              (900,000-US-dollar) cars," Leon Roy, the general manager of Rolls-Royce
              Motor Cars Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post.</p>
              <p>However, a spokesman for Ferrari in the Asia-Pacific region said they expected sales growth to remain strong in China.</p>
              <p>"As
              our president said at the launch of the California model recently, ours
              is a niche brand and if you are the type of person who can afford to
              wait 10-15 months for a car, you can still afford it," the spokesman
              told AFP.</p>
              <p>He said they expected some of the long waiting lists for the cars to be trimmed during the crisis, but do not see sales dipping.</p>
              <p>Audi
              Singapore managing director Reinhold Carl, however, told the Straits
              Times: "2009 will be a tough year for the car industry and the speed of
              growth for Audi in Singapore will be affected somewhat."</p>
              <p>William
              Choo, commercial director for Lexus at Borneo Motors in Singapore, was
              quoted as saying buyers might switch to smaller, cheaper models next
              year.</p>
              <p>But Simon Rock, managing director of BMW agent Performance Motors, said: "We expect to sell more cars on the whole next year."</p>
              <p>Sydney's
              Elkordi said cars are more easily dispensed with than other items and
              sellers are willing to give them up despite the likelihood of loss.</p>
              <p>In the last month he has taken on six or seven cars from sellers in this situation and turned away three or four more, he said.</p>
              <p>"You
              can imagine a gentleman has bought a new Ferrari at 507,000 (335,320
              US). If he was to sell that car to me today, I would be paying probably
              370,000 to 380,000 for that car if it's 12 months old, only because...
              who am I going to sell them to? That's the problem.</p>
              <p>"That's why at the moment, I've got over five million dollars sitting on the floor and we're not selling any cars of our own."</p>
              <p>The
              dealer, who has worked the market for 17 years, said the credit crunch
              had crippled the luxury sector -- from property to cars and boats --
              and he was now catering to more people buying cars for 150,000 dollars
              rather than the 250,000 dollars of a year ago.</p>
              <p>Sydney's principal
              Ferrari and Maserati dealer Tony Graziani agreed it was now a "buyer's
              market" for prestige autos but said he had received no cancelled orders
              for his luxury Italian motors.</p>
              <p>Speaking from a showroom floor
              filled with gleaming cars, Graziani said the mood of the times was
              uncertainty and some buyers admitted the situation was very different
              from two years ago.</p>
              <p>"We're not happy, we would like it not to
              happen," he said of the deepening global financial crisis. "But overall
              we're not too bad."</p>
              <p>Andrew McKellar, head of Australia's Federal
              Chamber of Automotive Industries, said a sense of caution was pervading
              the industry after a record 2007 in which one million new vehicles were
              sold Down Under for the first time.</p>
              <p>"We are certainly no
              exception to other sectors in the economy," he said. "If asset prices
              suffer, if growth in the economy slows, if there are concerns about
              employment then clearly that will have an impact in the market place."</p>
              <p>As
              the Australian International Motor Show opened in Sydney on Thursday
              without high-end brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes Benz, Elkordi said he
              didn't expect the market to improve anytime soon.</p>
              <p>"I've been told it's going to be worse. Everyone that you're talking to, no one is positive, there's only negative," he said.</p>
