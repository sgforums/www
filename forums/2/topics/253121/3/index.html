            <div class='col-md body'>The best suggestion I have read from all the replies is the one whereby TS is recommended to jam brake exactly after his car clears the barrier. Accelerate only when he sees the barrier down the back of his car. Got to be careful though... TS must know at which point the barrier will be down so that his boot don't kana chopped.<br><br>If that doesn't work, then what I'd suggest is that once TS has his cash card deducted and the barrier goes up, TS signals he is reversing his car. The tailgater has no choice but to reverse too. If she doesn't, TS can get out of his car and $%^&amp;#* the stingy chabor to move back.<br><br>The other alternative is to press the 'Help' button on the barrier stand and inform whoever it is on the speaker box that there is a car tailgating behind to avoid paying carpark charges. Hopefully, the carpark security personnel will turn up to see that the chabor don't cheat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually no point wat brake after barrier or wat. the barrier is activated by sensor. so if let's say the rav is very close to the vehicle in front, it will block the sensor and the barrier wun come down. the more appopriate solution wld be raise this issue to the mgt of suntec. have video clip to sustain ur evidence..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Would like to thank TS on behalf of Suntec Management, in pointing out this issue.<br><br>Ok, basically. Tail-gaters are a fairly common sight, multiple barriers have been broken, and in most cases video evidence would be submitted to LTA.<br><br>And for all those tail-gaters who think they can get away... DON'T BE AN IDIOT...<br><br>Once you entered the carpark, the serial number of your IU-unit will be recorded, with the time-in, and related informations. As long as the sensor does not detect an attempt to leave the carpark (with successful deduction), the time related to your entry/exit will continue "ticking".<br><br>Once it reaches a certain time-limit/or a few hundred dollars of parking charges, the serial number of your IU-unit WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED (which in-turns correspond to your license-plate number). Traffic wardens/supervisors will be AUTOMATICALLY ALERTED the next time you enter Suntec City. AND YOU'RE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR YOUR ENTIRE STAY SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS NO RECORD OF YOU LEAVING THE CARPARK, which can easily run into the thousands.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ERP car park system has two integrated systems into it...<br><br>One is the IU reader connected to a main computer for reading and detection of IU units in the vehicles and Cashcard IC chip, computation and data logging of entry time, IU serial number, Cashcard value, exit time, amount deducted...<br><br>Another system is the auto-barrier system... The motor or actuator of the barrier will only activate upon a pulse signal sent to the controller from the main computer which will then raise the barrier...<br><br>At the sametime, there will be an active IR sensor mounted which will send the IR beam, if the beam does not hit obstacle or obstruction based on a pre-programmed range of timing, the IC on the controller card will send a pulse signal to activate the barrier to lower...<br><br>However, in these sensor based barrier systems, the IR sensors are often mounted at an angle to offset and compensate for the time to tigger the barrier to lower... In layman's term, it means that as long as the sensor detects obstacle or obstruction, it will not close till the obstacle or obstruction is cleared... Normally the offset angle is around 5 to 10 degrees... Enough for a second vehicle to tailgate close enough, but without kissing the bumper of the car in front, to "bypass" the barrier system...<br><br>So in this scenario of the Rav4 driver, probably she knows this loophole and thus making it to her convenience...</div>

Tail-gaters are a fairly common sight, multiple barriers have been broken, and in most cases video evidence would be submitted to LTA.<br><br>And for all those tail-gaters who think they can get away... DON'T BE AN IDIOT...<br><br>Once you entered the carpark, the serial number of your IU-unit will be recorded, with the time-in, and related informations. As long as the sensor does not detect an attempt to leave the carpark (with successful deduction), the time related to your entry/exit will continue "ticking".<br><br>Once it reaches a certain time-limit/or a few hundred dollars of parking charges, the serial number of your IU-unit WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY LOGGED (which in-turns correspond to your license-plate number). Traffic wardens/supervisors will be AUTOMATICALLY ALERTED the next time you enter Suntec City. AND YOU'RE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR YOUR ENTIRE STAY SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS NO RECORD OF YOU LEAVING THE CARPARK, which can easily run into the thousands.</div></blockquote>Maybe she enter the same way by tailgating... so no IU is recorded</div>
