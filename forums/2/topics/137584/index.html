I think you kenna conned by the SA...go to any access shop and they will install the alarm for you. The SA simply saving her com and not spending it on the alarm for you, dude!<br><br>the Latio interior look plush though but if not for the Nissan badge, can easily mistaken it for a Renault, not suprising as Renault owns Nissan...<br><br>verdict: exterior cannot make it at all!

I do think that it is not a driver's car (like Ford Focus), however it does justice for it interior stlying, comfort, FC and gadgets? Would like to hear more from all of you. Thank you.</div></blockquote>yes, what WeNdRaGoN said are correct, don't let the no-solid-prove talk in this forum decide what you will buy. A car will be with you for at least 5 years, so test drive at least twice on each car that is in your consideration list. If you already zoomed into Latio, do test drive a Honda (maybe CIVIC), a Toyota (probably ALTIS), a Subaru (probably IMPREZA) and a CHEVELOT to be more sure, you will feel absolutely sure after test drives. Anyway, test drives are FREE of charge.<br><br>Overall, I love my Latio-Sport.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hei, thanx for all the inputs. I went to test drive the Latio again, this time with 3 others (so we packed 5 in total in the car including the sales person). when I tried accelerating, the car was noisy. is this typical of CVT engines? any of the latio owners out there have the same problem? I read a thread of Honday City which also used CVT having the same problems. inputs welcomed!</div>
