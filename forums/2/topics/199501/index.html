            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>it's normal to be frightened on your first lesson. you can't except to be a average driver on your first drive. don't be too hard on yourself. when I first drove, I always step on the brake hard!! the fear of knocking something was there.<br><br>but after a few lessons, I've began to drive smoothly... all things take time. learn to control your fears, drive with caution...you should be fine in a few lessons too... main thing is to keep your fear in control. all the best and hope you'll get your driving licsence soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For Learners (layman terms)<br><br>Biting point : is a point that power from your engine is distributed to your wheels<br>Q : How to know at which point is my biting point ?<br>A : When you slowly release your clutch, there will be a point where there is a drop in RPM. You will also feel the car moving forward slightly.<br><br>Scare of other cars surrounding you ?<br>Think this way (thou its kind of bo chap attitube), concentrate on your front mainly (I dont mean you do not need to take note of the sides). As for the back, dont worry. Drivers behind wont want to bang onto you too.<br><br>Points to take note of when learning :-<br>1) always remember to check your blind spots*<br>2) Slow and Steady<br>3) Listen to your instructor always<br><br>Some tips on circuit trainings<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Slope : Instructor will ask you to stop on a slope and ask you to move off from slope.<br><br>Method : Rev your RPM to 1500 rpm with handbrake applied. keep your rpm at 1500rpm and slowly release your clutch. You will feel that your bonnet actually rises and RPM dropped. Keep your legs in that position and release your handbrake. Once the car move, accelerate and move off from the slope</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">Crank Course : This is a double L turning course<br><br>Method : Assuming you are turning into the crank course on your left , full lock your steering wheel only when you see the curb appearing UNDER your left side mirror. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">E brake method : Slam on your brakes and clutch in only when you feel your engine is jerking (not car jerks)<br><br>Tips<br>Q : how to know when the instructor is going to do a E brake ?<br>A : He/she will tends to be more cautious. Example : My instructor taught me with no seat belts on, so when he put on his seatbelt, I knew he is going to ask for a E brake soon.<br>To ask you to do a E brake, your instructor will smack on the dashboard and that's the signal to do a E brake.</span><br><br>Tired le .. ask if you dont know.. Learners will learn the above from their instructors too but maybe in another way.<br>The method above was from BBDC years back when I am taking class 3<br><br></div>
