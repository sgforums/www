For 'enthusiast' cars, it could be either way.<br><br>These cars are driven harder, yes, so maybe they are more worn. But on the other hand, owners of these cars are usually car enthusiasts and always take care of their cars.<br><br>I know of normal drivers who drive family cars who dunno how to maintain their cars. Just drive until something spoil, sometimes never monitor mileage for oil change etc...<br><br>For car enthusiasts, they are quite dedicated. Regular oil changes with top brand oils for a start. Some redo entire air-con system. Other things redone = drive shafts, steering racks, brake pumps, brake cylinders, brake calipers and pads, radiator, distributor. Entire engine also sometimes rebuilt... rebore, or new sleeves, better pistons etc. Even studs and bolts might be branded ones!<br><br>Interior wise, new upholstery, new Recaro seats, new audio system, new audio board, new carpets, new steering wheel, gear knob etc...<br><br>So there are actually many EGs that have been redone sui sui already, almost like new!! If u get these type, no prob.<br><br>Of coz, there will be those poorly maintained types or a sui-sui one that has been stripped of all its saleable parts before sale, then those type you have to rebuild over again. Depends on ur luck and finding the rite car.<br><br>All I can say is, an old EG has more chance that the engine and parts have been rebuilt as compared to maybe an old Sunny. If the trip meter on the Sunny has 200,000 km, it prob is true, running on the same engine that u are buying in the car.<br><br>An EG with 200,000 km may have a spanking new engine inside. Maybe the mileage isn't even real cuz he's prob changed his meter cluster b4. Heh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree generally with guitarman. of course, there exists a rare breed of eg owners who really take car of their cars so u'd be lucky to find one who's willing to part with his ride. only prob is finding one and when someone loves their car so much and takes such good care of it well, chances are, good luck finding a mint one...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
