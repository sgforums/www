But as u say NS highway, Corolla and Civic can top 190km/h or 195km/h limited and pickup is faster than and V6. The interior quality is way higher and ..... No noise!!!<br><br>Jap built car are way better than Proton. And for contis, lots of those cheaper model are build in thai or china so they quality also so so.... but anyhow still better than proton.<br>My friend drove a Satria Gti 1.8, the fastest and most powerful car in proton, he like to power but the quality and noise makes him sucks. So he change to a Vios which he is very happy with now.</div>

The answer to it is Vios.... that what my friend chose. Its price at 84K for the luxury model and minus the 26K for a 1.5 car then the actual price will be like less than 59K, Thats is cheaper than Waja and full spec Gen2 and further the quality and goodie(safety spec) given are more.<br><br>eg. Ppl have this ideas saying add spoiler can make more hp and car go faster but spoiler are suppose to make ur car slower to give more traction right?<br><br>I am not saying you brad, just dont want ppl to be cheater by proton stuff.<br><br>Jap cars have lots of safety features and power like ABS, TRC, CVT, VSC, ECT, EBD, GOA, Variable Valve technology engine, much more fuel efficiency even with bigger engine, etc. Parts are double or triple more lasting than proton.<br><br>FYI.<br>Wira 1.5 almost 20hp less than VIOS 1.5. Weight almost same at 980 or 960kg. Vios top speed is less than 200(190++). Vios less wind drag than wira, 0-100 Vios is 9++ sec n Wira 1.5 is 12++ sec. Do u think wira 1.5 can reach 200km/h?<br><br>If a Wira 1.5 Auto can reach 195 or 200km/h then a manual one will be like 200++, then what is the purpose of Perdana V6, 1.8 DOHC wira (same handling as normal wira), Putra DOHC 1.8(208km/h) and especially Satria Gti(210km/h) where there are 46hp different from a 1.5 wira and price about 20k different??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last weekend went back to Malaysia. At traffic light, my Altis pick up lost to Gen.2, was wondering why is that so?? Even my engine sound started to be heard from inside also couldn't catch up. Poor driving skill?<br><br>Although I'm a Malaysian, I would not side Proton. With the price of Gen.2, I'd rather buy Vios for the resale value, brandname, quality, etc. although Vios is only a 1.5l car. However, I think the Gen.2 in Singapore will have better quality than Malaysia. For those who saw Gen.2 in Malaysia, you'll not see the same quality in Singapore since Proton leaves the rejects to the Malaysian market and export the QC-passed ones to overseas. That applies to the previous Proton models as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously think Proton cannot sell in S'pore... must admit that they have already changed a lot, the interior... engine, they even changed their logo..<br>But, still, in mind of a singaporean's,' Huh? Malaysia Car, cannot make it lah...<br><br>They were in s'pore mkt few years back.. but was kena kick out..<br><br>I mean if I want to get a cheap and value for money car... would probably buy Hyundai or Kia....  Proton, reputation quite bad...<br><br>I think they must come in with another name, cannot use back the "Proton" name..<br>It was like when Toyota launched it luxury cars in US, it cannot sell.. cos the Ang Mos cannot imagine the Jap can produce Luxury cars.. Only when they Toyota changed their name to Lexus.. then it really sold like hot cakes. In fact, the Ang Mos intially didn't know that Lexus was a Jap Car...<br><br>I bet proton will be out in another few years...<br>Anyone agree with me?</div>
