To be more amuse is that, proton is not making campro then who the h*ll gonna make it?<br><br>Proton car interior are more nicer than Korean car as it was mor of Jap design but the Quality they use is crap. See closer and you will see all those lining was not properly cut. And lots of common problem issue. If you thinking to get a car for long term needs, dont chose Proton. If you care about short term and cheap cost, then proton is the choice. And proton fuel comsumption sucks. Even those 1.6 or 1.8 Jap car like Altis, Civic are more fuel efficient than it.<br>Lots of those figure was claim and was/will never reach on the normal road use. I wonder those figure was from some sort of testing done close door  inhouse or what?<br><br>Does it back look like Kia?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no disrepect for Gen2.<br><br>Gen2 is not quite actually popular in M'sia.<br>I heard from my M'sian friends that Gen2 is very 'fragile' and good to own for short term only. the association with Lotus is not a plus point. Lotus has been declining compared to early 90s&lt;. i suspect it could due to proton which owns the Lotus company now.<br>For a S$66K price, it's better to get a Vios, City or Altis if u chip in a bit more.<br>Too ex for that $$ quote. Resale value is less favourable to Jap cars.<br><br>infact, when i was driving in M'sia a few time last mth, i hardly saw any Gen2 on the NS highway. mostly were Proton wira, satrias, waja, perdanas and kancils<br><br>i would skip this model if i'm buying a car.<br><br>no hard feelings to proton or Gen2 fans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
