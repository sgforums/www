              <p>If auto gearbox paired with big engines = good FC and auto gearbox paired with small engines = shitty FC, then why the hell would Honda use the CVT on the Jazz last time and VW using it's DSG on some of it's 1.4 TSI models like the Golf 1.4 TSI?</p>
              <p>It depends on what kind of auto gearboxes you're talking about man.</p>
              </div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe u have problem understanding what i was saying so let me make it clearer to u. larger engines with auto boxes have better fuel economy as compared to smaller engines is all down to one simple thing, torque. bigger engines naturally have bigger torque and its a known fact that torque converters sap power from the engine. so bigger engines have no problem overcoming that with their bigger torque outputs. smaller engines will have a problem. try driving an auto picanto and u'll know what i mean. and also, auto boxes are generally marginally heavier than manual ones. so that more or less explains the heavier FC on smaller engined cars. DSG gearbox don't have that problem is mainly due to the fact that it doesn't use a torque converter. on top of that, according to the examples u quoted, DSG is mated to a TSI engine. if u are aware of it, TSI is a twincharged engine, meaning it utilises a supercharger and a turbocharger to boost power and torque. this means that from a 1.4l engine, u can have a power output of a 2.3l engine. couple that to the fact that its pulling a relatively lighter car, u'll have good FC and power output. in a way, u can have the best of both world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as pertaining to your next example, Honda Fit/Jazz is a very light car. in case u r not aware, the new Honda Fit also uses the CVT gearbox. reason is very simple, to keep weight and maufacturing cost down. the new Honda Fit 1.3l w/o Skyroof weighs only 1010kg. couple that with a 100hp i-VTEC engine, u have one of the best combination in the auto industry. CVT boxes in general are lighter than normal auto ones. dimensionally also smaller, that's y its ideal for small cars like Honda Fit. in fact some bigger cars do use CVT boxes. eg. Toyota Estima 2.4, Toyota Vanguard 2.4, Toyota Alphard/Vellfire 2.4, Nissan Teana, Nissan Prairie etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i hope i have clear the air for u. i'm also learning new things everyday and its been enjoyable to b able to participate in such a discussion here. =)</p>

              <p>ok, taken a quote from the commercial - (a typical torque converter has 80-85% efficiency, but these new versions <span style="color: #ff6600;">achieve up to 92%,</span> according to ZF)</p>
              <p>92% efficiency under phyicsal testing or controlled environment testing? time frame that 92% were breached? before or after coefficient of thermal expansion kik in?</p>
              <p>did ZF post their dyno test report?</p>
              <p>n you still beleive those commercial reports?</p>
              <p>F1 are using modified powertrains and you cannot compare them with those car you buy off the shelf</p>
              <p>I will let this argument rest here</p>

              <p>Can you imagine your auto heavy vehicles without lock-up clutches? Do you know how much energy will be wasted?</p>
              <p>And <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/113851">r34gtr</a>, just to check, since the torque converter actually multiplies torque, particularly at lower rpm, shouldn't it be more advantageous for smaller engines?</p>

              <p>And of course I believe the report to a large extent. The fact that the new bus models we have that use the ZF6 (6 speed) are able to lock-up at 1100rpm, and change gears at 1500rpm, compared to the older models tells the tale already.</p>
              <p>We don't compare car with bus, we compare bus with bus, the new gearbox ZF offers really saves more fuel.</p>
              <p>Please don't question everything lar......use some brains.</p>
