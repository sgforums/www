              <p><br>Somehow, it seems to me you yourself can't even even explain what's a torque convertor yourself and you're asking nightsky87 does he know what's a torque convertor. Obviously he knows about it, and we all know about it.</p>
              <p>Even if you know how a torque convertor works, you're quite obviously confused about what's dual-clutch and automated clutch gearboxes. Or you're just confused about all gearboxes.</p>

              <p><br>Did I even act like I'm smart? I'm just telling you and the people in this discussion here in general there are 5 kinds of gearboxes out there. And all these knowledge are not from commercials. Just like what n0x said, have you seen commercials about gearboxes? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Start viewing from an engineering standpoint? I AM viewing from an engineering standpoint by stating the types of gearboxes there are in the market right now. I'm not even advocating which gearbox is better. <br>Did you even see me saying: "WOW, I must say dual-clutch gearboxes like the DSG are the best in the market right now."? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>a automated manual gearbox is still a manual box, to the layman it is consider as autobox, like nightsky87 said there is no clutch pedal sticking out but still need a clutch lever to release the clutch whether sticking out or not</p>

              <p>Alright, the thing you don't know and you still need to learn is the fact that you're just another mh2.</p>
              <p>Please define what's manufacturer to you. The automobile manufacturer like Honda, Toyota, BMW etc or the gearbox manufacturer like Aisin/BorgWarner, ZF, Voith, Ricardo, Magnetti Marelli etc?</p>
              <p>If you are talking about car manufacturers, they do talk about the gearboxes used on their cars, but that's not where I got all my knowledge from. I'm not stupid enough to believe everything they say.</p>
              <p>If you're talking about gearbox manufacturers, most of them don't ADVERTISE their gearboxes for christ sake, maybe only for ZF, with their occassional commercials in magazine and etc. I don't see Aisin or Voith or Ricardo or Magnetti Marelli having commercials on TV, buses, billboards or magazines, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I do not have to be a engineer to know about gearboxes, you know about gearboxes as well, are you a freakin' engineer? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>There's something called the internet in this world. It's a medium for you to find out about gearboxes (which I'm sure this is how you get to know more about gearboxes as well).</p>
              <p>And your paragraph two doesn't apply to me. Please take a look at my posts again. I'm talking about gearboxes from a very neutral standpoint. I did not advocate a particular gearbox. And I told you guys here automation of a gearbox is dependent on your definition of "automatic".</p>
              <p>I myself said automated clutch gearbox can be considered an automatic gearbox if that guy's definition of "automatic" means the gearbox can change the gears by itself without human intervention.</p>
              <p>It cannot be considered manual if the automated clutch gearbox you're takling about is fitted to commercial cars like the SMG, Selespeed or E-gear, etc. Because all these automated clutch gearboxes have auto function where the gearbox shifts gears by itself without the need of the driver's help.</p>
              <p>But if you're talking about automated clutch gearboxes fitted to racing cars like F1 racers, then it will be considered semi-automatic (or semi-manual depending on how you look at it) because they MUST shift the gears by themselves by depressing the '+' and '-' pedals on the steering column behind the steering wheel. And there's no fully-automatic function.</p>
              <p>So you're goddamn wrong, an automated clutch gearbox is NOT a manual gearbox and can NEVER be considered as one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>That's exactly what I said. There is pretty much no point arguing. seykai still insists you find out some "advertisement" about gearboxes; in the first place, it was he who mentioned about learning about gearboxes from advertisements. He has effectively (o rather, tried) to put you in a situation whereby 'heads you lose, tail he wins'.</p>
              <p>and I do agree that the future is in twin clutch transmissions. So far the trend IS clearly going down the twin-clutch route, including the japanese. While now only available on higher spec models (Evo X's SST, GTR's Twin Clutch), sooner or later as technology progresses and economies of scale are achieved, you will find such technology pervading the rest of the model lineup.</p>

              <p>Okies.. let me ask u  in a very refined way free of expletives and vulgarities....</p>
              <p>1. what do u define as bragging??? Are u not bragging when u pasted this???</p>
              <p><em>"manual gearbox have little power loss and automatic transmission can have  power loss up to 20% when engine torque transmit to powertrain so its more sensible to use manual gearbox in hilly places"</em>  </p>
              <p>If u say not.. then what constitutes to allggetia bragging??</p>
              <p>Seriously in this age of easy access to information, there is nothing to brag about seriously. Just google and what u need to know is there.. Why you think that allggertia is bragging cos u nv did any research yourself and was shot down... at the end of the day.. it boils down someone who embraces technology vs a computer klutz... simple as that....</p>
              <p>2. You say that you must be an engineer to have access to information. So are u an enigneer?</p>
              <p>3. If you are not an engineer. you got the above information(in italics) from commercials? May i know what commercials are u talking about? Can I have a look?</p>
              <p>4. You dunno how to use websites like <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>? Or you do not know they exist?</p>
              <p>Seriously if people are to learn objectively how something works... the last thing they will want to go to is the commercials cos they are biased.. anyone with common sense will know that...</p>
