              <p>Mostly because an automatic transmission can still be pretty much rubbish in challenging conditions. For the average European driver this consists of several things virtually unknown in Singapore such as hilly terrain and snow. Controlling the torque with the clutch in situations like these is essential, something I couldn't live without.</p>
              <p>In expensive cars there might be some decent semi-automatic ones as well, but even in many sports cars the manual one simply allows you go faster. Not just because you can change faster, but also because the gearbox itself is lighter which in turn improves pretty much everything in the car.</p>
              <p>As for fully automatic I can't imagine a situation where I'd want one. It's for the lazy and the unskilled.</p>

              <p>There's a stark difference between fully auto gearbox with manual overide and sequential manual gearbox. for BMW's SMG, its a sequential manual box with fully auto option. essentially, its a manual gearbox not unlike those found on motorbikes and F1 cars. just that it offers fully auto mode as an option with the computer taking over for gear shifting. the downside is that when in fully auto mode, there will be delay when it comes to shifting gears and shift shocks are very pronounced. most other auto gearboxes with +/- works just like a normal auto gearbox, just that it offers the driver with the option of shifting gears. they still have the traditional torque converter.</p>
              <p>Volkswagen's DSG and Nissan's GR6 gearboxes are basically twin-clutches auto gearbox. it offers faster shift times mainly due to the dual clutches which engage the next gear even before the gear is selected.</p>
              <p>its true that modern auto gearboxes offers better fuel economy, but that's only restricted to bigger engines. smaller engines with auto gearboxes generally consumes more fuel than manual ones. small cars like Honda Fit however manages to obtain excellent fuel economy is due to the fact that it uses a CVT gearbox.</p>
              <p>power loss on an auto box can range from 5% to 15%, mainly due to the power sapping torque converter. and when it comes to maintenance, a manual box is far more easier to maintain than an auto box.</p>

              <p>It all boils down to what's your definition of an automatic gearbox. If auto to you simply means the box will shift the gears for you, then yes, the DSG is an auto box. But a more accurate description of the DSG is: Automated clutch gearbox.</p>
              <p>Many people take automatic gearbox as torque convertor. Hence it's all very confusing. Posh's PDK or VW's DSG can also be classified loosely as an auto gearbox because it can shift gears itself (depending on your definition of automatic gearboxes).</p>
              <p>Alright, put it simply. There are 5 types of gearboxes. The good ol' manual gearbox with a clutch, an automated clutch gearbox (aka DSG, Selespeed, E-gear, etc), dual-clutch gearbox (aka DSG, PDK, etc), torque convertor gearbox (aka auto gearbox in most people's languages) and CVTs.</p>

              <p>DUH - Do you see cars with DSG having 3 foot operated pedals? I mean, DSG is obviously not a manual gearbox right? Anything that is not a manual is generally classfied as an automatic gearbox - that's where the name comes from - <strong>automatic</strong>ally changes the gears for you without the need for human intervention.</p>
              <p>Then again, I don't really expect much from you - after all, you're the one who cannot differentiate a brake rotor and a brake disc, no?</p>

              <p>Agree with nightsky87. r34gtr sounded professional right until paragraph 3. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If auto gearbox paired with big engines = good FC and auto gearbox paired with small engines = shitty FC, then why the hell would Honda use the CVT on the Jazz last time and VW using it's DSG on some of it's 1.4 TSI models like the Golf 1.4 TSI?</p>
              <p>It depends on what kind of auto gearboxes you're talking about man.</p>

              <p>Please don't mind if I refute that - the Lexus LS600 (520Nm) uses a CVT, while the LS460 (500Nm) uses the Lexus 8-speed automatic. Then again, it could be because the 600 is AWD while the 460 is RWD.</p>
