            <div class='col-md body'>came across this article dated 19 January 2003 by James Foxall of the Sunday Times on colours of a car. very interesting.<br><br><blockquote><span class="large"><strong>Now that's a daft colour</strong></span><br>by James Foxall of The Sunday Times<br>Pick the wrong shade and youÂ’ll pay the price<br><br>Drivers who put more emphasis on the colour of their new car than its engine and specification might be a joke to some people but they could be having the last laugh.<br>Not only do certain colours make you more likely to be a victim of car crime, they affect the way other road users treat you, indicate your profession, reveal your age, give clues as to how likely you are to break the law, even declare what rugby team you support. Most importantly perhaps, they can have a dramatic impact on your wealth.<br><br>Choose a car in a boring brown or the wrong red and you could reduce its resale value by as much as 10%. And the more expensive the motor, the greater the negative effect.<br><br>Adrian Rushmore, managing editor of GlassÂ’s Guide to used car values, reveals: Â“For a second-hand Ford Focus youÂ’re probably looking at a premium of about Â£250 for a good colour, for a BMW 5-series thatÂ’s Â£1,000, and if your Ferrari isnÂ’t red it could cost you Â£10,000.Â”<br><br>So how can plain old paint have such a dramatic effect? Some cars suit certain colours better than others. Peter Stevens, the product design director for MG Rover, says: Â“When we look at clay models of cars early in the design stage we cover them in plastic to give the appearance of paint. The colour you choose at that point can limit the possibilities of the car looking good in other tones later.<br><br>Â“Audi looks at its models in silver and itÂ’s no accident that its cars look much better in that colour.Â”<br><br>You could be in trouble if the colour doesnÂ’t match the type of car, too. Â“A sports car or hot hatch will carry a base red much better than a family saloon because the lower, more aggressive stance of the sporty car suits red,Â” says Rushmore.<br><br>Â“Bright colours generally work best on sports cars and hot hatches. On anything else they are a mistake.Â”<br><br>Why buyers want certain shades is difficult to divine. If that were possible we could figure out how Volkswagen managed to sell even 113 models of its Polo Harlequin, a car with every body panel painted a different colour. Sales of Minis covered in the stripey daubs of the British fashion designer Paul Smith were similarly pitiful.<br><br>Conrad King, consultant psychologist for the RAC Foundation, says: Â“Colours speak volumes about people. Drivers of red cars tend to be creative, those who drive black are ruthless and those in green conservative with a small c.<br><br>Â“We discovered in some research that drivers of pastel cars are far more likely to be victims of road rage than those of other colours. They are also eight times more likely to suffer from depression than drivers of blue or silver vehicles.Â”<br><br>But if, as King says, middle-of-the-road motorists go for green, why does research for Admiral, the motor insurer, shows drivers of green cars as the most likely to have a driving conviction? And if red is so suited to sports cars, why is it by far the most popular car colour among women drivers aged 55 and over? ItÂ’s as difficult as explaining why surgeons go for silver cars, police officers purple and vicars white. Yet they do, according to Admiral. It also found that the Welsh are 19% more likely to own a red car than people elsewhere in Britain, while Scots are 15% more likely to drive a blue car. Admiral believes itÂ’s partly down to rugby fans picking cars that correspond to their national colours.<br><br>However, Stevens, who was responsible for the sleek shape of the 1993 Â£540,000 McLaren F1 supercar, believes that manufacturers also play a crucial role. He thinks the colour a car is unveiled in can be influential. Â“When we first showed the McLaren we put it out in silver because thatÂ’s the best colour to show off a carÂ’s curves. That first viewing can be tremendously important because people often want to recapture the excitement of the moment they first set eyes on the car.Â” He has a point: half of the 64 road-going McLaren F1s sold were silver.<br><br>If youÂ’re buying a car and want to make the most money when selling it on, Rushmore says: Â“Avoid garish colours like yellow, unless itÂ’s a sports car, convertible or hot hatch. And if youÂ’re buying an executive car go for silver, blue or black. If youÂ’re after an ordinary saloon get an optional metallic colour. You will more than make up the difference in cost when you come to sell it.<br><br>Â“Flat colours are also out when it comes to sports cars. Avoid white or brown and some of the wishy-washy reds. If you want a red car go for the classic pillar box colour.Â”<br><br>One final point about red cars. Anecdotal evidence suggests that they could marginally increase your chances of being stopped by the police. Former policemen say they have heard of colleagues playing Â“snookerÂ” while on patrol, pulling a red car, then a coloured car, then another red, then a colour to see who can build the biggest break. However, youÂ’d have to be very unlucky to bump into one of the few bored officers who have taken part.<br><br>Hue dÂ’you think you are?<br>Red Several studies agree you are creative. The bad news is you could well be a Welsh woman over 55<br>Yellow Hooray! You are spontaneous and lively. But, alas, more likely to be convicted of careless driving<br>Pastel Oh dear. You are eight times more likely than drivers of blue or silver cars to suffer depression<br>White The favourite choice of vicars, it reveals you to be fastidious, anxious and hesitant on the road<br>Green You are conservative but have a wild streak: green drivers are most likely to be caught speeding<br>Blue Quietly confident, donÂ’t seek attention but get results. Bully for you. And you may well be Scottish<br>Black Several studies concur: you are ruthless and keen to exert your authority.
