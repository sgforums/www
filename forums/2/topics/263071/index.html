            <div class='col-md body'>thanks to apollo from MCF....<br><br><img src="http://images.paultan.org/images/Toyota_Valvematic.jpg"><br><br>Toyota has something new up itÂ’s sleeves - Valvematic, an evolution of the VVT-i mechanism which now incorporates continuous valve lift control together with VVT-iÂ’s existing valve timing control. Valvematic also eliminates the need for a throttle valve, instead controlling the volume of intake air using valve lift instead.<br>According to Toyota, an improvement of 5% to 10% can be seen with fuel efficiency, as well as an improvement of 10% with the power output on a similiar engine displacement comparison. Toyota also mentions reduced CO2 emission as well as improved acceleration responsiveness.<br>The first Valvematic-equipped engine will be a 2.0 liter model, most likely a replacement for the 145 horsepower 1AZ-FE engine which has been pretty much slotted with different tune levels into all Toyota cars in the C-segment and above. The trademark Â“ValvematicÂ” was registered by Toyota a few months ago, so alot of people have been expecting this. One of the first few cars to get the new Valvematic 2.0 liter engine are the 2.0 liter versions of the recently launched twin sedans Toyota Allion and Toyota Premio. The 2.0 liter variants are set to debut in Winter 2007.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://paultan.org/archives/2007/06/13/toyota-reveals-valvematic-technology/" rel="nofollow"><br>http://paultan.org/archives/2007/06/13/toyota-reveals-valvematic-technology/ </a><br><br>from the looks of it..... honda fans could soon be losing their bragging rights....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
