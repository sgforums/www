Good also if FC is important to you. Easy to sell on one hand few years down the road as it's a good car with good market value. However, too many Altis on the roads now may cause its value to drop as there is too much of a surge in its numbers. Maintenance is also fairly inexpensive. However, has image of family saloon, which you might not get used to. And in terms of power, not much to speak of. Just a very family-oriented sedan IMHO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) Not as nice as Altis but the other attributes aka fuel saving remain somewhat the same. Still, I personally think it's a bit on the ugly side  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Boot space is limited though. And let's face it: for a few K more, I rather get the Altis but that's personal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>3) Sporty car, FC quite high, maintenance more expensive. Power somewhat there. Market value is there but I think it's dropping *shrug* Mitsubishi has concentrated too much on the Evo series and neglected its lower end market, that is what I feel. Mitsubishi engine have not really gone through any major overhaul/fine tuning for some time? Not sure about this, you can check it out. But if you are going for sporty look, get this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Add a fierce looking spoiler and LED lights and you will get many challengers on the roads  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>My lousy 2 cents worth<br><br>P.S.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the answer is obvious ... get the Altis .. is good all round car and is very much of a fuel saver ...<br><br>The mitsubishi is using the 4G63 Engine for years and years in its higher end cars and it can last despite users whack it every now and then ... but i dunno about eh lower end model ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depending on what u looking for...<br>Looks: Definitely Lancer... Low profile plus crouching front gives a pouncing leopard look compared to Altis... Look a bit like tortoise from front... (pls dun flame me... I drive a Altis also... Juz my view... I love tortoises anyway...)<br><br>FC: Dunno... Depends a lot on ur driving style and how lucky u are... Say this cuz my pal's totally stock can get ard 15 even though his driving style almost like mine but I can only get around 13... Mine also stock but going for a body ki installation later... Sat morn that is... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Power: Altis... Lancer uses CVT (Continuos Variable Trans) meaning uses a series of pulleys and steel belts to pull it along... FF cars mah... But thus, it has no shift shock... But Altis has 4 traditional gears... Can feel the shift sometimes... Therefore... In this sense... CVT the FC should be better a bit...<br><br>Value added: Should be Lancer cuz u get the sports ver. everything u need almost there liao... from OZ rims (although quite heavy) to the carbon fibre interior... Altis u pay got leather seats and wood trims... (dun really like the wood personally...of course.. my personal views <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )<br><br>eh... still got what... oh yeah... BM service and attitude super f**ked up... like u owe them to buy a car like that... but i frequent toyotaclub forum seems got a guy got good SE for toyota cars... maybe can try asking him nicely...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...you are going to go for manual or auto??..<br><br>if auto its more of the altis cos its more powerful than lancer's cvt..<br><br>however, in my personal opinion, altis is mostly for family oriented..which is very true as the outlook and the interior is so family like..<br><br>whereas the lancer is different, the sports mode is for young people which is very eye catching too..i knew it cos im driving a lancer sports manual now.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Yongz,<br><br>At the end of the day, you have to prioritize what you are looking out for.  For example, performance/reliability/comfort/FC ...., which is more important to you?  Of course, if one make is superior in all aspects over the other make, then decision is clear.  But most of the time, you have a mix situation.  In this case, the quality you treasure more will precede over others and should therefore help you still to make a decision.</div>
