Just adjust the gauge to let more air flow so as to simulate that it is boost to 2. When the real fact is that it is only at 0.5 boost.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

ALL WRC car engines sound the same, so I do think that the impreza WRC car doesn't have the rumble. The high pitched rumbling u hear is more due to the sort of engine components typically used in WRC cars.</div>
