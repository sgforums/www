            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>I wonder anyone of you here operates a modification workshop,<br>or knows something about starting a business in this automotive line.<br>As a car lover myself. I wish to invest on a modification factory. As I have an interest in that business. May I know what are the criterias? i.e: cost and how much about modification do the boss himself needs to know? Personally I am a IT student. I do not have much knowledge about modification. If i hired a worker to handle my business, he will surely play me around his finger. How do i start out? Do i really need to start out working in one garage first to gain experience?<br><br>I hope someone in this line could help me out.<br>Pls private msg me, i don't think you wish to disclose to much to the public right?<br>Anyone share?<br>Btw, post are welcome for comments.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't kinda agree. You don't have to be an expert in cars to be a boss or investor of a company. I rather you be alittle knowledge in modding cars and be expertise in running your business. Why? COS its more important in managing your business well and smooth rather than concentrating on fixing cars when your workers are suppose to do those. Whats the difference if you are doing your worker's job and working as a mechanic in a garage? And then, who is going to manage you business?<br><br>Defintely, a little knowledge do helps but you can learn while running your business. It's more important to hire the right kind of workers that can be trusted. It's hard but you have to lose some to gain some. That's part of a risk you have to take.<br><br>Research reseach and more research should help alot. Concentrate more on your plans rather than learning from basic. It's a waste of time. Learn while you work. Seek advice from professionals. Get accurate details of where to get the best for your company.<br><br>If you need some help, i suggest you getting inspiring books on starting a business, i recommend "Clueless in starting a business" by May Lwin, Adam Koo. Its written and based local. lots of inspiring storys and advices for those who wants to make big in starting their business.<br><br>I'm actually planning to startup a small business and a garage have actually been in my list. Unfortuantely, a garage is way too costly for me to handle.<br><br>Lastly, have the passion. Go for what you want and stop wasting time.
