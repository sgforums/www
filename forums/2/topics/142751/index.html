            <div class='col-md body'>The main difference is that Lexus get the 6 cylinders engine while Toyota get the 4 cylinders engine.<br><br>Except for the Toyota Crown which is a V6, most of the other Toyota is a 4 cylinder. Not sure about the Lexus equilvent Toyota like the Harrier and the Altezza.<br><br>The reason Toyota models is using the 4 cylinders is to make sure that toyota dont step into and jeopardise the Lexus market. Ohter than that, the extras that you are paying goes to the lexus equipments.</div>

Lexus as you all know is targetted at the more premium market therefore it is only wise to differentiate Toyota cars from Lexus cars by better engines, higher tech gagdets, better afterservice and so on, if not it beats the purpose of having a Lexus. However, the underlying thing behind every Lexus car is still Toyota technology.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the engines used are the same for equivalant models for both lexus and toyota. Just that we gotta compare the various Lexus models with the equivalant toyota models.<br><br>RX300 has the equivalant 3.0L toyota Harrier too (which is just not popular here), just like the ES300 has the<br>Toyota Windom and the LS430 has the Toyota Celsior. Exactly the same car, different badge thats all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lexus is just like a more pretigious brand for Toyota which i believe is more for the foreign market especially the western region, same goes for Nissan's Infini or something like that. You built a car of the highest quality available, bearing the most radical design ever, set to take over the world by storm... and you name it after your... say maybe, your chinese name? just doesn't sound right, eh? Thus the world of branding, and it's a proven marketing tool. A brand alone came make a difference, it's how you use it to appeal to the mass.</div>
