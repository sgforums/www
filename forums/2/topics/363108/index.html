              <p>Yes... you have to go to court.. There is a court room that is specially used to handle traffic cases. Since ya demerit points are damn high... you therefore have to make a trip there. Just stand there and they will read out your charges in a loud and clear manner. You the kuku, will therefore keep saying yes sir.. yes sir i admit. Then after that... go to the counter and pay your fine then go home. You will not be alone.. people have to queue up for their turns to take the stand. But dont worry its very fast. ok??</p>
              <p>Next time dont chiong too much la.. kanina no car does not mean can speed leh.. even God cannot help you when you speed. 70km/h means maximum only 80km/h. Wake up la deh...</p>
              <p>Next time.. when drive keep looking at the speedometer la... side mirrors and rear mirrors to keep a lookout for traffic police and look for signs regarding speed camera and on overhead bridge for those hiding traffic assholes with a speed camera.</p>
