Moreover, most of the above listed businesses being affected are mostly operated by majority chinese. The malaysian government seems more interested in discussing the issue of sand and airspace issues than to what that is really good for their nation. Of course, the RM20 fee is just a 'tit for tat' after all who are we to complain since Singapore government is the first to implement a toll charge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
