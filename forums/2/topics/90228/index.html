Also, it can be easy to forget to step on the brakes while the car is stationary, instead of holding the clutch in in a manual car.<br><br>as for the accident u witnessed, well, civics are known to have softer body panels. pickups are made of tougher steel or other materials. sometimes, the aftermath of an accident can be deceiving as to the speed of impact. what looks bad may have actually happened at low speeds, or vice versa. of course, if the car is a total write off, that high speed was involved is in no doubt. For the civic, unless u actually witnessed it, u can't be sure. it could be that the pickup jammed brakes and the civic was tailgating, it could be other scenarios. we don't know for sure.</div>
