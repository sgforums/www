            <div class='col-md body'>I have some questions to clarify here.<br><br>I have had this notion for quite some time that <strong>the smaller the engine capacity </strong>of a car, the <strong>lesser the fuel consumption</strong> (FC) would be. Is this true? Or is this a serious misconception?<br><br>Is it also true that <strong>COE cars have higher road tax fees </strong>than newer cars? If so, what are the reasons?<br><br>What about insurance? Is the <strong>age of the car </strong>one of the factors considered in determining the <strong>insurance premium</strong>?<br><br>Thanks to all in advance.<br></div>

A case of all the aforementioned factors being in perfect harmony.</div>

Is this true? Or is this a serious misconception?<br><br>Is it also true that <strong>COE cars have higher road tax fees </strong>than newer cars? If so, what are the reasons?<br><br>What about insurance? Is the <strong>age of the car </strong>one of the factors considered in determining the <strong>insurance premium</strong>?<br><br>Thanks to all in advance.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi...actually other than the capabilities of the car...FC depends quite abit on how you drive too...driving hard will definitely use up more fuel. Also it will depend on if u do alot of city driving or high way cruising. Frequent city driving definitely gives u a bad FC as u are on 1st or 2nd gear or waiting most of the time.<br><br><strong>Road tax</strong> increases by 10% each year from the 11th year onwards. This is till 15 years where road tax is at 150%. this is the ceiling of the revised road tax for cars older than 10 yrs. For example...my car is 21 yrs old but my road tax is 150% of the norm. I believe the government introduced this measure to discourage pple from keeping old cars.<br><br><strong>Age of the Car</strong> is definitely a concern. In my case, only AXA insurance was willing to insure my car. Companies would be afraid of the cost of replacement of spare parts and stuff should u be involved in an accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bloody hell...to summarise and to make things simpler:-<br><br>Generally it all depends on:-<br>1) Overall weight of the car, e.g., continental cars are heavier.<br>2) Yes it is true, the capacity of the car, e.g., the larger the capacity, the higher the FC.<br><br>The other factors are rather unique:-<br>1) Technology employed, e.g., Engine Technololgy:- VVTi / iDSI; Transmission Technology:- CCVT / CVTC / CVT, etc.<br>2) Electricity driven? Petrol driven? Or both?<br>3) Ergonomical Design of the car, e.g, is it as aerodynamic as Honda or Celica?<br><br>even if you do not have the best ergonically designed car but has VVTi or iDSI, your car will still achieve good F.C. efficiency.</div>
