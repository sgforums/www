Is this true? Or is this a serious misconception?<br><br>Is it also true that COE cars have higher road tax fees than newer cars? If so, what are the reasons?<br><br>What about insurance? Is the age of the car one of the factors considered in determining the insurance premium?<br><br>Thanks to all in advance.<br></strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Hi...actually other than the capabilities of the car...FC depends quite abit on how you drive too...driving hard will definitely use up more fuel. Also it will depend on if u do alot of city driving or high way cruising. Frequent city driving definitely gives u a bad FC as u are on 1st or 2nd gear or waiting most of the time.<br><br>Road tax increases by 10% each year from the 11th year onwards. This is till 15 years where road tax is at 150%. this is the ceiling of the revised road tax for cars older than 10 yrs. For example...my car is 21 yrs old but my road tax is 150% of the norm. I believe the government introduced this measure to discourage pple from keeping old cars.<br><br>Age of the Car is definitely a concern. In my case, only AXA insurance was willing to insure my car. Companies would be afraid of the cost of replacement of spare parts and stuff should u be involved in an accident.</blockquote>Thanks Jiayong.<br><br>Your explanation is really informative and useful. These are valuable info for any potential COE car buyers.<br><br>Regarding the insurance premium, would a new car's premium be higher than a COE car premium for someone at the age of 26 and having 4 years of driving experience?</div>

No wonder i hv to cough out ~$1.2K+ for my civic, even after 30% NCD. BTW, does it mean Altis's insurance is much lower, as it would be deemed that most of its owners or drivers are very safe ... or slow (which in fact it's not, i saw some very hiong corolla and altis before, cut me like nobody's business... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> )?</div>
