              <p>Dear cars forummers, i just passed my license not long ago and got quite a plenty questions to ask,</p>
              <p>how isit that despite this bad economy car prices stil remains the same. Ppl are selling away their cars like hot cakes to dealers and few are buying cars, and so 1st hand car shop and 2nd car shop are sure to be hit badly. And so they shld start giving 5 or 10% discounts to their cars example a new vios from 45 K to 41K for example and a 2nd hand suzuki swift 39K selling at 35K those type. If they dun do this they will start paying money for their employees and their rental of car show rooms etc....</p>
              <p>Anyone understand what i am tryin to discuss abt or i am asking some noobie car questions.</p>
              <p>I also thought of buying a 2nd hand car maybe a 3 years old vios, avante, latio sedan, mazda 3, or any sedan car of around the same price and wanted to get a big big good deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also can you guys guide me whether to use my gf's name to buy the car for insurance since cheaper or use my name and how much money do i need to standby like 5 or 6 or 7 or 8K for the first month. Many thanks to you if u look through my post and give honest feedbacks. =)</p>

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I may not be able to offer much advice being a green horn myself.</p>
              <p>But my take for the car pricing is that it should have dropped more significantly</p>
              <p>IF the COE is not so low.</p>
              <p>While auto makers are in the reds, its true, I am as disappointed as you about the apparently not much change in the car pricing.</p>
              <p>To be fair, yes maybe cheaper by a few small percent. But not much.</p>
              <p>If this drags on, I would not be surprise more car makers go to their makers for more advice.  ;)</p>
              <p>Maybe you can still wait a month or 2.</p>

              <p>I feel that although the COE prices have fallen, the overall car prices doesn't change because the car's ARF remains high. Apparently, the cost of importing vehicle from overseas fluctuate, especially in Japan where the yen has risen against the dollar. This will inflate the overall vehicle car price given the current economic gloom. The rise in vehicle cost is buffered by the low COE, hence there isn't much of a significant drop in prices. That's what I think....</p>
              <p>Well, another reason could be, if they sell their cars at low COE rebate, they might expect more orders coming in, and this will inflate next round's COE to higher levels and customers might be asked to top-up the difference in worst cases. So to strike some sort of a balance, the agents might adjust prices to cope with the demand of a particular model....Well, in my opinion, now is a good (<em>not best</em>) time to buy a car but if you have the money to <em>own</em> it, but no money to <em>maintain </em>it, it's also no use.</p>

              <p>Prices have dropped not because ADs have eaten into their profit margin, but because COE prices have fallen. ADs are generally still making an average of 10-30k per car for japanese models, and upwards of 30k for continentals. ADs are not going to lower their profit margins, they are just going to tai chi the stress and pressure of making sales to the sales executives (since a large portion of their pay is dependant on commission).</p>
