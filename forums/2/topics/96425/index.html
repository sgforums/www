It was promoted as an alternative to the Cube in part because of its larger engine. A 1.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine will power the Japan model, on sale this month. A larger, 1.8-liter inline-four engine is expected to be optional.<br><br>The Tiida's interior length, measured from the accelerator to the rear-seat hip point, is as long as that in the Infiniti Q45 sedan.<br><br>But some at Nissan worry about whether the Tiida would sell well in the United States, where hatchbacks often have foundered. They favor the more conservatively styled Tiida Latio (pronounced TEE-dah LAH-chee-oh).<br><br>The Tiida Latio will offer the same spacious interior and engine choices as its hatchback sibling. It goes on sale in Japan in late October.<br><br>Its detractors compare the car's bland styling to the weak-selling Toyota Echo. They argue that a good-looking hatchback such as the Tiida is a safer bet.<br>Related Stories<br><br>from:<br><br><a href="http://www.autoweek.com/news.cms?newsId=100761" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoweek.com/news.cms?newsId=100761</a><br><br>Tiida Latio is probably called Sunny locally, and Tiida may be called Pulsar.<br><br>Sadly, Tiida Latio joins the fleet of other ill-proportioned cars, like the Honda City, Suzuki Liana Sedan, Toyota Echo Sedan.<br><br>Without doubt, the hatch version is the one to go for, although in the end you will still see more sedans here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story was posted a while ago. Maybe the Tiida<br>Latio is what they were referring to.<br><br>By KATHY JACKSON | Automotive News<br>Nissan's Mexico-built Platina could be sold in the<br>United States.<br><br>LOS ANGELES - Nissan might delay the launch of its<br>redesigned 2006 Sentra because test groups don't like<br>the way it looks.<br><br>Meanwhile, company insiders say Nissan plans to export<br>to the United States a car smaller than the Sentra.<br><br>The new Sentra has not fared well with focus groups in<br>this country, according to company and supplier<br>sources.<br><br>"It just doesn't go far enough in terms of appeal,"<br>says a Nissan source who did not want to be<br>identified. "They're talking about going back to the<br>drawing board."<br><br>The new version is scheduled to go on sale next<br>summer. The small economy car is Nissan's No. 2 seller<br>in the United States and is the main product for young<br>buyers.<br><br>"We have it down as delayed," says Michael Robinet,<br>vice president of global forecast services for CSM<br>Worldwide in Northville, Mich., which tracks<br>automakers' future product plans.<br><br>The new Sentra will share a platform with the Renault<br>Megane II, a compact sedan that has been received well<br>in Europe. But sources say focus groups here think the<br>new Sentra's styling is bland.<br><br>The Nissan source said the company also is scrambling<br>to get a vehicle smaller than Sentra to the United<br>States by 2007.<br><br>Nissan has discussed selling the successor to the<br>small, boxy Japan-market Cube in this country. But the<br>source says other possibilities are being considered<br>because the Cube may be too small and underpowered for<br>U.S. drivers. The current Cube is rated at only 98 hp<br>and is 154 inches long.<br><br>One alternative is the Tiida, which goes on sale in<br>Japan in fall. The Tiida is 165.6 inches long and will<br>be powered by 1.5 liter and 1.8-liter inline<br>four-cylinder engines.<br><br>Nissan also is considering exporting the Mexican-built<br>Platina compact to the United States. The 110-hp,<br>164.2-inch long Platina was launched in April 2002. It<br>is built in Aquascalientes, Mexico, for sale in that<br>country.<br><br>The 126-hp Sentra, the smallest Nissan sedan sold in<br>the United States, is 177.5 inches long.<br><br>"Nissan is absent from the minicar segment and needs<br>to be there," Robinet says. "I'm sure in the next<br>couple of years you'll see them there on a broader scale."</div>
