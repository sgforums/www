Which is to play safe, earn at least 3.5k. Owning a car is not as ez as owning a bicycle. Anything happen, its much more costly than you think it  might be.<br><br>For 20yr old + new license + 1.6 sedan, if i remember correctly, the insurance is about 3.8k with 0 %ncd , comprehensive 1st party insurance from AIG. That was the price I got a few years ago when asking for a quote.<br><br>Well...what most people do is get their parents to buy under their name to cut down on the cost. As older age people insurance charge is cheaper.<br><br>Well, for a start to get eg6.....might as well get a corolla or sunny, get more experience and learn more on handling in terms of skills n road condition. I believe on the road...no 1 wans to see the case of mx5 again..lolz<br><br>Well, this are my 2cents as a lau ah pek.. wahaha...lolz<br></div>

Its amazing how that car turtle on the right side. It does not look like it hit with another vehicle coz i din see any other damage vehicle. Even if tavelling at 90, with that type of situation, its also amazing how come theres no skid marks on the road when it was side way. Its as though like over turn 90 degree to the ride side on the spot. No debris on the road too.<br><br>Well, according to that car situation of how i look at it, the right side of it is totally owned. lolz.. 2 doors+window+side mirror+ whole of right side body+side blinker. waoh.... at least thats not the worst i see on the road, worst was when 1 car hit first lane cement wall and topple 180 degree upside down on the bonnet of another car at lane 2. Thats the most powerfull damage i see with my own eyes.</div>

Though I'm not quite sure what your concept of time is, so maybe last year is "last time" to you. And I did get mine in 2 months and my account still shows clearly my first lesson and my test date. So, you don't come and nonsense me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

You want to play punk also you will think twice. EG6 is a good car and can be a tame transport vehicle. As long as the driver is disciplined enough.</div>
