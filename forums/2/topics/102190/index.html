            <div class='col-md body'>I'm really damn insulted lor... Must always be the P plate's fault meh? Cannot be just someone driving a car with a P plate ah? I'm also a P plate... doesn't mean I don't check blind spot... most of the time is other drivers don't want to give way... always want to squeeze...<br><br>It's not good to sterotype... It's like saying women drivers are traffic hazards...<br><br>True... sometimes, P platers also commit mistakes... doesn't mean that ALL of them do it... So pls, dun sterotype... otherwise I might just be forced to say that all women cannot drive... which isn't really true... my sis drives like a guy...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

As i saw his car almost bumped into mine, i was forced to cut into lane 1 whereby i almost hit the car on the lane1. Luckily the car on the lane 1 drove passed me very quickly. I horned twice at the P plate driver(wearing glassess)...wtf!<br><br>To all P-platers...Plse for goodness sake, Please check your blind spot and signal early before switching lane! Dont cause harm to other traffic users becos of your carelessness!</div></blockquote>not only p-plate drivers what... I ve seen many others who are also doing such things. Being swerving to the next lane its a natural reaction to danger. but best..u should brake. Reacting aggressively to the situation might just put u to more danger rather than satisfying ur anger. The way u put it is like insulting all p-plate drivers. Well im not a p-plate but im just saying that...if u say such things ppl might get offended. I've almost met an accident abt such incident...involving a non-p-plate driver turning to my lane damn close. i swerve to the right while braking at the same time.</div>
