No carsharing scheme other than cityspeed is this nice.<br><br>Cityspeed also have better packages than NTUC eg. u can rent overnite car for $34 from 7 pm to 8 am etc check out www.cityspeed.com.sg<br><br>Rental companies hardly have hourly or day packages.<br><br>So if u r sure that u only need to have a car for that few hours, than car sharing is suitable.<br><br>BTW, u can rent a brand new car under your name from some rental companies. They will bring in the car that U want and rent u for min 2 years usually and at the end of the contract u can buy or return the car.

But they do give 10 km "free" for every hour that u book.<br><br>I am hopping that they will buy mazda 3 and the proton Gen 2 for their new cars as the price is slightly higher than vios.<br><br>Furthermore, cityspeed CDW or LDW of $6 for 1.5L car is 50% less than orix rental or other car rental companies ($15 or $22).<br><br>So add up the difference and overall u do save.
