            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>the story is like this<br>This afternoon, i got pulled over by one of those bikers.  im driving my renault kangoo on the 2nd lane (i been doing that everyday since i got the van 1 yr ago) and one of those bikes went past me..<br><br>the guy signalled me (quite aggreesively) to go to the 3rd lane and i "obediently" went back to the 3rd lane.. once he went ahead some distance ahead of me, i switched back~  and he specially slow down and point me to go to the road shoulder~<br><br>i sort of tot he want me to go back to the 3rd lane again, so i just went back there~ then he signalled me more agreesively, and i just stop by the road shoulder and see what he want.<br><br>basically he say that i am not supposed to drive on the 2nd lane~ ( fact is i have been doing that since the very first day and no TP have ever stop me before) and i claimed ignorant cos i nv learn it in basic theory mah~  then he said that i am road hogging instead, i was thinking, wtf.. i am driving at least at 80km/hr.  and that is road hogging? but i nv argue and just orh orh..<br><br>the funny thing is that before i met him, on the same afternoon, i met 3 TPs down the road and all of them just zoomed past me without saying anything.. -.-<br><br>Anyway im wondering what sort of powers do they hold?  and what sort of agency they belong to? Are they allow to book people or issue summons etc?<br><br>break my 3 yrs++ record of nv been stopped before... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
