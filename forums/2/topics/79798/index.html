Drive all the way, only stop for toilet breaks. Also watch out for traffic police, there will be 2 places- one JB, one Malacca where they catch u for speeding. If caught, offer ringgit $50. In KL, park in reputable hotel &amp; take taxi cos very cheap, no point get stuck in traffic jam. Coming back, leave KL early to avoid getting caught in jam.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm Malaysian. Here's my advice.<br><br>Don't offer bribe. Especially if you have a singapore number plate (they hold a grudge against you, don't you think?). Now is the transition period in Malaysian politics. You might become a scapegoat to be sacrificed in the police's campaign to rid themselves off the "dirty" image. The new PM (Abdullah) seems intent on setting things straight, or at least trying to put up an image of anti-corruption. If they press charges against you for attempted bribing, you will most likely go to jail as I believe that it is a criminal offense.<br><br>And yes ALWAYS lock your car, no matter what. At secluded places (for ex. highways), don't stop for "freak" minor accidents (for example, bumping into the backside of the car in front which breaked suddenly, or the car behind bumping into your backside). There are quite a number of car-jacking gangs (MOSTLY young Indians in groups of 3 or 4 persons) that purposely create accidents, so that you stop and come out and they can rob you. No kidding. People have been killed/murdered in such incidents. Be smart. Take note of who are the people in the other car before you alight. When in doubt, go to the nearest police station or call 999.</div>

Especially if you have a singapore number plate (they hold a grudge against you, don't you think?). Now is the transition period in Malaysian politics. You might become a scapegoat to be sacrificed in the police's campaign to rid themselves off the "dirty" image. The new PM (Abdullah) seems intent on setting things straight, or at least trying to put up an image of anti-corruption. If they press charges against you for attempted bribing, you will most likely go to jail as I believe that it is a criminal offense.<br><br>And yes ALWAYS lock your car, no matter what. At secluded places (for ex. highways), don't stop for "freak" minor accidents (for example, bumping into the backside of the car in front which breaked suddenly, or the car behind bumping into your backside). There are quite a number of car-jacking gangs (MOSTLY young Indians in groups of 3 or 4 persons) that purposely create accidents, so that you stop and come out and they can rob you. No kidding. People have been killed/murdered in such incidents. Be smart. Take note of who are the people in the other car before you alight. When in doubt, go to the nearest police station or call 999. </div></blockquote>Thanks for that advice! Anyway, it fits into my personal conviction about bribing too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Sounds serious on the car-jacking gangs, now i know what the baseball bat is for  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
