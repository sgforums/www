An eg would be: Inline 4, 1.6l 16 valves, naturally aspirated. that would mean this engine has 4 pistons(cylinders), arranged in a straight line. there are 4 valves to each piston, each piston displaces 0.4l, and the engine is not turbocharged or supercharged.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VTEC if i am not mistaken is Variable Timing Electronic Control is it?<br><br>Aiya..something like that...all the companies have different names for roughly the same technology. Like Mits has the Mivec technology that stands for Mits innovative variable electronic controller.<br><br>Ok..so what is Vtec? well..as my friend described it to me, it is as if u are have two cams, a set of normal cams and a set of racing cams.<br><br>When u rev till a certain rpm(with gear engaged) the Vtec will kick in and give u the extra boost and your car is porpell forward more at an even faster speed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as for the cylinder part...what Heng said is pretty much it.<br><br>I think most cars are 4 cylinders here? unless u talking baout all the ex ex racing cars la...<br><br>mine is a 4 cylinder 16 valve engine which calculates to 4 valves per cylinder lorr.<br><br>The Toyota Corolla AE111 overseas was using a 20 valve 4 cylinder 4ag-e engine...thus that will be 5 valves per cylinder.<br><br>hmm...anyone correct me if the info i give is wrong...i am still new to all these too...trying to pick up along the way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
