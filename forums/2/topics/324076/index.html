              <p><strong>Horn hitters</strong>, are drivers that as soon as the
                                      light turns green they beep at you. These horn bastards don’t miss a beep at every possible chance - they hit the beep as
                                      soon as you begin to park, they hit the beep when they want to go
                                      straight on a left turn lane, they hit the beep for no reason at the
                                      red light and they hit the beep for sound test when everyone else is
                                      stationary in a traffic jam.</p>

                                      3-seconds on the road. These idiots have too much brake liquid to spare
                                      and are usually drivers with poor sense of speed; they over
                                      accelerate and bang their brakes twenty times in one minute on any lane in any
                                      situation.</p>

                                      follow the speed limit at first lane. These idiots are either too
                                      scared to go fast or too scared of hitting others. <em>May apply to
                                      intellectual wannabes who are slow not because they are scared, but
                                      because they actually read all the signboards (including the Speeding
                                      Kills ones).</em> These drivers have the power to single handedly, stall any traffic on whichever lane they choose to travel in.</p>

                                      self-declared journalists cum drivers who complain, swear and comment
                                      about every other driver on the road. Prone to graphic violence with
                                      the flash of a finger, they are vulgar but harmless and don’t usually
                                      create problems for other drivers. Road reporters always think they are
                                      right, always talk a lot and the only people they annoy are themselves
                                      and their unfortunate passengers.</p>

                                      children in need of attention. Often drivers in modified cars with bad
                                      color and design combos, these children are attention whores looking to
                                      compensate. They rev their car engines even when no one else on the
                                      road is looking at them, even when no one gives a damn about who they
                                      are or what they drive. They are always the first to move off and
                                      usually the last to enter the first lane on an expressway because they
                                      are too busy checking out people checking them out.<br> <strong></strong></p>

              <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>No Signal</strong> drivers
                                      have broken middle fingers. They are also misers who will stoop to
                                      every method imaginable just to prolong shelf life of the car battery.
                                      They have no belief in giving signals. They do not give a signal when
                                      changing lanes and making a right or a left turn. Driving accumulates
                                      bad experiences for these misunderstood morons and they are hot
                                      favorites with horn hitters and road reporters.<strong><br> </strong><strong></strong></p>

              <p><strong>Squeeze Suckers,</strong> are drivers with fetish for
                                      everything tight. These suckers want to squeeze themselves into
                                      anything. As long as there is the chance of a perfect fit, any space at
                                      exactly their car length will do. They squeeze into space between two
                                      traveling cars and cause a road accident and they typically evolve into
                                      the <em>kiasu</em> driver in twitching cars that suffer from spasm.</p>
              <p>They will squeeze into a space smaller than their own cars at a merging lane because other drivers beside, behind and in front of them will
                                      eventually be sacred enough to back off and give way.</p>

                                      role models for children in modified cars. These drivers will come up
                                      behind your buttocks looking for a kiss, use their bright lights on
                                      purpose and signal you to move off because they think they can run you
                                      over. When you give way, they move in front of you and turn into slow
                                      pokers. These people are involved in a lot of accidents so they always
                                      remove themselves from the roads eventually.<br> <strong></strong></p>

                                      drivers with their own idea of drifting. These drivers travel only on
                                      two lanes and only between markers. They don’t have a clue about where
                                      they want to go because they never have to decide.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;">Descendants down the bloodline of taxi
                                      drivers, lane loiters are natural born king of roads because everything
                                      belongs to their grandfather. Lethal when combined with slow pokers.<br> <strong></strong></p>
