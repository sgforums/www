            <div class='col-md body'>U are quite right about the behaviours of Singaporeans everywhere they go. On many occasions, they do deliberately dilly dally when they jolly well know that someone is waiting. It is their joy to see someone hard up for their lot. Of course, there are also people that are very zhi tong and quickly move off. I usually remote start my car before I go to my car so that it is adequately warmed up.<br><br>If one wants to warm up their car, they should drive slowly off till the oil temp reaches 70 degrees and above.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">About two weeks ago, Flying Dutchman and Glen Ong talked about how a lot of people when they know someone is waiting for their lot, takes their own sweet mother's time to move out of their lot.<br><br>Personally, I have encountered such people too and I'm sure, most of you here will have too.<br><br>In my experience, the other party are largely ladies or young women who once in their car starts the engine, and began to make a call or SMS with their mobile phone knowing full well, that I am waiting to take her lot.<br><br>I often wonder; what good is a country of educated people who does not have any sense of common courtesy?<br><br>It is also my observation that, it is very possible that people who intentionally take their own time to leave their lot knowing someone else is waiting,  because someone else have done that to him/her and he/she is returning the bad experience.<br><br>This is quite likely the case with, I believe, EVERYTHING in Singapore.<br><br>What says you all??</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it depends on how long you wait.. if it is like 1 - 2 minutes, for them to put their shopping properly, make a call to confirm the next appointment, I think it is fair. They didn't expect you to be waiting there, and it is definitely safer to make a call IN the parking lot than on the road.<br><br>I don't mind waiting. What I DO MIND, is people who see I am waiting, come in, put their stuff without even acknowledging me, and then.. WALKING AWAY. I mean if you are NOT going to leave, and u know I am waiting, just let me know lah!<br><br>AND the most -use fist beat heart- thing is.. when u are ALREADy waiting and some big lorry comes in at the same time that a car leaves, and just quickly rush to that spot EVEN THOUGH he know u were there first. And big lorry what, L L loh.</div>

Stops suddenly to contemplate an empty lot (witout turning on hazard lights), then move off again SLOWLY looking around like no one else is on Earth and behind. And then when he/she finds an ideal lot, he/she wil suddenly brake and go into reverse - NO HAZARD SIGNALS AT ALL! So if you happen to be  one car-length behind and there are others behind you, you'd be hard put to reverse. And this really holds up the entire line of cars just because of one singular SELFISH SOUL, in front!!!<br><br>So this is what happens also; I keep about 2 car-lengths behind the car in front looking for a lot in a basement carpark, so that in case (which is always) he/she stops without hazard lights I don't end up trying to reverse with traffic behind me. But some idiot behind will suddenly overtake and fill up that the space I kept in front!  Walan... I tell you this burns me up!<br><br>Why the fuk are people like this, I ask you all??<br><br>I look at people driving nice elegant above average cars but their driving manners are so UNCULTURED, ILLITERATE, and BARBARIC!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One more thing; how long do you normally take to reverse-park your car into a lot in a basement carpark or multi-storey carpark?<br><br>&gt; 1 minute?<br>&gt; 2 minutes?<br>&gt; 4 minutes?<br>&gt; 5 minutes and more?<br><br>This is also what I notice in all type of carparks; people take unusually long to park. When I look at them, I note that they are moving very slowly, very cautious and almost looks like they just pass!<br><br>But funny, I followed one car that was driving very fast and confidently on the road into a carpark, only to be held up behind him as he took his own sweet mother's time to slowly reverse crawl into a lot! WALAN!!!<br><br>At first I thought it was because sometimes people like to make me wait because of my Jag S-Type. But no... when I drive a van it is also the same!!!<br><br>Generally, I can quite confidently say that people in our society at large, are SELFISH.<br><br>Period.</div>

Singaporeans as a whole, are not gracious enough.<br><br>We can't choose our parents but we can choose to stay seperately from them. Likewise, we can't choose our nationality at birth but we can choose to migrate. I suggest that, since u have so many complaints, choose the latter.</div>
