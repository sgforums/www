Because now all those who WERE weak in English are all so accustomed to speaking Mandarin from the home to the school, to the workplace. While those who aren't interested in Mandarin and are fluent in English remained largely, disinterested in Mandarin. As such the Speak Proper English campagne was introduced. One campagne begets another.<br><br>If WE don't have a problem and the Mandarin Campagne worked well (along with our glorified education system), I don't see why then our gov's over-dependence of FTs and their insistence that we lack the talents FTs have to offer??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think, if we look at it on the basis of survival, I feel it all boils down to how increasingly difficult it is to make a living.

I also noticed the many gory and fatal accidents there posted over the Internet. And I wasn't refering to HOW the parents drove; I am refering to their sense of RIGHT and WRONG - properness and basic integrity.<br><br>Yes, I know what you mean, and I agree I/we shouldn't jump the gun and pass quick judgements that Singaporeans are like that. I aim to change this wherever and whenever I can, and we should all do likewise to alter the chracater traits of our own people.<br><br>This morning after dropping my friend off, I waited till one of the parents come driving towards the church and I purposely drove out towards the Exit gate. Obviously they began to turn in and I got in their way and I honked at them long and loud, then pointed to the entrace gate further down the road some 25 meters away. The driver stared at me, I stared back with a frown at them pointed in the direction of the entrance gate and drive off. In my rear view mirror I can see that they turned in anyway.<br><br>Point is; even though I didn't stop or changed their ways, I am most certain they will have both talked about my honking them, and will definitely know they don't have much rights to be angry or feel offended simply because they were going against rules.<br><br></div></blockquote>maybe they might go to some forum and start flaming u there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
