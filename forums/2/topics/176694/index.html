            <div class='col-md body'>I think somewhere before the entrance of the carpark, they should put up a sign stating the parking fee. Especially if you're first timer parking there, 9 out 10 chance is that you won't know the parking fee and some places are so expensive. The sign should actually be displayed in a place where you can still decide whether to utilise the carpark or search for another since it's too costly to park.<br><br>Example are Shaw Tower, the parking charges are so high and yet no grace period and thus the other time my friend drove there to pick up an article from the office cost us $6</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually under Singapore law, the management of the carpark should display the parking rates clearly before the gantry and allow drivers to make a decision whether or not to actually enter the carpark.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, they should put up sign board with price list.<br><br>But by providing an U-turn may be a costly option. Even they do provide this option, they can price it into their parking ticket. In the end, the consumer/driver is going to pay for this - the fur still comes from the sheep.<br><br>Yes, they should provide a 5-10min grace period for people who pickup or drop off and for those who regretted coming into the carpark becos of expensive parking.<br><br>Parking is part and parcel of car ownership. Before committed to buy a car, one should have already factored in this cost. No point buying a car first and complaining this and that expensive later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, majority of the cash card car park does have time allowance. For the first 5-10mins. After which will be full price for the first hour. The rates display are normally at the entrance beside the cash card machine therefore, when you see the rates and dun wan to pay for it, drive it out of the car park immediately within less then 5 mins. Normally when I do that, it displayed " Grace Period"<br><br>Some people take their own sweet time and by the time they exit, grace period is over. All cash card car park duing day time, will charge the full first hour rates after the grace period. They dun go by mins. Normally would be first hour.<br><br>Juz remember, there is such thing call grace period. So far I have not encounter a car park which does not have grace period. Suntec, far east, paragon etc, all have this grace period. All HDB cash card car park have grace period too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by photo_seeker:</div><div class="quote_body">I think somewhere before the entrance of the carpark, they should put up a sign stating the parking fee. Especially if you're first timer parking there, 9 out 10 chance is that you won't know the parking fee and some places are so expensive. The sign should actually be displayed in a place where you can still decide whether to utilise the carpark or search for another since it's too costly to park.<br><br>Example are Shaw Tower, the parking charges are so high and yet no grace period and thus the other time my friend drove there to pick up an article from the office cost us $6</div></blockquote>shaw tower have grace period. I tested before.... less then 5 mins I exited. it show grace period. I tink your fren took longer then that.</div>
