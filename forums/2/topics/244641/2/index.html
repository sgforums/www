LTA promised to convert all Weekend cars to normal plates once ERP has fuly implemented. However, 15 years went by and ERP is still not fully implemented????!!!<br><br>Saturdays are supposed to be considered as weekends too under the pro-family stance that Government is encouraging. Tats the reason why it sounds contradicting cos on one hand..govt is saying Sat is weekend..other hand..OPC cant be used till 3 even if its a weekend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thread Starter,<br><br>May I know how you are going to petition the authorities on this issue? If you are really sincere about petitioning, you should gather everyone's particulars including their OPC registration number and signature instead of starting a thread here and getting flamed by normal plate ppl who don't have a clue to our suffering. With an overwhelming strength of OPC owners who support you, they will surely look into the matter. I personally am an OPC owner and strongly feel that 3pm is unreasonable. Most ppl who work on sat also end at 12 or 1pm and the govt is advocating a 5 day work week. 3pm is more than half the day gone. what is a weekend car when you can't drive on a weekend?

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing about the OPC scheme is it forces people to think whether they really need to use the car or not. If you think about it, if you own a normal car and you want to go to some place nearby within walking distance, you would have no qualms jumping into your car and driving there coz your mindset is you already paid for it. This means additional congestion and pollution on the roads.<br><br>The OPC scheme in a way brings down the number of unnecessary cars on the road and at the same time gives more people the chance to own a car. It forces people to really think whether they need to use the car because paying money per day to use a car has a much more deterrent effect then juz petrol cost. That is why I'm waiting the day when they implement the "pay as you drive" scheme which is a lot fairer. Currently the scenario could be that an OPC car owner pay $20/day for a short trip and a normal car owner pay just $8.20/day ($17000 + $8000 (Road tax rebate over 10 yrs) / ((365days - No. of Sundays + Public holidays) X 10 years) to drive the entire day and contributing many times over the congestion and pollution.<br><br>In my opinion, the price discrepancy between OPC and a normal plate is still too big, so much so that people are still shunning OPC cars and would rather have a normal car to park in the car park most of the time. This price difference should be pulled closer. It then becomes a pioneer version of the "pay as you drive" scheme. More people will choose to use an OPC car and there will be more car owners to contribute taxes to the govt as the upfront cost is cheaper but the numbers don't translate into higher congestion and pollution.<br></div>
