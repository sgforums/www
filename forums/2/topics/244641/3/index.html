            <div class='col-md body'>I agree OPC owners know wat they in for, so shouldn't complain too much...<br><br>But who on earth doesn't want more benefits? If can appeal and try your luck, why not.<br><br>When u out of job and can't find job, u'd willingly take a $1.6k job that tell u no bonus and pay increment $80 a year, hrs 8am-6pm, work Sats. But after working there for some time, sure sian rite? Won't u try to appeal for more bonus or pay? Or because the rule say something and u accept, means its for life? A bit kok...<br><br>Now I know why sgrean all like sheep... govt set some rule = bible liao. Cannot appeal? cannot try to gain more out of it?<br><br>If govt abolish COE now, and next generation of car owners buy car for $25k, but ERP become $20 at all gantries, will you current car owners smile at home thinking "Its ok, we knew what we are in for when we buy car"? Or try to appeal that its unfair to you because you paid COE and now oso have to pay super ex ERP while new owners have lower upfront costs but only usage costs?<br><br>Don't only think in your own shoes sometimes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cars are ridiculously expensive here in the first place; but I guess land here is limited. Anyway, I don't think ERP is helping much to lessen traffic. Maybe the new cut in COE will help somewhat, although most prob prices will go back to the old range of maybe $20 odd k. Still many people who can afford cars.<br><br>Regarding OPC, well, if you own one, of course you'd try to max out whatever you can. If you don't, of course you'll be unhappy that OPC owners are getting 'unfair' advantages.<br><br>As above poster said, it's all about which shoes you are wearing. Fair argument from both sides, IMHO. Maybe that extra 2 hrs on sat can really encourage more family planning and stuff!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Like what we are all trying to say, this is all about dollar and cents and you aint going to get any free lunch from such petition,.<br><br></div>
