When I passed by the small road(leading to TCS, dunnno the name of road), I saw a yellow lotus driven by a young pretty gal. Thought she was going to other place. When I reach adam food court, saw the lotus waiting for a parking lot.<br>sigh...how come there are people who are so rich? Go makan can take bus, but drive a lotus there. very envious....how i wish i was born in such a family... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>got car will drive car la. bus can be mafan also. honestly nothing beats the feeling of having your own transport. so if at home got lotus then drive lotus loh. besides, assuming u either saw an elise or exige, its a small car, small cars r easy to park n good for urban driving. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Some are rich but do not want to show off. Buying private house somemore need to pay heavy property tax, maintainance cost and never enjoy government subsidies.
