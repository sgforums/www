The Defender and The Hummer are both made as a rough terrain mover and not an urban vehicle. Therefore the basis of comparision should be made on this platform.

No one would want a vehicle that is 100% being built to handle off-road conditions, and thus useless in urban environments.<br>And in my opinion, both the above mentioned vehicles are not built solely for the jungle. They are road going vehicles with off-road abilities. If not, why do we see so many hummers and rovers being used on the roads?</div>
