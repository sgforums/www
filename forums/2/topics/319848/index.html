              <p>Hey guys,</p>
              <p>My friends took the school route at Ubi and managed to pass within 3 months, they were allowed to book their final theory and practical test together. But by right, you are only allowed to book your practical test after you pass your final theory. How does that work.</p>
              <p>Can anyone advise which route is faster? Private or School.</p>
              <p>I'm taking private and managed to grab a quick time slot(2weeks only) waiting time for my BTT, trying to push it forward so I can drive my SLK500. =)</p>

              <p><br>Sorry, but I'm pretty sure he booked his FTT and TP together. That's because, his TP was already booked and was only 2 days after his FTT and he had told me(us) that if he failed his FTT he couldn't take his TP.</p>
              <p>So I'm just asking, anyone has any idea how this works?</p>

              <p><br>school is more organised. everything schedule and plan out nicely. don't have to worry about a thing, processing wise also very fast, getting a TP date is also faster as compared to private. due to the fact that out of 10 slots every session, 8 are assigned to school students and 2 are assigned to private students. (heard it from somewhere).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>school is definitely more exp. i spent about 1.8k for school because i took all the peak period lessons (weekend, weekday nights, each lesson is about $80.25). As for private, definitely much cheaper per lesson depending on which instructor u get.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so my advice is to go for school. anyway the government are going to make it that there will be no more private instructors in 2 years time. meaning all have to go to school to take lessons. no more private lessons in future.</p>

              <p><br>Private is much cheaper. And here's why. Let's say you're learning manual and you already know how to get biting-point and how to start moving off, you can just tell the private instructor and he'll skip that part and move on to driving on the road. So you can skip a lot of lessons and save lots of money.</p>
              <p>CDC students compulsory need to learn minimum 19 lessons if I'm not wrong. And when one lesson is around $60, it adds up to a lot of money. Roughly $1200 and that's just practical lessons and this is if you are so pro and you only need 19 lessons.</p>
              <p>You can expect to half that amount if you go for private because you can take less lessons if you already know how to do basic driving. And charges for each practical lessons also much cheaper. At $30 to $40 per lesson.</p>

              <p><br>Okay, If I'm not wrong it's 30-40 per hour and they do 2 hour lessons. Hmm, in a way, say I'm relatively busy would it be advisable to go through 19 lessons(say 3 lessons a week since I'm rushing here) or would it be better to take private.</p>
              <p>Thus the equation would be.</p>
              <p>Time for no. of private lessons - Time to take 19 lessons from school + booking time for private - booking time from school = ?</p>
              <p>If it is positive then school is faster if it is negative then private is faster.</p>
              <p>Also factor in that my mum's relative has friends? at Ubi Driving Centre. Though I seriously doubt that it would help. (Though he said he could)</p>
              <p>Also take into consideration that I am living in the west, whereas Ubi is in the East(reason for that is that they say Ubi is easier to pass - because it's industrial area and you only have to drive in a box shape, whereas for bukit batok you have to drive highway and school zones)</p>

              <p>har... actually ubi is harder to pass because it is an industrial area and many of the big lorries will freak u out.. i havent heard of anyone saying it's easier to pass at ubi..</p>
              <p>and as for the cheaper private, it's confirmed de.. coz my friend 1 time pass 1.1, 1.2k nia.. school impossible to pass with that amt, unless u illegal driving b4 dat liao.. and the instructor tick tick chop chop fast.. and private de is normal 1.5hr per session.. at 22/hr.. so is 33/session(that was my friend's instructor's rate)..</p>
              <p>but as i said, waiting time for TP will be zzz.. if u r rich, just go school, dunid to tink so much liao la..</p>

              <p><br>At least it makes the instructor happy instead of just making the old fella Lee and his lackeys happy. And of course, they charge less than school so at least it sort of alleviates the negative impact.</p>
