My company could be sending me overseas to work in future like maybe 1.5 - 2yrs time for a period of dunno how long. So now I intend to buy a car or rent a car (like for 1 - 2yrs). Would it be more worth it if i rent a car for 2yrs? I don't have to lose the downpayment like 10k for a new car, no need to pay road tax and no need to pay insuarance only need to pay parking and petrol and the monthly car rental. But if rent a car, how about the servicing and repair if anything spoilt?

But if the rental rate per month is $1,400 max as mentioned earlier by pqr, I think it may still be a better choice to get a resale car.  The reason is that the paper loss from a resale car is confined mainly to its COE rebate difference over the next 1-2yrs even though you have to fork out more money for a resale car upfront.<br><br>Let say you rent a car at $1k per month, then over 2 yrs $24k will be gone (exclude petrol, ERP and parking).  But if you buy a reasonably well maintained 3yr old resale car, the real paper loss when you sell it 2yrs later is around $4k to 6k since the COE of such a resale car would be around $20k-$30k.  Of course, this is provided later on you sell the car at a premium to its paper value that is similar to what youÂ’d pay for it when you buy.<br><br>The common costs of petrol, ERP and parking are payable no matter what option you choose, so this is a difference of $18k-$20k in savings which, after factoring the payments for 2yrs of road tax, insurance and normal servicing costs for the resale car, can still leave you with spare cash to buy your own air tickets in case your company sends you overseas without paying for it later.  And if you still find extra savings after that, you can write me a cheque too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Most likely have to top-up near 10k-20k to sell it. The first 1-2 years for long loan period is usually just paying interest, not even getting to the car price yet.<br><br>Best to go for 7-8year old second-hand cars then.</div>
