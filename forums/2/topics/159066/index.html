            <div class='col-md body'>Cant reali decide which model to choose.<br><br>Price latio premium more city IDSI about $3k.<br>However generally latio sports a good ride. City has a better "feel" but seriously at $ 3k it has no kit, fog amps, armrest etc.<br><br>VTEC is almost the same as latio in terms of price. Heard that it is nosier than the IDSI version. However still feel that HONDA cars are generally overprice as it realy offer nothing exciting at all.<br>But the FC do reali interests me alot!<br><br>Any comments from bro out there?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>....for the money u pay, it is the latio but not the premium nor sports. Choose the latio std with normal auto trans.<br>I took this model because both city and latio premium have CVT trans. One big weakness of cvt is it has a belt/pully system in the cvt which have a life span of 150000 km ( about 7yrs ). If the belt snaps it means the gearbox have to be changed...very costly. So if u r unlucky this can happen earlier than full life span.<br>Besides the cvt doesnt give u the kick on gear shifts....but cvt is smoother and gets 10% better FC.<br>The Latio is great esp the keyless entry and starting. My keys r always in the pocket never need to take out. The rear seat leg space is the best among cat A cars. As it was launch only in Mar this yr few people realise how great this car is....esp now the price is 60k. when launched it was 78K... U save 18k in 7 mths.<br>It is also Japan made unlike City. OMV is about the same as City Vtec.</div>

Honda's done a fantastic job with their VTEC technology, but sadly, their interior plastics/design doesn't correspond to their engine technology.<br><br>Ride comfort wise etc, is not up to the price you pay for the Honda marque either. Honda's been consistently priced higher than other Jap saloons, together with Mazda, and i can only say that both marques are overpriced.<br><br>Latios have been known to be extremely fuel efficient, with Latio drivers reporting up to 15.6km/L.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the problem with the latio is both in its looks (it is rather squarish and boxy and hence its back makes it look horrible), and its name (latio.. hm.. sounds like how a singaporean might pronounce "ratio"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  )<br><br>anyway i think features and specifications aside, a car must really be pleasing to the owner's eyes. if not, looking at it every time u drive will be a pain. and what more disaster can there be than when someone makes a nasty comment on the car's looks and the owner actually agrees with it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
