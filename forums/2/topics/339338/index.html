              <p>Booked a car immediately after Nov $2 COE results.  Was glad to be the first few as the price went up by 1K the day after I booked.  </p>
              <p>When I checked the COE results today, I found out that the agent did not bid for me this round!  Asked SE why and there was no direct answers.  Is it common that the agent does not bid if there is a large number of orders? or is it because they want to give to those who paid higher price first?  Anyone to share their experience?  Hopefully the agent will not come back to me and asked me to top-up! </p>
              <p>btw, this is an authorised agent, not a Parallel Import Company.  Thanks.</p>

              <p>when i book last time, the SE told me that the AD may not bid for the next round, or even the 2nd rd. So this was made clear... not sure why your SE did not highlight this...</p>
              <p>who is the AD?</p>

              <p>My guess is...</p>
              <p>If you agreement stated "non-guarranteed", the AD could choose not to bid this time round if they are not confident to get it..Anyway...they didn't state "X consecutive bids"</p>
              <p>Btw..what car did you book? Mit, Kia, or Merc?</p>

              <p>Mind if you share with us the name of the agent? Cos I just ordered a Mit from C&amp;C as well...jus wanna know if I have missed out anything.</p>
              <p>Another question: How can we know if the agent is making a bid for us from the LTA website? Also my agent actually told me about the "three guaranteed bid". How to check and making sure tat C&amp;C actually mean what they say?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>K k .. chill guys .. as the saying goes .. " no man can satisfy all men (mankind) " so .. what i understand was, they will usually bid for those who paid at higher price ie, Garanteed COE takers, those who bought same car but after price increased. So that it's only fair for them to pay higher. On the other hand, it's unfair to those who did not get their COE .. each round of bidding has a quota so, see heng or suay lor .. like this round, too many orders liao .. sure higher priority given to those paid higher price then subsequence to those lower prices. Yep, all the best for the nxt round though .. " to be fair is to be unfair " <br><br>i dont represent anyone .. jus sharing what i understand yeah hehe .. and i m not wrking for any dealers hahahahaha .. cheers guys</p>

              <p>no lah his case is a little different from just now bidding.</p>
              <p>the agent called him to say that they have bidded when they didn't. If I'm not wrong normally the contract is for bidding for x number of times. by telling him that they have bidded once, it means they are telling him he only have x-1 times left and they have actually bidded for one of the times he paid for.</p>
              <p>in a sense they sold him a service that did not perform but claimed they did. sounds like fruad to me.........</p>

Explained my case to him and he said from his pt of view he felt that my SE has not explained the things clearly to me. (Shifting blame to SE) Then i asked a series of qns and here's the ans:<br><br>1) Do we still have another 6 bids since this round not bidded: "No"<br><br>2) Will we be asked to top up money. " Yes if COE doesn't come down to abt 7k.<br><br>3) How come C&amp;C bidded for those who paid 34 999 and nto 32 999. " I shall get my manager to give you a call"<br><br>He also exlained to me why not bidded becos bidding already over quota no pt bidding etc. <br><br>I personally feel that C&amp;C has not been frank and the price dip-$32 999 has conditions (COE less that or abt 7k) attached to it that our SE has not explained clearly. Now they have taken many of our 1k deposit and probably earned some interest from it for the next 3mths before telling us to top up. <br><br>I am discouraged with their services and if they were to ask me to top up, I WILL NOT. I will also complain to CASE abt their terrible service. Hopefully subsequent buyers will not have to encounter this. <br><br>(Thought only parallel importers will resort to such tricks.

              <p>Oh my.... that's the problem when you buy at such cheap prices....</p>
              <p>I emphatise with you but now that you have already booked your car...</p>
              <p>Trust me...there are lots more going to be in the same situation with you...</p>
              <p>Complain to CASE and see how it goes....</p>

He said that they did not bid for me because the stock is not available yet. Stock (black, auto) will come later in dec or mid jan and they will bid the next round. - I will wait and see..<br><br>Anyway, registered my displeasure with them for not telling the truth about not bidding, and also that low selling price has "unwritten" conditions attached. Did not expect a reputable company like C&amp;C to resort to this, and definitely gives me a bad aftertaste!</span></p></div>

              <p>My SE bidded for me for my $32999 deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me share my view...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the price you mentioned I think I booked the same car as you at $32999. I think your SE is not being frank to you by saying C&amp;C has bidded for you but in reality not bidded. For my case, my SE told me truthfully that C&amp;C has bidded for me the exact amount after I told him to find out for me after they bid. This made them know that I'm keeping track of the COE prices and know where to check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, they felt no need to bid, probably because the quota has been reached before they place the bid, knowing that the amount has exceed the amount they projected for your car, you will not get it even if they bid for you. This, I guess the SE should have explained to you clearly. This is essential for salesperson to build trust with their customer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He also told me the 'Mgr' will do something about it the next round of bidding to secure my COE. Judging from the price I'm paying for, I'm taking it with a pinch of salt.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Was following your threads, looking @ the price, guess we book the same "Pic" car. My SE called 3.15pm before the closing of the COE bidding and meantion that since bank has not approved my loan, they decided not to bid for me this time round and I still keep my bid, and I agreed knowing after monitoring the COE bidding price. I not sure does your SE put term such as pending for Bank Approval?</p>
              <p>I did a check with the Bank and was told to check with SE and a call to SE mentioned she has no news yet. Now, I am stuck as in whether did they submit my Bank Loan? Was it approved and SE not letting me know? or what ever.</p>
