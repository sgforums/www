I just joined today. Let me have a chance to give my personal view on the Altis 1.6. Here goes.<br>After driving the Altis for 2 months I find that it is far worse than I am expecting, for the VVTI fuel economical engine is a load of crab! I had being driving 3 Corona, Ford Telstar 1.8(M), 1 Corolla, Opel Zafira 1.8(A) and Altis. This I would say is the worse fuel economical car I had ever driven. My previous Opel can clock 12Km/L and my Altis only clock Ave. 11.5Km/L. It is a very wrong decision that I had make as I thought that the fuel consumption will be about the same as my Collora 1.5LX(M) which I managed to clock easily 15Km/L. Should have stick to my Opel MPV. What is worse is that when I send in to the Borneo service centre they told me Altis is heavier than the previous Japan model. Another load of crab, in fact Altis is lighter. I know because I have both the catalogue. Altis is heavier on the Kerb weight but only less than 10kg. Do yo think it will affect that much? The answer is no.<br>Well, no matter what I am stuck with it for the next ten years.<br>Oh one more thing, thanks for listening <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

There is nothing you can do now right?<br><br>O.K. first of all send it back to Borneo and ask them to check. I have a rattling noise in my Altis too. It is the empty passenger seat next to the driver. When someone seats on it, no more noise. I just ignore it. I changed my wheels to 15" noise very loud. I ramp it to &gt;3000rpm also noise. I also ignore it. If I go along certain express way also loud noise. It can also be your previous car is very quiet therefore you feel that this car is very noisy.<br><br>Don't be surprise that Borneo said that it is normal. That is usually their "normal" answer.<br><br>When all is said, send it to a outside workshop to check. Most probably they will get it fixed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

I don't know about the new Ford Laser, but the old ones were not up to the mark imho. Maybe I'm biased, but my Altis so far hasn't given me any problems, except for a sound which came from a loose brake booster valve. FC so far is an average of 12.2km/L for my first 1000km.<br>Freebies wise, can try to squeeze about $500 of cash rebate or freebies.</div>

X-Boy,<br>you wanna check out the posting by Galleze at "Where to find cheap and good performance parts?". It seems that KNN filters may not be that effective.. ..<br><br>BTW I've installed a ceramic film, huper Optik from BM, quite good but not dark enough for the passenger side. I notice that after my friend installed his v-kool for Kah, although I requested for the darkest possible.<br>Overall not bad, even under noon sun all it takes is just 5min of air-con to cool down the car after parking for lunch.</div>
