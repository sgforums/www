Here goes.<br>After driving the Altis for 2 months I find that it is far worse than I am expecting, for the VVTI fuel economical engine is a load of crab! I had being driving 3 Corona, Ford Telstar 1.8(M), 1 Corolla, Opel Zafira 1.8(A) and Altis. This I would say is the worse fuel economical car I had ever driven. My previous Opel can clock 12Km/L and my Altis only clock Ave. 11.5Km/L. It is a very wrong decision that I had make as I thought that the fuel consumption will be about the same as my Collora 1.5LX(M) which I managed to clock easily 15Km/L. Should have stick to my Opel MPV. What is worse is that when I send in to the Borneo service centre they told me Altis is heavier than the previous Japan model. Another load of crab, in fact Altis is lighter. I know because I have both the catalogue. Altis is heavier on the Kerb weight but only less than 10kg. Do yo think it will affect that much? The answer is no.<br>Well, no matter what I am stuck with it for the next ten years.<br>Oh one more thing, thanks for listening <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>agree with you on Altis FC.... although FE will improve when really run in and change to syn oil but it would not be as good as efficient as 1.5M of course. for Altis , most are getting 11-12km/l average.</div>

The Altis consumtption is only 11km/l at best for my driving condition which is worse than the previous model I owned. I also questioned BorneoService centre. They admitted that the Altis will use more fuel than previous model. But what you gain is a quieter ride than the previous model. But FC is moreimportant to me , so I dumped &amp; traded-in  my Altis to a parallel import 1.8WISH which is averaging 13.8km/L and not fully runned in yet (now only travelled 4000km) Wish is a lot bigger and heavier than the Altis, The WISH has a bigger engine yet better FC and better pick-up And dont worry about having to keep the car for 10 years, you'll be surprised at the trade-in difference you'llhave to top up and get a totally new car (because new car prices have come down a lot) So if you are unhappy about the high FC of the Altis, there is still other alternatives now.CHEERS</div>

Step harder = eat more fuel = more power <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Next time u see a slope, before going to reach the slope, step abit more<br>acceleration, so when u go up the slope. Its would be almost the same speed before u went up the slope. the only different is step more acceleration. after the slope, go easy with the acceleration..<br><br>For the seat belts, i've no problem with it.
