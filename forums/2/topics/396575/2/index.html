              <p>Yes people can borrow but they can only do so subjected to ability to repay within 2 years...Many will find their monthly expenditure shooting up as compared to a loan of over 5-10 years and hence refrain from borrowing beyond their means as they do not want to risk bankruptcy. Then you find the traffic really reducing. Look at the many car buyers today. Talk to a car salesman. Ask the bank officers in loan departments. They will tell you that many downpay a car for just 0-10% of its value. Why? Because of the 10 years loan tenure and these people probably have zilch in their bank accounts. Simple economics will tell you that if that period reduces by a drastic mile, demand will surely drop too.</p>
              <p>And having a great public transport network does little to solve our traffic jams because in Singapore, it is seen as a form of prestige to own cars. If owning cars is just a mere Point A to Point B thing, then everyone would own a freaking Kia Picanto, literally speaking.</p>

              <p>i tot their initial motive for COE is to control the numbers of vehicles on the road...</p>
              <p>anyway, their BEST SOLUTION is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">keep quiet</span></span> whenever they feel that the general public isn't happy about it...</p>
              <p>COE will be here to stay.. like it or not...  the true revenue is based on daily basis, once you de-register your car, the COE will be rebated back to the vehicles owner...</p>

              <p>But MTR &amp; their buses over there are jammed packed during peak hours. No doubt LTA has to purchase more train sets for NSL &amp; EWL.</p>
              <p>Many ppl only see abt ERP. They actually reduced e road tax when they added more ERP back then. So actually those who rarely drive during e ERP hrs ends up benefit. Open up your eyes.</p>
              <p>If you dun want ERP seriously, then control e number of cars if you are so fed up w/ traffic jams. You alrdy know we're land scare.</p>
              <p>The COE formula for e past few years was flawed because it was on a 'magic' projected figure. It's been adjusted recently, but the effect could only be seen years down e road.</p>

              <p>i agree with you. COE is perpetual. So we can do one thing in future: Vote against the PAP and hope one day, the new party is not money at all costs type.</p>

              <p>the thing is this. the garment always need the money to run the government system.</p>
              <p>the critical question is: do they need that much money every year???? look the budget for 2010. about 55 billion.</p>
              <p>so i would say what the next garment can do is to cut down governemt running cost, then the people will not be taxed so heavily,</p>
              <p>agree?</p>

              <p>COE is good. but only use it to control the population. and not issuing more  and more la.</p>
              <p>the garment promise 1.5% car growth, the question is: are we building so much road every year? even with a 0% car growth scenario, the COE can still function well, provided the garment dun anyhow issue the COE la.</p>
              <p>then we dun need the ERP liao ma. becos if you cap the population of car, there wont be jam any more.</p>
              <p>guess the Garment mis cal.</p>
              <p>less coe= less car= less jam. simple.</p>
              <p>and in sg, owning a car under the COE is consider luxury, as long as the COE system is in place, we must recognise this fact and dun complaint when the COE hit the sky, cos COE is mean for those who can afford a car,</p>
              <p>the rest take public. but then again the public suck, i can agree with that age ago.</p>
