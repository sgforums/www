Is it because it is heavy? I find that Sunny is very stable in high speed,cornering is very good too.</div>

Here are some points to consider:<br><br>(1) Fuel tank gauges are never totally accurate.  There is a flotation device in it which measures the level of petrol in the tank....and the flotation device (or its supports) may be faulty.  Its just a simple mechanism which is subject to failure....just like everything else.  And I believe that the fuel tank gauge is something that is not fully tested before shipment.  This may be your case.<br><br>(2) For fuel injected engines, there is an oxygen (O2) sensor on the exhaust side of the engine.  It senses the amount of unburnt oxygen and tunes the petrol feed accordingly.  If the O2 sensor is faulty, it may cause the system to inject more fuel.  Signs of this can be vibrations when idling, etc.  But in your case, its so extreme that you would be able to smell fresh petrol coming out of the exhaust!  Besides, judging from the amount of petrol lost, its probably beyond your ECU's programming.  So this is unlikely your case, I think.<br><br>(3) Your car hasn't yet passed its break-in period.  The piston rings, etc are still tight and there is lots of abnormal friction to overcome.  Cars usually show marked improvement after the first 10,000 km.  But then again, your case is so extreme that this is unlikely the case.<br><br>(4) Petrol tank leaking, tank cap not in place, etc.  I hope this is not the case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Hope you're not a smoker too.....<br><br>(5) The ECU (the micro-controller circuit, the "brains" of the car) may have gone crazy too, injecting too much fuel.  Then again, your case is so extreme that you would be able to smell the unburnt fuel in the exhaust.  So maybe this is not the case.<br><br>(6) Fuel injection pump spoiled or leaking.  Maybe there is a permanently opened nozzle or something....and the fuel is just passing through freely.  Never heard of this before....its something I just came up with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .  Don't think its your case lah.<br><br>The good news is....your car is new and under warranty.  So instead of guessing, its best to bring it back to Tan Chong IMMEDIATELY for inspection.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when my car is first started everyday, the fuel indicator will usualy indicate a slightly higher den wad it actually is..upon tavelling for a few mins den it will reach its ''real'' value..dunno abt other drivers but that's what i experience in my previous and my present car too..<br><br>so my guess is..<br><br>maybe the tank wasnt filled to the brim initially and thus it reaches the ;'half tank'' mark so quickly..secondly, of course its due to the running in period..you'll have to wait and see man..<br><br>bring it to TC for checking is also a good idea..but perhaps observe the car behaviour for a few more days first..im sure you dun like the feeling of waiting at the workshop, having no means of transport to other places...and if you bring it to them now, chances are they will tell you things like '' its normal...car runing in''</div>

If you brought it in now, they may just give you the traditional push-away excuse "Oh, its normal...".<br><br>One way for an immediate self-test is.....<br><br>(1) Fill your tank to the brim.  Like those who go to JB to fill up like that....until a bit of the petrol overflows.<br><br>(2) Run the car for maybe 100 km - you can do this over 2-3 days or whatever.<br><br>(3) Repeat step 1 again - only this time, note how many litres goes in.<br><br>(4) Take the number of km travelled divided by the number of litres which went in.  And you have the *very approximate* km/litre.<br><br>From there, you will know if the fuel gauge is a bit messed up.<br><br></div>
