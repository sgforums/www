            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, was walking around ubi 2nd hand car shop dealers a few days ago and i noticed a car that looked strangely familiar. Upon closer inspection, i noticed it was my uncles old car which he sold for 41k. Out of curiosity i asked for the price and was quoted $48,800. WTF ? The dealers mark up so much ? My dad was thinking of getting a 2nd hand car as a second car... but after finding out abt the7k mark up, we were abit skeptical about getting a 2nd hand car.. so can anyone tell me.. is this incredible profit margin applicable to all companies ? and where can I get a second hand car whereby i wont get ripped off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course if you can afford, brand new car would be best. if you are going to buy direct from car owner, few things u have to look out for. accident car? do you know how to tell if the car owner lies about it? problems with the car ie, gear box needs change or engine problems. these are just some of the few things to look out for.<br><br>If you do not think you can cope or handle these issues, maybe it is still better to go to a car dealer.... you can usually go back to the car dealer if these issues come up within the warranty period.</div>
