For manual car, when going down the hill, v engage to LOW Gear. But in auto, does it means that engage to "D" and it will automatically do the rest for u.(LOW gear)<blockquote></blockquote></div>

It is called "Over-drive OFF". Since u had said that, it makes me more confuse. Hope u can clarify with me. The sales men told me to switch the "Over-drive OFF" button when u r ridding on highway (110KM/H) or intend to overtake during high speed. It said, doing so will give u power and less fuel consumption. Ok, agree.But, u said the "O/D" will always transmit up to 3rd gear at most. If so, then can i said that during high speed drive. O/D is not advice to be turn on. As, the engine need to be in top gear for smooth driving. If so, then can i said wat the salesman comment is wrong?? Pls clarify with me with 1 is correct ************* [/u][/u]<br><br>****and u also comment that during up hill. To gain more power, again i need to push the "over-Drive OFF" button.</div>
