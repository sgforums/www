              <p>A 30-YEAR-OLD hit-and-run driver who killed a 79-year-old woman - while he was barred from driving - had his original one-year jail term upped to four years on Thursday by Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong.</p>
              <p>In raising the sentence of Charles Lee Cheow Loong after an appeal by prosecutors, CJ Chan noted that this was one of the worst traffic violation cases to come to court.</p>
              <p>Lee's original jail term, handed down in a district court last December, was 'horribly inadequate', said the CJ, noting that at the time of the accident, on Nov 16, 2006, Lee was two months into an 18-month suspension for drink driving.</p>
              <p>
              
              But Lee defied the law and got behind the wheel again. 'This time, he killed somebody,' said the CJ.</p>
              <p>Lee was speeding along Eu Tong Sen Street at about 6.40am when he knocked down Madam Pang Kong Hoon at the junction of Pearl's Hill Terrace.</p>
              <p>Instead of stopping to help her, he drove off and parked the car at a basement carpark in Balestier.</p>
              <p>But the license plate of the car was left at the scene and police went knocking on his door that afternoon.</p>
              <p>Lee turned himself in only at about 10.30am the next day, more than 28 hours after the accident.</p>
              <p>Last November, Lee pleaded guilty to five charges: causing Madam Pang's death by his rash driving; driving under disqualification; failing to give help; moving the BMW without permission; and driving without insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>Two other charges of failing to stop after an accident and not making a police report were taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>He was jailed for a year and banned from driving for 10 years. The prosecution appealed.</p>
              <p>Solicitor-General Walter Woon pressed the court for a jail term of between three to four years.</p>
              <p>He said that given Lee's propensity to ignore court orders and his lack of a sense of responsibility, the public can be protected only if he is locked up for a substantial period.</p>
              <p>Lee's lawyer, Mr Alan Moh, argued that Lee had 'exceeded the speed limit but was not exceedingly fast', and said his client had turned himself in 28 hours.</p>
              <p>He also argued that his client 'leaving the scene was inevitable' because he was fearful of being beaten up by a gathering crowd. But this did not wash with the CJ, who admonished the lawyer for 'making the case worse' with his arguments.</p>
              <p>After the hearing, Lee's parents and relatives created a scene outside the courtroom, ranting, cursing and decrying the justice system. Police officers had to persuade them to</p>

              </tbody>
              </table>
              </p>
              <p>In my opinion, similar to most, the sentence should have been a lot more severe. Look at it this way, minimum 10 years jail sentence inclusive 6-8 strokes of the cane. That would probably be a good place to start. First of all this joker is a repeat offender, 1st strike: Driving under the influence, 2nd strike: Disobeying court order/ Driving without insurance, 3rd strike: HIT &amp; RUN! How in the world did the first sentencing come up with only a 1-year jail term?!</p>
              <p>79 year old victim, so what?! Going too die soon so no big deal?! It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone of us/ our loved ones. I for one, not all for capital punishment but in this case I say throw the book at this clown, slap his relatives with charges in contempt of court. And I do hope the relatives of the deceased pursue a civil suit and collect damages. Since both accused &amp; family show no remorse. No one should be above the law.</p>

              <p>Yah the original sentencing of 1 year was extremely lenient.  Not sure what the judge was thinking about. </p>
              <p>Even 4 years sounds on the low side given this person's atrocious record. </p>
              <p>The part about Lee's parents and relatives creating a scene outside the courtroom, ranting, cursing and decrying the justice system made me very sad. They probably thought that their son should get away scot-free. With parents and relatives behaving like that, no wonder Lee turned out this way.</p>

              <p>Yeah, oso this indian fellow driving with a suspended license
              due to unpaid road-tax.... He got banned from driving for 99 years
              + imprisonment 2-3 years. But his
              lawyer plea-bargained, got him an offer to re-take his license
              provided he paid a hefty fine, umm.., I think $5000/- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> he had served the
              <strong>full sentence</strong>. Like that still considered fair, he
              didn't kill anyone yet. Got 2-3 years le. This Lee clown only
              1 year, den now 4 years?! KNN.., where's his <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>lifetime
              ban</strong></span>?? Wonder if he's related to SG's "Royal
              Family"? :P</p>
