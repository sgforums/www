No turbo and not a 2-dr car, I wonder how much to pay for insurance annually.</div></blockquote>Ha ha ... I am having the FD2R now n when I compared it to my friend Evo 9... the Evo is a very very comfy car indeed.... if that give you the idea how this car rides.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Fuel comsumption is about as stated 10-ish km/l or maybe less depending how often you get the vtec working (fyi mostly city driving n using rather heavy mineral oil 20- 50w vis) ...therefore if get mostly expressway driving n coupled with fully synthetic with 5-30w vis ... should not be a problem to achieve 11km/l or more at least ..... )<br><br>For those who have been complaining about the handling of this car being a FF..... think they should shut up before test driving one of these type R. This car is incredible for the price...... it runs well, steering very direct n understeering is almost non existence.... n most importantly it sounds really good.... sounds like a proper race car ...... something not in a stock Evo.....n when it comes to track driving this is just a gem to drive.<br><br>FYI if anyone wants to race with you on the track ... get them to race you 6-10 laps at Sepang non stop ... n see how to turbo guys lose their power n struggle to keep up with you ..... btw never run hot lap with them .... coz they can just crank up their boost n get away with an impressive single lap time quite easily..... instead ask for a proper racing style...... 6-10 laps n I am sure they won't accept this offer coz you know why!!!!  ha ha ... hopes it help   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the valuable inputs. Seems like Type R is the real deal, hahaha. I appreciate its high REV and heard good things about how sweet the engine roars. I have sent out email to some PIs to arrange for a test drive. Hope they allow me to try it out 1st. =)</div>

The price is also about there...but somehow I'm in love in type R. You will understand.<br><br>By the way, anyone know if any PI allows test drive? I wanna try out if the HARD riding is too extreme for me. And is Advancar good?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Dad Owns a JDM Civic Type R. He Bought if from Vincar at 101k eariler this year. Insurance is definately less than a EVO's and road tax is good because its a 2litres . Everyday Driving is good too because its relatively Quiet under 3k revs. On the other hand its good for overtaking others with its great acceleration. I take it to school everyday.<br><br>One last thing to make you love the JDM type r More. It Actually Churns out 238bhp at 8600rpm and i think its still cheaper than the Swindon Type R Kah Motors is selling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>To Validate all the info im saying , im posting a pic of the 3 month old civic<br><img src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee124/dlts92/CivicTypeRonsgforums.jpg"><br><br></div>
