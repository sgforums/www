VVTI is meant for fuel saving but dohc is for more power.<br><br>Hope this can give you some understanding about it. </div></blockquote>think i need to correct u on this point...u have a misunderstanding on VVTI vs DOHC... DOHC stands for Double Over Head Cam while VVTI is Variable Valve Timing with Inteligience which is a valve controlling technology to close certain valves when not required thus saving more fuel. if u want to talk about valve technology, u should be using VVTI vs VTEC... VTEC means Variable Valve Timing and lift Electronic Control. VTEC is more because it has another set of cams for hi lift producing more peak BHP.<br><br>ok, talking about DOHC...most vehicles are using DOHC nowadays compared to olden days where SOHC(single overhead cam) is more common. DOHC is used to produce more power but results in lousier FC but compensating that is modern technology like VVTI, I-DSI to operate sufficient valve for better FC.</div>
