            <div class='col-md body'>i own a honda city which i bought for around 62k with 30% downpayment and 7 yr loan. for that, i am paying 640 per mth for instalments.<br><br>then there is the season parking of 88 per mth. and of course petrol. honda city is quite fuel efficient - i can achieve on the average 15 to 16 km/l. my daily journey to work and back is 40km. usually only go out during weekends. for that, half a tank lasts me for about a wk. and with all these conditions, i pay around 1k for instalments, season parking, and petrol.<br><br>i havent added in maintenance,  and road tax, which is 900+ per yr, and parking and erp. lucky thing i dont go into the CBD often, except for shopping trips to orchard during weekends. so they dont go into much.<br><br>hope this helps. bottom line is, look for fuel efficiency esp since petrol is ex now; down more upfront if possible so as to save on interest.</div>
