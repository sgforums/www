Because first you condemned street racing, or at least quite obviously gave that impression. Following that, you ask people how to "tackle devil's bend". You don't have a bloody licence even, and you want to talk about tackling one of the most dangerous bends in Singapore.<br><br>Secondly, you have obviously contradicted yourself over and over again, and then try to cover up by giving some effing stupid excuse. "But no motorist". LJ understand? Just because there is no dick in the pants doesn't mean there is nothing if you kick it. Unless of course, we're talking about ball-less people here.<br><br>I will maintain my stand, for another time again, that you are being stupid. I won't mince my words. You are getting on my nerves, not to mention others' as well, by consistently and persistently spouting utter nonsense. It's so bad, it would make nuclear waste look like cheesecake.</div>
