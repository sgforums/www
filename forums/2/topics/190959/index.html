That'll only upset the balance of the car.<br><br>1stly, what car are u assuming u're in?<br><br>Personally, assuming im approaching it at 150km/h and im in a 4WD sportscar, I would most likely have a braking point picked out aready. I would be in 4th gear or possibly 3rd. Seeing as Devil's Bend is an off camber turn, and I'm in a 4WD car, I might go for a late apex approach as I am expecting understeer under acceleration. If I'm taking a middle apex I would take entry speed to be around 80km/, depending on the car's traction. Personally I would still opt for a late apex approach, with an entry speed of perhaps 60km/h, but gaining the ability to start accelerating earlier.<br><br>With a neutral apex approach, assuming in 4th, I would brake with my right foot. Assuming I'm in 3rd, I would brake with my left. if in 4th gear I would have to downshift to 3rd before entry(hence braking with right foot). If in 3rd, I won't downshift. I would then depend on left foot braking to keep the understeer in check.<br><br>Personally since I prefer a late apex approach, I will downshift to 2nd, whether im in 3rd or 4th. turn the car in at about 60, get it straightened out as early as possible and accelerate out of the turn, ideally upshifting into 3rd after performing most of the turn just before I take my late apex. Due to the shallower trajectory of a late apex approach, although turn in speed is lower, as the tyres don't need as much emphasis on lateral grip, and can accept a higher radial load, thus enabling a higher rate of acceleration, I expect to be able to exit the corner faster, accelerating harder. Point of acceleration can be before the apex, controlled with smoothness of the throttle inputs, not just stomping on it outright.<br><br>Aboveall, all transition in cornering phase has to be smooth, the turning of the wheel has to be smooth, any corrections should be in small smooth inputs. Big jerks of the wheel will just upset the balance of the car and slow u down.<br><br>And drifting this corner will most likely kill u, because its off camber.
