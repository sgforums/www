I also almost filter into another car last time. But at least I have already signaled. We were taught to check blind spot, but never have I know that a damn 2.0L can actually squeeze itself into that spot beside/behind my Kelisa. Got a horn and I siam to slow down and let it pass, then filter.<br><br>But no excuse for not signaling, especially for new guys.</div>
