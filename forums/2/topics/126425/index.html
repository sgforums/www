I thought it is worst than singapore. And btw, MY is also not a place to show of your wealth, unless you are prepared to be on the kidnapper's hit list and hire a your own troop to protect yourself and your family.<br><br>Owning a ferrari in sg is not exactly that expensive lah and definitely you dont need to make millions per year. The most economical way is to buy a used one. If you are lucky, sometime you might even make a little profit if you sell it after a year. I would say that for a used one it will cost in the region of about 50K per year, inclusive of normal repairs and depreciation.<br><br></div>

Not sure if anyone scrimped and saved to buy a Ferrari for daily driving and as the only car.<br><br>My fren's 360 modena (intending to change to 430 soon), of coz bot by the Dad. Got many other cars.<br><br>Doing own business. Some supply thingie.<br><br>Maintenance wise i not too sure, but parts of coz super ex. Tink he changed the rear vents thingie (dunno wat its called) to CS one (the black one) and it was like $3k.<br><br>I saw on Top Gear tat just to paint the CS stripe from factory cost a few thousand pounds (tink 3000 pounds). Ridiculous!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a misconception that Ferraris are out of the reach of the middle class in terms of money.You can easily get a 348, 328 or 308 GTS or GTB models for below $150k.Mondial Ts and Mondial Convertibles, though rare, are available around that range too.<br><br>I knew of a Dino 308GT-4 which was going for $70k and a 246GT for $60K.<br><br>However, cost aside, the main hurdle to owning and driving a prancing horse is to possess a good knowledge of your car's ability and weakness.The older generation Ferraris need someone to keep it in tip-top shape, regular DIY maintenance is enough for the carburettor models, esp the 308 GTS.GTB and the GT-4.Do give them a blast now and then, because their engines are designed for high-speeds, so let them work out , so to say. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It's not too hard to own a Ferrari, however most corporate guys won't be driving one due to fear of breaking some hierarchy in the office. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Keep it in your garage as a 2nd car.It's a fun thing to have.<br><br>Try a Maserati if you prefer a more normal road-going car.But the older Biturbo models are vanishing, and only a few Ghiblis are left in SG.</div>
