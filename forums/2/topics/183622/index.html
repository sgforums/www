            <div class='col-md body'>By Ernest Luis<br><br>March 24, 2006<br><br>SINGAPOREANS, start your engines.<br><br>Get ready for screeching tyres, ear-piercing sounds and the smell of burning rubber.<br><br>Come next March, Singapore should have its first proper motor-racing track in Tuas.<br><br>The western region may seem a bit ulu (remote), a faraway area where Singaporeans don't head to for leisure.<br><br>But Singaporeans, especially motor sports fans, will start to see Tuas in a different light.<br><br>Work on the track, named Tuas International Speedway, is expected to start in May.<br><br>Privately owned, it will cost an estimated $80 million.<br><br>But the racetrack will not be able to host Formula One races to rival that of Malaysia's 5.54km-long Sepang circuit.<br><br>The New Paper has learnt that the 3.37km circuit can only match FIA International Class 2 specifications.<br><br>Formula One tracks need Class 1 classification as extra land area is needed for safety purposes such as wide run-offs.<br><br>For now, Tuas International Speedway will be able to stage Formula 3 races, such as the popular events held in Macau, GT (Grand Touring) races and lower categories.<br><br>It's situated on a plot of land measuring about 600sqm - between Asia-Pacific Breweries and Raffles Marina along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim, just before the Tuas checkpoint.<br><br>It is understood that the lease for the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) land is for 20 years, and a deal will be sealed soon.<br><br>An initial launch is expected next month.<br><br>Said a corporation spokesman: 'JTC Corporation is in the final stages of negotiations to award to a private-sector consortium a site in Tuas, to develop a motor racetrack capable of holding races of international standards.<br><br>CLEARANCES<br><br>'The consortium is expecting to receive clearances from various regulatory agencies within a short time. More details will be made known probably in a month's time.'<br><br>The plot of land was targeted last year, in a bid spearheaded by Singapore Agro Agriculture, which is behind food-and-retail hub Turf City and kampung-style farm produce centre Farmart in Tengah.<br><br>Its four main business partners have formed a new company to run the racetrack.<br><br>They have been tight-lipped on the project since early last year.<br><br>But The New Paper has been tracking these developments since last April, when we published possible plans being studied for a Formula One street circuit in the Shenton Way/Marina Bay area.<br><br>A check with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority showed that Tuas International Speedway Pte. Ltd. was was registered on<br>26 Nov. The company was described as 'Car Racing Track Operators'.<br><br>But, what good is a racetrack without a major event?<br><br>Well, yesterday, the Japan GT Association (JGTA) confirmed there were negotiations to bring its popular series to Tuas International Speedway in June next year.<br><br>The Japan GT Championship stars former Formula One drivers such Ralph Firman (ex-Jordan in 2003) and Erik Comas (ex-Ligier and Larousse in the early 1990s).<br><br>In a phone interview from Japan, Satoru Tsuyama, 52, Pacific-Rim manager for JGTA, said: 'We are interested in bringing our championship to Singapore next year, once the operator has the track ready.<br><br>'Right now, Malaysia's Sepang circuit is the only international race we have on our calendar.<br><br>'The Japan GT Championship has always been looking to go more international and is the first Japanese series to do so.<br><br>'The Sepang race has points counted towards the overall championship, so drivers take it seriously.<br><br>'But if Japan GT comes to Singapore next year, the race will probably be an exhibition race at first.<br><br>'We need to see and assess how Singaporeans respond, and if sponsors in Singapore are willing to back the event, before we make it a permanent race with points counting towards the championship.'<br><br>The Sepang leg of the Japan GT Championship started in 2000, but was an exhibition race until 2002, when it became a permanent points-scoring fixture in the nine-round annual championship. It is held every June.<br><br>Tsuyama added: 'The crowd figures have been rising for Sepang. In 2004, there were about 25,000 fans. Last year, there were 38,000 fans, our highest so far in Sepang.'<br><br>20,000 SPECTATORS<br><br>Tuas International Speedway is expected to accommodate up to 20,000 spectators.<br><br>If the Japan GT race does come to Singapore, it would probably be held a week after the Sepang race, to cut down on travel and logistics.<br><br>The small Singaporean motor sports community is already abuzz with anticipation.<br><br>And fingers are crossed as fans wait for Tuas International Speedway to rev up to top speed in the next year.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Motorsports park theme for Tuas circuit<br><br>A MOTORSPORTS park seems to be the main focus of Tuas International Speedway, along with major races being held throughout the year.<br><br>Apart from plans to bring in the Japan GT Championship race next June, Singapore motorsports fans can enjoy a few other forms of racing.<br><br>The race circuit in Tuas will also feature a 1.1km-long go-kart track, built alongside the main track.<br><br>For years the Singapore motor sports community has been looking forward to a permanent racetrack.<br><br>Go-karting is widely seen as the 'primary school of motor racing' if Singapore is to develop a generation of racecar drivers.<br><br>And the business potential has already been acknowledged in previous reports.<br><br>Defensive driving courses could also be on offer at the track.<br><br>Motor enthusiasts will be able to tune up their cars at a variety of specialist shops at the circuit.<br><br>And car companies can do tyre-testing and product-testing there.<br><br>Even hiring the track for leisure racing will be possible.<br><br>This will mean Singapore car clubs and companies won't necessarily travel to Malaysia's Sepang and Pasir Gudang circuits to satisfy their thirst for speed.<br><br>Restaurants are expected to be built as part of the grandstand in a clubhouse about four storeys high.<br><br>It will feature a lounge area, spa and a play area for children.<br><br></div>

But at this moment I'm not complaining.. coz at least I have a place to chiong!<br><br>Also, with this track, owning a track car (non road registered race car) in Singapore will be cheaper and easier.  Can store at the track or at home (pay $50 tow to track if wanna use.)<br><br>And if it gets really expensive... we still have PG next door.. hahaha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Understand that it will be quite a good track. I believe the main reason for the expensive price is due to the cost of land in singapore. Let home the "waste land" at Tuas will not cost a fortune for the operator.</div>

COE is unlikely 2 pose any obstacles considering such cars are gonna be run in a closed private circuit. think of a person racing his lawn mower around his own backyard. dun think garmen can give him a ticket for having no COE 4 it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
