              <p>The COE for all categories of cars have breached $20K[<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1031922/1/.html">Link</a>] - car dealers accurately predicted this in Sep 2009 when the govt cut the number of COEs by 16%[<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_434182.html">Link</a>].
              Yes, what to do? More people want cars and Singapore has only so many
              roads so we have to ration car ownership and control the use of cars.
              The COE is a unique solution and the ERP is fairly unique - some
              countries collect toll for the use of highways but the ERP is a finer
              grained solution controling the use of stretches of roads that are
              congested. If the COE system is necessary - we were told that we will
              have crippling traffic jams without the COE, why haven't cities without
              COE fallen apart? Why are we the only ones with COE?..I'll answer this
              later.<br><br>In many countries, having a family car is very common if
              not a necessity but in Singapore it is considered a luxury and owning
              one is dream for many working class families. Because the number of
              COEs is fixed every year depending on the number of cars deregistered
              and allowing for a small limited growth, it is build into the system
              that many, if not most, families will never own a car. By importing
              more people who also compete for the limited number of COEs, even fewer
              Singaporeans can realise this dream.<br><br>The COE is allocated based
              on a bidding system i.e. it is allocated based on ability to pay rather
              than a person's needs. A family with 3 children has no priority over
              the teenage son of a tycoon - it is all decided based on who can spend
              more money. Now superimpose this COE system on a society with the
              highest level of income inequality in the developed world...hmmm what
              do you get? Then you supplement this with a 'for profit' public
              transport system which has shareholders to answer to. What you get is a
              transport system that people are constantly unsatisfied with. Cars are
              not going to the people who need it - families with children or
              individuals with disability but to people with money ...and a public
              transport system that has to tradeoff between service quality and
              profits for shareholders. Caught is this system is the working class
              father who has to carry his baby's stroller up a sardine packed bus and
              the mother who has to carry the baby and perhaps control a toddler who
              can't get a seat because the bus is packed and the tired Singaporean on
              the priority seat has closed his eyes and pretended to doze off.<br><br>Today
              as I was getting onto the MRT, I noticed that they have hired a woman
              wearing gloves at the platform. What are the gloves for? This woman
              will instruct the people on crowded trains to 'move to the center'. If
              they are too deaf or too stubborn, she will start using her hands to
              move them- that is why she needs the gloves. Why can't a supposedly
              world class govt run a public transport to maximise comfort for
              commuters without hiving it off to profit-seeking shareholders who want
              passengers to be packed like cattle so they can maximise their profits?<br><br>Now
              for the great mystery - why do we need the COE system when no other
              city's transport system has collapsed without implementing it? Why
              doesn't Seoul of pop. density double that of Singapore need to have
              COE? What about Tokyo....why hasn't it collapsed from a traffic
              gridlock without COE? What about Taipei which has a population density
              1.5 times that of Singapore? We ended up with this unique COE system
              that brought in more revenue for the PAP govt from car ownership than
              any other govt in the world and we also have the one of the most
              profitable, if not the most profitable public transport system per
              capita (aka SMRT) in the world....actually the public transport system
              in most countries lose money. So what is the explanation for this great
              mystery?<br><br>The demand for cars depends a lot on the quality of
              service of the public transport system. If you take 2 hours driving to
              work, you will switch to the MRT if it gets you there in 1 hour. This
              is why most Tokyo residents leave their cars at home and take the
              subway - 1 in 2 households in Tokyo own cars[<a href="http://www.japaneconomynews.com/2007/08/20/japans-per-household-car-ownership-down-in-2006/">Link</a>]
              but less than 10% use it to get to work. Most govt curb the growth of
              the car population and usage by investing heavily in public transport
              to make the network extensive and rides comfortable to lower the demand
              for cars[<a href="http://www.apta.com/resources/reportsandpublications/Documents/land_use.pdf">Link</a>].
              The Taipei subway for example arrives at less than 1 minute intervals
              during peak hours. In Seoul, the public transport network in up and
              running before people start moving into new residential areas to
              encourage them to use the public transport instead of buying cars.<br><br>By
              implementing its unique COE + ERP system, the PAP has been able to
              create a new source of revenue. At the same time, there is less
              pressure to improve the public transport rapidly now that the govt is
              able to control the absolute number of cars - the shares in public
              transport company have been sold to profit seeking shareholders and the
              public transport company now has to generate profit to distribute as
              dividends to these shareholders .No other city even those with far
              higher population density has needed to curb car population using a
              vehicle quota system....and no other govt in the world has been able to
              collect more revenue from car ownership than the PAP.</p>

              <p>Actually I am also find it quite interesting how they never promote any other kind of alternative transport EXCEPT public transport.</p>
              <p>Do you see them building up infrastructures for bicycles? Which are becoming more and more popular nowadays? If anything the roads are too unsafe for cyclists, and it's illegal to cycle on the footpath.</p>
              <p>I went to China and was surprised by their promotion of alternative transport. A family may not have a car but they can have an 300SGD electric scooter that serves as rather viable transport getting around the city. Somehow for us it's just the bus, or train... or be prepared to pay through your nose for a car. Nothing else.</p>

              <p>Cars are expensive to own and maintain in any of the asian tiger economy. The point was to call bluff on the often repeated phrase of " world class transportation system" and the necessity of COE system.

              <p>Laurence's ah pa, from here, we can really appreciate and understandÂ the Govt implementation of Gst isÂ to help the poor.</p>
              <p>Unless you are rich, you go buy cars and properties, then the Govt charge Gst, a car that cost 200k with COE will incur a Gst of 14k, a house cost 1 milllion will incur a Gst of 70k, altogether will be 84k, more than a typical lowerÂ singaporean annual income,...for the poor, you dun go buy these and that for the sake of losing out in status, you can live in 3 rooms, take public transports or walk..and yet you get lots of reliefs for 3 rooms and also can apply for bursaries, transport vouchers, U stretch voucher, etc etc...all from the contribution of the RICH.</p>
              <p>Our taxation system is build in a way to tax the rich, not like other countries that tax all or some even worst, only tax the poor.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Laurence,</p>
              <p>Why not? Did you know 5 years ago hair stylist was very wanted in aussie? USA is employing nurse from all over the world? WHY NOT?</p>
              <p>Maybe u don't have the skills and refuse to even try? If FT can leave their kids and wife @ home and come Singapore to look for work WHY NOT YOU??</p>
              <p>Few years ago I couldn't find job in Singapore so I went to find job overseas. I was working in Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, India all for projects but I never thought of giving up my Singaporean citizenship because after 3-4 years wondering around I still find Singapore beautiful. Don't just hear what ppl say. Don't just read forum. Go out and experience it - work in that country for a few years and u will know.</p>
              <p>Btw Taiwan is a great country - it's probably the only country I feel home [surrounded by nice chinese ppl] but try experience buildings shaking when u sleeping and politics there is a mess still I love Taiwan and their beautiful mountains when I retire I am going to sell of everything in Singapore and go Taiwan! :D *yeah*</p>

              <p>Superior would be a strong word, I would say they are better than Singapore's in some aspects. The PAP likes to portray Singapore and its policies as omnipotent and superior and the rest of the world as inferior.... but the truth is very far off.......</p>
              <p>As mentioned in the article," The Taipei subway for example arrives at
                                                                                              less than 1 minute intervals during peak hours"Â  Their MRT are in no way inferior to ours and have better frequency.</p>
              <p>In Tokyo, its rather obvious. Jam packed it may be, the cold weather allows for greater contact between passengers.</p>
              <p>1.The superiority of the Tokyo Public Transport lies in the extensive network of rail that touches all over Tokyo. Little need to own a car there.</p>
              <p>2. The trains arrive on a very accurate schedule, which makes very efficient route planning with minimal waiting time.</p>
              <p>3. They have express trains that skips many stations which allows you to reach home faster than travelling by car</p>
              <p>As mentioned in the article, the public voted with their feet as only 10% of the population travel to work by car despite a much higher car ownership percentage.</p>
              <p>PAP likes to bang so loud that they are "bestest" with flowery language such as "world class transport system". The truth is that if it is run by the civil servants in Japan, Korea, Taiwan or Hong Kong, it will be at least be just as good, if not, better than the Singapore system. It would be definitely be a less mercenary one....</p>

              Calvin before I reply u I just want to tell u I am not a PAP supporter but let me rational for u. Govt did try to improve that where we have Chinatown line and circle line etc but before they can justify building those lines they need a LARGE population base yes now we become as cramp as those countries u mention. Did u know COE use to be 60k?? 
              
              If I have the choice I rather stay in Singapore of the 80s . It may not have a lot of MRT lines and buses but @ least I am a happy Singaporean. If govt remove COE u may own a Car but the jam will kill u too.
