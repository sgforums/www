            <div class='col-md body'>When I was in NZ, I was required to pass their theory and practical driving test even though I hold a Singapore valid driving license for decades. Driving license from other countries such as Europe, America, South Africa &amp; etc need not seat for their practical driving test to get a driving license. I thought this country was discriminating, especially when Singapore driving test is more stringent then them. When I return after many years there, I realize NZ authority make the right decision. We donÂ’t signal when we change lane or overtaking. Vehicles donÂ’t give way to pedestrians even if the pedestrians have the right of way. Driving in Singapore is very stressful.</div>

This will give you room to pick up speed before joining the faster lane. This will avoid slowing down the traffic.<br></div>
