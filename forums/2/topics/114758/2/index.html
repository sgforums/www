You can post your worries and doubts here. I can give you some tips or two before yr next tp test coz I just passed mah and the driving steps are still fresh in my mind. I've just started driving my new auto-car and boy, it's much much more easy to operate than the manual one. For now, you just concentrate on perfecting yr hand and footwork coordination and the confidence will automatically flow in too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
