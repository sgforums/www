              <p><span> Business Times - 09 Jul 2008 <br> <br><strong>Toyota speeds up to regain top spot for first half of year </strong><br> <br>By SAMUEL EE</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">AFTER starting the year
              in an unfamiliar position as runner-up, Toyota finally pushed the pedal
              to the metal in June to wrest the No 1 ranking back from Honda by the
              end of the first half of the year. <br> <br>Toyota has been
              Singapore's top brand since 2002. From January to June 2008, Toyota,
              including luxury division Lexus, registered a total of 7,346 passenger
              car sales among members of the Motor Traders Association of Singapore
              (MTA). The world's biggest carmaker overtook Honda's 7,212 units after
              trailing the latter for the first five months of the year. MTA is a
              grouping of authorised distributors. Their sales do not include those
              of parallel importers, who have recently been experiencing record
              business. <br> <br>The key to authorised Toyota distributor Borneo
              Motors' turnaround is the Corolla Altis - the company's best-seller and
              a former perennial winner of Singapore's most popular model award. A
              new version of this stalwart was unveiled earlier this year and it was
              only from the second quarter that deliveries to customers began. <br> <br>'The
              Altis was launched in late March and we didn't have any equivalent
              models to sell during that period,' says Mark Choong, South Asia
              chairman of Inchcape Motors, which owns Borneo Motors Singapore. 'But
              once it started to take off, it was only a matter of time before we
              caught up with Honda.' <br> <br>With average monthly deliveries of more than 600 units of the Altis, it was no surprise that Toyota raced back to the top of the sales charts. <br> <br>Mr Choong says other
              models that did reasonably well in the first six months of this year
              were the Camry mid-size saloon and the recently-arrived Wish compact
              MPV. <br>'They helped to contribute to the volume,' he says,
              adding that the 1.5-litre Vios sedan also did 'pretty well because it
              is in the smaller-car range'. <br> <br>'It is affordable and
              economical. All these are critical factors in the current market',
              which is focused on running costs, adds Mr Choong. <br> <br>High pump
              prices have also spurred demand for the Prius petrol- electric hybrid,
              but Mr Choong says Borneo is unable to get enough cars to sell because
              of supply issues. <br> <br>Further down the sales chart, Mitsubishi ended the first six months of 2008 in third place with 3,983 units, while Nissan was fourth with 2,863 cars. <br> <br>Mercedes-Benz
              was in fifth place overall with 2,127 passenger cars, making the
              three-pointed star the most popular premium brand in Singapore. Right
              behind it at No 6 was traditional rival BMW with 1,890 units. <br> <br>At
              No 7 was Subaru. The once niche Japanese carmaker has gone a little
              more mainstream, and since then it has been speeding up the sales chart
              from when it ended 2007 at No 9. <br> <br>Korean marque Hyundai - previously a regular feature in the top three a few years back - was eighth with 1,828 units. This number could have been higher if the 627 Sonata taxis registered in the first half were included. <br> <br>As for the No 1 model in the first half of 2008, that accolade went to the Honda Civic with 3,283 units,
              including the hybrid variant but excluding the three-door Type R. In
              2007, it was the Mitsubishi Lancer, after displacing the Toyota Corolla
              which had held the top spot for five years before that. <br> <br>The runner-up from January to June this year was the Toyota Corolla Altis with 2,539  units, despite being in the market for only three full months. <br> <br>Rounding off the top three was the Toyota Vios with 1,925 units.</span></p>

Ok maybe the new Altis isn't so bad compared to the previous versions which just sort of screams UNCLE. The new Vios however, just doesn't cut it, at least thats what I think...</p></div>
