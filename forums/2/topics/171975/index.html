If you dun do it early, it'll be difficult when all the commitment comes in (ie. family, children, business).</div>

But for someone with such an attitude and with such a blatant disregard for the law, it is very likely that he will run afoul of some other traffic regulation and be caught sooner or later.

Problem is, he has no license.   Insurance and car registered under his wife's name, but he'll be driving most of the time.  In fact, he was the one who drove the car back home from the dealer!<br><br>That prompted me to think, under what circumstances will he be caught? If he's caught, will his car be confiscated?<br><br>My friend is pretty worried, because since he is marrying his gf, he might be affected if they need him to help pay for the fine, and this BIL of his is pretty much of a loafter.</div></blockquote>it pretty much of a family affair to me. a confrontational approach may only work if ur fren is asked to speak 2 the bro in law on behalf of the family.<br><br>else, wad makes him liable to help the bro in law in the event he kena caught? besides, i dun think driving w/o license is a compoundable offence. IMO, if theres anyone to blame, it should be ur fren's future sis in law for allowing the bro in law to commit such acts with her blessings, and any consequences should be theirs to bear if they choose to do nothing about it.</div>

U hav to get use to half-clutch control. Dun worry, u juz started slowly u can do it well de. But remember, dun speed. Speed does not = good techniques.<br>Speed = fast, also = ppl die faster. Speeding = lesser chance to react = cannot avoid accident. Car is a transport, but is also a killing machine if u dun use it well. Yah i know its great to speed, but always remember the concequences. Meet in accident... u die nvm, u knock down ppl, ppl die or cripple, u'll feel bad ur whole life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Dunno anything juz ask in Car, ppl here will help u de <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
