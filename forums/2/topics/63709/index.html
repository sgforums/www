            <div class='col-md body'>hello Grief  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Actually your experience with driving shouldn't severely affect your choice of car... i guess what's most important is to drive carefully yah? Nothing shld happen in that case... and if anything does happen, it'd be an insurance issue rather than a new car/old car issue. A new car is definitely more worth it than a used one, unless you are on a tight budget and would want to get more car (metal/size) for your buck. People used to buy 2nd hand to avoid the mandatory 30% downpayment for new cars. Now that is gone, and also how new car prices have dropped, it's definitely more worth it to get a brand new one.<br><br>Made in Thailand shouldn't be a problem, as many forum users have said  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  due to the AFTA, more Japanese manufacturers will be assembling their SEA cars in Thailand. The City/Accord (City is a 5-door Jazz) Vios/Corolla/Camry are built there already. Major parts and the designs still come from Japan, but labour, component, logistics costs are lower.. so why not?<br><br><strong>Mazda 323</strong>: The replacement model's coming in next year. These are leftover stock the local dealer's trying to clear. It's up to you whether you fing this worth it or not.<br><br><strong>Hyundai Matrix</strong>: Low price for a 1.6l car... though i reserve my comments on Korean cars, I believe it's under-powered and the rear seats are tad too small.<br><br><strong>Nissan Sunny</strong>: Another popular car, though I agree with you that the rear looks ugly. It's supposed to consume a lot of petrol, if that's an issue with you. Actually rear drums aren't bad ideas, they are just cheaper than disc brakes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>Proton Wira</strong> Avoid at all costs! An early 1990s Lancer and if you are looking for reliabililty, don't look at this car.<br><br><strong>Manual or auto?</strong> This is really up to personal preference. If you'd like a manual, my advice would be to borrow a manual car and drive it around for one day to gauge the feel. Hah, as for not wanting to drive a manual after using an auto, well it depends on whether you'd want to or not!  An auto is definitely easier to drive, but I still prefer manual cars... heh.<br><br>Good luck with your choices!</div>
