            <div class='col-md body'>Only people with low self-esteem will worry about whether others think they are driving a "beng" car.  If you like driving and appreciate the performance of a car instead of the supposed status it carries, you wouldn't give a damn what people think.  FYI, the cars that you just tried to slam as "beng" are recognised worldwide by car enthusiasts as great performance cars.  The same people who review the Z4, SLK, M3, Carrera and Boxester will tell you that the Evo, Rex, 350Z, MX-5 and S2000 are just as great, if not greater.  I'd sooner drive the Rex than the Jag at home.  My friend has more fun with his Forester than his Porsche.
