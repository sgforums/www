            <div class='col-md body'>I don't mind Cerato for its price and value for money. If u have booked one earlier, u can get lots of freebies. Too bad, the hatchback version is not in Singapore and Kia owner has an uphill task against anti-Kia and brand crazy owners.<br><br>Honda City saves fuel but I dislike the funny shape of the car.<br><br>If you intend to buy a GETZ, it is best that you pay some more to get a MATRIX since they are from Hyundai anyway. There are 1.3 and 1.6 GETZ around.</div>

I feel its engine noise is the smallest in the class if you are in the cabin.  Unless you are saying the sound when the bonnet is openned.<br><br>Did you try Jazz?  It's a highly ranked car and also quite popular in the road.  4-5k more than city.  But I don't think that difference in price tag makes a lot of difference when you buy a car in Singapore.</div>
