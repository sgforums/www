During the first 2 week of my car ownership, I saw 1 taxi high beam me when he is waiting to turn right. I was lost then, only later I realise from my brother than I was only putting on parking light all the time. And once someone tap his brake in front of me in an expressway, my light was on high beam. Finally found out about the blue light symbol means.</div>
