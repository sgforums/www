              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Pls look out for this roadbully if you ever come across.<br>I was waiting for a lot last evening for about 30 mins or more.<br>Finally I saw a guy approaching his car opposite along the parallel lot. I then move forward to do a 3 point turn with my hazard lights on.<br>When I was turning, this car behind me drove very fast and overtake me. Fearing for safety as the car is very reckless, I stepped on my brake. That car just quickly reverse in. I horned him and got down my car and politely tell the guy that I was waiting along the road for very long. This middle age man, about 40-50 years old, just applied very arrogantly stating he don't care I waited for days or hours but this is his lot as he is already in position to reverse. He is very rude and cocky and ask me to move off. He then raised his voice and started shouting.</p>
              <p>I was very angry as it is very obvious that I am intending to wait for this lot. This middleage man has no courtesy at all. This is really a disgrace. I believe things might be easier and might get more respect if I am a male.</p>
              <p>His car is a silver KIA Cerato : <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S G A 5909 *</span></strong></p>

              <p>i sincerely think you should have just smiled at him and politely told him to repeat his shouting. while he was doing accordingly, you quickly grabbed his hands and put them on your abdomen. then quickly acted like he pushed you and you reflectively trying to hold on to his grip while preparing yourside for the falling act. then shout out super loud like you were really in injure while of course lying or sitting on the ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>surely will scare the living soul off him. i believe he will quickly get back to the car and drive off in order not to be caught by any passerby or authority.</p>

              <p>You should have demonstrated to him the power of your 4 disc brakes. Ok lah dangerous and stupid suggestion considering his son wasn't properly belted up. But still, one day he will meet someone not as nice as you who has no qualms sacrificing his rear bumper and if his son flies out of the front windscreen because of his irresponsibility to ensure his children are not belted up properly... he has no one else to blame because he didn't cherish his children in the first place.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>wah today even worse... this honda odyssey driver..<br><br>i was on lane 1 along the long toh guan stretch doing 110.. he was coming frm behind very very fast, think he 120-130 alr.<br><br>but i no choice, i have to go lane 2. he also no choice. ahead got roadworks... had to brake to about 70-80km/h.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15/10/08 09:38 Roadwork on PIE towards Changi Airport before Bukit Batok East Ave 3. Avoid lane 1.</span><br><br>so first was the series of cones to converge the traffic to lane 2 and there was the first lorry with the safety device at the back to absorb momentum should you crash into it.<br><br>if the site where they start work is further ahead from the area of convergence of traffic, obviously they have to lay the cones for a far distance spaced <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rather far apart</span>. and the working lorries are far ahead so it creates a "very empty" lane 1 after the lorry with the safety device.<br><br>everyone stayed on lane 2. what this odyssey driver did.. after he switch to lane 2 and passed the safety lorry, he "see" lane 1 empty and he went into lane 1 and HIT THE CONE!!!!<br><br>what followed next wasnt what you see in F1 races lah. cars spinning around and crashing into the sidewall.<br><br>he managed to get back into lane 2 safe &amp; sound. i dont see any prominent damage on his SJH-registered odyssey. (new car chiong already?) after the roadworks he overtake me and zoom off, exit eng neo.</p></div>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Pls look out for this roadbully if you ever come across.<br>I was waiting for a lot last evening for about 30 mins or more.<br>Finally I saw a guy approaching his car opposite along the parallel lot. I then move forward to do a 3 point turn with my hazard lights on.<br>When I was turning, this car behind me drove very fast and overtake me. Fearing for safety as the car is very reckless, I stepped on my brake. That car just quickly reverse in. I horned him and got down my car and politely tell the guy that I was waiting along the road for very long. This middle age man, about 40-50 years old, just applied very arrogantly stating he don't care I waited for days or hours but this is his lot as he is already in position to reverse. He is very rude and cocky and ask me to move off. He then raised his voice and started shouting.</p>
              <p>I was very angry as it is very obvious that I am intending to wait for this lot. This middleage man has no courtesy at all. This is really a disgrace. I believe things might be easier and might get more respect if I am a male.</p>
              <p>His car is a silver KIA Cerato : <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">S G A 5909 *</span></strong></p>

              <p>Some people are like that one lah. No class when driving. I also ever kenna taxi driver steal my lot. Was angry and even pointed 3rd finger at him but obviously he can't be bothered.</p>
              <p>In case you are wondering, I am a male and sometimes it doesn't matter what gender you are. Its not as though I can give the guy a punch or something without having to face severe consequences. The most I can do is go up and reason with the bum but if he is already someone with no class who steals people's lots, more often than not, reasoning with him is also wasting your saliva.</p>
