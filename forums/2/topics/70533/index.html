            <div class='col-md body'>welcome to the forums! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>the acura brand only exists in the states as far as i know. the RSX is known as the integra locally as it is in JDM.<br><br>in sg, the integra comes in 2 specs. the base IS version pumping out 160 ps and the type-R (aka ITR) putting out 220 ps.<br><br>the RSX type-S puts out 200 ps and it uses the same block as the IS and the ITR (albeit, in a different tune). the diff btw the ITR and the RSX-S is that the S comes without the factory recaros, LSD and brembo brakes as found on the ITR.<br><br>hope that answers your question.</div>
