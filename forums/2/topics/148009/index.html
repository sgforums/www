Phased out is confirmed and likely product discontinued. However, not replace by Swift since the engine capacity will be different - 1.5 vs 1.6L in future. Not many IS new units left at Champion... grab it while u can.<br><br>2. Not as easy compared to a Rex or Honda model. Nonetheless, you can also DIY (self-import) or customized locally.<br><br>3. Front-wheel drive only.<br><br>4. I believe not a problem i stock... some of the hardcore drivers should have bring it lower with some mods now.<br><br>5. So far not a single advertisement from PI for this IS model except the basic 1.3 model.<br><br>For further info, go to the Suzuki forum <a href="http://forum.suzukiclubsingapore.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://forum.suzukiclubsingapore.com/index.php</a></div>

Last heard is that Champion motors left with 4 pieces. After this, all gone. Was 9 units two abt two weeks ago. Heard that Swift GTI is coming out in 2006. 1600cc, but will cost abt 10k more than IS. Power to weight ratio should be IS slightly better.<br><br>2) The parts are not hard to find, if you ask me. You must know where to find! That's more important. You can pm me with you wanna know where to get their parts.<br><br>3) Front wheel drive.<br><br>4) Stock condition the car is already pretty fast. In fact, with a some mod, the car should go below 8 sec ........... i do not know how fast is the fast cos i never time myself.<br><br>5) Not that i know of. Japan already stopped the production of this car..... anyway, just something to poison you.<br><br>http://www.suzukisport.com/english/sales/ignissport/list/index.html<br></div>
