Not some kuching kurap.<br><br>So yea, I strongly believe and will uphold that there are no heros on the road, esp Singapore roads. Wanna be a hero? Go PG, Sepang or if you can, join a WRC team or F1 team, there you be hero I salute you. U die in a crash ppl will cry for you, cover you with national flag. Here you be hero on the roads, you kill other ppl or kill yourself, ppl will PCN at you. They will say, look, another idiot who gave his life for a moment of thril.. PUI!!<br><br>So pls, for your own life and more IMPORTANTLY, OUR LIVES and other road users life, go to somewhere else and show off your drift/slide/burn out/wheelie or SMLJ skills you call them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And ermmm... can the mods here be more professional?

Don't ma lu Civics leh.<br>IMHO Singaporean drivers (whether young or old; older ppl can have bad habits) would benefit from some advanced driver's training. Not the racing kind, but for situational awareness, skid control etc. Accidents can happen regardless of speed or whether the highway is "so straight" etc. That's why it's called an accident. You can drive years without an accident and still end up in a tree while scoffing at some "young punkster" for buanging his car.<br>And for speed happy people...the track is still safer. Might cost money, but there're far less variables (like trucks, a kid crossing the road) and if you spin out, you just get grass and laughed at, not a grave.</div></blockquote>nice advice....thks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
