            <div class='col-md body'>haha..oohh?? so i the one who making assumptions...but i tot someone said i drive like a wuss and xiaoboi is my gay partner...hahaha...the gentleman making such statement....so has he got evidence to back up his statement or he is just making assumption like what i am doing..haha....well...until he produce such evidence, i'll regard him as a wuss for now<br><br>anyway, hmm, talking abt law, haha, i remember someone tell me to go study more law, but that weirdo is ironically challenging me to drive faster than 90 on lane 1, challenging to do something against the law????? oh my goodness...it's like an ex-convict teaching law to a cohort of promising undergraduates in a university lecture hall.<br><br>"<strong>the onus is for the proprocuter to prove beyond reasonable doubts</strong>", ok so i will make sure in my next post i will produce evidence tat his driving record is not clean or he has buang his car before...this kuku balls not large enough to post his DIPS status here...<br><br>no lah, haha, i didn't label all drivers as bad drivers ok, again there is a monkey here assuming things. i only labeling those who kenna accident before as bad drivers which i think is true, in my capacity as a law-abiding dirver who has maintained zero demerit points and zero aciidents. (and i've produced evidence on that). i respect and salute drivers who have a clean driving record and condemn errand drivers who kenna demerit points before. never had i labelled all drivers as bad drivers.<br><br></div>
