Change lanes no signal, beating red light without camera in dead of the night etc.... the list is endless. Many many ppl doing it.<br><br><strong>also because of hive mentality, reflects very lowly on your own character, shows that you are very weak in upholding your own principles, when others break the law, you follow suit, if your friends around u are wayward, u sure will be lead astray, u can be easily misled into wrong path</strong><br><br>As for your dumb criminial record analogy, maybe a guy stole things to support his family. Or maybe he blogged about some things in the name of fun and kena jailed. Does this mean they are hardcore criminals and don't deserve another chance?<br><br><strong>but life is cruel, u are in real world, not in paradise, once u commit a mistake, u will be condemned</strong><br>C'mon, they are just normal ppl like u and me.<br><br>The law is inflexible, situations are not. Sometimes really boh pian have to stretch the law a bit.<br><br><strong>To each his opinion, some people find it very hard to obey the law, hopefully he is aware of the consequence and graciously accept his punishment</strong>[/b]</blockquote></div>
