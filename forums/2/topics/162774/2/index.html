            <div class='col-md body'>how to buang you?? in sg roads, very difficult to buang one,<br>BKE, SLE, PIE, TPE, every expressways all the way straight one and level, don't need to hold steering wheel also can drive straight, all you need is to drive straight and concentrate on your view in front, don't care about tailgaters....<br><br>an average driver alone should never buang once in his lifetime, that's why i said if you kenna accident ever once, this shows you are no good already, very poor driving skills..i know it's a bit harsh to speak in this way, but this is a fact and you have got to accept that</div>
