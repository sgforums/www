Honestly, I have to agree with Edgar_Davids. Having a nicely painted car does not warrant you the skills you need. I personally get very annoyed with' young punks' who try to show off their skills on the roads. So pls, if you don't value your life, value others. Sometimes I like the speed too, but when I think of other users, I slow down. I am not an old man, I have only been driving for 10 years, but I value life. Don't take accidents so lightly, you might be all good to go go go as you said now, in future, we do not know if you can still start a thread here or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>I WILL SAY THIS ONE MORE TIME NO ONE IS TRYING TO SHOW OFF!!JUST TAT THE SITUATION AT TAT MOMENT I HAVE TO CATCH UP WITH MY FRIEND!!!<br>YOUNG PUNKS HUH??WHO THE F@#$ R U TO SAY THAT....U LIKE TO CALL PPL NAMES THEN U BETTER STAND BY....COS IN THIS FORUM THERE R A LOT OF YOUNG PPL WHICH U WONT LIKE!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm think your friend ought to have slowed down since he's leading u and it'll take you longer to figure out where he wants to go; changing from lane 3 to 1 to 3 again at higher speeds isn't exactly something they teach in BBDC either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . Don't ma lu Civics leh.<br>IMHO Singaporean drivers (whether young or old; older ppl can have bad habits) would benefit from some advanced driver's training. Not the racing kind, but for situational awareness, skid control etc. Accidents can happen regardless of speed or whether the highway is "so straight" etc. That's why it's called an accident. You can drive years without an accident and still end up in a tree while scoffing at some "young punkster" for buanging his car.<br>And for speed happy people...the track is still safer. Might cost money, but there're far less variables (like trucks, a kid crossing the road) and if you spin out, you just get grass and laughed at, not a grave.</div>
