            <div class='col-md body'>hey pardon me if i am wrong to say this.<br><br>while riding home yesterday i saw this driver, obviously very impatient, he tailgated a malaysian motorbike on lane 3 and tried to force him out of the road by inching very close to his side. then he cut into a filter lane out of the expressway without signalling, nearly knockdown another bike... But in front of him was a lorry. and the lorry travelled even slower. the driver? LL keep a safely distance following the lorry's speed.<br><br>i am trying to say, pls, drivers, spare a thought of the rider's too. don't think because you are bigger and well protected, you can bully the helpless riders. and to the driver. why don't u dare to bully or try to force the lorry like wad u did to the previous bikes?<br><br>its all about the mindset. so pls. practise more patience and tolerance. it really won't kill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These type of drivers are the real problems for our roads. The think that beacuse they are some stupid executive or managers in their small little offices, they think they 'manage' the road as well!! If I have his namecard, I make sure i call up his boss and feedback to him/her on what an 'outstanding' employee they have.<br><br>I do not believe in violence, but some people just don't deserve your kindness and benevolence.
