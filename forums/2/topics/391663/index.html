              October, he had been fined three times for parking his car illegally
              without a season parking coupon around Yishun Street 61.<br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/motoring/02Feb10/others/seeingdoublecopy.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Mr Wei points to the look alike car carrying the same licence plate as his.</em><br> <br> The 30-year-old, who works in the sales industry, said: "I live in Serangoon. I work in Clementi. I don't even go to Yishun.<br> <br> "So I was very surprised when I received the three traffic tickets. I
              reported this to the authorities who said they would look into the
              matter."<br> <br> Then on Wednesday, he got a call informing him that a parking warden had spotted a car bearing the same licence plate.<br> <br> He rushed to the open-air car park between Blocks 640 and 641 Yishun St 61.<br> <br> Sure enough, parked before him was a Mitsubishi - same colour, same licence plate.<br> <br> He called the police, and a few patrol cars arrived at the scene shortly after, reported Shin Min Daily News.<br> <br> <strong>Man looked familiar</strong><br> <br> Mr Wei had no clue at that point who owned the look alike car.<br> <br> Then he spotted the other car owner walking towards the car park.<br> <br> Said Mr Wei: "I recognised him immediately. He's a valet parking
              attendant working in the vicinity of Boat Quay. I then alerted the
              policeman beside me."<br> <br> Mr Wei said he has been going to the Boat Quay area once or twice every week, and usually uses the valet parking service.<br> <br> The cops moved in and the other driver didn't put up a struggle.<br> <br> Shin Min reported that the driver lives in Yishun. He was about to go to work when he was arrested.<br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/motoring/02Feb10/others/samelicenseplatecopy.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>The driver of the look alike car being questioned by police.</em><br> <br> It was reported that the driver may be facing problems paying his car loan.<br> <br> He allegedly used the fake licence plate so that his car would not be
              spotted and subsequently towed away by the finance company.<br> <br> The car with the fake plates - reportedly with a 2,000cc engine - is more expensive than Mr Wei's, which uses a 1,500cc engine.<br> <br> Mr Wei's car, which he bought about 18 months ago, is valued at about $65,000, according to the current market rate.<br> <br> The car with the alleged fake licence plate reportedly uses another type of engine, and costs around $140,000.<br> <br> The police told The New Paper said it had handed the matter over to the
              Land Transport Authority (LTA) for further investigations.<br> <br> This is not the first time someone has been arrested using a fake licence plate.<br> <br> Last year, Ng Boon Leng, 29, forged his father's licence plate to drive around in a "borrowed" car.<br> <br> When he did not return the car, the original owner of the Honda Civic reported the incident to the police.<br> <br> Ng was caught by police in July and jailed for 3 1/2 years in September for theft, among other offences.<br> <br> Source: <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/Owners/Story/A1Story20100219-199705.html">http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/Owne...19-199705.html</a></p>
