            <div class='col-md body'>You need a Grant of Probate which should be done by your lawyer.  As no will was drawn up, whatever that is under your father goes into the estate.  To sell the car, you will need special permission, ie. anyone who is challenging the estate etc etc.  The lawyer will have to work that out for u and it will also needs the executioner's permission.  Upon which, LTA then will grant you permission to liquidate the car.  Hope this helps.</div>

Under CPF board, there is this thing called DPS, which will give you a lump sum when your dad passes on.  Check that.  The money can assist you to tide over your difficult period.<br>As for your mum, doesn't she work and at least have some Medisave $$?<br>Legal Fees can be obtained from the estate if dispensed......the same goes for estate duties.</div>
