            <div class='col-md body'>The placement of the driving wheels does make for a difference in oversteering or understeering, although suspension and tyre setup can (to some extent) reduce such differences.  As for wheelspin, I doubt if it makes for much of a difference - if inertia exceeds grip at the applied torque, you're going to get wheelspin no matter what.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i am not wrong for example two cars(with same engine,engine in front,same torque and hp)car with FF layout will have lesser chance of wheelspin than FR as the engine weight is giving more pressure on the front wheel so more grip than FR on the front wheel...<br>thats y cars engineer design the MR and RR layout for better pick up for cars with RWD..<br>am i wrong anyone can clear my doubts</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well AWD also remember...higher maintainence....cos more moving parts....and weight also....and AWD does not mean u have all the handling in the world....dunno id u seen a test where they did 2 runs... 1 in a carerra and a carerra 4.....the 4wd was slower in the tighter turns as opposed 2 the Rwd version...anyway the whole package also matters....chassis rigidity...suspension etc....all have to be balanced....u look at the focus ST and the Mini....both are FWD but they dun show their FWD understeer weakness...which explains my pt</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Front wheel drive cars aren't necessarily easier to control. You can still oversteer in them.<br><br>They're used in mainstream cars is because they eliminate the need for a propellor shaft, which adds weight and costs and consumes some cabin space (hence a transmission tunnel in RWD and 4WD cars). And it is the logical choice when a transverse engine layout is used.</div>
