            <div class='col-md body'>I WRITE in response to the letter, 'Old hands at driving booked 5 times in month' by Ms Koh Bee Kwang (ST, Sept 23).<br>First, I applaud the Traffic Police for outsourcing some of their traffic-policing function, and United Premas and Cisco for a job well done.<br><br>Ms Koh did not dispute that the five traffic offences were committed; Rather, she was 'incredulous' at the outsourcing because it is easier to catch offenders now.<br><br>Many experienced motorists drive the way Ms Koh did, simply because they thought they were 'experienced'. They forget there are many others on the road who may not be as 'experienced' as they are, or older folks like me whose reflexes are slower, and so cannot pre-empt other drivers' actions, read their minds or take corrective action in time. (Taxi drivers please take note.)<br><br>Even more do not realise that most cars on local roads have about the same performance level. Whether it is a Picanto, a Sunny, an Altis or whatever, most can do the 0-100kmh sprint in 10 to 12 seconds. All cars can also hit above 100kmh.<br><br>So those who are under the illusion that their car is faster, and demonstrate it by trying to outrun others, or weave in and out of traffic, are creating trouble.<br><br>I appeal to all who have the same attitude as Ms Koh; Obey traffic rules, they are there for a purpose. Drive leisurely, have a mental map of your route, and study the Highway Code again. Many have forgotten it.<br><br>Every day on the road, I experience drivers who:<br><br>Do not signal<br><br>Do not give way, but rather speed up when others signal their intention<br><br>Drive at speeds in excess of 20kmh over the speed limit, even in the heartland.<br><br>Muscle their way past when approaching a merging road even when they are three car lengths behind - the list goes on.<br><br>My pet peeve: neighbours in my area who insist on parking next to the kerb in the public carpark (thereby creating an obstruction and a hazard) when the lots in front of their flat are occupied, rather than park a short distance away and take a short walk.<br><br>I remember one big black car which was habitually parked in the handicapped lot. The owner's attitude was aptly summed up by a decal on his windscreen: 'I am always right!' I hope the enforcement agencies get him soon.<br><br>And for those reading this and starting to point their middle finger; Take heart. I was fined twice recently, once for beating a red light ($200 and 12 demerit points), and once for parking at a bus stop ($70).<br><br>Goh Choon Poh<br><br>(Straits Times 27 Sept)</div>
