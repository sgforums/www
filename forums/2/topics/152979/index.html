            <div class='col-md body'>hi everybody. i'm turning 20 this year and my family is thinking of getting an small affordable car that is just able to be used as a transportation for a long period of time for around 5 - 6 years. I know that there are some models that is very affordable these days and this two model strikes my attention. With understanding of auto cars has a higher FC compare to good driving habits on a manual cars. It's seems like picanto has a gain by having an 1.1 5Door manual at around 40k than getz 1.6 3Door manual at around 48k. Am i right by saying so? In term of performance and overall could anyone give me advices on which car is better? Any owner of these cars having problem yet? sincerely thanks for your valuable advices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I'm affording the car on my own with slight help from my parents. Do Kia or hyundai sg provide 0 dollars down payment? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kia does not provide 0%. Max can go 95% only. This is my case, although SE may say it is possible and he will try for you. Even for me as civil servent, I can get only 95%, so you dun expect a better deal. For the other 5%, you can pay by crecit card 0% installment, so i think it is fine.<br>Personally, I feel picanto is a nice car. Every time i on the road, will look at it if it passes by. Very attractive. If you are a gal, then it makes you very compatible in a picanto.</div>

But due to its slightly slow reponse, its FC can really go bad for heavy footer.

Actually, I have to rev 4th gear to 5krpm, 140kph. Cause 5th gear really cannot accelerate fast enough. 110kph is my 3rd gears up-shift point to 4th.
