Unless you declare to be also the driver for the car, but then the insurance will be based on the youngest driver. This is what I get from reading all those post, don't really know as I am insured under my own name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look... If the insurance is under your name, your PREMIUM will be HIGH &amp; also as EXCESS LOADING (considerate as inexperience driver/ below certain age) is also high if U MET WITH AN ACCIDENT. So consider properly before adding the name.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Ask the car dealer for the premium plan and compare the amount between ur name and ur dad.<br>To insurance company, they have A LOT OF FACTORS to base on.

Have a look.<br><a href="http://www.mycarforum.com/reviews/?action=fc_table" rel="nofollow">My car forum fuel consumption list</a><br><br>Picanto isn't meant to be a car to be driven hard, unless you are thinking about filter left with over a hundred km/h, you usually don't have to think about its stability. At high speed, its heavy kerb does provide some sense of security, much better than mine (kelisa). And it 100cc bigger engine allows you to push the little Pi even faster.<br><br>Low cost, low maintence, good FC, point A to B, how about Kelisa?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Actually Aveo(M) should be within your range too. With some discipline driving, it can do 14km/L FC figure. Or the Siron, going at around 50k now, I would consider it being among 1 of the better cars. FC is good at 17km/L.<br><br>Lastly, if your main concern is FC, then you shouldn't be thinking about auto-transmission cars. Unless you don't have the appropriate license. Difference between Auto and manual car of the same make can be as much as 3km/L.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Don't let a moment of weakness cause you 10 years of regret.</div>
