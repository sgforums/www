No offence, although the car make is good, but the price is way too costly, and also petrol consumption is way high.<br><br>i'm thinking of maybe a Toyota Corolla, Lancer 1.5GDI, or Subaru impreza.<br><br>don't want to buy too expensive ones. maybe in-between $70-$85k.<br><br>any suggestion??<br><br>and also, lets say the car is $80k, and we do not have to pay Downpayment right, then what are the cost that i need to pay when i get the car???<br><br>let's say including all the paper work???<br>any experience drivers or dealers around or friends can help??<br>i really need to get the money ready first, just in case i over spend.. hahaha<br><br>thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking.. To me i find tat....<br>If u get a loan for 90%. Assume u paid 10% download n took a 10 yrs loan. can u imagine how much extra interest u will be paying for the car. Think maybe close to or even more than $10K of interest. Doesnt sound worth it. Plus last time i read a post from someone from some site, cant remember liao. If u wanna sell ur car away after 5yrs.. instead of getting some money back.. u actually had to chip in to pay the loan company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my fren who works in Honda tells me that indeed though without rules on downpayment, u end up actually more in the sum total for the car. Of cos the no-downpayment for some people is a plus cos they dun wan to committ a lump sum which of cos gives them some liquidity...<br><br>so its up to u all to decide whether its worth it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi AhDan,<br><br>Well just a few suggestion, since u r buying a new car, why don't you go for some new models that had just hit the road. U can consider these 2 if you like, as both of them are below $80k. The new Honda City 1.5, Honda Jazz 1.4 or the new Mitsubishi Colt 1.5. Don't know abt the performance of these 2 cars though but Mit and Honda are pretty good cars, esp Honda.<br><br>Anyway if u wanna stick to the popular saloon, my personal feeling is as such:<br>Look sporty: Subaru Impreza<br>Performance: Should be Toyota Corolla (not 100% sure cos didn't drive most of the car b4).<br>Value for money: Toyota Corolla &amp; Nissan Sunny<br><br>If u wanna mob the car a bit, go for the subaru.<br><br>Yes its true that dun ever go for 10 yrs installment, not worth for the car. Try to cut it down to as short as possible. Maybe 7 yrs the worst case.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for first timer - i strongly recommend Toyota or Nissan:<br><br>Simply becos u need a reliable car to learn and experience.<br>for 1.5 manual, I believe<br>toyota - 75k<br>nissan - 70k<br><br>the rest may look good but maintenance may pose a problem after a few years.<br><br>can email me if keen on any model and i try to hook you up<br><br>carseller@catcha.com</div>
