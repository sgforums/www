            <div class='col-md body'>Bandar Seri Begawan - The recently launched China-made Geely CK 1.5 manual drive seems to have made a good impact on Bruneians. Ten out of 12 units of the first shipment have already been snapped up.<br><br>"This is due to its very affordable price. It allows more people to be able to afford a practical, brand new car," said John Too, senior sales and marketing manager of GHK Motors Sdn Bhd.<br><br>Costing less than $15,000, this car comes fully equipped with electric windows, airconditioning, a CD player, safety belt features, a remote control and an automatic security central locking system.<br><br>"The reason why this vehicle comes at such an affordable price is because production costs and labour in China is cheap," he said.<br><br>Instead of actually developing and manufacturing its own engine, the manufacturers bought Toyota Soluna engines fully approved by Toyota, he added. "For a 1.5 engine vehicle, the public can now pay a monthly bank repayment at just over $200, one of the lowest repayment amounts in the region."<br><br>The vehicle has also been distributed in Singapore, according to Daha Trading Sdn Bhd senior marketing manager James Chin.<br><br>"In Singapore, most of the cars go through a strict quality test before it is allowed to be sold in the market. People there look for quality and they have high expectations of vehicles," he said.<br><br>The sedan is made by China's Geely international, which was founded in 1986 by entrepreneur Li Shufu. The company is based in Huangyan, Luqiao Taizhou city, Zhjiang Province.<br><br>Initially set up as a maker of refrigerator parts, the firm went into car manufacturing in 1997, and they are currently in the midst of a global expansion, with plans to set up an assembly plant in the United States.-- Courtesy of The Brunei Times</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CAUTION:<br><br>be careful of china cars, especially geely brand. my husband was posted to shanghai for work and while there we bought a geely car. it was quite cheap, about 60,000 chinese renminbi (about 12,000 singapore dollars). less than a year and before clocking 10,000km, the car needed extensive overhaul. we had to write it off as a VERY bad investment.<br><br>all of you should read the following articles:<br><br>http://www.caradvice.com.au/3612/chinese-cars-fail-in-europe/<br><br>"Chinese Cars Fail In Europe" in Australian CarAdvice.com.au dated 3 July 2007<br><br>http://money.cnn.com/2007/07/02/autos/jdpower_on_chinese_cars/index.htm?postversion=2007070315<br><br>"Chinese car makers face tough U.S. scrutiny" in CNNMoney.com dated 3 July 2007<br><br>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bw/2006-03/13/content_545084.htm<br><br>"Total recall" in China Daily dated 13 March 2006<br><br>http://www.chinacarforums.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2443<br><br>"Geely cars are Bad Quality: Please Comment" in Chinacarforums.com<br><br>Look at Post #1 dated 7 May 2007.
