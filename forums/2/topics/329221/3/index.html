              <p>I think it is very much up to one's view then but at the end of
              the day,a qualified driver is one who has a valid driving license
              if we talk in legal terms.As to whether they are good,that's
              seperate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If those bad habits/driving behaviour are applied to a licensed
              driver,it can be considered as bad habits/driving behaviour.BUT if
              he/she was caught every time when they displayed such
              behaviour,they would be disqualified from driving by the
              authorities after all those times.To me,that does not mean that
              they are qualified drivers,it just means that they are LUCKY enough
              not to have been caught yet or have not racked up enough
              points to be disqualified  yet.This is purely my
              view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of an unlicensed driver....whether he/she displays
              such behaviours or not,he is STILL an unqualified driver till
              he/she gets a license.That's not my view,it's the law.</p>
                            </div>

              you're the one who asked for my views oon whether I consider qualified. *shrugs* anyway as I said the point on why the accident occured is not whether he is qualified but whether his driving is skilled/safe/acceptable.

              <p>court can order to suspend him for a period of time...for driving without valid licence and all its related charges...that would be in terms of years.</p>
              <p>so no...reach legal age already also cannot learn driving...assuming his suspension period is still in force at that time.</p>
              <p>when booking for any TP tests(theory and practical) or even enrolling with driving centres...they will specify as a requirement that U dont have 12 demerit points and above and is not expected to be slapped with 12 points and above...if U lie and they find out...U kiss ur licence goodbye and U can appear in court again.False declaration of information.</p>
              <p>No licence to kantong in the first place is not an issue..even learner drivers with PDL...say...they beat the red light...12 points....it will be on record and added to the driving licence when the person passes...so no such thing as no licence to kantong =no responsibility hor...</p>

              <p>court can order to suspend him for a period of time...for

              <p>so no...reach legal age already also cannot learn

              <p>No licence to kantong in the first place is not an issue..even

              <p>Wah, so if a learner driver beat red light and get 12 points, then he pass the driving test. His provisional license would be automatically suspended the day he pass as new license drivers cannot get more than 12 points in the first year of passing? Just wondering.</p>

To be honest, when someone dies in such accidents, what the point of coming unto this forum and say u do not pity him and that he deserves it? He cant hear you anyway and he wun need you pity. The people who needs our pity is his mother and family. So you wan to tell his mother in her face that he deserves to die? He is wrong and naive and stupid, but does he deserve to die?</p></div>

              <p>RIP. thank god there wasn't anyone else killed in this accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think his passion on cars got the better on him, my guess is that since, he knows everything about a car, sure he knows how to drive. start engine, shift gear to "D" release handbrake and off we go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but what he lack off is the skills to drive a car, which caused his death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>let this be a warning message to all the teens and initial D wanna be.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">All it take is just 1 simple mistake, wrong judement in driving to kill yourself.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't drive without a Driving lisence.</span></strong></p>

              <p>For those who feel that this 16yo boy was old enough to realise the
                      full fledge dangers of driving on the real roads without a proper
                      license, that his death isn't a pity, that his plight should not be
                      sympathised with, I really don't know what to say.</p>
              <p>When I read about this piece of news this afternoon, felt pretty down for a bit. When I drove out to work this morning, rain was damn heavy, the roads actually look a bit scary. What it must've been like during the final moments for this kid is unimaginable.</p>
              <p>Imho he was a child. He had no real idea about the possible consequences. And no I don't know this boy personally.</p>
              <p>When
                      I was 17, I had no real idea the simple act of lighting up could get me
                      hooked for almost a decade. You think teenagers these days are very
                      mature, and old enough to think for their own safety, they are not. They
                      may dress mature, look mature, but their level of exposure to real
                      danger is limited.</p>
              <p>Maybe he thought driving was easy, the same way it was like on TV. Only he didn't know of things like doing it defensively, blind spots and intermittent braking, braking room, reduced friction and all that shit they teach you in driving school.</p>
              <p>Nuff said. RIP.</p>
