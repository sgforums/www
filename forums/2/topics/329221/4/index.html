              <p>no.the learner will get licence revoked only when he/she goes above 12 points(ie 13 and above)...so the day the learner passes his/her test and gets a qualified licence...he/she will have 12 points on record....He/she can still drive...but all it takes is 1 mistake and the licence would be revoked...essentially it means that he/she can keep the licence in the drawer until the 12 points get cleared...which is about 1 year later I believe.</p>

To be honest, when someone dies in such accidents, what the point of coming unto this forum and say u do not pity him and that he deserves it? He cant hear you anyway and he wun need you pity. The people who needs our pity is his mother and family. So you wan to tell his mother in her face that he deserves to die? He is wrong and naive and stupid, but does he deserve to die?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Safety experts call for more public education to curb underage driving</span></span></strong><br>By Imelda Saad, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 02 September 2008 2219 hrs</p>
              <p><br>  </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Safety experts are calling for road safety education to be extended to upper secondary students.</p>
              <p>This comes after the death of a 16-year-old boy who slammed into a tree while driving without a licence on Monday.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, anyone below the age of 18 is not allowed to drive.</p>
              <p>A 17-year-old youth, who wants to be known simply as "John", could very well typify your average youth on the verge of getting his driving licence.</p>
              <p>Like other boys Channel NewsAsia spoke to, he has heard of friends taking joyrides using their parents' car. They are underaged, without a driving licence, and just out to have a good time.</p>
              <p>"John" said: "(They do this) partly (due to) peer pressure, partly to have fun, and they (do not) have to waste money on taxi fares."</p>
              <p>But these bouts of fun can be dangerous, with some youths revving up to 140 kilometres per hour on the speedometer.</p>
              <p>Tan Jin Thong, president, The National Safety Council of Singapore, said: "Driving on the road is already very dangerous, it is a skill that has to be acquired and learnt.</p>
              <p>"These youngsters, the underaged especially, they think that driving on the road is so easy... just moving the steering wheel, controlling the car to go straight, left or right, and stepping on the accelerator and knowing how to apply the brake...</p>
              <p>"But in fact, that is not true. There is a lot more to learn on road safety and safe driving. If you do not go through a proper course in driving and you do not have a valid licence, I don't see how they will be able to react in an emergency.</p>
              <p>"And they not only pose a danger to themselves, but in fact also pose a hazard to other motorists, pedestrians; and (if) they are carrying passengers who could be their friends, they are also endangering their lives."</p>
              <p>Police figures showed that the number of people caught driving cars without a valid licence shot up 30 per cent to 25 in 2007. There were five such offenders in the first half of this year.</p>
              <p>One area that may be lacking is public education. One hears a lot about anti-drink driving messages targeted at youths, but hardly anything on underage driving.</p>
              <p>Police have also said that currently they do not have any programmes with schools to address this.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Automobile Association said it plans to widen its road safety education outreach to youths in tertiary institutions in the coming months.</p>
              <p>Its CEO, Lee Wai Mun, said: "It is important for young drivers to understand that driving without a licence, as well as reckless driving and drink driving, are very serious offences, as such irresponsible acts could endanger not just their own lives, but also put other road users at risk.</p>
              <p>"At the same time, driving is also a skill that one becomes more adept with through experience and practice."</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said: "I think it is a good idea that it can start from the schools, especially the upper secondary, because those students are around 15, 16 years old and they observe the adults driving, and they think that they want to have a try, and one day sneak into their parents' car, their brother's car, and then just get a few of their friends to be around, and once they come across an emergency, they've had it..."</p>
              <p><strong>Anyone caught driving without a licence could be fined up to S$2,000 and jailed up to six months. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>A first-time offender will face a maximum fine of S$1,000 or a jail term not exceeding three months. A repeat offender faces a maximum fine of S$2,000 or a maximum jail term of six months. -</strong> CNA/ms</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Safety experts call for more public education to curb underage driving</span></span></strong><br>By Imelda Saad, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 02 September 2008 2219 hrs</p>
              <p><br>  </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Safety experts are calling for road safety education to be extended to upper secondary students.</p>
              <p>This comes after the death of a 16-year-old boy who slammed into a tree while driving without a licence on Monday.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, anyone below the age of 18 is not allowed to drive.</p>
              <p>A 17-year-old youth, who wants to be known simply as "John", could very well typify your average youth on the verge of getting his driving licence.</p>
              <p>Like other boys Channel NewsAsia spoke to, he has heard of friends taking joyrides using their parents' car. They are underaged, without a driving licence, and just out to have a good time.</p>
              <p>"John" said: "(They do this) partly (due to) peer pressure, partly to have fun, and they (do not) have to waste money on taxi fares."</p>
              <p>But these bouts of fun can be dangerous, with some youths revving up to 140 kilometres per hour on the speedometer.</p>
              <p>Tan Jin Thong, president, The National Safety Council of Singapore, said: "Driving on the road is already very dangerous, it is a skill that has to be acquired and learnt.</p>
              <p>"These youngsters, the underaged especially, they think that driving on the road is so easy... just moving the steering wheel, controlling the car to go straight, left or right, and stepping on the accelerator and knowing how to apply the brake...</p>

              <p>how come his younger bro have licence already but he don't have. =/<br>That's even worse! means he's above 18 already and must take the full responsibility.<br><br>i agree with purpledragon84 also. If the law can't catchup on him, then he needs a bigger wake up call. <br><br>But hopefully not with the gf inside the car though. Hate it when the passenger dies but the driver gets away scott free, just like the EG civic accident in OG. And as the Colt VR accident also, its always the innocent passenger that has to suffer the ignorance and stupidity of the driver.<br><br>After the accidents, hear all the nonsense like "he was a safe driver.. nv speed at all.. blah blah." Ya right. Play with fire, prepare to get burnt.</p>
