              the front and rear axles rotate at different speeds except when driving in a perfectly straight line. So the only way both can power the vehicle on dry-road turns is if there's a differential between them. (On slippery surfaces the tire slippage compensates for the wheel-speed differences.)
              
              Many awd vehicles share much of their drivetrain with similar front-drive models but add a compact center differential, driveshaft and rear differential. Four-wheel-drive vehicles use a transfer case placed after the transmission that directs power to both the front and rear axles when needed. When engaged, the transfer case drives two separate driveshafts that operate individual differentials. No center differential is used on true 4wd vehicles going off-road in 4wd mode.

              <p>Hi Bearhug,</p>
              <p>I own a CX7, and yes, its one good value car(SUV) in my opinion. Its faster than most SUVs (I remember watching a youtube clip where it came in second, behind the Porsche SUV Turbo), has lots of goodies (Bose system, sunroof, auto headlights, cruise control- not tat u use it in Sg much). Good built quality overall, and good looking.</p>
              <p>The only downside i think, is the lack of noise insulation for the car. Noise from outside, tyres and engine can be quite audible, making it not as luxurious a ride that I had expected (my previous cars were all conti makes).</p>
              <p>But overall, i enjoy my CX7 more than my other cars. Its fun to drive, powerful, good looking and generally comfortable enough for an SUV. As far as I see it, its the way SUVs should be.</p>
              <p>The engine power is ok to my standards, but dunno about it being able to outrun a WRX. Mine's a stock, and I've tried, but no matter how powerful the engine is, its still an SUV, and pickup cannot outdo a WRX. </p>
              <p>Some punk in a Honda Euro did try to bully me once without realizing what a CX7 is. I let him overtake me, and tailgated him all the way from Nicoll Highway to Middle Road, with my high beam glaring straight into him that night. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/arrogant.png" alt="arrogant.png">. He went to 140km/h to try shake me off but without avail. The look on his face at the traffic at Middle Road was priceless.  And mind you, there were 3 other adults in my SUV at that time, compared to him being the lone driver.</p>

              <p>I'm open to suggestions on how to mod my ride for a more powerful ride, but am unsure where to go for advise as I've only been back to Sg recently. Would love to hear your recommendations and tips on what should i do and where should i go.</p>

              <p>hey.. im no pro in modifying cars.. but do know a fair bit.. but will you want to go for big upgrades or just minor one?</p>
              <p>because.. lots of money is involved. and also.. maybe u can join me over at the mazdaclubsg to find out more from the cx7 bros..</p>
              <p>also, not sure if u wan to go illegal or legal..</p>
              <p><br>1. reinforce ur engine like your pistons, gasket, header. u need to do these first b4 upgrading ur turbo.</p>
              <p>2. get a bigger turbo kit. this will include the intercooler, turbo, pipings.. this upgrade can cost from $3k-$10k depending on your choice of turbo capacity.</p>
              <p>3. get a good ECU and get it tuned properly by reputable workshops.. i would recommend F-Con to be installed too..</p>
              <p>4. bigger brake kits &lt;- VERY IMPORTANT.</p>
              <p><br>the above mentioned can probably get ur car up to about 300-400bhp.. depending on ur parts... last but not least, do research on how much power ur gear box can tolerate.</p>
              <p>my friend's cx7 is pusing about 330hp on the wheels with 450nm of torque.. so far no problems with his car..</p>
