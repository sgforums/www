              <p>Hi Jamie and zerocool,</p>
              <p>Yes, i am aware of the mazdaclubsg. Infact, when i first got my CX7, i did apply for membership, but sadly no news from the moderators. hence, my application still pending...for close to 5 months already.</p>
              <p>Mods to my car would i think be legal... in my profession, wouldn't be too nice if i caught with illegal mods. I guess i'm just looking for that little extra oomph for the times when i really need it.</p>
              <p>Budget wise, 3k to 5k shouldn't be a problem.</p>
              <p>I think my first mod would be the air filter. Any recommendations on what air filter for a CX7? Dunno what brand or model will fit, cos the damn car is too new for aftermarket mod parts.</p>
              <p>Oh, and wats an F-con? Sorry, but i've never modded any of my cars in my entire life.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the feedback! Its been an eye opener..didn't know there are so many CX7s in Sg that are modded!</p>
              <p>Stock in itself is already a quick car, but modded ones would make a great alternative to the usual turbo Evos and Rexes.</p>

              <p><br>5k, you probably wouldnt get much of an increase.. but still will get u somewhere... 5k i believe u can upsize a bigger turbo and a FMIT (front mount intercooler).</p>
              <p>with a bigger turbo (not too big) so that it will not harm your engine. FMIT for better cooling. because if u want to upsize to those quite big turbos like my friend is using.. better reinforce your engine before having such big turbos.</p>
              <p>go to workshops to get advise on what turbo size you can get for 5k. remember to tell them that u do not intend to reinforce ur engine.</p>
              <p>about ur mazdaclubsg membership, ive already pmed ur application to the admin of the site to check about the pending application. welcome to the club in advanced.</p>

              <p>I went to Sin Tien Seng to check out the Daihatsu Terios.</p>
              <p>There are 2 &amp; 4WDs, with centre differential lock.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I don't know much about these technology but it seems quite a good bargain @ $62,300 for the High Grade model. I am not sure about its performance though. Any comments?</p>

              <p>For the younger crowd, Terios and Rush look pretty good on the streets though most people advice against them for poor handling reasons. I think that's the concern with compact SUVs. The ride is jiggly and you don't really feel confident and safe, especially when traveling above 80km/hr in the city.</p>
              <p>Bad FC as in how much? Fuel consumption depends on your driving pattern as well. Brand consciousness aside and thinking in terms of budget, I personally think Tucson is a decent choice. It feels stable, the handling is smooth and FC is reasonable at 10km with ample room and roof rails to fit a small family and some equipments. Have no idea why people feel that 2WD Tucson is poor choice for an SUV unless they are regular/serious off roaders. A number of driving instructors and friends all recommend the Tucson for SUV.</p>
              <p>For off road work, then I guess either a Jeep or a Land Rover might fit the bill? Can't comment on that since I haven't driven any. My only off road experience was passenger in a very very old defender and it came across as more than capable. It took us 6 or 8 hours up and down steep gradient mountain slopes filled with rocks and 2 drivers were taking turns to handle it.</p>
              <p>If I have the budget, definitely a Toyota RAV4 if I'm content with just street driving. The handling is comfortable, the ride feels safe and design looks good though reviews and reports claim the machine is not built for off road driving.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth. </p>

              <p>apparently the terios is getting about 10km/l.. i personally feel its bad for a 1.5 car.. it shld be achieving at least 11-12km/l based on the cc.. so, it boils down to the weight of the car.</p>
              <p>no doubt, i think terios its a really nice car. but ive not driven it so i dare not comment on the ride's handling.</p>
              <p>hyundai, the cars are very heavy, i went to the show room, the weight of the door and the bonnet already turned me off, that's why i never liked hyundai cars.</p>

              <p>What has the weight of the door and the bonnet got to do with getting an SUV? I'm just curious, has it got much to do with a substantial amount of fuel required to get it going?</p>

              substantial amount of fuel required to get it going?</p>
              <p>Which one did you choose to get in the end?</p>
              <p>Like for me a car especially in Singapore, is just a car.
              Function, handling, safety, FC, design, budget and maintainence are
              the only factors I believe could be worth considering.</p>
              <p>For people wavering between 2.4 or 2.0 car, are there
              considerable differences? It's like a landscape photographer
              wondering whether a MarkII or a 5D can take better shots.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth. Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

              <p>because already these parts feel heavy.. so im guessing the whole car is very heavy.. so since the whole car felt heavy to me.. im assuming the the fuel consumption is gonna be really bad.</p>
              <p>i didnt buy any suv.. just sat in and drove a few before.</p>
              <p>precisely, hyundai's safety, design and fc isnt fantastic compared to the other brands. may call me bias but no, i do like the new avante, i think its a really nice car.. but these are proven facts that FC and design cannot compare with the rest. well, at least not yet.. give it another few more years and i believe they will be one of the better cars in the market.</p>
              <p>i was not asking TS to get a bigger cc car. but based on what ive heard, small cc SUV not a good choice because it will kill on the FC (as explained earlier). but perhaps overall he will save on road tax and insurance to compensate the fuel.</p>

              <p>I think SUVs in general burn more fuel due to their heavier size and weight, probably engines as well. To consider or treat these heavy vehicles like normal cars can get a little frustrating.</p>
              <p>It is possible for well designed 3.0 litre engines to be engineered with better FC than less efficient 1.8 engines though it probably costs more to purchase. In the end things even out. Like you suggested, TS will save on road tax and insurance to compensate the fuel.</p>
              <p>On top of that there are cases of two drivers with the same car of the same generation having different average FCs. Some people can only achieve 8km while others can do 12. I believe if you really need to scrutinize these factors right down to the last decimal, you need to consider factors like driving patterns (acceleration), engine design (quality and big or small) and the type of load their cars (weight of vehicle as well) ferry regularly.</p>
              <p>For me in the end everything evens out. Ultimately, Singaporean drivers purchase SUVs because they enjoy the image it generates, like the design, height and function plus they can afford vehicles that burn more fuel than the average saloon.</p>

              <p>If I have the budget for a Mazda CX7 (looks way too much like an MPV/hatchback imho), will rather get a Wrangler and pay more road tax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>The CX7 resembles Suzuki's SX4. Both are mongrels. Whether they are a queer mutation from SUV, hatchback or MPV nobody knows. No personality. Not the kind of car a young SUV lover wants to be seen driving.</p>

              <p>When I think Mazda CX7, I recall even older uncles and soccer moms.</p>
