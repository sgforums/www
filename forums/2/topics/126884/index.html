TC must be some kind of incompetent, fly-by-night, ah beng workshop. Letting petrol ooze out will damage your paint work. Go back to their authorized dealer Tan Chong Motor to check up.<br><br>The problem is high petrol consumption, which has nothing to do with how much to fill up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't just blame TC for the poor FC for your new car. The sales agent did highlight the latio average about 10-13km/l and it's very normal for a 1.6l car.<br><br>This also teach people some lesson, better do so research b4 commit. Anyway you bought a latio sport, and you expect a FC of a Honda Jazz?????? Like someone bought a EVO and expect a FC of a lancer. !!!!111111</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Initially, I heard news that the Latio's new engine is to solve the problem of high fc of many sunnys. Seems like it is not the case, as mentioned by many owners and se as well. Seem like it will probably not go near vios range mainly due to its high kerb weight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Anyway, you might like to check with nissan club to see if they have any solution.

            <div class='col-md body'>New cars are like that. Your FC will get better as times goes on (probably after 10k mileage from my experience). Just like your slippers, never feels good wear it for first few times.<br>Like the others said, nissan engine never has good FC but one thing about their engine is that its relatively powerful and feels more torquey when it comes to manual engine, thumbs up for this. Many things can't be explained when it comes to car, you have to feel and observe for yourself and know what you want in a car. Good FC never match with speed and precision.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think if that is only the first tank ... it is very unfair to judge that FC is very poor and etc...<br><br>Everyone knows that during the run-in phase .. FC is generally very poor. Only after the first tank and subsequent service .. the FC will be getting better until it stablise.<br><br>I am driving a Latio Sport and currently on Second tank.<br><br>First tank, around left 1/4 hit only 380KM<br><br>Second tank, now at almost same level hitting around 410KM...<br><br>this is before first service.<br><br>Nissan cars used to have FC problem like their Sunny but this joined developed engine suppose to solve the FC problem yet giving the similar performance of a 1.6L.<br><br>Check out the specs and u could see it is close to some 1.6L specs.<br><br>The niggy complain generally abt this car is the inital pickup ... the pickup is good when u hit 2K rpm and above else it is pickup is crawling instead.<br><br>As for poor FC for Cefiro.. I think u cant realli complain about it as it is a 2.4L car body with a 2.0L engine. It is the same for 2.0L camry, the 1.6L old Corona, the old Sonata and etc ...<br><br>All car body is heavier but all seriously underpowered. But for driving a 2.0L car .. u cant expect to have a FC of a 1.6L car.<br><br>Same goes for 1.5L car .. u cant compare its FC to a 1.4L or 1.3L car (Honda Fit)<br><br>Just my two cent worth ... I have been active in Nissanclub too .. so far majority are hitting 14km/l ... it is also very much depend on your driving behaviour and daily distance and road condition</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>NISSAN LATIO FUEL CONSUMPTION IS SUPERB!!!</strong><br><br>LATIO FC NIGHTMARE is NO MORE!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I was invited to Nissan Ubi  to conduct a test yesterday. Thanks to the efficient Service Manager Mr Lee and his assistant Mr Low, I went off on a ride with Mr Low on a full tank (pump until petrol visible at opening). We finished about 22.6km and went back to top up fuel again up to visible petrol at opening level. The amount of petrol refill came up to just 1.37 litres!<br><br>Meaning my NISSAN LATIO car actually achieved 1 litre = 16.5km!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> A far cry from my own test of just 1 litre = 10km. Why? How? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>We discovered that it was due to one easily ignored fact. I was driving on low gear most of the time. To maximise Auto CVT driving, you should always accelerate to hit 2,500 (thatÂ’s the point when Nissan Latio or many other Auto CVT car changes gear). I was always driving below 2,000 and even though the speed picked up (speed will always pick up regardless of whether you cross 2,500 or not), the car engine had to use up more fuel on a low gear.<br><br>So what I did was to quickly (that take skills because it is a fine line between speed driving) cross 2,500 whenever it is possible to do so and not holding it to below 2,000. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Already, using this method I havejust  crossed 120km at the 1st quarter mark. Hitting 13-14km/l shouldnÂ’t be a problem. As the test with me in it showed, it could easily hit 16.5km/l on a drive test with a lot of highways!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Proven FC very good. The trick is really about bringing it up to cross 2,500r whenever you can. Because my office is too near my house (less than 5 mins) and generally I am always driving 100%urban, it was kinda hard to ram across 2,500. Then again, Nissan Latio Sport 1 litre=16.5km is impressive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
