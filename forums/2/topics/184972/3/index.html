            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, there's one around - SgLexus. It's got a growning no. of IS250 owners (as well as other Lex model owners) discussing wot they're doing with their cars and a bunch of other stuff.

            <div class='col-md body'>I must say that the IS250 looks great externally but if you talk about the interior, I still prefer the BMW 3-series or Audi A4.<br><br>Anyway, I think when people buy a Lexus, they donÂ’t just get a great ride. TheyÂ’ll get great services as well. I know Â‘cause I drive a GS. They actually couriered a bottle of good Spanish red wine (very well packaged if I may add) to my house in appreciation of my Lexus purchase. This was followed by a Lexus Club teddy and car decal (a few weeks later). Then came complimentary tickets to Lexus Club private screening of Â‘Pirates of the CaribbeanÂ’ @GV Grand. These are just some of the perks you can expect being a Lexus owner. These perks may be cheap but at least theyÂ’re making a good effort in making the owners feel good/pampered.<br><br>Perks aside, letÂ’s tak about car servicing. Whenever you bring your car in for servicing, thereÂ’ll be an agent attending to you (this is common, I know). And whenever I step into the service centre office, IÂ’ll (almost instantly) be asked whether I would like to have some snacks/food/drinks by the attendant there. ThereÂ’s even free internet access &amp; cable tv for you to enjoy while waiting for your car to be ready.<br><br>All these without paying a premium that you normally would for a European marque. What more can I ask for? So Angielika, I hope youÂ’ll have a pleasant Lexus experience like I did. Enjoy and take good care of your new Â‘babyÂ’!</div>
