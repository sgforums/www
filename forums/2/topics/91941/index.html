            <div class='col-md body'>From Striat Times Webby:-<br><br>MOTORISTS will be able to take driving tests using automatic cars from Jan 1 next year and qualify to drive such cars with a new Class 3A licence.<br><br>Unlike Class 3 licence holders, 3A licence holders will not be allowed to drive manual cars unless they pass the Class 3 tests as well.<br><br>Class 3 licence holders can continue to drive both automatic and manual cars, said Traffic Police commander Teo Kian Teck yesterday.<br><br>He said the move to create a new licence class was decided after a review conducted with relevant agencies, and feedback from the public and driving schools, showed that more motorists were driving automatic cars. About three in four new cars here are automatic.<br><br>Assistant Commissioner Teo noted there were similar schemes elsewhere like in Australia, France and the United States.<br><br>The police define automatic transmission as a car without a clutch pedal, which means that a Class 3A licence is also valid for cars using clutchless manual transmissions, such as the Alfa Romeo's selespeed and Opel's easytronic system, according to their website.<br><br>The three driving centres here and the Singapore Driving Instructors' Association have been notified to prepare new syllabuses and acquire automatic cars.<br><br>While he acknowledged that the 3A licence may be easier to obtain, the assistant commissioner said there would be no compromise in training, and testing standards would remain the same for all.<br><br>Police also said 3A licence holders caught driving manual cars would face severe penalties, as such offences are tantamount to driving without a valid licence and driving without valid insurance coverage.<br><br>The public may visit www.spf.gov.sg and www.ecitizen.gov.sg for more details.<br>-----------------<br><br>Good news for manual car haters?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What is your definition of Auto Transmission Vehicle (ATV)?<br>An ATV is defined as a motorcar without any clutch pedal. The skill required to operate a vehicle with a clutch pedal is the key difference between a Manual Transmission Vehicle (MTV) and an ATV.<br><br>2. It was announced that from 1 Jan 05 onwards, learner drivers will be able to take their driving tests using ATVs. Since it is a public holiday, when exactly can I take a Class 3A practical test?<br>You can take a Class 3A practical test from 3 Jan 2005 onwards, subject to availability at the driving centres.<br><br>3. Where can I apply for Class 3A training lessons?<br>You can train for Class 3A at any of the driving centres, namely Bukit Batok Driving Centre (BBDC), Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC) and Comfort Driving Centre (CDC) or from Private Driving Instructors (PDIs).<br><br>4. Where can I apply for Class 3A test?<br>You can go to any of the 3 driving centres for enrolment of the Class 3A practical test.<br><br>5. How do I apply for Class 3A test?<br>You can apply for a Class 3A test in the same way you would for a Class 3. Simply approach any of the 3 driving schools to book your theory and practical tests. At the point of booking for the practical test, candidates will have to indicate whether they will be using an ATV or an MTV for their test.<br><br>6. Will the theory tests for Class 3 and Class 3A be different?<br>The basic and final theory tests are the same for both ATV and MTV learners.<br><br>7. Can I drive an ATV if I have a Class 3 licence?<br>Yes. A Class 3 licence will legally allow you to drive both MTVs and ATVs.<br><br>8. Can I drive a MTV with a Class 3A licence?<br>No. You will need to undergo a practical test in an MTV to ensure that you are able to handle an MTV and drive on the road on an MTV. The fee for the practical test is $20.<br><br>9. Can I apply for a taxi-driver's job or other jobs requiring vocational licences with my Class 3A licence?<br>No. You have to follow the regulations as stipulated by LTA when applying for vocational licences. They require a Class 3 licence.<br><br>10. I have a Class 3A licence. How do I get a Class 3 driving licence?<br>You can go to any of the driving schools to apply for the Class 3 practical test, which is essentially a driving test using an MTV.<br><br>11.  What documents must I bring along for my practical test?<br>You will have to produce your identity card or passport, test fee receipt and the car insurance certificate [for student of Private Driving Instructors (PDIs)].<br><br>12.  When can foreign ATV licence-holders convert their licences to Class 3A licences?<br>One can convert his or her foreign ATV licence to a Class 3A licence from 1 Sept 04 onwards by passing the basic theory test and presenting the necessary documents to facilitate the conversion. No practical driving test is needed.<br><br>13.  How much does it cost to get a Class 3 driving licence?<br>To get a Class 3 licence, you will have to apply for a Class 3 practical test. The test fee will be $20/-. You may also wish to go through the Class 3 course training provided by the driving schools and the PDIs. The Class 3 course is not compulsory, and the fees for each lesson vary from school to school and from PDI to PDI.<br><br>14.  What is the advantage of going through the ATV-only training lessons?<br>It is for those who are certain that they would only be driving ATVs after acquiring a driving licence, as more time would be spent on training you on the features peculiar to ATVs.<br><br>15.  Are there any countries that have implemented this scheme successfully?<br>Yes. Countries like the US, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Korea, and Australia have implemented similar schemes.<br><br>16.  I have a Class 3A licence. How long must I wait before I can apply and take a Class 3 practical test?<br>You can apply for a Class 3 practical test as soon as you have obtained your Class 3A licence.<br><br>17.  If I have a Class 3A licence, can I drive cars that are using clutchless manual transmissions e.g. Alfa Romeo's selespeed, Opel's easytronic etc?<br>Yes. As long as there is no need to physically operate a clutch pedal, the vehicle is deemed to be an Automatic Transmission Vehicle for the purpose of the Class 3A.<br><br><strong>18.  What are the offences and penalties for driving an MTV with a Class 3A licence?<br>The offender will be charged for driving without a valid driving licence and may be fined up to $1,000 or jailed up to 3 months for the first conviction. He will also be charged for driving without valid insurance coverage and can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed up to 3 months, or both. He will also be disqualified from driving for at least 12 months. </strong><br><br>19.  Can current Class 3 licence holders take ATV training lessons if they wish to?<br>Yes. He can opt to attend an ATV familiarisation course at the driving centres. Driving centres have their own ATV familiarisation course packages, which may be tailored to the learner's individual needs and requests.<br><br>20.  If I pass my Class 3 practical test recently but have a Class 3A licence for a year or more, am I under probation?<br>Yes, you are under probation. This means your Class 3 licence may be revoked if you obtained 13 or more demerit points during the year of probation.<br><br>21.  If I pass my Class 3 practical test within one year from the date I got my Class 3A licence, do I need to display a probationary plate?<br>Yes. You will need to display the probationary plate as long as you are still under Class 3A's probation period. When your Class 3A's probation period is over, you need not display the P-plate. However, you will still be subject to the 13-demerit point rule under your new Class 3's probation period.<br><br>22.  If I get 13 or more demerit points while under probation and I have both Class 3A and Class 3 licences, which licence would be revoked?<br>Only the licence that is still under probation will be revoked. Therefore, if only your Class 3 licence is under probation while your Class 3A has passed its probation period, only your Class 3 licence will be revoked. If both your Class 3A and Class 3 licences are under probation, both will be revoked at the same time.<br><br>23.  Do I need to get a new Provisional Driving Licence (PDL) when I sit for my Class 3 practical test?<br>It depends. Class 3 PDL covers both Class 3 and Class 3A vehicles under the law and is valid for 6 months at one go. You can continue to use the PDL if it has not expired at the time you are taking the Class 3 practical test. Otherwise, you will have to apply or renew your PDL at $25/- at any of the driving schools.<br><br>24.  Am I required to take Class 3 course lessons before I can sit for a Class 3 practical test?<br>You are not legally required to take the Class 3 course lessons. You are only legally required to pass the practical test to prove your competence. However, the schools and private driving instructors may have their own policy of ensuring that you are adequately competent to use their vehicles for the test. They may require you to go through a lesson or two to ascertain your competency level.<br><br>25.  Can I use my own private vehicle for the Class 3 practical test?<br>No. Cars used for instructional and testing purposes have to be insured for training and testing and must be approved by LTA. The three privately owned driving centres only allow cars belonging to private driving instructors who are their members to enter their driving centres for training and testing.<br><br>26.  If I am undergoing MTV training currently, can I switch to ATV training?<br>You are encouraged to continue with your current training lessons. Please check with your driving instructor if it's appropriate for you to switch to ATV training as the change may disrupt your learning schedule.<br><br>27.  If I had earlier booked for a date for MTV test, can I switch later for ATV test?<br>For private candidates, you would first need to cancel the MTV test that you have earlier booked before reapplying for a new test date. A test fee for the new application will be required. Otherwise, driver learners should approach the driving centres that they have registered with. The first test will start only from 3 Jan 05 onwards.<br><br>28.  Can I apply for a Class 4A driving licence if I have a Class 3A licence?<br>No. You need a Class 3 licence.<br><br>29.  Can I sit for a Class 3A practical test even if I already have a Class 3 licence?<br>There is no need to take the test. You may opt instead for an ATV familiarisation course available at the driving centres.<br><br>30.  Can I book Class 3 and Class 3A practical tests concurrently at the same driving centre but for different dates?<br>No. This will push up the waiting time for other candidates. You will deny other candidates the chance to have earlier tests.<br><br>31.  Can I book Class 3 and Class 3A practical tests concurrently at different driving centres?<br>Please check with the driving centres on the booking details.</div>

VITO is also used as a Maxicab by Citycab. VITO commercial vehicle, if i am not wrong, does not have auto.<br><br>The other is sold as a passenger car (SD/ SF something plate) and it is called V-class, V230 to be exact. Quite rare but if you open your eyes, you can spot a few on the roads. It is only available as an auto.<br>Wonder why got people buy this passenger car that exactly look its van silbing. Not cheap. If i can remember correctly, the price is in the range of high $100K</div>

Cars, I can agree because the driver have an option to switch to fully auto or manual, both illustrated in Alfa's selespeed and Opel's easytronic system.  Commercial vehiclel comes with the familar double H gearbox, just that it does not have clutch...so it is considered an auto(without clutch pedal), can be driven with 3A licence?<br><br>For those who are not sure, Class 3 licence can be used to drive lorry/ commerical vehicle under 2500kg<br><br>Think about this...Grey area... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
