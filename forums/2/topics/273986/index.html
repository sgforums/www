            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, ppl here do take care of their rides except for a few slobs here &amp; there. Usually for myself, I wash about once a week or once in two weeks. It is recommended in car mags that after a downpour, cars should be given a wash. It's just that sometimes it always seems to rain ater u wash..., happens a lot..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But u should not allow things like bird droppings to sit and bake on ur paint in the sun. This is because bird droppings can contain an acidity level that can damage ur paint job permanently... Waxing is recommended but not too often, maybe once a month depending. Car wax is meant to provide a layer of protection for ur car &amp; also provide an even shine. So when it rains, water rolls off rather than stay on &amp; eventually leave a watermark. Personally I use liquid wash &amp; wax, applied after washing the car while the car is still wet. Try not to use solid waxes unless u hv experience or u hv a car buffing machine. Too much wax will lead to a build-up on the paint &amp; will result in lack lustre (i.e the color will seem dulled)...  Spraying water on the car will just leave watermarks...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But i've heard ppl send their car to Sin Ming Ave to get their car detailed..., they will polish it right off..</div>
