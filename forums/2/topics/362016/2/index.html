              <p>I do understand that all cars will have their own set of problems, that's y I shouldn't be worrying too much abt them. And sometimes it may voice down to 'luck'!</p>
              <p>Of cse, I'll not buy on impulse! I'll definitely work up my sum b4 signing along the dotted-line and spend within my budget.</p>

              <p>If you need a salesperson to assist you, simply pop by the counter and request for one. Apparently this is the way certain showrooms work nowadays, which is good for people who don't want a SE to follow them around when they wanna explore the cars.</p>
              <p>However, even with that problem out of the way, VW sales staffs are simply mediocre compared to other continental makes.</p>

              <p>n0x,</p>
              <p>I started off here. Eventually, my fren recommended me to
              post my questions in www.vagsg.com, which I did ("Volkswagen Car Spare
              Parts Costs?"). Thanks anyway!</p>

              <p>Both. On a busy day, it can be hard to get a SE. Even on a weekday afternoon, some waiting may be necessary and there aren't a lot of people in the showroom. But I must say this has improved in recent times. Perhaps they have recruited more staff.</p>
              <p>Service wise, I guess other bros here have also had experiences that aren't anything to shout about. One sells car like he sells chicken rice, and a couple of others believe 'silence is golden.' You gotta experience it for yourself.</p>
              <p>I have been there on 3 different occasions with different friends who are looking at getting a new ride, and we can't say we enjoyed the 'buying experience'.</p>

              <p>True, I may never see my SE again after I get the car. But will I give my money to a SE with subpar service? It's a straight no, not even if I like the car. True, I won't ever see him after handing over of the vehicle, but it does say alot about how a company treats its customers. It's also an indirect indication of the after sales service, which matters to me.</p>
              <p>After experiencing how good other SEs are, let's just say VW has plenty of room for improvement.</p>
