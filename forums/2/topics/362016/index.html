              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>I'm actually looking at the Volkswagen 1.4 TSI (DSG). Any experience Volkswagen owners out there who can give me some advices?</p>
              <p>1) How durable is Volkswagen's car? How long can the spare parts generally last before having problem?</p>
              <p>2) Are the spare parts (eg. auto gear box, air-con, etc.) expensive to repair or replace?</p>
              <p>3) I was told by the sales person that servicing for every 15,000 km cost around S$300+/-. Is this consider expensive?</p>
              <p>4) Is there any body kits for Volkswagen 1.4 TSI (DSG) and where can I find them?</p>
              <p>5) Is this car a value buyer for around S$78,000? Any resale value?</p>
              <p>Hope some 'seniors' out there can give me some valuable advices. This will be my first car after working so hard for the past 10 years.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Scirocco is a beauty... but it's totally off my budget. I prefer sedan, that's why I'm not looking at Golf.</p>

              <p>1) How durable is Volkswagen's car? How long can the spare parts

                                      expensive to repair or replace? Roughly how much they will cost?</p>
              <p>3) I was told by the sales person that servicing for every
                                      15,000 km cost around S$300+/-. Is this consider expensive?</p>
              <p>4) Is there any body kits for Volkswagen Jetta 1.4 TSI (DSG) and where

              <p>I bought my Jetta TSI in Jul 2008. So far so good with zero problems, hence no comments on price of spare parts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Serviced it for the first time last month (after the first 15000km). costs me only $150. Cheaper than a typical servicing at Borneo motors for a Toyota.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At $78k, you are paying for a Continental car with 7 speed DSG, paddle shift, twin-charged TSI engine, good fuel economy etc. Trust me, you will not be thinking of reselling anytime soon.</p>

              <p>1) Sngyyy bought his Jetta in Jul 2008, so his Jetta is obviously still under warranty, so he must have serviced it with the authorised service centre at VW.</p>
              <p>2) Jetta looks good enough in stock form, just give it bigger rims and maybe a lowered ride height. I think adding side skirts and spoilers will only make it look stodgy.</p>

              <p>I'm kind of skeptical of changing the rims. Yes, it's may look nicer with a nicer, lighter 17"/18" sport rims, lowering the ride height, but I'm worry abt the additional noise generated. My bro just bought his new Mazda 3 and changed to 18" (lighter) sport rims. I felt very noisy when sitting his car.</p>
              <p>Jetta looks very executive. That's y I might want to add a small spoiler to add some sporty look. Side skirts??? Didn't cross my mind.</p>

              <p>Bigger rims are usually wider as well. So, yes, it will definitely generate more road noise. But given the fact that the Jetta is a continental car, I bet the noise insulation will be better than the Mazda 3, especially around the wheelarches.</p>
              <p>The only thing you're gonna worry about fitting bigger rims is brittle ride.</p>

              <p>why make urself miserable when u noe u r gonna worry if the parts will fail and if u will be able to afford the replacement of the parts? and this is already with the knowledge that certain parts will cost a bomb to replace? the equation is: u pay $ to worry about something.</p>
              <p>if u worry about having to pay a big amount to replace a part, it probably also means that u do not have a pot of cash for any rainy days, or its a very small and slow growing pot, or do not want to touch the reserve fund that u set aside for whatever. TS, i would ask u to seriously reconsider ur car choice, or even ur choice of transport.</p>
              <p>maybe im ignorant. u can ass u me that im ignorant. but pls be absolutely sure on which grounds ur standing on to judge me ignorant.</p>

              <p>What i mean is if u dun worry about all the aspect u r going to face after purchase the car, u might go into a deeper shithole. thats y i suggest it will be more kan chiong on the details before getting a new car.</p>

              <p>1) How durable is Volkswagen's car? How long can the spare parts
                                      generally last before having problem?</p>
              <p>I've two friends who have owned VW Passats, and they were okay with it for like 5-6 years. Then again I don't think their VWs came with the DSGs, so I'm not sure how reliability is going to work out on that. I would be more concerned myself, with the DSG because I would think VW engines would be fine. If it's the nitty gritty things like power window motors and all that, I think all of them just have limited useful life, and if you have to replace it you have to replace it.</p>
              <p>2) Are the spare parts (eg. auto gear box, air-con, etc.)
                                      expensive to repair or replace?</p>
              <p>I'm guessing the DSG would really take the cake for repair costs compared to things like air conditioning parts. I just changed the cooling coil on my Altis for like $500. Seemed a bit high to me, but the mechanic who did it for me does good work so I guess I paid for a little reassurance too.</p>
              <p>3) I was told by the sales person that servicing for every
                                      15,000 km cost around S$300+/-. Is this consider expensive?</p>
              <p>I was quoted about $200+ normal servicing by my VW SE, I didn't buy one in the end, weighing between this car and the Honda Civic, still went for the Civic.  However Borneo motors charges about $200+ for an Altis' normal servicing, same for Subaru Forester turbo.  I guess VW has a lot more electronic systems to worry about? Anyway I do my servicing for my Altis in Malaysia for S$128, inclusive of wheel balancing, alignment and rotation, so I guess choice of place does make a difference.</p>
              <p>4) Is there any body kits for Volkswagen 1.4 TSI (DSG) and where
                                      can I find them?</p>
              <p>5) Is this car a value buyer for around S$78,000? Any resale
                                      value?</p>
              <p>The SE was upfront and told me the resale value will never be as good as a Honda or Toyota for the short to medium term, unless maybe VW sells so many of them here that 2nd hand demand rises drastically? To me it's a value buy, you get a lot of power and kit for the money, but resale value is probably going to be low. Resale value also depends on market sentiment at the time of sale so I don't think anyone can provide you a concrete answer for an extended period of time. Nissan Sunnys used to have great resale value from what I know, but the newer ones are simply not as high in value compared to the late 90s. All I know is, never ever hope to make a profit on a car in Singapore, it just seems impossible for owners.</p>
              <p>I hope this helps you, but if it doesn't, at least I had fun typing out the reply <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>I do understand that all cars will have their own set of problems, that's y I shouldn't be worrying too much abt them. And sometimes it may voice down to 'luck'!</p>

              <p>As im a dutchmen i dont know VW expenses in SG. But here in the netherlands they're quite affordable. Service costs are not that high either.</p>
              <p>They've proven to be very reliable too. But japanese cars are still on top for quality, very reliable. But today the day, almost all cars are comparable.</p>
              <p>I guess in sg VW will be more expensive then here in the netherlands tho cause of our location. Like asian cars are more expensive in service then european cars. But even that all depends on the type of car you have.</p>
