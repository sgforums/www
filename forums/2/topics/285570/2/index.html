It is very uncall for especially in a public forum. You have the rite to post or talk whatever you want, but do not assume others as not knowing the importance of driving and customer satisfaction. One of the ethic in business is not to engage in personnal critic and assumption but merely to make money by trading in an equal enviroment.<br></div></blockquote>Agreed x 2..

I was taught through experiences that driving your client in your own car projects the professionalism and image of yourself and the company. Last time when I was out entertaining with small clients, I usually order Coke so that I can drive home. This time round my boss has pre-ordered 15 bottles of <span style="color: red;">Martel</span> and other liquor so I can't escape this time round  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div></blockquote>ur boss ordered toys ah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>unless u drive a bentley or a rolls royce, and assuming ur clients are really that status conscious, i dun see why u can't get a decent merc cab to ferry ur clients around. and if ur clients are really so important until u muz drive them personally, all the more ur boss should excuse u from drinking so that can fetch and send them safely instead of drinking urself silly (and look silly in front of ur clients when u have to get another person to drive).<br><br>another marketing scam. backfired. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
