            <div class='col-md body'>Because they are from overseas without transport here so my boss says that it is better and more proper to drive them in personal vehicles than using taxi. Price wise I think it's reasonable. Taking cab to their hotel to fetch them, then to the club, then back to their hotel then lastly back home, including midnight charge, should cost a bomb! Most big clubs charges $60 for such service! Price wise I am fine with it. It is the fact that I never try before so perhaps someone here have tried before so asking for feedback. Thanks!</div>

I was not really drunk, but just worry of accident and being book by TP for alcohol induced driving and later get suspended, then how to do my business. I requested for a lady driver as i do not trust man, so they get a lady for me, Wow! real professional, very good and courteous driver, their service is very good. Me reached home, she parked at my garage, then told my maid to take care of me. She even left a note with me with  her contact nos and also stated if anything is missing from my car, please do not hesitate to call her/her company.<br><br>The next day, she even call to ask how am I doing. I am so pleased. Used to call her for her service even to fetch clients at airport or when I need to chat with client in the car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Samicksports. I agree with your boss. It is necessary for you to drive your own car instead of taking a cab when business clients come from overseas. I am a businessman myself and I have never fail to drive my client around in my own car, even going out for night entertainment where drinking is never out of the list. Having said that, I am Drive-U-Home Services regular customer and I am never once disappointed with their service. They saved my licence, my car and my life many times. I believe most of the guys who replied you are not businessman/woman themselves and does not know the importance of driving your client in your own car. So with my advise, businessman myself, I highly recommend you engage their service. Be responsible, you drink, don't EVER drive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi archergod, yeah I agree with you. I was taught through experiences that driving your client in your own car projects the professionalism and image of yourself and the company. Last time when I was out entertaining with small clients, I usually order Coke so that I can drive home. This time round my boss has pre-ordered 15 bottles of Martel and other liquor so I can't escape this time round  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

It is very uncall for especially in a public forum. You have the rite to post or talk whatever you want, but do not assume others as not knowing the importance of driving and customer satisfaction.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by archergod:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Samicksports. I agree with your boss. It is necessary for you to drive your own car instead of taking a cab when business clients come from overseas. I am a businessman myself and I have never fail to drive my client around in my own car, even going out for night entertainment where drinking is never out of the list. Having said that, I am Drive-U-Home Services regular customer and I am never once disappointed with their service. They saved my licence, my car and my life many times. I believe most of the guys who replied you are not businessman/woman themselves and does not know the importance of driving your client in your own car. So with my advise, businessman myself, I highly recommend you engage their service. Be responsible, you drink, don't EVER drive.</div></blockquote>I'll agree with the point about not drinking and driving, but the rest of this post is rubbish.  I don't know what kind of backwater banana republic clients you have that would be impressed with you having a car, but to be frank, who gives a damn as long as the service/product you offer is rock-solid?  Are you trying to cover up for poor offerings from your company?</div>
