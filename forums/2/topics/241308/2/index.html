            <div class='col-md body'>All these crap on illegal use of foglights are downright irrelevant and yet another mis-application of the regulations by the supposed experts in the authorities.<br><br>First of all.. after driving for more den 10 years on the road, i am telling you the single-most glare caused by another vehicle has always been that from a SBS bus, lorry or similar sized vehicle whenever they come right up behind you. But these vehicles usually dun have very strong headlights to cause glare from a distance though. They do, however, cause momentary blindness when in close range at junctions especially when on opposite directions. I believe this is due to the height of the lamp mounted on their vehicle.<br><br>Other lights that glare are HID lights from a distance behind. But because they are factory standards, LTA says they are safe to create such unsafe situations. Go figure.<br><br>Foglights?: The angle which they are mounted never causes glare if i may say. Even some years back with lots of unapproved aftermarket foglights in the streets, not a single one actually caused me any glare. They were at the most, loud with their more den usual headlamps and some with distinctive colours.<br><br>So if glare and disturbance are the logic of their arguments, they should make turning on of HID lights illegal and those cars with HID should use only their foglights since those dun create glare to other road users other den ants on the floor.  In fact, i find that driving on our streets, the importance of lights serves more as a signal to other road users that our vehicle is in that position rather den to illuminate the road ahead. Our roads are generally pretty well-lit already and even driving without headlights are possible on highways.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, foglights are irritating when turned on during downpour, coz the reflection from the asphalt can cause glare, but ok when it's hazy...<br><br>in the other hand, aftermarket HID sucks since we can choose the colour, I think the illegal one is only under 4500 Kelvin, but I once saw kiosk selling 12000 Kelvin, it's purple <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I would certainly think so..so it's also only a matter of time before we got used to HID lights..and like I've said before, if you are gonna ban HID lights on cars, then you might as well import cars to Singapore without headlights..because HID lights are filtering into a lot of cars..even cheaper cars now..so soon HID lights will replace the halogen bulbs and every car will have HID lights.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
