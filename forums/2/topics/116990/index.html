            <div class='col-md body'>damn suay... today actually want to go to celebrate cny one but kena accident... i on SLE towards mandai, and this white car in front of me suddenly swerved left without braking at all. i was wondering wat the hell was he thinking about and suddenly i saw this golden renault scenic in front of me and i jammed the brakes immediately but crashed. The scenic was stationary or near stationary. i estimate i was around 90 to 100km/h when i applied the brakes, so it should be around 60-70km/h when crash. Luckily everyone all right but my car cannot start engine at all... if repair need to change whole body, thinking of getting a new car instead... so who do u think is more wrong? me or the scenic? if the scenic hadn't stopped at all or stopped at the shoulder then i wouldn't have crashed... if the white car had braked b4 swerving then i would have been prepared... now i have a feeling that the white car purposely want me to crash one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ...</div>

Try to remember if the scenic was stationery because of the following purpose and if the hazard light  and triangle sign was there or not(if breakdown).  If don't have its possible to shift some blame to the other party.

            <div class='col-md body'>STiYaKuzA,<br><br>Based on what you described, in my opinion, you were TOO CLOSE and the white car wants you to learn something; Don't Tailgate.<br><br>If, you had kept a good distance, I guarantee you will have been able to avoid this crash at such a high speed.<br><br>Why in the first place, must you travel so close at such a speed? Whether the car in front signals to swerve out is irrelevant. The fact that you could not evade a crash, is obvious that you were too close. In an emergency, it is not possible to signal before swerving out to avoid a collision. Only a safe distance of at least 3 car lengths can allow you time to react.<br><br>Even then, it all depends on how attentive you are, while driving.<br><br></div>

Anyway, tailgating is an offence, I think, so for this incident, I guess you are at fault. Be glad no-one is hurt.</div>

This is a piece of good evidence that a driver has stopped without good reason resulting in the accident. It is likely if there is a court case, she will change her statement later.<br><br>The three question I would ask for this accident would be<br><br>(1) "Did the scenic stop suddenly and without valid reason"? If yes, this is the party at fault.<br><br>(2) "Was the white car day-dreaming and did not realize a car has stopped and continue to speed along only to realize the stopping car in the last second?" If yes, you got sabo by this driver, but is unlikely able to blame him.<br><br>(3) "Were you following too close and fast to allow any reaction time at all?"</div>

The prescribed distance is just a guideline. If your need more reaction time, then you should just have more distance or drive slower.<br><br>If the car ahead of you had to swerve due to jaywalking pedestrian, would you have reacted in time to avoid the pedestrian?<br><br></div>

This is a piece of good evidence that a driver has stopped without good reason resulting in the accident. It is likely if there is a court case, she will change her statement later.<br><br>The three question I would ask for this accident would be<br><br>(1) "Did the scenic stop suddenly and without valid reason"? If yes, this is the party at fault.<br><br>(2) "Was the white car day-dreaming and did not realize a car has stopped and continue to speed along only to realize the stopping car in the last second?" If yes, you got sabo by this driver, but is unlikely able to blame him.<br><br>(3) "Were you following too close and fast to allow any reaction time at all?"</div></blockquote>how to tape leh... everything in a mess that moment... anyway when the white car swerved, he was damn close to the scenic when he did so... too bad never take note of his no. plate... how many percent is this going to be a court case btw?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in any case, despite trying to put myself in your shoes, you are in the wrong here; this is what the TP will decide most probably anyway....<br><br>You are right when you say the Scenic should not have stopped, I have been behind cars which has no car in front of them but brake suddenly or behind cars  that brake at every 3 seconds (i really saw a Hyundai Sonata do that to me before hahaha).<br><br>The key thing in defensive driving is that whatever the stupid actions of others, we must be alert and prepared to avoid accidents. We must ALWAYS expect others to make mistakes, We must ALWAYS think that our car, a machine, may screw up today; this is good defensive driving. Though its not 100% foolproof, it is a good guideline to follow.<br><br>In your case, whatever the stupid actions the scenic or the white car in front of you did, it is very hard to tell the TP that the fault is not yours because you crash into a car directly in front of you.  The only time a friend got off banging someone was he was going straight and someone suddenly cut into his lane and he bang.  Though he bang from behind, there were eye witnesses and also he took photos of the scene that the front car suddenly swerve in the lane which he has right of way of.<br><br>So bro, just be thankful no one is hurt and well for the accident, you can call it suay or what, but just take it as a lesson lah....</div>
