            <div class='col-md body'>I also kena a similar accident on the 30th of Jan. Driving my Vios along Punggol Road. Going to turn right at a junction. In front of me is a Hyundai Matrix. For some reason or other, the Hyundai matrix did a sudden brake. As i was too close behind her, I langa her from behind.<br><br>Ask her why she did a sudden brake, she said the car in front of her also brake. But she will also win the case hands down because you are the one hitting HER FROM BEHIND. LAN LAN<br><br>The lesson i learnt is also keep a safe following distance.  No matter what stupid thing the car in front do, if you langa the car from behind, then good luck to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br></div>
