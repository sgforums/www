            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br>I just bought a car and is still waiting for it. I booked it about 3 weeks ago and my SE say still not release yet. My car is from C&amp;C. It thought if my installment start liao and I havn't got my car, it will be quite loogie mah. But since this is my first car, I dunno what is the practice out there. Anyone can advise me on this?<br>I think my SE told me the installment start when I book it, but that time, he told me car can get very soon ,so I thought never mind. But until now, still waiting, and I think this is not correct way of doing things. What shoudl I do now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did the contact you sign state a minimum time for delievery. For me, I was shocked too when my SE asked for my money and IC for registration. I also questioned about the reason for asking for money so soon. In my contact, it state that I will get my car not more than 3 weeks after my car is registered.<br><br>2 weeks after, my IC still wasn't returned. And I started questioning my SE why the delay. Than few days more, he told me to go and get my IC. At first I was like, "What I still have to go down to your place?" in my mind. Then he said, "don't want to get your car?".<br><br>Later I realised that they will only register your car after they have installed all the given freebies to maximise my ownership. Just that my SE isn't tactiful enough to give my assurance when I was confused. What I did that time was said another SE recommended by my other kelisa drivers.<br><br>By the way, how you know loan started? Actually loan started still isn't "lugi". Worse is road tax and insurance already started and car still isn't ready. Do clarify if the car is already in Singapore and if it is already registered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i can't confirm the loan started, just a feeling because I asked my SE once when the first installment start and he said september(free), so I need to pay 2nd installment in oct. But sept start liao, still no news.<br>I also didn't read the minimum time of delivery. What is the time of delivery based on? From booking, signing of car or what?<br>When you say car registered, what does it mean? My SE say my car already all done sui sui liao, waiting for PDI(pre-delivery inspection) to approve the release. So can be anytime, but that anytime had been since last last week(mid 20th of august).Is that waht your registration means?<br>At first I though C&amp;C do things very nice, but now like abit disturbed liao.<br>Somemore, at first say my insruance cost that much, then after that, say need to increase because I p-plate. Got this kind of things one meh? What do you think?<br>I only felt assured because this is C&amp;C, not some PI. But the service I got is still like not up to standard enuf...</div>

Cause usually they will give you the estimated price from your age, some newbie SE might miss out a few details until they submit your details for the actual number.<br><br>Lastly, since this is your first car, first time buying something with a 5digit number price tag, naturally you will be un-easy due to some unexplained delays and such. Anyway, only when you encountered a lousier service would you think the pervious one is good, a kind of human nature. So just be patience and let the SE sort things out for you. Don't rush him, might result in sloppy job. (Not checking your car before delivery or anything similar.)</div>
