              <p>Friends here, the car mentioned here is a WRX. The driver mentioned is someone whom i know but yet to meet up with and he just got married this year. This freak accident was caused due to the collision avoidance with a cyclist.</p>
              <p>I suspect he might have stomp on the accelerator instead of the brakes and being a turbo charged car, he might had lost control easily and veered off the road.</p>

              <p>another senseless lost of life... avoid cyclist... how many of us have to on the roads nowadays especially if u are driving in the areas of Geylang and Serangoon road. U gotta juz let off on the gas and the damage would not be so serious even if there is one. 60km... dream on x2 may be more likely. Goes to show u can drive but wat is speed without control? ABS, EBD, Airbags.... all crap as even a russian tank wont save u if u drive in such a reckless manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wanna witness such dumb acts.... juz go to the bus stop beside the Durian at Marina in the wee hrs between 2-4am, u will get to see a lot of such crap drivers, T-rexs, Evos, Swifts, hell there are even Altis F1 wannabes there. A couple of times I've seen the drivers brake really late to avoid ramming into the back of other cars and once a malaysian registered Wira almost slammed into the right wall juz before the Fort Canning Tunnel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guessed we're not the only ones who know of such reckless driving and if the LTA wif cameras in the Fort Canning Tunnel turns a blind eye and TP does not step up enforcement in the area and to other known death traps to curb such acts, all we can do is juz hope that we will not read in the papers one day of the lost of one of our friends, bros or children.</p>

              <p>Was at the wake 2 days ago,  really sorry for ex-colleague. But shld hv warn him when he crashed his silver WRX weeks ago.</p>
              <p>His friend red WRX is mod to 700hp &amp; while i won't discount the reason for speeding, but DAMM! the people here are heartless with needless remarks.</p>
              <p>But then this is SGforums where there are many retards(not to mention the MODs!), so i guess it's excusable.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Just dun blame me when me &amp; my group comes in with insensitive remarks if anybody's known loved ones here passes on too. </span></strong></p>

              <p>people out there, pls don give anymr bad comments...already passed away, can just let them go peacefully? u think he wanted the way the whole incident ended? he was just avoiding the cyclist...and ended up tis way... yet ppl out there still gt d mood to snap videos...btw hps are gone, who took it?</p>
              <p>bahnoo u sure they are speeding? their cars sound like speeding but most of the time its not speeding....cos when they step abit of the accelerator, the sound will go vrooom...u sure they are speeding? or u just listen to the sound only? i tink if they wanted to speed they also will not find that area for speeding....</p>

              <p>Reminds me of a red MR2. After going off the road down an initial D kinda downhill track, skidded , i was the 3rd car . I turned the bend to see the evo brake n i had to avoid it n brake in front of the evo. When we maanged to get down there, the car was a ball of junk. Crushed beyond recognition. Him crushed inside the car. Nothing any of us could do but to wait for the police which took almost 45 mins to arrive.</p>
              <p>Then there is the BMW accident , the Rover accident, Silvia accident, the Supra accident...man the supra one was way way too brutal and graphic.ALL RIP. Then u see the parents. N some of thier parents blamed us. Well, what can we say right ?</p>
              <p>Look at how bad the Rex is after impact. Unrecognizable. When u drive in high speed and crash into an immovable object, something has to give. N in tis case.. its the car and the passengers. Anyways, if drive 60KMH n below will definately be able to avoid the cyclist. Its the speed and the sudden need to avoid that always end up crash n burn. Even i dun dare to say that i can avoid effectively while at high speed. Everything is so fast, near misses wakes u up. But whether or not u heed that warning or not is up you.</p>

              <p>Friends here, the car mentioned here is a WRX. The driver mentioned is someone whom i know but yet to meet up with and he just got married this year. This freak accident was caused due to the collision avoidance with a cyclist.</p>
              <p>I suspect he might have stomp on the accelerator instead of the brakes and being a turbo charged car, he might had lost control easily and veered off the road.</p>
