              <p>I really doubt yr words. In the 1st place no1 was knock down so y keep cursing and giving stupid comments. U all r so funny. If u say they deserve to die, then maybe yr friends or loves one also devserve to die. Y?  I use yr word 'IF' , IF yr love ones caused some1 to die just becos the drivers wan to sim them or maybe they jaywalk, should yr love 1 die?  So many accidents in spore that means to say are cause by racing la. Some accidents are becos of stupid or inconsiderate ppl like u, not racing. Any how sway left/right with signal is 1 example.</p>
              <p>Pls think b4 u talk big! If u say no doubt we should let the dead RIP, then STOP OR  THE STUPID COMMENTS.</p>

              <p>comparing SGForum to other forum that is discussing the same topic, i can see the difference.</p>
              <p>SGForums is starting to be somewhere for kids/keyboard warrior/nothing else better to do fuckers who come in and talk without knowing the exact picture. for fucking goodness sake, the dead is dead, give them your respect. we do not know what really happen, we juz fucking keep our fucking mouth shut and keep comments to yourselves. no point saying they are speeding at xxx km/h and crash and deserve to die when u fucking do not know the full picture. there are different stories here and there, wait till the coroner report/ investigation report to be out than come in and give your comments.</p>
              <p>take a minute and tink it thru or look at other forum and see the differences. and for those who say THEY or THE DRIVER deserve it, better take back your words. karma will come to you soon.</p>

              <p>Seriously saying about they speeding why not saying about those fukers that actually cycle on the roadside.Go ask all the drivers in singapore who didnt saw such cyclist that cycle on the road and expect all the cars to give way to them.

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, let me say something 1st:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My condolences to the 2 who passed away and their frens who are sad, esp direct family members...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one deserves to die like that...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i`m not going to side who, but everyone are entitled to their point of view, that includes mine too....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will not say they deserve to die, but lets just face it, they were too fast for the road that they were on.. thus it lowers their reaction time towards the environment.. be it the cyclist or not..</p>
              <p>let their dimiss be a lesson to all, let just drive properly..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being a transport user in all 4 classes, walking, bicycle, motorcyle and driver... i believe i deserve some substinence to talk abt how things should be fairly accounted for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and seriously, i tink indeed some ppl here have been really too insensitive towards the deceased, but the reffutals from the drivers fren aint really too fair either...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don mind me OT for a while when one of the frens mentioned about bahnoo being jealous of not able to drive a sports car or things like tt... somehow it feels too arrogant for me to stomache too.. tell me it`s a performance car instead, cuz i`m sure u dunno what`s a real sports car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the comment that makes me wanna post here...</p>
              <p>Mr 87, can u tell me where do u actually wan cyclist to cycle??</p>
              <p>middle of the road or on the pavement?</p>
              <p>if u do not know, it`s perfectly legal to travel on the road, but not on the pavements where ppl walk... u know, as cyclist, we do not want to be a nusiance to the ppl walking at the pavement too..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so tell me, singapore should FUCKING BAN CYCLING?</p>
              <p>where u expect cyclist to cycle anyway?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i say this incident, if it`s the cyclist tt caused this accident, he`s only to carry partial respoinsibility, cuz a bicycle cant be `that` fast.. i`m not discounting that there are indeed cyclist who don care abt thier lives.. just tt this case, i feel the responsibility rested too much on the drivers instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i rest my case with my humble opinions...</p>

              <p>comparing SGForum to other forum that is discussing the same topic, i can see the difference.</p>
              <p>SGForums is starting to be somewhere for kids/keyboard warrior/nothing else better to do fuckers who come in and talk without knowing the exact picture. for fucking goodness sake, the dead is dead, give them your respect. we do not know what really happen, we juz fucking keep our fucking mouth shut and keep comments to yourselves. no point saying they are speeding at xxx km/h and crash and deserve to die when u fucking do not know the full picture. there are different stories here and there, wait till the coroner report/ investigation report to be out than come in and give your comments.</p>
              <p>take a minute and tink it thru or look at other forum and see the differences. and for those who say THEY or THE DRIVER deserve it, better take back your words. karma will come to you soon.</p>

              <p>Seriously saying about they speeding why not saying about those fukers that actually cycle on the roadside.Go ask all the drivers in singapore who didnt saw such cyclist that cycle on the road and expect all the cars to give way to them. (If you didnt saw it before then drive more.You will see them.) They are the main cause of accident. Even the safest driver can lead to accident because of them. Not to say where are they from as people should know which place or country loves to cycle. Not to be racist but that is the fact.</p>
              <p>And if you are one of the cyclist that  cycle on the road like its yours, please cycle on the walkway. If you can't then just walk or take bus or you will have a day that you will see your bicycle split into half.</p>

              <p>irrespective of cyclist or driver, nobody likes an accident to happen, especially if someone gets hurt or in the case, lives are lost.</p>
              <p>fuming over cyclists will get you nowhere. they are here to stay.</p>
              <p>you are better off keeping a look-out for them, or for the matter, pedestrian, motorbike, other cars too to avoid hitting one just as they practice safe and defensive riding/cycling/driving.</p>
              <p>i (used to) drive, but i still ride the bicyle and scooter on the road, and i know how driver and rider feel about each other. mutual respect to all users on the road will help make the road safer for all.</p>

              <p>Mayb i am going out of point here. But i do own a sabaru car and i like to point out that the car might b a bit on the heavy side with all it AWD and nice handling, but still, its body is damn soft loh.</p>
              <p>I know that the point of impact is at the weak link of the car design, hence spliting into two, but will this happen if it was another car maker type?</p>
              <p>Reason why i said it is soft... coz one day i, my knee accidentally bump into my own car door and it create a deep dent on it. Either the body is very soft or i got metal knee, coz i dun even suffer from any brusing at all. Worse of all, itis at the harder part of the door frame near the edge rather then the softer middle section.</p>
              <p>On another inciddent, my fren car bump into the rear of a wrx. The wrx bumber is totally crush. But my fren car front plate is still very much intact. cost $6k repair for the wrx and zero $ repair for me fren's car.</p>
