              <p>Seriously saying about they speeding why not saying about those fukers that actually cycle on the roadside.Go ask all the drivers in singapore who didnt saw such cyclist that cycle on the road and expect all the cars to give way to them. (If you didnt saw it before then drive more.You will see them.) They are the main cause of accident. Even the safest driver can lead to accident because of them. Not to say where are they from as people should know which place or country loves to cycle. Not to be racist but that is the fact.</p>
              <p>And if you are one of the cyclist that  cycle on the road like its yours, please cycle on the walkway. If you can't then just walk or take bus or you will have a day that you will see your bicycle split into half.</p>

              <p>i do believe ur mentioning those bangladeshi's who cycle w/o even bothering about the traffic conditions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there have been many instances of motorists getting into arguments with cyclists. and many a times, its the motorists who "think" cyclists should belong to the pavements. and that's why they try to be funny, sounding the horns FOR NOTHING just to scare the cyclists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the speed is way off the limit, its way off the limit. dun blame cyclists....if u wanna drive, drive properly. if not, take public transport before some innocent people die as a result of RECKLESS driving.</p>

              <p>sometime shit happen mah... that is why now most bus stop have crash barrier install. So if u look on the bright side, atleast something good happen out of that.</p>
              <p>u can oso comment on that time the bus reverse into the bus interchange killing a nus undergrad sitting there waiting for bus.</p>
              <p>So this serve as a reminder to all those that speed that is does kill. save 5min of travel time, cost you and those in the car their life. Worse other innocent victim as well.</p>

              <p>Mayb i am going out of point here. But i do own a sabaru car and i like to point out that the car might b a bit on the heavy side with all it AWD and nice handling, but still, its body is damn soft loh.</p>
              <p>I know that the point of impact is at the weak link of the car design, hence spliting into two, but will this happen if it was another car maker type?</p>
              <p>Reason why i said it is soft... coz one day i, my knee accidentally bump into my own car door and it create a deep dent on it. Either the body is very soft or i got metal knee, coz i dun even suffer from any brusing at all. Worse of all, itis at the harder part of the door frame near the edge rather then the softer middle section.</p>
              <p>On another inciddent, my fren car bump into the rear of a wrx. The wrx bumber is totally crush. But my fren car front plate is still very much intact. cost $6k repair for the wrx and zero $ repair for me fren's car.</p>

              <p>Hey thanks SandmanX for the well taken video clip at gulliemard road! Indeed very</p>
              <p>''gory'' You took great effort to video this clip just to journalise and educate the public yah?? Repetition of 3 posts of the same entry *clap hands*</p>
              <p>God knows whether were you the one whom raced with the driver on that day yah??</p>
              <p>If that's the case, maybe i should get the investigating officer to track down your</p>
              <p>ip address since you took great effort to post this video clip after 3 months of their</p>
              <p>death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest you to post this clip 3 months ago since you have all the information</p>
              <p>that people like to know. Scared??? Why post 3 months later?? For your information,</p>
              <p>if you do not know your spelling well, please do not disgrace yourself. Well, ''gory''</p>
              <p>indeed, HAHAHA! Retarded idiot whom don't even know how to spell glory!</p>

              <p>Is no wonder why you feel nothing when both of them were lying in a pool of blood because you are <strong>visually impaired</strong> towards such horrific scene.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I shall educate you too!</p>
              <p>Visually impairment is the consequence of a functional loss of vision, rather than the eye disorder itself.Visual impairment can also be caused by <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">brain and nerve</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">disorders.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>I bet you are <span style="color: #ff0000;">having some brain and nerve disorders</span> too which i strongly</strong></p>
              <p><strong>suggest you to <span style="color: #ff0000;">see a neurology doctor soon</span>. =) </strong></p>
