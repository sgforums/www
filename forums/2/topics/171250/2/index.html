Dun try to make a "slow" car fast, it will cost you plenty more..<br><br>I used to play with plugs.. take out cats, put "high-flow" air filters, use donno wat stupid friction reducing oils (btw, they are all useless, forget about those 5~15% improvement shit claims! Trust me, BHPs dun come that easy and cheap!).. then, to the more serious stuff such as change flywheel, chutch, 1/2 race cams, programable ECUs.. ok, the car did go faster.. but still not fast enuf, normal driving like shit, difficult to drive and have a 6km/l FC (lucky last time fuel not so ex)!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Den hor, go insprction FAIL!! need to reprogramm ECU so lean till car can only crawl in order to pass!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And if matter is not bad enuf, I go race (legal ones of coz) becoz i mod my car, need to go different class, now kena race with even faster mod GTis!!

My advice would be to work on your rolling acceleration.<br><br>Anyway it can be a miss conception that a cold air intake will increase acceleration, because what happens with a cold air intake is, it increases top end power, but your torque suffers. Instead, I believe a change to a sports filter, which retains your original filter box but uses a specially made filter, such as K&amp;N, would be sufficient.<br><br>next, think about changing your spark plugs to high performance ones such as denso iridiums. also, switch to larger diameter spark plug wires, and THEN, adding grounding in conjunction with these other changes to the electrical wiring makes sense.<br><br>You might also want to consider swapping a sports exhaust system, although there aren't many legal ones out there, and the legal ones are expensive. Taking out the 'cat' would liberate some horsepowers, but not advisable, as that is illegal as well.<br><br>Of course, 1st and foremost, u have to ask yourself, what your budget is, and then from there, decide what you should do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i also need to point out to you, that its not 100% accurate to say that if you change your rims to a smaller one, u'll get faster acceleration.<br><br>generally, what matters most is the overall wheel size, meaning, the rim with the tyre fitted on. if you go down a rim size, but get higher profile tyres, it generally off sets the change in rim size, hence your speedo's calibration should not be affected either.<br><br>similarly, if u go up a rim size, and get lower profiled tyres, your overall wheel diameters stays more or less the same. so for eg, if your car has 15" rims now with 195/65 R15 tyres, if you swap out for a 16 inch rim, u should be able to stay with 195/55 R16 tyres, maintaining your overall wheel size. in general, for every inch increase in rim size, u have to do a corresponding 10mm decrease in the tyre's profile, and vice versa.<br><br>now regarding overall wheel diameter, if that decreases, it is true that your acceleration would increase. But it would also upset your car's suspension settings as the car's suspension was set up to respond best to running on that particular wheel size. a smaller overall wheel diameter might result in insufficient suspension travel, which might result in the underside of the car being damaged easily.</div>
