            <div class='col-md body'>In the state of California, there exists a mandate that a breathalyzer be installed in the cars of individuals that have had two or more violations for driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. The test requires the driver to breathe into a breathalyzer before the car will start. If the driver is above the legal limit for alcohol, the carÂ’s starter motor will not operate and the engine will not start.<br><br>However, a major problem with this device is that it does not guarantee that the driver of the vehicle is taking the breathalyzer test. For instance, a driver can have a sober passenger take the breathalyzer test and thereby be able to drive the car.<br><br>Research is ongoing to add weight and seatbelt sensors to ensure that it is the driver and not someone else who is taking the test.<br><br>I have a better idea. A small DNA chip installed into the breathalyzer system will confirm the identity of the person by the DNA present in the saliva. The technology is now available but rather expensive.<br><br>Persons convicted of drunk driving can be made to pay for the system to be installed. If we extend it to all drivers of vehicles, drink driving will be a thing of the past.<br><br></div>

Someone else's DNA will not be recognized and so the engine will not start. It's like a fingerprinting machine.<br><br>Yes, it means the car can only be driven by the person or persons registered to drive it. You need to have both the right DNA and the low alcohol levels to start the engine. Once started, an infrared surveillance system will only allow the engine to run as long as the driver seat is occupied. If you leave the driver seat, the engine will shut down and you will need to blow again to start the engine. This will also prevent you from getting your wife to start the car and then change the the driver.</div>

Increasingly, car insurance premiums are linked to the age of the driver, his safety record, number of traffic violations etc...if a safe driver allows his reckless speed demon of a brother to drive his car, the insurance company will suffer loss.
