            <div class='col-md body'>I got caught doing 109km/h at a 50km/h road at the end of the Upper Serangoon Road few years back. Sian ....TP set up camera there on a saturday afternoon aroud 5pm. At that time, my wife was carrying our first child and requested me to go home faster to bring her to a clinic. Told the TP wat happened, he dun give chance. I was exceeding the speed limit by 59km/h, then friends tell me to prepare 3000 to pay the fine. In the end, go to court 23 in the afternoon. Plead guility, then go and pay the fine 800 and 18 points off the licence.<br>So in your case it should be peanuts..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

And 120kmhr is not really that fast yet, they are all out to caught those really fast, like 140kmhr.<br><br>And if they never catch you red handed, even better if you are driving your own car, as in the car is registered under your name. It will affect your insurance in future.<br><br>Hope this helps. I got caught once before for speeding at 139kmhr. Didnt know where they popped up from. So went to court and was fined $650, on top of my illegal exhaus.( I was driving Nissan S14 at that time). But when I attended the court, I found out that my speed was the lowest! The court was full of people caught for speeding, and you wont be surprised to hear some speeding at 170kmhr or even higher.<br><br>Thats my experience.<br><br>Be more tactful when you want to speed...<br><br>cheers</div>

That is the max speed they can go. The Fast and Furious car can go at 192km/hr cos it's modified, so the TP knows it's impossible to chase up lah.</div>
