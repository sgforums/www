            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://itv-f1.fp.sandpiper.net/media/imagelibrary/19374_2.jpg"><br>Sauber's relationship with Ferrari moved even closer today as the Swiss team unveiled their 2004 challenger.<br><br>The new C23 uses exactly the same engine as Ferrari, as well as the Scuderia's seven-speed gearbox.<br><br>The car bears an undeniable resemblance to Ferrari's F2003-GA, while driver Felipe Massa has also been borrowed from the world champions.<br><br>But it was the news that Ferrari had agreed to supply them with the very same power units that the world champions' F2004 will use that provided the biggest story of the day.<br><br>It is the first time in their eight-year association that Sauber have enjoyed parity with Ferrari's own team.<br><br>The decision is likely to have been forced on Ferrari by this year's change in engine regulations. Now powerplants must last the whole grand prix weekend, with any driver who has to change being dropped 10 places down the grid.<br><br>As usual, Sauber's engines will be rebadged Petronas and the Malaysian company's engine boss Osamu Goto said: "We are using the same model engine for the first time. Despite the new regulations, there has been a weight reduction of the engine."<br><br>Another indication of the closeness between Sauber and Ferrari is the fact that the world champions will even borrow both of the Swiss team's drivers, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella, for testing duties in 2004.<br><br>Technical director Willy Rampf said the team had taken a pragmatic approach with the design of the new car.<br><br>He said: "Owing to the fact that we will not be able to start working in our new wind tunnel until after the roll-out of the C23, this solution made sense to us more than any other."<br><br>The car features a more tightly-packed rear end than 2003's C22 while Sauber have abandoned their twin-keel monocoque in favour of a more conventional front suspension layout.<br><br>Team boss Peter Sauber added: "Our goal for 2004 is to clearly increase our performance. How well weÂ¡Â¯ll be able to do this primarily depends on how quickly weÂ¡Â¯ll be able to translate the results of our wind tunnel work to the race track.<br><br>"Certainly, the presence of seven automotive manufacturers has made the competition in Formula 1 fiercer than ever, but weÂ¡Â¯re ready to accept this challenge."<br><br>Sauber have also unveiled two new sponsors, the port of Sokhna on the Red Sea and Chinese life insurance company Tai Kang Life.<br><br>courtesy of www.itv-f1.com</div>

He said 'If you want to move, it is not a problem'.<br><br>"It happened already with Raikkonen."<br><br>courtesy of www.itv-f1.com</div>
