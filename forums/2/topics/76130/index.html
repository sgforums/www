            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering if mentally insane people are allowed to keep their licence and continue driving on our roads. Last night at 1230am i was driving home and was along tampines SAFRA traffic light when i noticed the driver beside me in a Yellow Celica behaving weirdly.<br><br>He was flicking his head left and right wildly and kepy gesculating his middle finger to a bus in front of him. I thought at first if the bus driver had offended him in anyway. later he saw me looking at him, he smiled and showed me both his middle fingers and kept reving his engine. All this while he was laughing and flicking his head left and right as if he can't control his nerves.<br><br>At the next traffic light outside bedok reservoir he kept inching his car forward slowly until his bumper touched against a lorry's bumper. It was so slight that the lorry driver didnt know it. he kept laughing and flicking his middle finger at the lorry as if he was having the biggest fun of his life.<br><br>then he turned into bedok area. Along that road he turned off his lights for a few seconds and flicked it back on again. When he pulled up at the traffic light a girl was crossing the road. At that hour she just wanted to get home. When he saw the gal he kept flicking back his hair and running his fingers through it. after the gal passed the car, he horned once and started showing middle finger at the girl( i think cause she never look at him). after that last junction i turned different direction liao...<br><br>I felt that the man was absolutely insane. He is in his 40s. No glasses. Balding but still got some hair. Pretty weirdo. Yellow Celica...</div>
