EVERY racing driver knows about the marbles off the racing line. what the hell was he thinking when he tried to lap ralf in the tunnel? Granted ralf was at fault too, but Alonso really should have known that he wasn't gonna pass Ralf when Ralf got on the throttle in the tunnel. smart thing to do was to back off, tuck in behind, and nip thru at the chicane. ralf would have to let him pass anyway there, because he was being lapped. Certainly, trying to get wide on the throttle on the marbles was sheer lunancy.<br><br>03 in brazil was another incident. what was he trying to do, driving so fast thru the wreckage of Mark Webber's jag? he was lucky not to be more seriously hurt! anyways no doubt the kid is good, but there is more to being championship material than just driving skills. look at kimi. the 1st half of the year was crap but he never lost focus, and hammered away at it till he got results.<br><br>oh btw, lets talk about Trulli as well. I don't know about you guys, but last year Trulli reminded me of when Alain Prost was at McLaren with Senna in 88.</div></blockquote>Met the both drivers at a renault launch of their CC car... they arent the tallest bunch of people though... even though i do think alonso is a really good driver.. cocky, arrogant and aggressive.. who can forget the hungarian GP when he actually lapped Micheal. even though he was mistake prone the whole of last season....</div>

HE out performed Alonso by 5-3, not including USA where Alonso had a big accident due to tyre failure.  After the French GP, when they entered silly season, I think Trulli lost focus, and something seemed to have made him unmotivated at Renault. He started to drive the car at about 8 tenths, and seemed unwilling to push. He made THAT classical tatical error at France, letting Rubens steal a podium from him at the 2nd last corner, and then he made that horrendous mistake at Germany, letting Mark Webber sneak when he had to ceede the corner to Takuma Sato. He finished even behind Klien in an arguably superior car. After that, he kept finishing out of the points even when his car was capable of performing, as Alonso demonstrated at Spa b4 leaking oil from his engine caused him to spin. Thats why I say Alonso is actually not as good as he is rated, and Trulli is crap when he has no motivation at all. Finishing out of the points all the time when your car can perform, just because u don't feel like driving it, is not a good excuse.</div></blockquote>Trulli might have done those mistake on purpose.. As we know that towards the end of the season, trulli relationship with Renault turn sour and left before the final few race. Trulli to me a a damn down to earth and good racer and it is definitely a gem to have in a F1 team. Especially to work beside ralf.<br><br></div>

But I can't really think of an instance where Alonson actually challenged MS and came off tops. Lapping MS at Hungary in 03 doesn't count, because when you are being lapped, you are obliged to give way. Kimi vs Schuey in Australia 03 was particularly exciting. And Monty gave Schuey countless frights. Was it last Spa when he pulled off that almost impossible 'outside-inside'move on schuey?</div>

One is build to last only for 1 weekend, while the other is build to last like a road car. You have to look into the way they construct the engine to see the link.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Btw, most car magazine does mentioned that the new M5 V10 engine perform and sound like a high pitch high rev F1 power plant. 90degree V10, high rev are very typical of F1 and I dont see that in any other road cars. Couldnt they be mistaken too? </span><br></div></blockquote>hullo. u said its a road going version of the V10 used in the Williams. That means the same engine, detuned for road use, like in the case of the Yamaha OX99-11 or the Ferrari F50. NOT in the case of the new M5. It would perhaps be more accurate for you to say that the engine design was heavily influenced by F1 technology? Technology link is not a direct link like the F50 has. And yes while I agree that those magazines are not mistaken, in describing how the engine performs and sounds, I also believe non of them have actually said that it is the same engine from the Williams F1 car detuned? So here, I think I am right, the magazines are right, only you are mistaken.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
