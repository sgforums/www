In term of engine and gearbox technology, BMW and Audi are a class above Saab, Volvo, Peugeut and Rovers. BMW involvement in F1 and Audi involvement in Le Mans have proof that they are the leader in car technology and if I have to choose a car, i will seriously take that into consideration.<br><br>Furthermore, I believe both BMW and Audi will fetch a better resale value then any of the above non german cars. In term of value for money in this class, my money is in the Audi.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm true. u have a point, but really, saab and volvo's low boost turbo technology for cars are a specialty. Also, For that same reason, I'd actually pick a mercedes over these 2. Audi's domination is slowly ending, even though they r dominating thru the Bentley brand. I believe when Aston Martin makes a return to Le Mans this year with the DB9, it might, JUST might spell the end of the Audi-VW domination. BMW, Mercedes, didn't quite do so well in 1 last year. I guess in a way, you can't really judge what car to buy by the performance of their formula 1 teams. Ferrari, well, is Fiat, and we know most Fiats r rubbish(personal liking for the Stilo). Dun think ppl would be flocking to buy Fiat. Um... Honda is 2nd. Their cars r nice, yes, but they don't really have a hand in the Junior Exec market, if you compare the volume of Accord sales to the German big hitters?. Renault... well... what can I say... their past attempts at cars in the junior exec segment have been duds. Think: Vel Satis, Laguna.<br>Anyways, what u say about resale value is true. I only wish that BMW and Audi weren't embroiled in a "I've got the uglier car" contest with each other. Is it me or is Mercedes the only German car that looks good now?</div>

I should know. I've done burnouts, U-turns at 80km/h, powerslides etc. with the family E200 Kompressor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Also, our car wasn't recalled, pricewise, its not too far off a BMW and Audi, and certainly, it looks good, which I think was the tone this thread kicked off on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Yes the McLaren cars were DNFing with alarming regularity in the 1st half of 2004 but actually, only 4 DNFs were caused by engine failure, including a double DNF in Nurburgring. By Canada, the engines were becoming reliable, and by Silverstone, they were challenging Ferrari. The team suffered just one more engine failure on Kimi's car at Italy. Comparatively, Williams suffered from 2 mechanical failures attributable to BMW, an engine failure in Malaysia and a gearbox failure in Belgium. If we were talking about engine reliabilty, then BAR Honda was actually as bad. They sufffered 5 engine failures throughout the year. So no I don't actually think the Merc was particularly bad, just underpowered. It did not blow up at virtually every race in the 1st half of the season since the 1st half of the season consists of 9 races, which means there are 18 chances to blow up the engine, of which there were only 4.<br><br>As for Bentley, what I actually meant was that they dominated Le Mans and generally FIA GT last year. Sorry for being unclear on this point. And what makes me think Aston can challenge Audi/Bentley in Le Mans is the people behind the team at Aston, namely prodrive. Familiar? they prepred Colin McRae's Ferrari 575M GTC last year. It the resurgance of the great Brit GTs again, last year Bentley had their show. This year I believe Aston would be it.<br><br>As for design, well to be honest, I am very much with another sch of design, which is the Renault's quirkiness with the Megane and the Citroen's innovative take on the C4. Those are what I consider good designs, along with the more traditional shapes like the Mercedes SL, SLK and E designs. Other notable design mentions include the new Vauxhall Astra and the New Golf(esp the GTi!!! whoooot!)</div>

That was why last year was a failure for them. They failed to achieve their target. One thing I've learned about F1 is that, the most off-handed remarks are often the most accurate ones, because they haven't had time to be turned into PR-speak by the PR people within the teams. Ralf might have a contract, but IF toyota were to pull out of F1, there is nothing he can do really. Yeah he can sue, they give him $, and he's still without a seat.<br><br>So once again, I state this: Toyota MUST achieve their targets for the year, or else, the boffins at Toyota will start to lose confidence in this whole adventure, and consider pulling out, much like Ford has done. Remember, it is never good for your F1 cars to be seen pottering around at the back of the grid, new team or not. That is how corporate boffins think, unfortunately.</div>

But seriously, after seeing Trulli's performance in the 2nd half of last year, I'm not sure he will perform. Of Ralf, I feel more sure about him, because even after missing 6 races, he showed not much loss in form, taking a 2nd place at Japan. Pity about that puncture in China.</div>

As long as the sound has a fairly deep and solid bass, i am happy. Thats why im actually NOT happy with the audio setup for the Airtrek. BAD bass. Merc has good solid sound tho. love it. um, the passat looks horrid. front ain't too bad, but that rear is..... nightmarish!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">Aluminium chassis is not exactly a technology, it is more about weight distribution. I think the only major problem about aluminiun is that it is difficult to repair if there is a knock, other than that I dont see anything problem with using this material. If I remember correctly, the new A6 and A8 are both made of aluminium body and they are both very popular in Singapore.<br><br>You might highlight which generation of A4s are you talking about. Are you refering to the 1.6L model 2 generation ago? </div></blockquote>I can't say for certain which generation it was, but this was about two years ago, and the problem was that aluminium was too soft.  Audi drivers were getting pretty annoyed with how easily the rims were getting dented by potholes, so they started switching over to aftermarket rims.  Audi sent out an advisory against such changes: if the wheels were too rigid, shock would be transmitted up the suspension and chassis, damaging both.  The drivers were unimpressed with the softness of the chassis, and subsequently dumped their A4s.<br><br>I agree with what you've said about Toyota - the original Lexus LS400 certainly made Mercedes, BMW and Jaguar rock back.  Then again, in the supercar bracket, the Honda NSX had pretty much the same effect.  I see Toyota's problem being similar to Volvo's - they both need to get away from their "safe but dowdy choice" image.<br><br>As for F1, Merc has been in the wilderness since beryllium was banned, and overall the team strategy leaves much to be desired.  Changing 96% of the parts on a championship-winning car was nothing short of stupid, and 18/19's nose was a mistake that they took two years to correct.  Ferrari's current dominance is owed to the fact that while Ferrari are building logical developments on their already successful cars, the other constructors are trying new approaches and dumping them before they've had a chance to bear fruit.  As always, the development priorities for the engine builders is reliability, power and weight in that order.  Both Toyota and Honda have spent the last few years working on reliability and power, and now it's time to get the weight of the engines down.  Renault, in the meantime, should have stuck with their wide-V design instead of following the crowd with a 90-degree design - despite having less power, the wide design allowed for better weight distribution, and was actually starting to come good when Renault dumped it.  Big mistake.<br><br>I would put neither Half Schumacher nor Yawno Trulli down as championship material.  For crying out loud, when Halfie switched over to Toyota, he couldn't drive their supplied road cars - he even crunched his car while parallel parking because he forgot that the Toyota didn't have the BMW's proximity sensor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Montoya's been pretty disappointing too - he's gone from Formula Juan to Juan-Lap-Wonder.  I'd say that the guys to look out for at the moment are Raikonnen (even though he had a crummy year last year), Alonso, Webber and Button.  Of course, this year's going to be another entertaining one, what with Rubens still claiming that he has a shot at winning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Changing the rims would not make a difference, because the shock that would go into damaging the rims would instead travel further up, damaging the suspension and chassis.
