Isnt that abit misleading?<br><br>Quote : The second important area is the F50's much acclaimed 'Formula One derived' engine. This is based on the 3.5 litre V12 unit which powered Prost and Nigel Mansell in the 1990 season, but it's relations are loose. The road going powerplant took the F1's 65-degree vee, used the same 5-valve per cylinder design, and retained the block length. Everything else, however, is different. It had to be - although the F50 is a remarkable car, the requirement to replace an engine every 200 or so miles as in an F1 car would be ridiculous! Some of the exotic materials have made it onto the road engine, however, with titanium playing a part in the internals. The capacity was increased to 4.7 litres, and the engine hits the rev limiter at 8,700 rpm, quite some way short of the 14,000 attainable with the F1 engine - pneumatic valve springs made such revs possible, but these were too unreliable to be used due to air leakages (which have been often seen to cause problems in Grands Prix), and were replaced with steel springs for the road engine.<br></div></blockquote>sigh....... statee your source please. mine comes from www.Ferrari.com<br>under the cars section, look for the F50. The engine is stated as being "derived from F1 unit". See when you quoted all that above, you really do not understand what you are saying do you? What is your defination of detuning? Isn't the above said by you detuning? Take the engine block, use the same design, and then fit in other target-specific components to make it last? THAT is detuning/re-engineering. In fact I've read the exact same paragraph you just quoted, but I forgot where from. So state your source please.<br><br>meanwhile:<br><br>The BMW M5 DOES NOT take a Williams.BMW F1 unit, and detunes/re-engineers it. It's a completely new design.</div>

Of course, both engines were extensively modified in terms of cooling, ignition and the other systems I mentioned earlier, and that modification is the definition of detuning.  In effect, the F50 and OX99's engines fit the definition of "road-going F1 engines", while the M5's V10 does not, because it was never an F1 engine to begin with.</div>

TO ME, detuning is when you take an existing design, and re-engineer or modify it to suit your purpose. aka, coming out with a road going version of it, eg. "Its the same engine, but a road going varient of it"<br><br>When it is not the same design, even though they can share many design similiarities, it is still 2 different designs, and hence, I won't say the M5's engine is a road going varient of the F1 engine. Instead I would say "The M5's engine's design has been heavily influenced by Formula 1 technology"<br><br>meanwhile u still haven't named the 1st asian F1 driver, nor have you named the one thing unique about the M5's engine management systems.</div></blockquote>I thought you already said that there are no F1 link to the M5 power plant, so what is the point asking me about the engine management system. DonÂ’t you agree that the answer to that question is going to contradict your statement even further?<br><br>From what I know,<br><br>The engine management system (ems) is very similar to those used in the F1 car and it is something that has never been used in a normal road car before. M5 EMS is managed by a very powerful CPU that is capable of making 200 million calculation per sec, and has about 1000 tiny components to it. It is believed that the M5 has as much computing power as a F1 car.<br><br>Unlike normal road car where all cylinders are controlled in the same way, the M5 EMS is capable to controlling each cylinder separately. The EMS can time, ignite, inject and control the quantity of fuel through the valve, into each cylinder differently and this enable each cylinder to operate differently under different rev, vibration or any different condition. The result is a highly efficient and powerful engine.<br><br>Frank or Head will never admit into helping BMW in developing the car, because BMW is still consider a potential competitor in the F1. If they would to say yes to the press, they will be in major conflict with the interest the banks and Williams stakeholders. BMW has all along shown interest in setting up their own F1 team and they are pursuing it by trying persuade Frank into selling his company and technology.<br><br>I personally feel that the M5 is truly BMWÂ’s first "F1" road car (not super road car) and there is no question about F1 involvement in it.<br></div>
