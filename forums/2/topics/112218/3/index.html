EVERY racing driver knows about the marbles off the racing line. what the hell was he thinking when he tried to lap ralf in the tunnel? Granted ralf was at fault too, but Alonso really should have known that he wasn't gonna pass Ralf when Ralf got on the throttle in the tunnel. smart thing to do was to back off, tuck in behind, and nip thru at the chicane. ralf would have to let him pass anyway there, because he was being lapped. Certainly, trying to get wide on the throttle on the marbles was sheer lunancy.<br><br>03 in brazil was another incident. what was he trying to do, driving so fast thru the wreckage of Mark Webber's jag? he was lucky not to be more seriously hurt! anyways no doubt the kid is good, but there is more to being championship material than just driving skills. look at kimi. the 1st half of the year was crap but he never lost focus, and hammered away at it till he got results.<br><br>oh btw, lets talk about Trulli as well. I don't know about you guys, but last year Trulli reminded me of when Alain Prost was at McLaren with Senna in 88.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by the way, talking about performances, Trulli was actually much better than Alonso up till the French GP. HE out performed Alonso by 5-3, not including USA where Alonso had a big accident due to tyre failure.  After the French GP, when they entered silly season, I think Trulli lost focus, and something seemed to have made him unmotivated at Renault. He started to drive the car at about 8 tenths, and seemed unwilling to push. He made THAT classical tatical error at France, letting Rubens steal a podium from him at the 2nd last corner, and then he made that horrendous mistake at Germany, letting Mark Webber sneak when he had to ceede the corner to Takuma Sato. He finished even behind Klien in an arguably superior car. After that, he kept finishing out of the points even when his car was capable of performing, as Alonso demonstrated at Spa b4 leaking oil from his engine caused him to spin. Thats why I say Alonso is actually not as good as he is rated, and Trulli is crap when he has no motivation at all. Finishing out of the points all the time when your car can perform, just because u don't feel like driving it, is not a good excuse.</div>

Alonso, maybe, but I'm less sure of him. Maybe Button, but that largely depends on whether BAR improves and/or him going to another championship capable team. While we're at it, what's your take on Nick Heidfield at Williams?</div>

How fitting that both of them are at Ferrari now... albeit as test drivers. amazingly, Bernoldi is at BAR as test driver alongside Anthony! wonder where they dug him out from. I suppose Red Bull dumped Bernoldi long ago eh? altho i must say, he is one of the few people who've overtaken MC proper(Malaysia 02).</div>
