If you want the ultimate in performance, you're going to have to sacrifice plenty. There's no luggage space. None. No stereo, no electric windows, no fancy adjustable seats, no "amenities" at all aside from air conditioning. The interior is spartan, almost stark. The car is loud, so loud that your ears will ring at full throttle (sure does sound good though). And hot, very hot.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gaz, this bit you quoted agrees with what i just said:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">The road going powerplant took the F1's 65-degree vee, used the same 5-valve per cylinder design, and retained the block length. Everything else, however, is different</span></strong>.</blockquote>Exactly what I said - the design started life as an F1 engine, and substantial changes were made to it.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br><strong>The capacity was increased to 4.7 litres, and the engine hits the [b]rev limiter at 8,700 rpm</strong>, quite some way short of the 14,000 attainable with the F1 engine - pneumatic valve springs made such revs possible, but these were too unreliable to be used due to air leakages (which have been often seen to cause problems in Grands Prix), and were replaced with steel springs for the road engine[b]</blockquote>As I said earlier - the valve trains had to be changed.  Also, at 8700rpm, the Mrelli system from the original F1 design was replaced as well, if I recall correctly.<br><br>So if you agree with this article you posted, you agree with Heng's definition of a detuned F1 engine: that an F1 engine was extensively modified to make it suitable for road use.<br><br>As for noise, that's up to each country's traffic authority to make a judgement on.  Ferrari built the car as a) a production model, b) a car that is not limited to race tracks but can in fact run on normal roads and c) is available to buyers without a racing licence.  That makes it a road car, and that's Ferrari's definition.</div>

The F50 project is the first and the last of its kind, and mainly it is because it is simply not practical for the road and the driver.</div></blockquote>In that case, I think we're ready to go back to the original point, where you said that BMW's F1 participation is something you would take into consideration when buying a car.<br><br>We've established that unlike extreme examples such as the F50 and the OX99, the relationship between F1 constructors' road and race cars is tenuous at best.  As such, how much can you really count on the constructors' F1 performance as an indicator of their road cars' quality?<br><br>I assert that F1 participation is not a very good indicator at all.  The road cars do not share the chassis, suspension or engine designs of the race cars, and as such are so different that any inference is dubious.<br><br>What we're left with, then, is the engine management system and transmission.  Sure, the E60's EMS is a you-beaut unit, running three 32-bit processors and making a couple of million calculations per second, but that ultimately affects smoothness, not power.  Plenty of people have taken a big-block engine and cranked out lots of horsepower - a Chevy V8 can be made to pump out 500 bhp quite easily, so the E60's power is more a function of its size and rev speed, not the fact that it's got individual throttles for each cylinder.  As for semiautomatic transmissions, they're becoming pretty common these days, with even Alfa producing shifters mounted on the steering wheels.  To your average road driver, what difference does 50 miliseconds between gears make?<br><br>The bottom line, therefore, is that when you're behind the wheel, the manufacturer's participation isn't going to make much of a difference.</div>

Date 14th Jan 2005.<br><br>'Tonio' Liuzzi will use a part time F1 drive in 2005 to prove he can be trusted to become a 'proper' team member next year. The young Italian, like Christian Klien, will almost certainly 'share' the sister Red Bull cockpit next to David Coulthard. "I'll learn this year, giving my best," said the F3000 champion, "and showing my potential." He added: "For example, I see this as an opportunity because I can learn about how to set up a car well, which is a difficult task, and then show I can become a proper driver in 2006."<br><br>Team principal Christian Horner, meanwhile, said Red Bull can decide who'll race in Australia 'literally a day or two before' the opening grand prix. But he added: "We'll probably make a choice a bit before that."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You could well be right - I'm interpreting the news upon the basis that a driver gets a complete season with the team.  If Klein and Luizzi are willing to sacrifice their standings in the championship to each get part of a season in the team, they could share the seat.  I'm not aware of any rule that prohibits this.<br><br>It's an odd form of placement, though.  I've seen drivers sign on for a few races (Senna with McLaren at the beginning of 1993, for example, was on a race-to-race contract for the first four races), or one driver taking over the seat for the remainder of the season, but I can't recall anyone ever agreeing at the start of a season to "share" the seat.</div>

And it should happen after F1 V8 engine regulation kicks in in 2006.<br><br>At the moment I see no reason why Volkswagen would want to invest in a new multi millions V10 program when it is going to be outdated in 2 to 3 years.<br>I think Audi already has a very good V8 program with Le Mans and they are likely wait till 2006 to lanch the assault.<br><br></div>
