Why touch on some many other issues of F1 when we are just talking about Trulli...I am confused!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>simple. I am saying this because, you are too naive to believe Jarno Trulli were doing all that on purpose as part of his plan to get out from Renault. The truth is, he wasn't, because, in F1 impressions count, and ANYTHING that gives u unfavourable impressions, however short term, can harm. All I've said are to illustrate this point. So no, I don't think Trulli is championship material, and yes, I do think those mistakes were genuine. Also, if you're not giving it your all in a car, then you won't be champion. You didn't see Senna pottering around the midfield complaining, just because the car wasn't to his liking. He drove the wheels off the thing. As a result, he made himself desirable to any team because they are assured of a racing driver who would promise them 100% of his abilities, no matter how good or bad the team is. With Trulli, he performs, as long as he is happy. 1st sign of something not to his liking, he sulks and does not perform. And its not just at Renault too. I don't remember him being particularly stunning at Jordan near the end of his time there either. You want a racing driver who encourages the team by giving it his all despite everything, not one who sulks and doesn't helps.</div>

On a long term basis, if you don't perform, people will start devaluating you again. I won't comment that there is or is no transfer of technology between Williams and BMW. But in the case of the geabox of the M5, yes. Patrick Head specifically said they did NOT help develop that. And there are no direct links I can see either. Technological influence, yes. Plenty of that. Direct links? no. like I said, not in the way the F50 AND teh OX99-11 uses a detuned F1 engine.</div>

U said a road going version. When u say road going version of an F1 engine, it means a detuned version of it. That is how we describe the OX99-11's 3.5l V12 and the F50's V12. It is a roadgoing version of the 1992 Jordan Yamaha F1 engine/ It is a roadgoing version of the early 90s Ferrari F1 V12. meaning: it is detuned. If u mean to say it is technologically influenced, then say so, don't say "it's a road going version" because u are going to mislead people into thinking it is just a detuned version of it.</div></blockquote>Heng, if you read what ferrari have to say about the F50 engine, it is no exactly like what you have discribe. Isnt that abit misleading?<br><br>Quote : The second important area is the F50's much acclaimed 'Formula One derived' engine. This is based on the 3.5 litre V12 unit which powered Prost and Nigel Mansell in the 1990 season, but it's relations are loose. The road going powerplant took the F1's 65-degree vee, used the same 5-valve per cylinder design, and retained the block length. Everything else, however, is different. It had to be - although the F50 is a remarkable car, the requirement to replace an engine every 200 or so miles as in an F1 car would be ridiculous! Some of the exotic materials have made it onto the road engine, however, with titanium playing a part in the internals. The capacity was increased to 4.7 litres, and the engine hits the rev limiter at 8,700 rpm, quite some way short of the 14,000 attainable with the F1 engine - pneumatic valve springs made such revs possible, but these were too unreliable to be used due to air leakages (which have been often seen to cause problems in Grands Prix), and were replaced with steel springs for the road engine.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heng, F50 is not a road friendly "road" car and I think its emission doesnt really meet the regulation in many countries. And there are also compromise to it.<br><br>Quote:<br>The only compromises on this car were road legailties and driver limitations, and Ferrari see the F50 as truly an F1 car for the road. But, because this is "a race car for the street," there is no carpet or upholstery -- except for the lightweight seats and the leather-covered steering wheel. Even the gearshift knob is composite.<br><br>I personally think that you need to be a race driver to drive a F50 and it is unlike a F430 that is more driver friendly.<br></div>
