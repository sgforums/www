Has anything like that ever happened to you??<br><br>My mom drives a really nice lexus, and whenever she goes to geylang for supper with me and my sis, all this ah pehs and shit always pretend its their car by like lying against it.. then u'll see all this pros and chinagirls approach them .. i mean honestly.. you can tell by the outlook, the manner, the grace of a person whether that person is of any standing in society. i mean even my rich friend playboys are all smart witty people with good grace, good humour though not the most moral and value-conscious.<br><br>Here's another story, i have a good friend called derrick and derrick has a skyline turbo something la .. i not into jap sports .. think they v. ah beng .. anyway then he's a playa .. cars are a babe magnet depending on whats ur ride .. honda integras dun pick up nuts .. skylines do all the time.. anyway one night we went to a huge niteclub and he picked up this chick.. we'll were leaving and when we'll started heading back to our cars.. when my other friend nick came along .. nick drives an audi tt.. and anyway we always play around so nick drove up to us and said to the girl:"hey cutie, you sure u wanna leave with him and not me??" the girl took off with nick in the end even tho she only met him for like what ?? 15mins ?? all this while we never revealed that we were good friends of many years..<br><br>no morals in the story, just sharing some interesting stuff <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> anyway hope you guys share any amusing stories as well here</div>
