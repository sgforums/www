            <div class='col-md body'>hehe, reminds me of the time at Zouk KL. There were 2 ang moh dude leaning against my car chatting up with 3 superficial girls. i went "do u mind, i'd like to leave now". The 2 ang moh dudes quickly got up and walked off. It feels so good to humble ang mohs in this region. Don't get me wrong, there's just too many ang mohs here giving the whole lot a bad name.

I'm just stating facts as it is. Just as you can tell if someone is well groomed from their outlook! I hope when you say "jumping to conclusions", you do realise you are indeed pointing 4 fingers back at yourself. You would have realised that I am not looking down on anyone (and I honestly NEVER HAVE; and I am not a snob) had you read my earlier post. I never said you couldn't afford a lexus. READ. Since when did I ever mention the slightest bit or ever implied that? So what if you know rich people?? Rich or poor they are all the same aren't they? that is if we go by your so called "Pisses me off" thinking, that we shouldn't look down on people. By simply placing someone under the classification (or the usage) of "rich", you are indirectly looking down on the people who do not belong in that exclusive region. If this pisses you off, put it somewhere else, this thread is for interesting/amusing first hand experiences that drivers @ sgforums.com have had.</div>
