            <div class='col-md body'>No, they usually won't remove carpets, seats and all that. You prob can request, but it will cost $$$$. The labour required is quite a lot. By itself, workshops already charge for labour for removing seat, removing dashboard, remove carpet etc... imagine doing all. Prob can get bulk price, but at least few hundred. Also, dunno if they put back nicely.<br><br>They usually don't sandpaper also, but can request, costs $$$$.<br><br>Normally they will spray exterior, engine bay, door internal lining, boot internal etc.. good enough.<br><br>Why bother to strip everything then spray? Half of the places will never see sunlight again. Waste $$.</div>

Poster ask for reasonable price, so standard practice is they wun go dig out your carpets and all that.<br><br>Some shop even dun bother to talk much. You just tell them respray, wat colour and they ask u pass u the keys and come back 1 week later. They dun ask whether u want inside bonnet la, door sill la, sand off old paint first la etc...<br><br>So if you din specify properly, expect the basic which is just spray over old paint and prob engine bay and door linings.<br><br>btw, not everytime peanuts get monkey and if using TT Durai $600k peanuts means get good quality. Some times pay $1700 still get monkey. Sometimes $600 come out damn sui, pearl/chameleon type and good workmanship (seen before, power). So don't be misled also.  haha.<br><br>But if ppl got testimonial of a certain place which is exp and good as well, then more or less it should be safe. But ensure that it is the 'tou shou' doing the painting. Sometimes a shop got 3-4 painters, 1 is damn good but the rest do farked up job. So cannot just follow workshop name, more important is the painter himself.</div>
