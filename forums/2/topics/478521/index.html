              <p>A man was sentenced to nine weeks' jail on Wednesday 
                  for offering his nephew money and a job for taking the rap on his behalf
                   for a driving offence.</p>
              <p>Mohd Yusof Mohd Ali, 58, was driving a car along Jurong West Street 
                  75 without a licence on Nov 8, 2009 when he was involved in an accident.
                   He pleaded guilty to the driving offence as well as to offering $1,000 
                  and a job to his nephew in return for his nephew lying to the police 
                  that he was the driver of the car at the time, reports The Straits 
                  Times.</p>
              <p>This was the fifth time that Yusof had driven without a valid 
                  licence. District Judge Marvin Bay imposed the jail term and banned him 
                  from driving for five years.</p>
              <p>The court heard that he settled the traffic accident by paying off 
                  the other party $300 when their vehicles were involved in the accident 
                  at the junction of Jurong West Street 75 and Jurong West Street 73. 
                  Later that month, he told his nephew, Muhammad Norzaid Muhammad Yazid 
                  Johari, then 24, about the accident, and that he had been driving 
                  without a Class 3 licence. He asked Norzaid to lie that the latter was 
                  driving the car at the time him to shield him from criminal liability. 
                  He promised to pay him $1,000 and offered him help to get a job, if 
                  everything went well.</p>
              <p>Both men went to the Traffic Police and gave false statements.</p>
              <p>Norzaid was fined $4,000 earlier this year for giving a false
                   statement to the police.</p>
              <p>Yusof, whose sentence was deferred until Nov 15, could have been 
                  jailed for up to seven years and/or fined for perverting the course of 
                  justice.</p>
