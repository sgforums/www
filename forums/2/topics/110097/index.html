            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes really don't know whether is it SG drivers have no manners or they are simply clueless. Was driving towards AMK today and in a bit of a rush, so I was on the right most lane. This Lancer in front of me was going fairly slowly, about the same as cars on the lane on the left. So I just signal right as I was coming along fast from behind him. There was no car at that point of the road on his left so he should have moved back to the left lane after overtaking. But NO~ He stuck to the right most lane at his placid speed. I kept the right signal on and waited and waited and waited... But either he did not want to give way or he did not know what the signal means. So no choice right? I overtake him on his left then. And you know what?

            <div class='col-md body'>There are also 3 lane NS highways after seremban to KL.<br>In spore maybe bcos th speed is consider not very fast so ppl just bochap but in NS highway the case are different. Do not keep hogging to the right lane unless u are fast cos there are lots of cars travelling at excess 150km/h.<br>Accident at high speed mean fatalities and 80 or 60km/h in spore only mean injuries.<br>Lots of big cars drivers is m'sia are very courteous and give way even they dont travel fast although their cars are capable. But in spore these drivers are very proud and arrogant thinking their cars is fast.<br>I encountered many these spore plate drivers hoggin at NS highway at 110 to 130km/h....... even the kancils sometimes travel faster than them also never hogging the right lane.<br><br>I would say that no. of spore driver growing become inconsiderate is double or triple the amount of m'sia drivers.<br><br>That is why lots of spore drivers like to over take at the extreme left lane..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
