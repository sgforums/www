            <div class='col-md body'>actually... FWD are cars with the engine power going to the front wheels of the car... usually using transaxle gearbox, meaning transmission and axle in 1 housing. because most of the mechanical components are in front, thus saves weight and space.<br><br>RWD... meaning either engine in front, middle or rear, with engine power going to the rear wheels. Its heavier because of the addition of axles, drive shafts and dadada. Space can be also taken up by the axles and the longitudinal mounted transmission (that buldge in the middle of the interior).<br><br>FWD usually have limited hi-power traction capabilities (when the weight is shifted to the rear during acceleration) , especially cornering where understeer is it natural tendency. RWD, in my opinion, would be less fuel efficient at lower speeds, with all the additional connecting components to link the rear wheels from the engine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how to check rwd or fwd? simple .... if your car is auto, put in to D mode .... handbrakes up .... footbrakes off ... step on gas a bit .. it car moves with handbrakes engaged its FWD ... but of cos try it on even roads only .. i learnt it from my driving instructor ... i dunno if it works for manual cars though</div>

I suspect you're describing a feature of "4"WD, which is available on SUVs. For passenger cars, I don't think there's such a feature  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

If there is, then its a RWD or maybe AWD. If you dun see anything in between the rear wheels, nothing connecting to each other, other than the suspension components... then its a FWD.<br><br>OR, turn the steering wheel, full-lock to the left or right, and then look inside the wheel wells of the front wheels. If you see any rod (which is the driveshaft) that sticks out from the centre of the wheel, going into the engine... then thats a FWD or AWD. No shaft in front = RWD.<br><br>AWD will have driveshafts both front and rear.<br><br></div>
