              <p><strong>Revision Of Road Tax For Vehicles And Special Tax For Euro-IV Diesel Cars</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1     As announced on 30 Jan 2008 and 15 Feb 2008, the road tax
              and special tax for vehicles will be revised with effect from 1 July 2008 as
              follows :</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">    a.     The road tax for cars, motorcycles,
              taxis and commercial vehicles will be reduced by 15%. In addition, the road tax
              structure for electric and hybrid cars will also be revised; and</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">    b.     The annual special tax for Euro-IV
              diesel cars will be revised from the current computation of four times of the
              road tax to $1.25 per cubic centimetres (cc) of engine capacity, subject to a
              minimum annual payment of $1,250.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2     The reduction in road tax is in line
              with the Government's on-going approach of gradually shifting from vehicle
              ownership costs towards usage measures to manage congestion on roads. The
              revision to special tax structure for Euro-IV diesel cars is made in recognition
              of the improved emissions of Euro-IV diesel cars with respect to both
              particulate matters</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><sup>1 </sup></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">and
              carbon dioxide, and the fuel efficiency of diesel engines. It also seeks to
              narrow the difference in the cost of fuel consumption between a Euro-IV diesel
              car and a petrol car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3     From 9 June 2008, the LTA will
              indicate the revised road tax/special tax rates (payment for special tax is made
              together with the road tax) on the road tax renewal notices or GIRO payment
              schedules issued. LTA's e-Services@ONE.MOTORING portal (<a href="http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/">www.onemotoring.com.sg</a>)
              which operates from between 6am and midnight daily will also henceforth reflect
              the new rates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4     Vehicle owners have received notices
              or GIRO payment schedules from LTA prior to 9 June 2008 but renew their road
              tax/special tax on or after 9 June 2008 will pay based on the revised rates for
              the licensing period from 1 July 2008. Those who have received their road tax
              renewal notices or GIRO payment schedules with the higher road tax/special tax
              rates indicated may refer to the aforesaid portal to find out the new rates.
              They need not request for a new renewal notice or GIRO payment schedule.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Excess Road Tax/Special Tax Paid</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5     There would be a number of vehicle
              owners who would have paid their vehicle road tax and special tax (if
              applicable) before 9 June 2008 based on the current tax rates for the period
              commencing 1 July 2008. In such cases, the excess amount paid would be indicated
              on the vehicle owner's next road tax renewal notice, and would be automatically
              offset from the next road tax/special tax payable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6     If the vehicle is transferred before
              its next road tax renewal, any excess road tax/special tax paid will be used to
              offset the total transfer fees payable. Any remaining road tax/special tax,
              including any excess road tax/special tax paid, will be transferred along with
              the vehicle to the new registered owner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7     If the vehicle is de-registered, any
              remaining unused portion of the road tax/special tax and excess road tax/special
              tax paid will be automatically refunded to the last registered owner of the
              vehicle.</span></p>
