              <p>I find it strange and 
                      odd that important Singapore rules and regulations  are ill-available to
                       the layman, at least not on the internet and not  accessible through 
                      Google. e.g. Rule 28 of the  wrt cycling on pavements
                       and I find it quite a  shame.<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/S5LiPCOqS2I/AAAAAAAAAFs/Db8C_E4A5q8/s1600-h/Road+Traffic+Rules+(Google+search).JPG" alt=""><br> <br> The said rule has been quoted countless times, in the following

                        portal</a>: 'Transport and Travel'&gt; <a href="http://tt.ecitizen.gov.sg/TT-cycling-in-singapore.html">'Cycling in Singapore'</a>&gt; 'Cycling Rules'&gt; "As  
                      the number of commuters opting to cycle continues to grow, so does the  
                      importance of observing the rules and regulations of cycling. Being  
                      aware of and keeping within the guidelines of these rules help keep  
                      cyclists safe and to avoid accidents between cyclists and pedestrians on
                        footpaths.<br> The relevant laws governing cycling on the road are: <br> - Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276, Section 140), <br> - Road Traffic Act (Chapter 276, Section 114)"<br> * Both these links lead vaguely up to <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/">http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/</a>-
                        the general page for ALL Singapore statutes.<br> In any case: <br> Chapter 276, Section 140 is titled:  <em>'General provisions as to 
                      rules'</em>&gt; '140. —(1) The appropriate Minister  may make rules —<br> (a) for prescribing the language and script in which any traffic sign,

                      to Cap. No.' box and read the statute yourself. For the life of me, I  
                      cannot understand how these vague specifications help regulate to any  
                      adequate extent, cycling or even the use of footpaths, the laws listed  
                      are just much too vague. So are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Road Traffic  Rules</span> are quite different 
                      from the 'Road Traffic Act'? Where then  can one access the the oft 
                      mentioned  '<span style="color: #ff0000;">Road  Traffic Rules</span>'? <br> <br> WRT 'Bicycle Rules', I was finally led to  <a href="http://www.togoparts.com/forum/showthread.php?fid=5&amp;tid=54861">'ROAD TRAFFIC ACT, (CHAPTER 276, SECTION 140), ROAD  
                      TRAFFIC (BICYCLES) RULES'</a> contributed by an avid cyclist, the  
                      original source of which requires PAID  SUBSCRIPTION to view.<br> <br> Another discussion board user also seems to have the same problem in  
                      accessing the said '<span style="color: #ff0000;">Road Traffic Rules</span>', his response <a href="http://comment.straitstimes.com/showthread.php?p=415546#post415546">viewable here.</a> <br> <br> So I surmise that we are a rather sad country, where whilst one is 
                      expected to  obey the rules, the access to such rules actually requires 
                      <span style="color: #ff6600;">'PAID SUBSCRIPTION'.</span><br> What kind of bankrupt authoritarian country is this. Perhaps I'm  
                      speaking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Is_Falling_(fable)">'sky-falling-down'</a>, then again, please correct me if I'm
                        wrong.
