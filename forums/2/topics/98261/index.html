Cos currently I'm working faraway from home, which takes 1.5 hours by train but 30 mins only via car. So thought of this issue...<br><br>Would you be interested in providing your car for a car pool?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I would be most interested in car pooling. It's environmentally friendly, cheap, and convenient. But unfortunately am not working in Singapore yet. Maybe can set up a kinda of website, for people to post their car-pooling requests, and offers, like they do here (in Germany, where I study). It's cheaper than any form of public transport (for long distances). Just share petrol cost, and a token fee for the driver.</div>

The person is not going to puke in your car. If ya, then make him clean it. Dun be squeamish. Strangers become friends. Say hi to your neighbours.</div>

Read my website idea. There can be a bunch of guys who travel regularly to various different locations, or better still, just have a kind of database where people who want to car pool can key in their start/end point and time. Imagine this. You own a car, and you want to go from Jurong to Bedok at 8am on 18 Oct. So just SMS this line which registers this. Something like (JUR BED 0800 181004 D) Then anyone who needs a car pooling service, can like type (JUR BED 0800 181004 R) or something, and bingo! A civic initiative that beats the cab drivers, is convenient, and environmentally friendly.<br><br>As you can see I have pretty utopic visions. But then again, we managed to create a world without chewing gum stains, so it can be done in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Car pooling may turn out to be an idealistic concept( too real to be true). Well, one of my fren was sharing a car with another happily until that guy pull out of the loan deposit and this poor chap have to continue paying the full loan on his own...<br><br>Another problem will be in times of urgent matters...  the one who shares might be unwilling to let you have the car...<br><br>How are you going to settle the servicing, repair cost etc... Well, it is always good to have someone nice to come along to share the car but there is always this qn of wat if?.....<br><br>Well, unless u r sharing the car with your immediate family, bf or gf... then  it may be a difference story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> For car pooling, I think u got to have some mechanism to make sure the person used the car for the number of hours stated in his share. In the practical environment, it may be difficult when things happen eg. number 3 knocks into someone's car, is everyone going to pay for it or number 4 discovered a dent on his car but number 3 denied he has done it.<br><br>There are private car pooling now with rules and regulations for every members. Eg. NTUC carcoop, Cityspeed etc.  If we don't drive so often, it may be economical to join these car sharing schemes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
