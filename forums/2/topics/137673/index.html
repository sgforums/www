            <div class='col-md body'>The FXX<br><br>New FXX to turn client-collectors into genuine Ferrari Test Drivers<br><br>Ferrari has developed a truly innovative technical collaboration programme around the FXX prototype aimed at its most dedicated and passionate Clients.<br><br>The FXX is the most advanced GT ever created at Maranello and its mission is to involve our most valued Clients as genuine Prancing Horse Test Drivers in their own right.<br><br>The wealth of data and experience gathered in the course of this very special programme will be exceptionally important.<br><br>In fact, the feedback from these highly skilled, non-professional Client Test Drivers will be compared and supplemented with suggestions from Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello and FerrariÂ’s professional in-house Test Drivers.<br><br>Every Client who signs up for the FXX project by purchasing one of the estimated 20 or so cars being built, will actually be joining Team Ferrari, and will have his driving experiences at the wheel of this new car monitored directly by the Prancing HorseÂ’s technicians and specialists.<br><br>The FXX is the fruit of FerrariÂ’s know-how in building special limited-series sports cars combined with, of course, its racing experience. It will provide the basic framework on which the specifics of future extreme models will be worked out. The exceptionally powerful FXX delivers absolutely blistering performance on all fronts.<br><br>The FXX has not been homologated for road use and thus will not be a competition model. It will be used exclusively on the track as part of a specific ongoing research and development programme featuring this first ever group of Client Test Drivers.<br><br>The FXX is powered by an imposing 6,262 cc V12 engine that can punch out over 800 hp at 8,500 rpm.<br><br>Its gearbox is the result of the transfer of F1 strategies, delivering gear change times of under 100 ms. This is almost as fast as the F1 single-seaters, themselves the absolute pinnacle of current technological achievement.<br><br>The FXXÂ’s aerodynamic design is particularly innovative too as it has resulted in a shape that produces 40% higher downforce than ever achieved before. It is also possible to adjust the FXXÂ’s mobile spoiler configuration to suit the specific circuit.<br><br>FerrariÂ’s partnership with Bridgestone has resulted in the development of a specific 19Â” slick tyre for this particular model. Likewise Brembo has created a special brake cooling and pad system for the FXXÂ’s extra large Composite Ceramic Material disc brakes.<br><br>The Client Test Drivers will also be able to share their unique track experience with a passenger Â– in fact a second seat is also available.<br><br>What really sets the FXX apart, however, is the sophisticated telemetry system which will monitor and give feedback on 39 different vehicle dynamics parameters in real time. The system is also able to record other data as demanded by specific circumstances.<br><br>The information gathered will then be analysed by the Ferrari technicians working on the programme and discussed with the individual Client Drivers to ensure that the car is kept constantly updated.<br><br>The FXX package also includes participation in a series of track events to be organised by Ferrari on various international-level circuits over the coming two years. On these occasions, an official team of technicians will be on hand to provide any assistance and support required by the Client Test Driver.<br><br>In addition to these truly unique official events, Clients will also be able to take their cars out on the track independently during private sessions. Clients wishing to leave their car at Maranello will be glad to know that the vehicles will be transported directly by Ferrari to the various European circuits for the various scheduled events.<br><br>Given the carÂ’s exceptional performance and the unique nature of the package, delivery of each FXX will also include an ad hoc driving course. The instructors will, of course, be professional drivers and the courses will take place at the Fiorano Circuit where Ferrari does its most important F1 single-seater testing.<br><br>After the seat and the pedals have been individually tailored to each driver, there will be a traditional Â“shakedownÂ” followed by a training session to introduce the Client Test Drivers to test driving methodologies.<br><br>After a careful client order selection process, the first FXXs will be delivered by the end of this year. The initial testing of the definitive car will be taking place over the coming days at Fiorano.<br><br>The FXX and the relative package cost a total of 1.5 million euro (excluding taxes). Applications to join the programme are being evaluated by a special in-house committee.<br><br><img src="http://images5.theimagehosting.com/FXX.JPG"></div>
