              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>I have booked a picanto last month but i am still undecisive which package to get. The SE told me to think first then let him know.</p>
              <p>package 1, $2000 voucher<br>package 2, DVD player + GPS<br>package 3, $800 insurance rebate + reverse LCD</p>
              <p>initially, i opted for package 3. but later i think maybe i can do more with the $2000 voucher. i called the SE, and he quoted me $700 for leather seats and $800 for sport rims. I think he buffered the prices.</p>
              <p>i am also thinking of adding reverse sensor, solar film and alarm.</p>
              <p>does this picanto comes with remote lock?</p>
              <p>need your advices on what i can get with $2000 voucher what are the market prices for those above mentioned items.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank u :&gt;</p>

              <p>Wats the price u were offered?</p>
              <p>I rem my SE mentioned the same price for leather and rims. U check your insurance premium how much u nid to pay...if u are young and nid to pay high premium, opt for (3)  and bargain for ur leather seats and rims... if not, the best deal will the $2k vouchers. Personally i dun tink DVD and GPS is useful for cars in SG.</p>
              <p>$2k vouchers u can actually get rims, leather seats, alarm, rev sensor. Try to bargain for solar film, if else fails, extra 6mths rd tax. Ask for Visors too...</p>
              <p>For the rims i tink chg to a third party rims will be nicer and stable...stock rims too thin...</p>

              <p>Oh... i work in city area and i have a motorbike. i dont intend to drive to work due to congestions, high parking rates and erp.yes, i did think abt getting normal car when the price was low. but after some calculations, the maintenance cost will be high if i drive to work. the opc is more for weekend and nite outings, or when i go marketing.</p>
              <p>yes, though i can afford a normal car but i rather save up the extra maintenance cost.</p>
              <p>it's very economical to ride bike.free parking, $1 erp, can squeeze throught congestions, and also 40km/l fuel.</p>

              <p>ic... i hv a fren who work in town area too. he drives a normal car. however, due to congestions, erp(s) and parking fees, he end up taking mrt.</p>
              <p>still unwilling to convert his car to opc because he think he may (sometimes) want to drive during peak times..... like saturday before 3pm...</p>
              <p>so his driving style is like 70% off-peak, 30% peak. but still paying nornal car cost.</p>

              <p>For the difference in category pricing....well....the difference isn't too large <em>for now</em>....If you see previous months, you would know what I mean...</p>
              <p>The old Lancer GLX has poor fuel consumption and new Lancer EX costs around the same as Jazz.... The Vios, in my opinion, has near perfect interior but near zero exterior.... I still like the Jazz/Fit overall... Hehe....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
