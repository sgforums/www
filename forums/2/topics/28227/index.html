            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Guess the reason why Saab is not as common is becos its a Swedish car. And the most famous swedish car is of cos volvo.<br><br>Germany are well know for their technology, that's why for those who can afford 150-200 over k, most will go for presitige, which generally will drop to Merz, BM, Audi or even VW.<br><br>Didn't know abt Saab, but drove a 1996 Merz E200 and 1997 BMW 316i before. If wanna some opinion of these cars, then maybe i can help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I'm looking for opinions and comments about Saab as I've not heard much about it here in Singapore. I don't deny that the Jap cars offer great value and performance. I personally am biased towards Honda. As for the other prestigious makes like Merz and BMW, perhaps there are too many of these around for my liking and besides, it appears that many (NOT ALL!) Merz and BMW owners have a problem with perception about their self-importance... (I know, I'm about to start a car war here) but it's just that they come off as really cheena or snobbish.</div>

SAAB is not too bad a car as it offers value compared to the german competitors. Its not meant for the young but rather for those late 20s to 40s...... The SAAB convertible loses to the german in terms of looks and handling. They uses light pressure turbo on the SAAB. Its a little quicker than the german counterparts in terms of same c.c.. Its quite comfortable and can be quite luxurious depending on the trim......the only is that the equipment in the interior is quite tacky or rather plasticky.....build quality is not as good as BMW, MERC AND AUDI. Well to me SAAB is a better built and engineered Renault. Resale value sucks for SAAB. However on the overall is not too bad a car comparable to Volvo. Cheers<br><br></div>

Have you considered that? They are not too bad too and price wise its just a liitle more expensive than the germans as it is equipped with a minimum 2.5 litre engine and 4wd. However a 2 litre version is coming without the 4wd drivetrain. The interior and the build quality is little bit low quality. And also no foot rest...crap. However its value for money for the specs and free 3 year servicing and also 3 year warranty. Wah sounds like some sales man. Cheers.<br><br></div>
