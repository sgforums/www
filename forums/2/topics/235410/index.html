            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lower COE premiums drive many people to car showrooms</strong><br><br>It may be one of the best times to buy a car right now.<br><br>Distributors say the lower Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums for cars - down by almost 50 percent - is getting more people to visit car showrooms.<br><br>COEs for Category A cars below 1,600cc are now $5,200 while Category B - for cars above 1,600cc - stands at $6,002.<br><br>The last time the COE was this low was back in late 1991.<br><br>At Komoco Motors, things are moving fast - with the company expecting business to increase by 4 to 5 percent.<br><br>It has also ordered more of the popular model, Hyundai Avante, which now costs $53,000 - some six thousand dollars lower than last month.<br><br>Most cars have been marked down by two to three thousand dollars.<br><br>There are also increased interest in other makes - like the Nissan Latio Premium at Tan Chong Motors, now going for $54,000, down by $2,000.<br><br>"It will be a better deal if we get it now but there's only one week left so that's why I guess it's so crowded as well," said one potential buyer.<br><br>"Now that the COE has gone down, the price of the car has gone down a little, so my agent is doing the calculations for me. I've not decided yet," said another.<br><br>"COE for Cat B now is $6,002. I don't think it will go down anymore. Because why? Too low already. I keep on track with the COE. When I buy, I want to know it's a good profit. No good profit, don't buy."<br><br>He is not the only one predicting that COEs will bounce back.<br><br>Teo Hock Seng, Managing Director, Komoco Motors, said: "When there's glut and everybody come back thinking it will be cheap, the volume builds up again. Don't forget in 2001, prices dropped to $101, but that doesn't mean that it's going to stay at that level. I personally think perhaps the COE will come back to the range of $11,000 to $12,000 for Cat A and $12,000 to $13,000 for Cat B as a sort of a gauge."<br><br>Some distributors say the reduction in road tax from September is also a factor driving the interest in buying cars right now.</div>

So I don't see there is any difference," said a potential car buyer.<br><br>"When you purchase a car at a higher price, definitely the price will be higher when you resell. So I don't see a reason why there is a hoo-ha to buy a car when the COE prices are low," said another.<br><br>So some buyers are pragmatic when buying a new car.<br><br>But others don't want to miss out on the chance of a good deal.<br><br>In the last bidding round, almost twice the number of bids were received as there were COEs available.<br><br>But what caused the drop the last time round?<br><br>Edmund Gin, from Cycle &amp; Carriage Automotive, said: "People who come in during that period of time before the COE drop could not have got their car before Chinese New Year. So everybody was thinking, 'hey, I come into the showroom and I can't get a car before Chinese New Year, I might as well wait'. The buying power was not there. So that has actually caused the COE to come down to $5,000 level."<br><br>And next month, the start of the new financial year will reveal the new COE quotas - which in turn will determine the general price of COEs.<br><br>Edmund said: "General feel is based on the scrapping of cars. Over the last one year, it has reduced. So the number of cars on the road has been kept at a certain level. So we should foresee less COEs being made available."<br><br>With the latest increases in COE premiums, the prices of most cars in Category A (1,600cc and below) should go up $1,000 to $2,000, while those in Category B (above 1,600cc) will rise some $1,000. - CNA/ir</div>

I think we complain too much about high COEs and people cannot afford cars, so now COEs are not really used to control the number of cars... maybe if we start complaining about high cost of usage and the number of cars on the roads... hee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

              <h1 class="clr">COE prices little changed in first bidding exercise after sweeping transport changes</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: There was little movement in COE prices in the first bidding
              exercise conducted after sweeping changes governing future car growth
              were announced late last month.</p>
              <p>In the tender results released on Tuesday, COE for cars up to
              1,600cc closed $1 higher at $12,002 while the premium for cars above
              1,600cc was $80 lower at $13,209.</p>
              <p>The Open category, used mainly for cars, dropped the most. It fell $500 to close at $13,301.</p>
              <p>COE for commercial vehicles finished $500 higher at $13,001, while motorcycle COE was $13 lower at $999.</p>
              <p>The
              results came as no surprise to car dealers. One reason the COE prices
              did not move much this time around was because the bidding exercise
              crossed two periods — the week before the announcements were made and
              the week after the announcements were made.</p>
              <p>Dealers said they expect the earliest big movements to come in March.</p>
              <p>Vincent
              Ng, product manager at Kah Motor, said: "After the first bidding in
              March, if Transport Minister announces new quota — which I think would
              be substantially smaller — I think that would spiral demand and could
              signal upward COE trends starting with the second bidding in March."</p>
              <p>Edmund
              Gin, senior manager at Mitsubishi Sales, said: "It’s only up, no way
              prices are going to come down. On average, we expect COE prices to go
              up by $8,000 to $10,000. That will translate to an increase in car
              prices, also up by $8,000 to $10,000, starting from mid—April."</p>
              <p>The
              government has also announced that Additional Registration Fee (ARF)
              will be cut from March. This should bring car prices down.</p>
              <p>But dealers say if you are looking to replace your car, prices have never been more affordable than now.</p>
              <p>But
              if you are a new car buyer, with all the recently announced increases,
              it is best to do your sums before making a final decision. — CNA/ir</p>
