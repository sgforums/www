That was an increase of $602 from the last bidding exercise.<br><br>In Category B, for cars above 1600cc, COEs fell to $10,600, registering a decline of $201.<br><br>COEs in the Open Category were up slightly from $10,803 to $11,101, an increase of $298.<br><br>There was a drop in the COE prices for Category C or for Goods Vehicles and Buses by $450 from $5,951 to $5,501.<br><br>Motorcycle COE prices also came down by $19 to $881.<br><br>The President of the Automobile Association, Mr Bernard Tay, commenting on latest COE results said though the Category A prices have gone up slightly, there was a drop in the number of bidders.<br><br>He noted that "While car price cuts and some new models have stirred up buying interest in the last round of bidding for this category somewhat, it did not sustain that interest. Car market for Category B is also quiet."<br><br>Mr Tay also observed that "existing car owners are hanging on to their cars as many can't sell their cars without having to top-up cash to pay off their loans. First-time car buyers are also adopting a wait-and-see attitude to see if COE prices will drop further." - CNA /dt</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Green Transport Week 2006</strong><br><br>LTA is pleased to once again support Green Transport Week which is an annual campaign organised by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC). One of the messages that SEC is conveying to motorists during this yearÂ’s Green Transport Week, which runs from 20-27 August, is to consider alternative modes of getting to their destinations, including tapping into the public transport system. This converges with LTAÂ’s strategic thrust of promoting public transport as the choice mode of travel.<br><br>Given limited land resources, public transport is key to the sustainability of SingaporeÂ’s land transport system. In fact, providing an attractive public transport system is the cornerstone of the Land Transport AuthorityÂ’s (LTA) land transport strategy.<br><br>LTA has been a supporter of the Green Transport Week since its inception in 2001 as Car Free Day. As a programme partner and to demonstrate its support, the Authority is encouraging those among its staff who drive daily to work to leave their cars at home during the campaign and commute to the office by public transport. This will be on a voluntary basis. Also lending their support will be LTAÂ’s Chief Executive BG (NS) Yam Ah Mee and his senior management team.<br><br>Motorists will be able to access real-time information on traffic and road conditions to help reduce unnecessary driving at <a href="http://www.onemotoring.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.onemotoring.com.sg</a>. LTAÂ’s ONE.MOTORING portal is the official web partner for the campaign.</div>

We are not saying, 'leave your car at home, forget about cars'. Cars form a very necessary part of our integrated transport system. But what we are encouraging people to do is to choose more fuel efficient vehicles if you have to drive, maintain your vehicle so that it emits less pollution, have better driving habits and use the car responsibly. If you are going to travel less than two kilometres, you might want to consider walking or using your bike."<br><br>This year's Green Transport Week will see a contest to spot fuel efficient cars on the road.<br><br>Owners of cars with fuel economies of at least nine kilometres per litre and who are under the Fuel Economy Labelling Scheme will receive decals and stand to win fuel vouchers if spotted.<br><br>And, SBS Transit will encourage more people to take public transport next week, by handing out free drinks at selected bus interchanges.<br><br>It is also encouraging motorists to give way to buses to ensure a smooth ride for commuters.<br><br>There will also be community activities beginning this Sunday, such as an "Eco Chase" which will see teams racing round the island via public transport.<br><br>The first event on Sunday at Changi Village will see the launch of the third edition of the Green Transport Guide which contains useful tips to help motorists reduce fuel consumption and save money.<br><br>Organisations and schools will also be able to pledge their support and submit their plans online for the Green Transport programme.<br><br>Since rebates for hybrid cars were introduced, more Singaporeans have been interested in buying them.<br><br>But while driving fuel efficient cars and taking public transport might be more environmentally friendly, Singaporeans Channel NewsAsia spoke to say cost and convenience are also major factors in their choice of transportation.<br><br>To learn more about Green Transport Week, you can log on to www.sec.org.sg/gtw.</div>
