            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore drivers have no MANNERS?<br><br>Ok, let me put it this way; it isn't just MANNERS lacking. One word sums up the common attitude I come across on our roads daily - SELFISH.<br><br>Forget MANNERS here. Forget even Road Courtesy - you can really forget this one.<br><br>Driving around here, you need to expect others NOT giving way. If you signal to turn out from a minor road which has a yellow box in your favor, don't be complacent, NO ONE, will let you out. When you signal to switch lane, you can bet your last Singapore dollar, the traffic behind you will speed up to pass you first, and likewise the car behind, and next, and next.. in the end you will have to just swerve right out, making yourself, inconsiderate as well.<br><br>Signalling is something every singapore drivers FORGETS, once in possesion of a driver's license or just passed the driving test.<br><br>When someone cuts into your lane rudely, you're not supposed to horn, or you'd be given the finger. If you give someone a finger, you'd likely be challenged to a fist fight by the roadside.<br><br>Overtake someone in a flashy car or branded car on the expressway, he or she will likely overtake you in return.<br><br>When you are waiting for a lot in a carpark, expect others will ignorantly slide into the lot you were patiently waiting for - particularly lady drivers who convenient dive into a lot head first, ignoring anyone waiting to park.<br><br>The list goes on. Some just park their bloody car diagonally across two lots, pratically occupying two space! Then there are motorbikes who park right in the center of a car's lot.<br><br>Motorists in Singapore, are a SELFISH lot. Summarily Self-centered, ego maniacs. Out of 10 motorists on the road, only 1, will be considerate. This fact is disgraceful of a society and country that is number one in many things, and highly educated. But largely, people are full of s-h-i-t.<br><br></div>
