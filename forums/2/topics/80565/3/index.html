            <div class='col-md body'>3rd and 4th lanes are meant for slow moving vehicles going at 70kph or slower... 80kph is perfectly alrite cos it isn't slow and the 3rd lane would have too many trucks and lorries going slower... if u think u wanna push yourself to the limit (90kph) or even more, u can just overtake that car<br><br>___________________________<br><br>80 in 2nd lane... then 90 in 1st lane?   Overtake where then?   Just general rule of thumb, if you can go one lane left safely, then bloody well do so... there are other road users too.<br><br>Another thing that bugs me about Singapore drivers... Say you're driving 2 car lengths behind someone in the overtaking lane with no traffic behind you.   Someone in the left lane wants to pull into your lane... Common freaking basic road manners to pull behind you right?  NO BLOODY WAY!!!  These moron drivers will squeeze in dangerously in front of you!!<br><br>But of course #1 irritant are road hoggers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is pretty much down to the pace of life and high density population (pple and cars) here in sg. Everybody is rushing, most for the sake of rushing, because he/she is doing that in work everyday. It's no wonder the heart attack rate among s'poreans is high.<br><br>And it doesn't help when most of the roads are densely filled with vehicles all the time, unless you are driving along mandai ave, lim chu kang, loyang, etc. Esp. during peak hrs, sometimes filtering is not easy, and it makes you look like a road hogger, even if you are already travelling at 100 kph. Somehow the guy behind you still thinks that you are driving a tortoise!?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
