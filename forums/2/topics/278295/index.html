            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i am amused that a lot of road users didnt and cant seems to give way and get all worked up when they are overtaken.<br>Please, fast lane is for overtaking and it doesnt matter whether you are going 90km/h or 190km/h, just give way. It's not a matter of pride or observing laws, if others think they can speed and get away with it, let them be. We are all road users and we really have to share and be considerate to other users too. Have you notice that a lot of rage and reckless driving is created when the faster vehicle is forced to overtake from the left?<br>Let us all be considerate so as to have a smoother traffic, there's only so much space left to widen the roads and it can never be enough if we do not learn to be considerate. Anyways, for the self righteous hoggers, its right there in the Basic Theory of Driving to give way to faster vehicles. So let's all keep left!<br><br>Regards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some farkers purposely like to slow down when they know u r tailgating them, leaving a big gap in front of them and a long long train of cars horning behind him...<br><br>a classic example --&gt; one fine night i was recalled back to camp, so was travelling on this particular expressway, going at quite a high speed. soon i was behind this one car, let's name it car A. car A was going at the expressway speed limit and there's quite a big gap in front of him. traffic was moderate, slightly more pack than normal due to high number of bikes. so i was tailgating him, and i guess he can see that i'm trying to get pass him. he keep moving left and right in the lane and obviously trying to irritate me. so i flash my high beam to indicate tt i need to pass him fast. but bloody hell he lower his speed to 10-20 kph below the speed limit of the road. behind me was a long trail of car and all are horning and high-beaming (can see from mirror). tried to overtake from left but too many bikes. so bo bian, wait for opening. den chance come alr got lobang on the left, cut out, speed up and when i come alongside w the car, tt farker was happily chatting w his gf/fling/mistress/prostitute. i horned him and almost everyother car passed him oso horned him. once i switch back to the 1st lane, he still got the balls to high beam and horn me and tailgate me. knn i tulan i jitao slam brakes and pull handbrake den see his headlights suddenly get bigger den get smaller. in my mind i tot "ho seh liao free bodykit" but nv leh.. his brakes better than mine...<br><br>such kind of idiots are damn hell. if i got the time i sure play w him even more one but too bad need to rush rush...</div>
