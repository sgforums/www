            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys , need your help on this one. i think i have decided on the manual, choosing between the sunny and the lancer. I read the specs and the sunny seems to be more powerful? is this really true? i know the lancer looks more sporty, and the sunny seem really like a saloon car...but apparently in terms on performance, the sunny seems to have an edge. Can someone here advise me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New car... the major thing headache is i understand the sunny has bad FC, thats what holding me back. I like everything about the lancer but its significantly more expensive and the specs in terms of horsepower, 0-100 etc... is not as impressive as the sunny. hence the headache.<br><br>I thought about getting a manual for the sunny to save FC but it just seems wrong...the sunny is such a saloon and to have a manual ride just seems out of place. I rather enjoy the smooth ride and relax. I like the idea of a manual lancer coz its sporty...really headache...dunno which car and cannot decide on auto or manual.<br><br>i think i will be using it alot in the city for travelling short distances going from one place to another. so whats ur advise?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>looks like u're stuck btwn looks (Lancer) &amp; performance (Sunny)... well i tink specs dun exactly reflect the actual performance of the car, dere're other factor components of the car which'll influence the actual performance to a certain extent eg. transmission, weight... yea so it's indeed wise to go test-drive n whack the cars hard, n since dey're already quite seasoned by previous different drivers, so maybe it's a way to gauge the true quality &amp; durability of the cars? well even if the specs are right, u can't do much to the sunny's looks, but u can do more to the power of the lancer after buying. i guess i'm biased towards the evo family tree hehez... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my dad owns a sunny supersaloon a/t. Although the specs is slightly better than lancer, I'll still go for the lancer if I'm the one buying. Personal preference here. Like above mentioned, the lancer looks more sporty and you look younger driving in one (not as if I'm old, I'm just 19 lol).</div>

Those mileage given in the brochures are just plain suggestions and unless u hear from the horses mouth, you probably wun know the difference.<br><br>When I first switched to a nissan sunny about a year back, i thought the car body was darn too heavy and fuel consumption wld be high. BUt after comparing with my friends driving other models of cars, think..hey...not much difference. But my friends were surprised when i told them i need less than $40 ringgit to travel from causeway to Pahang! The car weight...though is heavy compared to my ex-car...was giving me stability (not to sure whether its the Monroe suspension or izzit the car wieght but i think both help) throughout the drive and I maintained my car speed at 140km.
