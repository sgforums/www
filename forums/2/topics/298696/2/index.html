            <div class='col-md body'>U cannot compare cars lah. It's all up to the person who buys the car. U have to test drive it. Some want speed, some want space, some want slient car, some wants econmic. For me, I own a Picanto and it's good enough for me. I only need to car to bring me from point A to point B. No need speed, everywhere u go also jam, u speed pass a red light, but there's always a second traffic light waiting for u. Nosiy engine, every car also got noise wah.
