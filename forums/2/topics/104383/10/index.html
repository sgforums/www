Shame to u, lamer~!<br><br>U classified Tus as a poor man car, as many other forum brudder oledi justify tht it was 110+ when the Type-R was oni 120k+. It's a matter of preferrence. I got frend who r 23 oni drive tus take 8 yrs loan, father drive E class, stay bunglow, is him a poor guy??? His dad is planning on his SLR now...hmm...since u so good in judging, judge for me pls~!<br><br>Well, some said if a tus owner stick to 8-10yrs loan is a poor man, then does it mean they need to settle full payment at once to prove tht they r rich or smart??? for the latest price of Tus, I can settle the full amount without single loan, but if i buy it, i'll still using the same loan period tht they offered, bcos I'm just trying to use my money in a smart way.<br><br>Guys, did u pissed by a Tus recently? Or else why u so biased bout them suddenly? U think Tus will loose to normal 1.6 sedan or Celica, did u see it? from wat i know, stock Tus can beat any sedan (auto oni, bcos Tus 2.0 is coming with auto oni) &amp; even SS1. U r driving a sedan, wat car is tht??? mind to let us help u judge it whether u r a pathetic looser or u just like tht car to fetch u from point A to point B.<br><br>Believe me, the more u argue is just to show us how childish r u, to discuss bout a car, this is not a good attitude in a forum, it getting u nowhere, &amp; i believe u r just lucky to b in this forum which is not properly monitor, or else, guess u have been banned oledi, hahaha</div></blockquote>$110k only serves to make it a bigger mistake...<br><br>Sure, loser so be it la. U sound like a childish, poorly educated beng yourself.<br><br>And why the other bro emphasize "USE TO" (keyword some more) drive a Civic as if he is ashamed of it if he still drives it now?<br><br>You guys are juz as childish, have judgements of other cars or certain people, but act so HIGH and MIGHTY when judging me. Cmon wake up. With ur ah-beng seh, i bet u have look at ppl on the streets before and tink they are damn sia-lan. Or see something buay song at one time or another. So dun act like angel here.<br><br>Forum ban me cuz I dun like a certain model of car? Wahaha.. bro, u are the worst of all the posters so far in my thread. At least the rest got some substance, reasoning etc... u the most low class.... haha... u make me laff la, thanks!</div>

When you dont own a car you probably have alot of views on other models... but as a car owner, you will be proud of whatever car you drive regardless of make and model, cause you bought it with your HARD EARN MONEY. unless daddy only bought a normal sedan when you want an audi TT or something...</div>
