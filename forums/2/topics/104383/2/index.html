            <div class='col-md body'>personally i feel it just boils down to being BRAND CONSCIOUS thatz all.If u r the type of people that only go 'Wow celicas Wow DC5 etc and 'chey Tuscani' admit it ur just plain brand conscious.Hyundai has come a long way to where they are now.U cannot just jump the gun n compare Hyundai with the japan counterparts who started so much earlier.At this present day,i would think the koreans are doing a great job in terms for cars. IMO the Tuscani performance is quite decent with a sporty looks n good value for money.(im just a nissan sunny driver) so its actually a really good deal.And yeah whats up with the sports 'wanna be' catergory? I dont see why a Tuscani shouldnt be under this 'sports car' cat. be it with celicas,DC5 etc equally?Just because its a Hyundai? or just because it known to be abit heavier than other coupes? Oh please.....have seen a few done up n fast tuscanis on sg roads,and they are definitely not slow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree that it is brand concious. everyone thinks subaru is a great rally car model.. but in actual fact.. citroen and peugot is the top two car model in the world rally championship. so at the end of the day. it is not how fast your car is or how good it is. it is who is behind the wheel that makes the difference. of course you cannot compare between a 1.6L car to a 3.0L car. no matter what driver you put inside a 1.6L car it wont work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey hey hey I think lets not quarrel lah huh....<br><br>I think what the topic starter said was right for SOME people but definitely not for MANY of the Tuscani Owner.  Basicallly, there are people who really likes the car for that price.like whats being said, you dun expect it to outrun a Rex but still its the same reason why I bought a City instead of say a Beemer.... cos the budget is tight and City happens to look good to me and perform resonably well.<br><br>But of cos, the topic starter has his point, definitely there will be some poseurs who think that driving a coupe is sibei stylo and tries to act like he is driving some high end coupe or sports car.<br><br>But in all categories, we have poseurs like them not just for Tuscani so well, I guess lets not shoot each other until die lah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accutually for your information tuscani has one of the weakest accelerations and top speeds of sport cars. Tuscani accelerates from a standstill to 100km/h in 12 secs...that totally sucks for a sports car. Even the city now i'm driving if manual can hit 9.8 secs vTEC. CVT version i think can even be 10.8 secs vTEC. Accutually vTEC makes a hell lot of difference. Tuscani 2.0 litres more road tax. City lesser road tax, only 1.5 litres. City more fuel efficient bcoz of technology, it gives abt 12km/litre if i drive fast. My previous hyundai matrix only return me 6km/litre when i drive fast and feed him with 98ron petrol. The only thing i like about tuscani is the looks lol.... anyway tuscani not a bad car.... its just that it doesn't perform like it should and should giak yiu. I think the interior of the tuscani oso quite nice. Overall?..............made affordable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuscani is for those who can barely afford a coupe. It is price so low that it is not in the range of celica or integra. In fact it is price in the range of more expensive 1.6 sedans. For those, who dont follow cars may be impress with the design of Tuscani. For those who know cars, Tuscani is a low class coupe. Only the design makes it to fall in coupe category. Sometimes it may be shameful to be seen driving one as they know that these owners want a coupe so bad and yet they could not afford a decent coupe like celica. Even celica or integra is already inside low cost coupe category.<br><br>Why buy Tuscani?<br>Because I want a sporty car but i could not afford a 'real' coupe. It is a poor man coupe.<br><br>It is a real embrassment if a Tuscani is stop side by side a RX7 at traffic light junction <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, as a neutral, feel dat the car HAS the ability to turn heads... wen it was 1st launch by Hyundai, up till now... generally i feel dat the car had the minimal performance for a sports car; acceleration, speed, etc.... but it makes up for its appealling interior and sleek womanly exterior. it is no wonder dat MOST Tuscani drivers are women, because women are generally more conservative in their driving, they want a car which not to powerful and not to slow and also, to show her female counterparts @ work... Everything abt the car just appeals to women... Even made my mum interested in getting one! However, i've seen the modded version of the Tuscani, it looks very fierce, in comparison to the stock model. the image of the Tuscani can be changed from sexy curves to fierce muscles...<br><br>perfomance wise, i feel its average, FC is high, maintenance is high, etc... but Korean cars are well known for their safety standards. they are built heavy so that the body will cushioned most of the impact caused by a collison. therfore, heavy body, high FC...<br><br>but let me pose a question to the thread starter and to other stereotypes, If u want to go for perfomance cars, would the FC and maintenance be very high? Can u tell me wich perfomance car can deliver a minimum of 12km/l?</div>
