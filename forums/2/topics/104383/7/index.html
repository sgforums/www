I'm merely a regular guy who feels a certain way about the Tus due to the general feel I get from other ppl.<br><br>Ok, granted the Tus is a 'bang-for-buck' car in its class (but frankly I have no idea wat class it actually belongs to cuz as i said it has no solid identity. It's not a family car and neither is it a sporty car or sports coupe. It is JUST A NORMAL COUPE. I mean like wtf class is that?)<br><br>as for asking Hyundai PEEPS out, no nid la.. give me some PG or Sepang timings that are up to the family car 1.6L Civic can liao. Or else maybe can email HKS, Jun, Toda, Tomei etc and ask them why they not making performance parts for the Tus. </div></blockquote>well it is normal coupe. It is a class of its own, that is why they say you never know about cars...you never go to showrooms or read other car manufacturers.. just because there are many tuscani on the road you just say oh only one kind of coupe...<br><br>The renault megane sports hatch is also a coupe, It is only 1.6L with a horsepower of 115.  It cost you 85K. Nice looking car and comfortable but too expensive. There is also a renault megane coupe also 1.6L but only 110 horsepower. It is around 80K but it is hardly any space inside.. Rarely seen on roads too... And to you what does a volkswagon bettle and mini cooper means to you.. they are two door.. no space behind to drop off any people...<br><br>As for why you think a civic is faster.. cause they are made of lighter material as well.. have you seen a civic hitting a railing and spilting into half.. it happens all the time...safety is a priority over performance.. you can buy a new car anytime but you cant buy a life....</div>

Who design it and is actually designed for which car maker in the first place? And what's the combination of the different models design in in the Tus? Why ppl wonder &amp; heads turn during the test drive in Europe  highways for the first time?<br><br>Guitarman1, I think... Couple is a general layman terms only for 2 doors. But be sure to know that Tus is a fun-car. Not a sports car or performance range. Insurance will be ex if this is a sports classified. And since then, I think there's no need to compare with other classes of cars or performance or even pricing ...blah,blah, blah..<br><br>It's a class of it's own within the fun-car range... NOT performance range (Stocks), Not Sports car range too. Fun-car must look good also, performance will be secondary.<br><br>Well.... Should the Tus is branded under other Conti car maker, who dare to say it's a cheap car????? I think there won't be anything under 100K.</div></blockquote>Yes u are rite, if the Tus was under a famous Conti brand, it mite not get the 'bad-press' (so to speak) its getting. But its not.

Have you driven a stock Tus that have gone thru proper running and stock tuning before?<br><br>If no, then how can you say that it;s your general feel for that car?<br><br>If you think "coupe" is a wtf class.... Then you shld go and tell this to DaimlerChrysler. And ask them why they have CL class and CLK class. And DaimlerChrysler is proudly calling this 2 type of cars a coupe.<br><br>PG or Sepang using a 1.6 Civic??? Basically are you trying to use the quarter miles race thingy again??? To be frank, the performance of a car is not just dashing on a straight road. It consist of many factors, i.e. road handling, stability at high speed, etc. If you really keen to on at PG or Sepang, I think there will be at least one Tuscani would like to have fun with you. But provided you show yourself up and not hiding behind the computer.<br><br>For your info, there are racing development team and company for Tuscani in both korea and US. There have wide range of stuffs, inclusive of TC and SC kits for both I4 and V6 that can throw out 200bhp - 400+bhp depending on which FI setup and which stage. Not only japan have racing, but korean and american who race too and probably more than japanese. Just that you dun know.<br><br>Another info for you. Japanese are proud of themselve and their product. Therefore they will seldom develop anything for stuffs that are developed by other country. So it's not that jap race team dun develop for Tuscani, but it's their culture to stop them develop for Tuscani. I have their blood and brought up in this kind of enviroment, and that's why I know.<br><br>So far from what I know is that the jap Co do developed stuffs for Tuscani, e.g. Veilside and a few. The reason they do it, becoz they see the potential of the market due to potential of this car.  </div></blockquote>Ok mr Car God, firstly, i din say I know the car damn well... I am talking about GENERAL feel and PERCEIVED VALUE of the car.<br><br>Ok, one thing I never deny, is tat this post is also about the BRAND and how ppl look at you. Driving a Merc Coupe, ppl mite be jealous, mite hate u, but they wun tink u are a poor man trying to drive sporty car. But in a Tus, u mite get tat. Understand this point??<br><br>As for timings, ONE, ONE Tus and u expect ppl to suddenly respect the whole community? Of coz sure got some heroes in diff car model can outdo even Evo or Rex on track etc... but in general, when the hero drives the diff car models around the track, which one ends up the best? And like for the Civic example, there are MANY who are faster than Evos and Rexes, some still keeping to 1.6 lit with other mods.<br><br>The point is that the Civic has EARNED itself a reputation (besides as an Ah Beng car) as a FAMILY CAR tat is a giant killer and highly moddable. Its a cult. But still a lot of ppl look down on it and tink nothing much..<br><br>Wat more for a Tus?? It has much less credentials than the Civic but it LOOKS like its trying to be more.<br><br>As for challenging the Hero Tus, did I say I'm the best driver and that I will beat all Tus? I merely say I perceive Tus as a wannabe car, I din say I'm better than them. He may be a hero in his community, but I dun care, if I see him driving his Tus with an arrogant face, I'll still tink he's a wannabe.<br><br>If every forum dispute have to settle face to face, then wtf is a forum for??<br></div>

I did not say you should not buy a coupe.
