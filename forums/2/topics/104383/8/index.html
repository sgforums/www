Like you I am very concern about FC. Thats why I settle for a Japanese sedan, about 14km/l. Being 2nd car for family, obviously i dont need the extra passengers seat behind. I have 80k ready cash to pay off for my car at that time. I could have at least $150k budget if i take a 7 yr loan. I like coupe too but reason I settle for sedan is <strong>FC</strong>.  Thats is why i find your reason of low fuel consumption for purchase of Tuscani unreasonable. You should not have quoted FC as a reason, makes no sense at all.<br><br>What does it tell you about a person if he take a 10year loan on a coupe.<br>I give a rating 10/10 for being an extremist and courage but a rating 0/10 on money spending. As i said before, it looks like a lame attempt to pass off someone who is sporty and rich. At least i am not a poser. I buy something which i can easily afford, not saving here and there just to pay off my loan, or accelerate the coupe so slow to save the fuel.</div>

I referred more like a 'wannabe' or 'no identity' car.<br><br>Wat u mean no such thing as poor or rich car? Car is just car? Thats rubbish. It may not BE a NICE FACT that there are societal levels and comparisons, but it IS STILL A FACT. There are expensive cars, cheap cars, good cars, respected cars, lousy cars and cars people don't like etc..<br><br>Of coz there are always exceptions to every case, and if u notice my first post, altho I sound condemning which IS MY RIGHT, I didn't straightaway say "Oi, All Tusc drivers! U all are poor!"<br><br>I just asked why they bot Tus when it dun seem to satisfy any particular category well (albeit in a nasty tone).<br><br>Ppl say I low mentaliy and all tat, but are no better than me. </div></blockquote>There is nuttin wrong with that,coz its your rite n yr opinion,but different people might also think otherwise.Any person with the right state of mind would definitely wont straight away just say 'Oi, All Tusc drivers! U all are poor!" 'no $$ buy better cars etc' And this applies to all kinda cars not only tus.But ur indirectly twisting yr words in a 'nicer' manner which will inevitably reach to your actual point(which u did)<br>Obivously there r respected,bad,ex,cheap cars? Then y got price difference?But ultimately isnt it 4wheel base?Like what i said dont compare with those exotic etc cars that i mentioned earlier which is another level of comparison,coz we r normal PEOPLE.(if ur rich kind den say)People tend to look at only the surface which is not always rite.Everyone has their own preferences n needs.So lets say since there r lots of mazda6s or rx8s on the road,wat the lastest pricing? Maybe slightly abit more than 100k for M6 $130+k for rx8?So these people who r driving these all cant afford better cars?They could jolly well go n buy a 2nd hand jaguar x-type for a even cheaper price n gain their rep,n 'rich man look' So those who think in that way,stop looking always on the surface and being so judgemental.So how ru going to explain all these 'rich man car' 'poor man car' theory when there is no definte answer?Everyone has their own needs n wants.</div>

The reason why Tus is targeted is because its the cheapest coupe, easiest to pose. There should be more poseurs in Tus than other coupes.<br><br>That doesnt mean other coupes are safe from the tag 'poser'. Next to follow are integra and celica at 90k region.</div>

CVT version i think can even be 10.8 secs vTEC. Accutually vTEC makes a hell lot of difference. Tuscani 2.0 litres more road tax. City lesser road tax, only 1.5 litres. City more fuel efficient bcoz of technology, it gives abt 12km/litre if i drive fast. My previous hyundai matrix only return me 6km/litre when i drive fast and feed him with 98ron petrol. The only thing i like about tuscani is the looks lol.... anyway tuscani not a bad car.... its just that it doesn't perform like it should and should giak yiu.
