Do you like 350z? As a 350z owner, I am interested to share with what people thought about it. No right or wrong answer, appreciate any feelings/flames.<br><br>My experience is that most evo drivers I met like 350z and vice versa. Not sure about wrx ... S2000 etc? RX8 owners probably had some reservation on 350z (vice versa), but I guess strangely both driver groups respect RX7 (more than RX<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and the Zs. Is there certain grouping of drivers who share traits and likings on cars?</div></blockquote>Bro, why dun u start a new thread so its not so messy?<br><br>Anyway, 350Z and RX-8 are nice.. and based on the Top Gear review, their track capability are the same. So its a matter of choice. 350Z rd tax chor for 'same' performance with RX-8. Also, lose to stock Modena cannot use cc as a reason why u lost... hahah<br><br>The 350Z got a nice, squat, rather muscular shape while the RX-8 looks more agile, tho the front look a bit dorky. But I like the "rear-door" of the RX-8 which makes it much more convenient for rear pax.<br><br>But wasted both not OEM with Turbo, so cant mod legally. That makes them nice touring/cruisers, but cant really buy these cars to play with Rex and Evos, at least legally in Sg.<br><br>RX-7 got mod potential and already many proven examples, tats why its so well respected. Like the GTR, practically everyone loves it and respects it some way or the other. Other than mebe hardcore Supra fans.</div>

And they had to keep revving the engine really high which, while entertaining from the start, kinda got to their nerves in the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rx7 is a 2 seater purely 'sports', or rather say drift machine.  It's popular bcos of the handling, definitely not the top speed, may b this is the nature of rotary engine.  They have been in many racing events for yrs, tht's how they built the fame &amp; 350Z is so new, it's totally diff to it's predecessor which is powerful but lack of good handling.<br><br>RX8 is a 2+2 '4 doors' car, diff weigth distribution, diff concept.  Latest RX7 will come out in 2007 if i'm not wrong, so RX8 will never replace RX7, i think RX8 can consider as a family sports car oni.  It's difficult to explain, but ppl who tend to drive fast, once they put their hands on RX7 &amp; 8, they will feel the handling diff immediately.<br><br>I like 350Z very much, but road tax &amp; insurance turn me off.  It's using VQ series engine which GTR35 going to use it in future as well.  In fact, latest R34 in Jap racing events mostly change to VQ (or VG? I can't rem) series engine instead of RB oledi.  Nissan has tuned down the 350Z due to the government restriction.  Or else, with 3.5L engine, guess it can pump out at least 300+ HP.  RB26DTT is capable of handling over 600 hp without internal mod, so i assume 350Z can make it as well, compare to stock 4G63 can handle around 400HP without internal mod, i think 350Z is sweet.  Subaru engine i have no comments, not familiar, haha<br><br>Okie, now we r toking bout the potential of the engine, back to Tuscani again.  Stock Tuscani BetaII can handle 300+HP without internal mod (claimed by korean &amp; US tuner), not too bad rite?  1st thing we need to consider is this engine is 1+yrs old oni compared to 10+ yrs old engine out there, just like asking a 1yr old kid pick fight with a 10yr old kid.  They need a lot of R&amp;D &amp; aftermarket support to live up the engine.  Korean most powerful Tus can hit 800+HP so i dun think Tuscani is a ricer or poser car.</div>
