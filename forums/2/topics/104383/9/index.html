They bought it cos they could afford it comfortably. Young adults? Maybi plus those young at heart too, haha... Posers Cars? You see many of them on the road be it a coupe, family sedan or small cars. Is it jus that you happen to know a young adult who want to be a poser as rich and sporty and he bought tuscani? haha, Come on, let not generalise Tuscani owners. You dun need to save money here n there ony for a coupe. Even a small CC, COE or sedan car requires you to manage your finance carefully or u might end up struggling. Ultimately, it boils down to wat you could afford to pay comfortably for the choice of your car in SG. So be it.</div>

You see many of them on the road be it a coupe, family sedan or small cars. Is it jus that you happen to know a young adult who want to be a poser as rich and sporty and he bought tuscani? haha, Come on, let not generalise Tuscani owners. You dun need to save money here n there ony for a coupe. Even a small CC, COE or sedan car requires you to manage your finance carefully or u might end up struggling. Ultimately, it boils down to wat you could afford to pay comfortably for the choice of your car in SG. So be it.</div></blockquote>U did not read properly.
