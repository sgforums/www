            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, let's put it this way. Based on my run-ins with some Tusky's and the general sentiment from those ppl i've talked to or met, it is potentially a poser's car and prob IS used by some to that effect.<br><br>Of coz, there are those who really like the car and find its performance is good enuff for them. And not everyone is a poser.<br><br>And its true that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, thats why I can have my own biased views and people can come shoot me down.<br><br>But there are also those who will start resorting to calling loser la, shameful la when the discussion gets heated up. And get super personal and insecure.<br><br>Although this thread wasn't really a high-level intelligent discussion (my fault..heeee), it still had some logic and was highly debatle. Generally, the talk was civil and judgements and views, although biased, were still passed logically.<br><br>But then suddenly it degrade into a name-calling, slugfest...haha.. quite fun la actually.. it just goes to show that I'm not the only 'low-mentality' person here...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my first post.<br><br>I have been reading this forum for some time, just to pass the time and for interest sake. However, this topic perked my interest.<br><br>I drive a 350Z. Minimal finance. Before we go into a rich's man car, poor man's car concept, let's put it this way. It was a comfotable car for me, both financially and aesthetically. Simply, I like it, and it's well within my means. I could buy a Mercedes CLK or SL, but it would strain my lifestyle.<br><br>However, I am going to buy a Tuscani for my girlfriend. Frankly, I do not like the car. Both in terms of looks and performance. BUT, she likes it. And frankly, I know of some people who like it. Simply because it is a "sports car" in general. 2 door, low profile, what else can it be to the general public. Yes, they may seem to be poseurs, but how many people, young or old, rich or poor, have dreamt of owning and driving a "sports car"? And if it makes their dream comes true just for a moment, who are we to criticise?<br><br>I have heard many associates of mine pass the Tus of as a "poor man's sports car". Some of them are rich people. When you own a few ferrari's, $80k for a hyundai is ridiculous. However, most of them just drive a family sedan. They are working class people, yet they condemn their peers when they buy a Tus. But in todays context, where we work to support the family, and every cent counts, do you think it is feasible to buy a 2 door coupe? Thus, a Tus will only be to feasible to singles, or as a second car. Since generally, singles do not remain single for long in Singapore, averagely, it would mean someone young. And to be able to afford a car, any car in his/her early to mid twenties, is commendable. I need not further say that to afford a second car in Singapore is not easy.<br><br>In conclusion, we each have our views. I tend to lean towards guitarman's view on this CAR, but that doesn't mean I have no respect for the DRIVERS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After such a long thread,i would think there isnt much to say,coz they will be always be some people who would think a tus is a "poor mans sports car" "hokua boho jia" etc.Well,they have every right to their own opinion.Just would like to say to all tus owners,if some people would want to think in that way.then so be it,most importantly is that u enjoy your ride.Frankly in my own personal opinion,i dont think its a "poor mans sport car" or "hokua boho jia" as those who had followed this thread would understand y i think like that.Seriously those who REALLY "follow the car scene"would know where a tus stands in this so call "sports car era"To those u think its "hokua boho jia" i would like to suggest u guys to try to read more car mags n watch more car vidz(especially UK &amp; US ones)Overseas,a tus has all along been as reputable as any jap "sports car" at the very start,not to mention its 1 of their favourites to mod them into powerful monsters.Guess over here in sg its a different case where some people tend to look down or "label" all those driving fast/mod or stock tus,just because its a Hyundai,cheaper than other coupes etc.Nevertheless,to each its own.</div>

If someone really follow auto mod industry closely, they will know tht Tus is very popular in US &amp; they ever claimed tht the stock engine block r stronger &amp; can handle more boost than many other jap engine block out there.  U'll b amazed by the results of their Tus after mod.  Dun tok bout stock to me, it's always a personal preference.  Some ppl is die hard no-mod fans, but to me, I always luv to know the potential of a car rather than the stock figure shown on paper.<br><br>I always believe most Jap or Korean manufacturer can manufactur an extremely fast machine if there is no restriction from government or market.  Imagine if hyundai comes out a rally version Accent with the Rax price tag, how many of u will buy it???  I guess most ppl wun, they will say, geezz, this is a hyundai, why the price so ex???  I admit tht I'll rather get a Rax, but the main point is, i would like to know more &amp; support them instead of criticize them when I know nuts bout the potential of the car or the company, bcos when the market bcome more competitive, consumer always gain the benefit.<br><br>To guitar guy, u read through ur msg from the very beginning until now, wish u'll realise ur attitude of criticizing other car or driver &amp; act naive by sitting over there &amp; say, 'hey, this joker makes me luff, LOL'~!</div>
