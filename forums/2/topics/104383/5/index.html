            <div class='col-md body'>Why is everybody so defensive or blasting each other over their choice of ride? Some pple just like to be seen in a tus.. Some pple like to be seen in a Big matrix. or some ppl just like to be seen in a sedate and family oriented corolla.<br><br>its all individual choices. In singapore, it doesnt matter if you 0-100km/H  is less than 5s or more than 20s. THe Police beemer will always win. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .<br><br>And Fyi, the tus when modded is one major giant killing machine. (e 2.7L one.)<br>Sat in a tus myself , and the ride is ok, pretty decent too. So if anybody is gonna compare it to a Silvia, MRS, 350Z, Celica SS2 or ITR, its gonna be very One sided. Hyundai quality has definately improved over leaps and bounds. but to compare it to the higher japanese marques, would be like comparing your corolla to a lexus ES430. Different market and definately different target of consumers. Not everybody needs a Ferrari F430 for a sports car, or a Mercedes S500 for a family Sedan. or use a 350Z for the early market trip. But for the $$ rich ppl, Maybe So..<br><br>Main point being, its a car that People would like others to see them in. but for some others, the utilarian priority is more impt, thus getting a sedan or MPV more relevant to them.<br><br>But there is absolutely nothing wrong with the tus. It was never Marketed to be the definative sports coupe/high performance car in the 1st place. so why blast it in that category? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Anyway, I am driving a SIS.I choosed it for its design, suzuki fuel economy and relatively good performance. It is NOT a high performance car, but its my choice of ride. I believe the same thing applies to all the other TUS owners. They own it because there is something in the car that appeals to them. So just leave it as that and respect them or other car owners for their choice of ride. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuscani has a nice design, and thats about it.<br><br>Guess the main problem with Tuscani is that the engine and the price do not say the same about its nice design.<br><br>Its a pity that the engine isnt strong enough to complement the design. Its like a Japan 1.6cc engine inside a 2.0cc coupe body. A coupe with performance of a sedan.<br><br>Thats why the pricing of Tuscani is in category with some 1.6 sedans models. Will anyone consider buying if it is higher? They have to price that low for a coupe to entice people to consider.<br><br>Although there is nothing great about Tuscani, cars isnt cheap here.

He may choose 350Z cuz he dun want to maintain turbo car or dun like rotary. And as I said, the 350Z still has 280 bhp which backs it up.<br><br>Ppl wun look at 350Z and say stuff like "poor mans sports car" etc.. they at most tink "wasted, tat guy should buy Evo"<br><br>As for the Tus, the owners (not including those who really really like the looks of the car) want to get a sporty car but as I asked, why do ppl get sporty cars??<br><br>Usually, for performance, looks, or show-off value, which arguably the Tus dun have. So they made the choice to buy a 'poor-man's coupe' , so called, instead of saving up more for performance car or settling for relak family car or buying a good 1.6 sedan.<br><br>So since the Tus is in a sense flashy, it is subject to higher levels of scrutiny.
