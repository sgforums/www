Tuscani accelerates from a standstill to 100km/h in 12 secs...that totally sucks for a sports car. Even the city now i'm driving if manual can hit 9.8 secs vTEC. CVT version i think can even be 10.8 secs vTEC. Accutually vTEC makes a hell lot of difference. Tuscani 2.0 litres more road tax. City lesser road tax, only 1.5 litres. City more fuel efficient bcoz of technology, it gives abt 12km/litre if i drive fast. My previous hyundai matrix only return me 6km/litre when i drive fast and feed him with 98ron petrol. The only thing i like about tuscani is the looks lol.... anyway tuscani not a bad car.... its just that it doesn't perform like it should and should giak yiu. I think the interior of the tuscani oso quite nice. Overall?..............made affordable.</div></blockquote>actually it is 10.5 not 12 secs from standstill till 100...</div>

It is price so low that it is not in the range of celica or integra. In fact it is price in the range of more expensive 1.6 sedans. For those, who dont follow cars may be impress with the design of Tuscani. For those who know cars, Tuscani is a low class coupe. Only the design makes it to fall in coupe category. Sometimes it may be shameful to be seen driving one as they know that these owners want a coupe so bad and yet they could not afford a decent coupe like celica. Even celica or integra is already inside low cost coupe category.<br><br>Why buy Tuscani?<br>Because I want a sporty car but i could not afford a 'real' coupe. It is a poor man coupe.<br><br>It is a real embrassment if a Tuscani is stop side by side a RX7 at traffic light junction <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>why should there be an embrassment?....you have your car i have mine? then if a kia picanto stops next to a ferrari then the kia owner must hide himself meh?</div>

You dont compare a durian and a grape. They are not in the same category.<br><br>If you dont feel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  then good for you. This is just my personal and my friends'  opinion on Tuscani. For about the same price, I rather settle for a sedan like mazda 3 sports.  It is like you want to be in the tops of 1.6 sedan category or the bottom of coupe category. Is there any coupe that is cheaper than Tuscani?<br><br>My personal opinion.  This is a forum right?</div>

IMO the Tuscani performance is quite decent with a sporty looks n good value for money.(im just a nissan sunny driver) so its actually a really good deal.And yeah whats up with the sports 'wanna be' catergory? I dont see why a Tuscani shouldnt be under this 'sports car' cat. be it with celicas,DC5 etc equally?Just because its a Hyundai? or just because it known to be abit heavier than other coupes? Oh please.....have seen a few done up n fast tuscanis on sg roads,and they are definitely not slow.</div></blockquote>Trust me la, I not the only one comparing... How many ppl u tink will look at a Tus and have so much free time to think "Wah, Tus, its not too bad, considering the Koreans have come a long way blah blah blah..."<br><br>They will just look, and they will judge. And the Tus being a 'sporty coupe', does put it to more scrutiny than a normal sedan and doesn't have the meat to back itself up.<br><br>Its under 'sports' category because its a coupe! I'm not saying it try to be a supercar, but its trying to be a sporty car but dun have the performance to match! Celica actually a bit cmi oso, a lot of ppl from the car scene hate the 'sillycar' oso, esp. when the owners think sooo highly of themselves. I dun wanna start another flame war abt Celica, but tats the general feel tats floating around.<br><br>Done up ones not slow of coz la... its 'done up' wat.. done up Nissan Sunny also can be fast. When comparing mods, things become a little trickier but u can still see which cars are 'better' by following the aftermarket manufacturers products.<br><br>I'm sure there are less Civics than Sunny or Corolla on the rd, but why so many mod parts for Civic? Because the B/K Series engines are respected and highly moddable while still keeping it 'relatively' stock.<br><br>The R34 is king becuz can make till 1300 bhp using stock block (altho bored up)...<br><br>Nissan Sunny and all can put turbo, yes, but how much bhp can reach? And if can, how long will the engine last?<br><br>Those fast Protons, are they using super boosted Proton engine? No rite, using mostly Evo4 engine. So they cant really boast about the Proton brand. Anyway, they only good in straight line.<br><br>So the long and short of it, I personally feel that either a person shld relak drive normal car, or get a respected car, or do up a super sleeper but not go for something neither here nor there.<br><br>Its like I rather wear a Giordano t-shirt than a Polo Ralph Lauren Polo shirt with the horse having only 3-legs.<br><br></div>

This is just my personal and my friends'  opinion on Tuscani. For about the same price, I rather settle for a sedan like mazda 3 sports.  It is like you want to be in the tops of 1.6 sedan category or the bottom of coupe category. Is there any coupe that is cheaper than Tuscani?<br><br>My personal opinion.

How many ppl u tink will look at a Tus and have so much free time to think "Wah, Tus, its not too bad, considering the Koreans have come a long way blah blah blah..."<br><br>They will just look, and they will judge. And the Tus being a 'sporty coupe', does put it to more scrutiny than a normal sedan and doesn't have the meat to back itself up.<br><br>Its under 'sports' category because its a coupe! I'm not saying it try to be a supercar, but its trying to be a sporty car but dun have the performance to match! Celica actually a bit cmi oso, a lot of ppl from the car scene hate the 'sillycar' oso, esp. when the owners think sooo highly of themselves. I dun wanna start another flame war abt Celica, but tats the general feel tats floating around.<br><br>Done up ones not slow of coz la... its 'done up' wat.. done up Nissan Sunny also can be fast. When comparing mods, things become a little trickier but u can still see which cars are 'better' by following the aftermarket manufacturers products.<br><br>I'm sure there are less Civics than Sunny or Corolla on the rd, but why so many mod parts for Civic? Because the B/K Series engines are respected and highly moddable while still keeping it 'relatively' stock.<br><br>The R34 is king becuz can make till 1300 bhp using stock block (altho bored up)...<br><br>Nissan Sunny and all can put turbo, yes, but how much bhp can reach?
