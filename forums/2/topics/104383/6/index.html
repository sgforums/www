Its like a Japan 1.6cc engine inside a 2.0cc coupe body. A coupe with performance of a sedan.<br><br>Thats why the pricing of Tuscani is in category with some 1.6 sedans models. Will anyone consider buying if it is higher? They have to price that low for a coupe to entice people to consider.<br><br>Although there is nothing great about Tuscani, cars isnt cheap here.

Have you driven a stock Tus that have gone thru proper running and stock tuning before?<br><br>If no, then how can you say that it;s your general feel for that car?<br><br>If you think "coupe" is a wtf class.... Then you shld go and tell this to DaimlerChrysler. And ask them why they have CL class and CLK class. And DaimlerChrysler is proudly calling this 2 type of cars a coupe.<br><br>PG or Sepang using a 1.6 Civic??? Basically are you trying to use the quarter miles race thingy again??? To be frank, the performance of a car is not just dashing on a straight road. It consist of many factors, i.e. road handling, stability at high speed, etc. If you really keen to on at PG or Sepang, I think there will be at least one Tuscani would like to have fun with you. But provided you show yourself up and not hiding behind the computer.<br><br>For your info, there are racing development team and company for Tuscani in both korea and US. There have wide range of stuffs, inclusive of TC and SC kits for both I4 and V6 that can throw out 200bhp - 400+bhp depending on which FI setup and which stage. Not only japan have racing, but korean and american who race too and probably more than japanese. Just that you dun know.<br><br>Another info for you. Japanese are proud of themselve and their product. Therefore they will seldom develop anything for stuffs that are developed by other country. So it's not that jap race team dun develop for Tuscani, but it's their culture to stop them develop for Tuscani. I have their blood and brought up in this kind of enviroment, and that's why I know.<br><br>So far from what I know is that the jap Co do developed stuffs for Tuscani, e.g. Veilside and a few. The reason they do it, becoz they see the potential of the market due to potential of this car.</div>

Who design it and is actually designed for which car maker in the first place? And what's the combination of the different models design in in the Tus? Why ppl wonder &amp; heads turn during the test drive in Europe  highways for the first time?<br><br>Guitarman1, I think... Couple is a general layman terms only for 2 doors. But be sure to know that Tus is a fun-car. Not a sports car or performance range. Insurance will be ex if this is a sports classified. And since then, I think there's no need to compare with other classes of cars or performance or even pricing ...blah,blah, blah..<br><br>It's a class of it's own within the fun-car range... NOT performance range (Stocks), Not Sports car range too. Fun-car must look good also, performance will be secondary.<br><br>Well.... Should the Tus is branded under other Conti car maker, who dare to say it's a cheap car????? I think there won't be anything under 100K.</div>
