He may choose 350Z cuz he dun want to maintain turbo car or dun like rotary. And as I said, the 350Z still has 280 bhp which backs it up.<br><br>Ppl wun look at 350Z and say stuff like "poor mans sports car" etc.. they at most tink "wasted, tat guy should buy Evo"<br><br>As for the Tus, the owners (not including those who really really like the looks of the car) want to get a sporty car but as I asked, why do ppl get sporty cars??<br><br>Usually, for performance, looks, or show-off value, which arguably the Tus dun have. So they made the choice to buy a 'poor-man's coupe' , so called, instead of saving up more for performance car or settling for relak family car or buying a good 1.6 sedan.<br><br>So since the Tus is in a sense flashy, it is subject to higher levels of scrutiny. But got nothing much to back it up. At most ppl say affordable and like the look, and if they can put up wif the fact it garners no respect at all, then so be it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess yes, Tus is a poor man's coupe. But just as my city or even ALtis is a poor man's sedan....hehehehe....<br><br>I guess, like for me i buy City, some just dun like it, I like it for reasons seem stupid to some.  But well again I say, there are some really poseurs but there are many who buy it because they like what they saw for the budget they have... Anyway...its very hard to see whos really a poseur.... its not the car but the attitude of the driver....<br><br>some people says that like Celica SS I or Integra Type S is a poseur cos they no money to buy the SS II or the Type Rs...i would say, why is that so? I mean really its almost 30000 cheaper, some people just want a car that looks good, reasonable performance so buy Type S integra can liao why need to buy Type R.... so I guess to one paddle overturn the whole boat is not right lah....</div>

Cant afford an expensive one so they go for 206cc. There is a PURPOSE for buying it.<br><br>Its not the same for Tus, cuz it fails in so many categories except maybe for looks.</div>

Even Datson 100A can liao. Coupe some more more inconvenient, as i said, for the occassional dropping off of frens/relatives.

            <div class='col-md body'>The long and short of it, I'm not totally condemning any brand particularly.

Got no employee!<br><br>The fact is they are just admin, secretary, IT support and co-ordinator.<br><br>I rather be titled aptly to my job and my paycheck then to pretend to be some big shot, look nice on namecard.
