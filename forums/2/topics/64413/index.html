Ok here's my take on this.... i've been playing wif TAMIYA 1:24 scale models for a while now have 3 in my possession and one more skyline to built.... always shop from this place in funan last time... i haven't done any model shopping for the past 2 yrs but i think it closed down...<br><br>2 popular locations to buy plastic kits and paints and other stuff for buildign up one is either bugis..or Specialist shopping centre 3 floor.... bugis has more tank kits and japanese anime stuff... but for a wide variety die die have to go tai seng... and they are onli open during office hrs on weekdays and half days on sat.......<br><br>As for building models, my advice.. dun buy your dream car or yoru fav car model to build 1st... coz usually 1st try will always be disaster... like when i 1st got mine i wrecked the bumper paint job and numerous decals... try on something less fanciful... i.e. no F1 or WRC cars wif lots of decals...... u might consider investing in airbrush and other paint tools like mask tape and paint pens.. ....<br><br>My worth of contribution.. hope it helps... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
