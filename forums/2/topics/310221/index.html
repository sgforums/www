              <p>I live in a condo in Upp Bt Timah. A lot of us are fed up with people driving their cars in the wrong direction in the carpark. We have complained countless times to the management; they have sent out multiple circulars to the residents. They have recently deployed guards at random times to patrol the carpark and take the the car license numbers if the flout the rules.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a few minutes ago, my father signalled to a person that he was going in the wrong direction. My father has told this same person that he was going in the wrong direction last year. He did it again today. That effing sonofabit** threw his blardy shoes out of the car, got out, slammed his blardy Lexus door and shouted: " You have a problem?" He shouted damn loud. He repeated that phrase a few times. My father said, " You are going in the wrong direction. I'm just telling you." He shouted again "blah, blah, blah" He went back into his stinking Lexus and came out again "Why are you pinpointing me? Everybody doing it.!!!!" He jumped up and down like a retard. Another case of others eat sh*t, you follow them.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He went to park is stupid car. I was really furious at his shameful behaviour, I shouted back at him. My neighbour witnessed the incident and went to comfort my father.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That mad dog came up again and shouted "You have a problem?!" I think that guy really has a screw lose. Blah blah blah. Then his daughter comes into the scene and defends her father by saying who started the argument first. And can say that he is correct...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We couldn't be bothered with those ppl. Went into the lobby. Wah, that effing bast**d can charge like a bull into our lobby. I quickly closed the lobby door bcos it will lock securely once you close it. He blardy hel* started kicking the door. "Come out lah! we challenge one on one!" If he dared do it, it would immediately be an assault case. In fact he can be fined for vandalism and given demerit points for flouting the rules. Dam violent person.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very shameful people. In the wrong dun want to admit and say sorry. You guys say whether he is right lah. We are going to report this bcos we cannot stand it anymore.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> I mean an accident can occur. That lane is for cars going up, he go the opposite way.</p>

              <p><br>My father is not an elite who likes to expect everything to be in order but disrupt the harmony. And just to highlight we are not the only ones who tell them to go the correct direction. Management, security guards, other residents are fed up. Others say leave the jobs to the security guards, but they are not patrolling all the time. One day, there will be an accident and it will just be too late to learn their lesson. It can involve a life or inflict serious damage on the car. We keep on telling them, they don't want to learn their lesson. B4 an accident happens, we just bring the matter to the police and let them handle it. This is just basic safety and basic highway code.</p>

              <p><br>Thats what we try to emphasize. They one ear in one ear out. What you said is very true. They can either learn it the easy way or the diddicult way. When they meet with an accident dun come back crying...really frustrating.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Cement supplier offers new type of concrete for use in car parks</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : A local cement supplier is offering a new type of concrete for use in car parks.</p>
              <p>The material works like a sieve, allowing rain water to drain away.
              This is now possible with a new local invention called Permecrete.</p>
              <p>If
              all goes well, it could be used at car parks at the new Marina Bay
              Sands integrated resort. Its creator, Holcim, hopes to cement the deal
              within three months.</p>
              <p>When used in a car park, Permecrete will help to keep the area dry and clean, with no puddles on the ground on a rainy day.</p>
              <p>Holcim
              has submitted its proposal to Marina Bay Sands for consideration. It
              also plans to sell the idea to the Housing and Development Board (HDB)
              and property developers.</p>
              <p>Holcim said the concept of Permecrete is a sustainable way of development, especially when sand is in short supply.</p>
              <p>Dr
              Sujit Ghosh, Vice President, Operations, Holcim, said: "It’s the first
              time in Singapore that this kind of Permecrete or sand—less concrete is
              being developed and being considered for car parks. The cost is
              controlled significantly by materials, so one of the material
              components which is sand, is out, so it’s not going to cost more than
              normal concrete definitely."</p>
              <p>No definite details can be released
              now because the deal has not been finalised. There will be more
              research done to improve the product, including the greater use of
              recycled materials.</p>
              <p>One source of recycled materials is the
              National Stadium that will make way for the new Singapore Sports Hub.
              The complex will be built by a consortium, led by construction firm
              Dragages Singapore.</p>
              <p>Dr Ghosh said: "We’ve initiated discussion
              with them, to see how we not only act as a concrete supplier, but also
              help in using back as much of the recycled materials which will be
              available from the demolition. So they have shown initial interest in
              this."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Sports Council said plans to recycle the
              demolition waste have not been confirmed. The National Stadium will not
              be torn down until after the World Cup qualifiers in June.</p>
              <p>Industry
              players said some amount of "legislation and incentivisation" will be
              necessary to encourage greater recycling of construction waste.</p>
              <p>Such
              efforts are particularly active in Europe. For instance, in some land
              scarce Scandinavian countries, contractors will have to pay a dumping
              fee when they discard waste materials.</p>
              <p>Currently, the amount of
              recycled demolition debris in the market totals over a million tons.
              Holcim said they could be used for non—structural applications and
              reduce the amount of raw materials to be imported.</p>
              <p>Responding to
              Channel NewsAsia, the HDB said contractors for its various upgrading
              projects sell construction waste materials to recycling companies. —
