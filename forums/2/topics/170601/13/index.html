            <div class='col-md body'>haha my god<br><br>heres my take on this thread -<br><br>this IS a car forum and theres nothing wrong really with sharing your experiences. so for people who say "So What" or "who would post this kind of information" so be it, but the first few reactions showed that some people where actually interested<br><br>if anyone gets caught by the cops you all have nothing to lose so why do you care, if you're so certain they'll get caught then isn't it satisfying enough with that knowledge because it definitely seems you want these people in jail.<br><br>no one went to the meet up intending to speed. they went to have a convoy and dinner which did happen but somewhere in there temptation came in and they decided to push their machines and again like its already been said, the area was checked there were no other vehicles around. if anyone crashed it'd be the speeder who would suffer a loss not any innocent people.<br><br>they took the risk, you didn't. why do you care?<br><br>and if you notice by now the ones who started the thread have given up because whatever they say seems to be wrong<br><br>and honestly just saying something like "i wouldn't do that" or "its definitely not safe to do in singapore" is better than yelling your butts off.<br><br>so how abouts we end this thread and move on with life. *sigh*</div>
