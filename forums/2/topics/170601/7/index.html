            <div class='col-md body'>Gazelle.. I think ya on the wrong section of the forum..<br><br>If u dun appreciate cars.. whether or not itÂ’s a super car, fast car, expensive car, cheap car, old car, second hand car..etc.. They are still cars.. ThereÂ’s nothing wrong or immature with them posting this thread..<br><br>In fact.. It is the PERFECT place to post it..<br><br>On the other hand, stop crapping abt the sg police force.. coz its total bullshiz.. SG has always claimed that it has strict internet laws.. blah blahz.. Its all bull and made up.. Its silly people like u who falls into that shiz hole of believing whatever the SG govt says.. Not everything is true..<br><br>And if u wanna talk abt the SG POLICE FORCE.. for ur infomation.. THEY DO NOT GO to a person's DOOR just to ask them to pay a SPEEDING FINE.. They have more important jobs to do..<br><br>It really doesn't matter if they post pics of their so beautiful cars outside their house.. sorry to upset u.. but it doesn't mean anything.. and this thread.. No matter wat u typed here.. its not substantial to be used in court at all.. tts why this is called a "FORUM"..<br><br>They can speed all they want.. and its non of ur freaking business.. If they get caught by police.. then let them be.. who are u to care? If they get killed.. Its their own consequence.. they are old enough to think for themselves..<br><br>Besides.. they are not those inconsider bastards who speeds on normal roads in daylight trying to freak out all the other drivers and pedestrians.. They only speed in empty and deserted roads at vampy hours.. If ya so against wif people speeding.. why dun u go get a traffic police job.. probably u will feel more useful than to bitch around here like an old hack..<br><br>So stop acting like ya so "mature" and "know it all".. when ya basic information on SG govt and law is not even sufficient.. maybe u should go back to ur "law books" before u come back to this forum to flame others..<br><br>The reason why they didnÂ’t put up their physical self inside is becoz of GREEN LOSERS like u who gets jealous over them when they are merely sharing their fun car experiences with other car enthusiasts.. if u think they are lying.. they can always put their physical pics up here, wif their cars..etc..<br><br>**********If u MAY SooOo PLEASE ASK.. POLITELY..<br><br>Shut ur filthy mouth about others showing off.. when ya throwing a bomb outta ur mouth saying that u can drive faster or better than them wif a normal car.. this simply proves that ya the one.. trying to "show off ur skills".. when NO ONE actually even know if ya real..<br><br>IÂ’ve met them.. I know their character.. They are NICE people who just simply loves cars.. Not everyone who owns nice cars are arrogant.. some just happen to be luckier than others..<br><br>Doesn't matter if u own a lambo or any other cars.. even if ya the one with the Only CCR in SG..<br><br>If ya NOT a Car Enthusiast.. then BUTT OFF and go into some Â“aunty gossipÂ” forum where u can bitch all u want..<br><br>Till then.. all others who appreciate such pictures, information and experience sharing.. Cheerzz!!~ More meet ups and pictures please!!~  *smiles*..<br></div>
