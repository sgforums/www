I just looked thru. Did I say u were sucking up to them? No I didn't!<br>*ding ding ding*<br><br>next!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>u know, its not very nice of some of them either, to say the things they say. If they are nice people, they don't have to snap back do they? Honestly, it would be funny if I were jealous of them. When I am in Singapore, if im not driving a Mercedes myself, Im driving an Airtrek Turbo R. I get to go circuit racing on weekends, and before I left Singapore I've already raced semi-professionally for 3 whole years. Why indeed, I would wonder, should I need to be jealous of them? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>btw, i wonder if its considered your own car if the money still came from mom n dad. If u look thru my previous posts, i've always maintained that what one's parents wish to spend on their children is never the business of others. I still hold that view. But unless u want to tell me ALL of them bought the car on their own salaries, I think its stretching it a bit thin to say its their own cars.</div>
