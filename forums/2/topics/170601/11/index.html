The only reason why it works.. is becoz of the HEAVY FINES that comes together wif their "ever so convincing" SPEECH..<br><br>** Imagine if SG govt doesn't FINE people and JUST simply "ASK" people not to smoke, speech, commit crimes, etc.. asking based merely on speech.. u know it yourself.. its USELESS without HEAVY FINES included to back up their speech..</div></blockquote>Are you suggesting that the only rational solution to social misconduct is punitive in nature?  Or are you a firm believer of a retributive criminal justice system as opposed to reformative and corrective training?  Do you not believe that education is the salvation of the generations to come?  Were the great teachers Buddha, Jesus and Muhammed in fact the greatest fools of all time?  Did Gandhi live a life in the blazing heat wasting his saliva without restraint?  Did Martin Luther King choke in his words and die in vain?  Are persuasion and advice lost arts in modern culturalism and egotism?  Did God make a fatal error when he created the voicebox and eardrums?<br><br>And are you asking us to refer this thread to journalists, TP, prosecutors, MPs and the like so that heavy fines and punishments will be meted out?<br><br>I feel the need for speed too, but I know the folly of advertising it.

If they are nice people, they don't have to snap back do they? Honestly, it would be funny if I were jealous of them. When I am in Singapore, if im not driving a Mercedes myself, Im driving an Airtrek Turbo R. I get to go circuit racing on weekends, and before I left Singapore I've already raced semi-professionally for 3 whole years. Why indeed, I would wonder, should I need to be jealous of them? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>btw, i wonder if its considered your own car if the money still came from mom n dad. If u look thru my previous posts, i've always maintained that what one's parents wish to spend on their children is never the business of others. I still hold that view. But unless u want to tell me ALL of them bought the car on their own salaries, I think its stretching it a bit thin to say its their own cars.</div></blockquote>That's sad.. i did not say that u said that.. how did u end up wif it?? u should read wat i wrote againz.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dun need to go into such technical terms on whether its yours or mine or parents.. Obviously the money comes from the parents..<br><br>It doesn't need to be bought by them to make it their cars.. So happen that they haf nice parents who likes to buy them wat they want.. At the end of the day.. its still their own cars.. probably under their names..<br><br>Doesn't matter TO ME whether ya a professional racer.. etc.. I can't be bothered on ur personal life.. dun bother going into details.. besides i'm not against you.. there's no reason why i should either..<br><br>and i'm not saying u r jealous.................. please revise wat i typed...<br><br>Like i said.. even if ya the only one in sg that owns a CCR.. if u dun appreciate information sharing here.. just dun read  this thread.. can't deny that this topic was grabbing ur attention and u can't help it but to click onto it right?</div>
