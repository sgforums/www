Or ur brain simply can't resolve this little info?<br><br>Besides.. Dun need to tell us about accidents..<br>We have probably read more than u n we'r aware..<br>Doesn't matter if u were the one who seen it personally..<br>We dun gif a shzt.. *winkz* WE DUN GIF A SHZT! GOT IT!?<br><br>In the first place.. We DID NOT say that "speeding" was RIGHT..<br>Its more like.. Who's BUSINESS OF YOURS is it?<br><br>Then againz..<br>Some people were nice enough to just ADVICE US NICELY not to speed..<br>We are okay wif that.. In fact.. thank you for ur concerns.. *smiles*..<br>BUT WATS WITH ALL THE RUDE NAMES!? AND FINGER POINTING!?<br><br>P.S to Spec : *smiles*..<br>i went missing for awhile.. and i'm still remembered..<br>Thank you..<br><br>Gazelle - If u realised.. u were the one who started to call people names in the first few pages of this thread.. so dun deny the fact that u were one the trouble maker after all..<br><br>Ter - Remember i was feeling really pissed off.. so in the end.. I took the car and I went over to a friend's place lastnight.. We played some alcohol game.. End up.. we all got pretty high.. We had 5 different bottles of alcohol and only 7 of us drinking them.. outta 7.. 2 hardly even touch them.. That makes.. 1 person drinking 1 bottle each.. But e worst part was.. we mixed them all UP! Well.. I'm back safely at 6am in the morning..<br><br>ALL - Wats wrong wif KIDS(spec! KIDS!!!ArhHHzz!)  hafing their own car? Just so happen that some people are luckier than others.. Isn't that LIFE!? Get a hang of it manz.. and whether or not someone is "stupid", "silly", etc.. Please.. Meet and know the person FIRST b4 u start commenting.. To b|tch abt someone that u dun even know.. Simply proves that u ain't any better.. So please.. If u think u can't stop critisizing others...  JUST SHUT UP~<br><br>Oh.. and Please come down on Fridayz... Come on dudes.. The more the merrier.. Its gonna be real fun yea!?<br><br>P.S: TROUBLEMAKERS.. pleaseeeee restraint ur SANITY while ya around k.. I'm sure everyone wants an enjoyable time..<br></div></blockquote>Shantelle,<br><br>What a matured reply!  I am amazed.  I am "jealous" of your youth and wealth.  I am so proud you drank so much alcohol you only got back at 6am.  This does not even remotely concern me or any other forumer here.  I am not in the least bothered.<br><br>If you cannot even answer coherently, with proper facts; without resorting to assume that people are jealous, you are luckier etc etc, then shut up.  Assumptions will only make you sillier in all your replies.  Airhead is SIMPLY an appropriate term for people like you.<br><br>Meanwhile, enjoy your holidays.  Start school next week already.<br><br>I shall not reply unless there is a proper answer with proper and sane answers.  Oh yes, Shantelle, don't restrain your sanity, let it flow, cause you need a LOT of it.  Hey, no names, I am still calling you Shantelle.</div>
