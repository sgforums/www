            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, think debating whether one shld give way when at speed limit etc wont get us anywhere. Bottomline is, if one refuses to give way and the other tailgates and an accident happens, both parties lose. who's really at fault doesnt matter if someone dies or gets injured. At the very least the cars are smashed. So might as well just give way (if possible) and drive defensively, no point "teaching ppl lesson" and risking urself; at same time dont tail gate road hogs, they'll probably wont care and u risk urself and ur car again. 2 wrongs dont make 1 right. so saying there are horrible road hogs out there, or ppl who tailgate u on the CTE when there's simply NO room to change to the left lane and there's already a car in front of u. so might as well not add to the list of bad drivers.</div>

When you see a vehicle pulling up behind you on the overtaking lane, isn't that already a sign that he wants to get by?  You choose to wait till he's right on your tail then give more excuses, "He is now tailgating, so i won't give way"... ???<br><br>You think it's your right to cruise in the overtaking lane till someone signals you to get off?<br><br>Ask yourself honestly, how many times have you seen two or more vehicles cruising in the overtaking lane and another vehicle, or more, behind gets stuck there.  Why?  Because the selfish b*astard in front is thinking to himself, "The guy behind me isn't trying to overtake anyway, so I'll stay in the overtaking lane".  The guy behind him is thinking, "I'm just following the speed of the guy in front of me, so, I'll stay in the overtaking lane".   The consequences then is that every other car is stuck behind them.<br><br>As for that link wbucket sent earlier; Everyone already knows that Singapore bureaucrats are a mindless bunch that can't make decisions to save their lives.  It's way easier to enforce a law that has a quantitative measure - like speed - but when it comes to something that requires judgement - like road hogging - the entire machine falls apart.<br><br>What were you expecting them to say in print?  Yes, you can go faster than the speed limit"?  You think the civil servant who answered that question was going to put his job at risk by having a black and white account of that?<br><br>The fact that he said there is no real law which dictates the rules to an overtaking lane shows that he needs to retake his highway code himself.  What are the signs stating, "Keep left unless overtaking" for then?  To fill up open space and make our highways look nicer?<br><br>Just a side note - I called the traffic police once to enquire about bikes squeezing through highspeed traffic, and was also told that there is no law against that.   Anyone who has taken their bike licence here would know that it's drummed in from lesson one that a rider should not, and can not, do that.<br><br>The main thing is this - we all use our roads daily.  By acting so damn selfish and inconsiderate on the road, does it make your life any better?</div>

So when the flow of traffic is 120 and everyone else is speeding beyond 120,  that's their business, i will still maintain around 85-90 and i don't see any reason why i should give way to them unless they are police cars, ambulances.<br><br>Occassionally i will still glance at my rear-view mirror, those tailgaters wanting to get past me can try every possible means, that's none of my business. They can overtake from the left, fly on top of my car, or go underneath my wheels in order to overtake me, that's not my business and they don't deserve my attention on them. I don't really give a damn.<br><br>Those tailgaters can do anything they want behind me, that's not my business, as long as my car is still intact.  But if they ram my car from behind, then that's my business , and i'll make sure they get it from me...i'll make them suck my c o c k<br><br>You guys can call me a jerk or a sicko but i don't really give a damn..woooahahahahahahahaha<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and there are also people who, even though the road is quite packed, and most cars are, e.g. driving at 90, thinks they are extremely skilful and their time is more valuable than all the others on the road, and insists on weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating cars infront to force them to give way (even though it is difficult for the car to give way due to road conditions), exploiting people who choose to keep a safe distance from the car infront by forcibly driving into the space, basically, being a complete arsehole who thinks the whole world should let him go first. i have seen such drivers before (thankfully, not too often), and even though i may not be directly affected, i seethe whenever i see one. i often wonder if these idiots get caught by the traffic police - they are the ones who the police should be looking out for and booking, not those who drive beyond the speed limit but drive safely and follow the road conditions!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reading this thread reminds me of why we need the courtesy campaign. Speeding is wrong - everyone knows that. Road hogging is also wrong - some pple know that. Insisting that you are not road hogging becos you are driving close of the speed limit although you are on the right lane - CHAMPION!!<br><br>The rules of the road are meant to make it travelling on the roads safe for all road-users. Faster vehicles on travel on the right and slower vehicles on the left. SIMPLE! No need to argue.<br><br>Now, lets see if you understand that principle - Lets do a multiple choice question -<br><br>If there is a faster vehicle coming towards you and you are on the extreme right lane, you are: -<br><br>(a) the slower vehicle<br>(b) the faster vehicle<br>(c) a bladdy eeediot becos you actually did not know (a) was the right answer and you actually considered (b) or (c)<br><br>whats there to argue???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree that tail-gaters are pain in the arse. Agree that road hoggers are pain in the arse too.<br><br>But I note that there is no agreement whether a car travelling at around the speed limit is necessarily a road hogger when it is not on lane 1. In the morning, when the bus lanes are in operation, some vans or trucks will slow everyone in lane 2 down on 3-lane roads. I get stuck behind them at 60+km/h, but I don't tailgate and don't complain. I will overtake them on lane 1 if necessary but I certainly don't think that their presence gives me the right to go in lane 1 at 70+km/h.<br><br>I don't subscribe to the "flow of traffic" rule of thumb. When there is such a thing as a speed limit, "flow of traffic" should not exceed the speed limit.<br><br>By the way, I am also a cyclist and firmly believe that speeding vehicles are a menace to other road users. Speeding drivers can crash themselves to make my day.</div>
