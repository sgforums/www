Cause if not, most likely you will skii first. So as long as people take photo of both car's skii marks, true is known. Secondly, you trick only works with tailgater. The moment you cut in, if too close, a horn and the hogger will slow down to keep a distance.

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about this, I have something to comment though. I have noticed that almost once every 2 days, I see accident(s) on the road. I ride along PIE (Changi) to work. It's very frustrating. As a rider, I already feel this frustrated, I'm sure for car drivers, definitely worse.<br><br>Do Singaporean drivers/riders think that they are too skillful or simply just too inconsiderate? And I always believe in this thought "If you want to die, die further away. Dont cause inconvenience to other people".<br><br>It's so "sad" that Singaporean motorists do not understand traffic rules well. Call me "black heart" or what, but I always feel happy when I see people getting caught by TP. Whatever it is, they deserve it.<br><br>Note: I'm not those rider who go in between cars, unless its very slow traffic or massive jam.</div>
