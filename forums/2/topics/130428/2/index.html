On that note, I never said it's ok to tailgate either.  I'm just talking about the morons who roadhog then complain about tailgaters.<br><br>I've always made it a point to keep as far left as I can... even on the odd days that I chose to drive at 120Km/h on the overtaking lane, I STILL pull left when I see a car pulling up behind me (and yes, even at 120, it does happen).<br><br>I do not stay in the over taking lane and give selfish excuses like, "I'm already over the speed limit", I don't do stupid things like, "Don't bother looking in the rearview mirror"...  I don't wait till they are right on my tail then give excuses like I can't pull left now.   I can honestly say here - I almost NEVER encounter tailgaters.<br><br>There are that one or two occasions where I'm already on the left most lanes and there aren't any exits nearby, yet someone tailgated me (and I was doing about 70 - 75 in an 80 zone)... then yes, I slow done even more gradually till he/she overtakes.<br><br>I don't think there really is or should be an "official slow speed" before you can be considered road hogging.   It's just if you're holding up traffic when the lane to your left isn't going much slower than your own speed, or if you're not pulling left in the overtaking lane when another car is trying to get by.<br><br>I's just simple, basic road courtesy... I have no idea what the arguement is about?<br><br>All these selfish mindsets and excuses rather than to just give way.  There is no way of knowing why the other driver is in such a hurry...  a loved one could be dying in a hospital... it could be some other life and death issue, whatever.<br><br>Even if it's nothing more than some idiot wanting to speed.  That is really his business.  Why play traffic controller and put other people and ourselves at risk, should this driver make a rash move???</div>
