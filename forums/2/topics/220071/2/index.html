            <div class='col-md body'>Huh??? Sorry, dun quite understand your question. If you are talking where to park at genting, there's plenty of parking lots in the open area infront of Genting Hotel. Can't miss it.<br><br>Also the last time that i went up (the trip where i burned all my rotors), i saw quite a few singapore registered cars, got their driver side window smashed.

Anything happens, still car rental company got to foot the bill. Singapore cars are just to damn expensive to be driven up there.

How to park so that pple wont steal the whole car?</div></blockquote>I park at the 1st world hotel carpark. . Use steering wheel lock.<br>Can see the security patrolling the place in a motorbike and sign the book now and then.<br><br>Select parking lots that are near lift or place which people and car alway go by. Would advice you to invest in steering wheel lock bar ... or brake lock device , which you can easily get in singapore. That will at least discourage would be car thiefs as it will take them more time .... which is not good due to the frequent patrol.  Next is to empty your car of all things that look expensive, without them no one will want to smash your window to take anything.<br><br>Just check on your car every morning, as it be good you give your car a little warm up in the engine due to the cold weather.</div>
