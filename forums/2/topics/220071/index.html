Possible it be good if you wash your car - wind screen clean is very important as if rain or get too cold, your windscreen if clean will remain clear and not fog up so easily. Top up with proper wiper liquor instead of water.<br><br>You should have no problem going up at all. You can try using D mode to going up and down the slope.  For going up if you feel the lack of power then change to d2.  Well just drive up slowly.<br><br>coming down hill all depends, if you are not too confident a driver, better use d2 , as D mode can be a little fast for the turns. just tap your brakes a little here and there to slow it down. using a little brake here and there will not wear it out that fast.<br><br>Use D2 for increase engine brake when driving down hill or for increase engine power when driving up hill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just came back from Genting.  The road up Genting has improved alot.  Some parts of the road going up has 3 lanes that make it easier to drive up.  If you are using a manual car, use 2nd and 3rd gear.  When near the top, the road is a one-way and has 3 lanes and this makes driving up easy.  You do not need to stop and brake the car so frequently compare to the past where there are only 2 lanes and there are many cars infont of you and you also have to watch out for cars coming down.  Use Shell V-power petrol when going up, it will provide extra power for your car when you are going up.  I have tried with this petrol and found that it really gives additional power driving up the hill.<br><br>When driving down take note of some of these precautions. Immediately after you start your car, before your start driving, always press the brake pedal a few times.   Then move the car slowly and test the brake and make sure that the brake system is working properly.  Do not press on the accelarator when the car is down gradient.  Engage 2nd or 3rd gear and press on the brake to slow down the car if the car is travelling at above 40km/hr.  Do not always press on the brake as this will wear the brake lining.<br><br>The North-South expressway has also improved.  Some parts of the expressway from Malacca to KL has 3 lanes and the road has been resurfaced.  This makes driving much more comfortable.  Beware of road works along this stretch as they are adding lanes and resurfacing  the road.<br><br>Happy driving to Genting and these few tips should help you to have a safe journey.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Drove my manual civic up once. On my way down, friend advised me to use engine brake. I was thinking....... "Siao, later gear box spoilt how?". Used the brakes and half way, i smell something burning. Stop the car, alighted to check and found all my discs rotors multi colors. In the end, all discs rotors and brake pads needed to be changed before coming back to Singapore. Cost me a bomb. Lesson learned. Next time, i rent car to go up.</div>
