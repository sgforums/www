When I said what I said, I meant that we cannot just because that person paste sticker, we say he is poseur. I am sure there are poseurs. But I am sure there are some who are not? Or would u generalise that every hyundai or every nissan or any type of cars put sticker or some other things which does nothing is a poseur?<br><br>As I said, if you own a car, every morning when u come down to the carpark and see ur car, you wanna have that feeling "I love this car man." Its that person's feelings that matters not ours.<br><br>PS: my car doesnt have any stickers or any air scoops that doesnt suck in air. All I did is a strut bar and an air filter. But still I think whatever people do to their cars is up to them.<br><br>If you insist on calling them poseurs I dun agree.
