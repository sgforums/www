            <div class='col-md body'>Today I went to pay the balance of vios.<br><br>There package I've taken is S$45988 for 1.5E AT, plus S$100,<br>for the V-Kool.<br>The SE told today that this S$100 can be waived if I willing to<br>give her the "government paper" after scraping car 10 years later.<br><br>This is what her original word (in Chinese), if you do not buy<br>new car 10 years later, government will not give you any money<br>for rebate, just a paper like this(she show me a white paper, just<br>Bm letterhead paper), so you will get nothing except this paper,<br>and if you sold this paper to some second hand car dealers, they<br>can transfer to new car, so they willing to buy this paper.<br><br>I ask her, why the used-car dealer need this paper, is it for<br>the PARF rebate? if for that rebate, it's still 50% at 10th year,<br>quite a few thousands, how can I give up it for S$100?<br><br>She did not explain it further, just said if you want to keep, then<br>just pay the S$100 loh..<br><br>I don't believe she dare to cheat me a few thousands of dollars,<br>a few hundreds dollars is possible, but as she did not explain it<br>further, I really don't know what "paper" she refered to.<br>Just quite sure that is not a good deal for me.<br><br>Then comes to V-Kool, I took out V-Kool's price list, and ask her<br>which package in the agreement, she said it's the cheapest package<br>Mirage, this is not a surprise, Mirage price is S$850, and there are<br>2 better packages UV Protect 70, S$950, Mystique S$1100, so I<br>ask can I pay the difference S$100 or S$250, so that can get the<br>better package?<br>She said no, the V-Kook dealer give her about S$500-600 for<br>Mirage package only, if I want the better package, should pay the<br>difference beteen S$500-600 and S$1100, that it about S$650!<br><br>This is a surprise, why I can not pay the difference base on the<br>price list? that's sounds more reasonable, am I right?<br>and I think everybody can point out the second issue here, the<br>difference should be S$500-600, why she slip out S$650.<br>if it's S$650, then the actually price for Mirage is S$450, this maybe<br>the real price V-Kool offers to BM salesperson. and deducts my<br>S$100 topup, the actual freebie she give to me is S$350 value.<br><br>Now is the last thing, She said the car collection date is next Wed,<br>I say is it in the delivery centre? She said no, just in the Showroom,<br>because she will let the V-Kook vendor (just behind BM UBI showroom)<br>to work on the car before I collect it.<br><br>I do know most of Vios users collect the car at Borneo Motors<br>delivery centre, so I don't know is there any trick here?<br>Is it a good idea to collect the car at delivery centre by myself, so that I<br>can follow the checklist to check the car first, then I send it to<br>V-Kool vendor 1-2 days later for the film?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SEs get different kickbacks for different V-kool package, so DO NOT expect to pay just the difference in the list price should you decide to upgrade.<br><br>I got my car at the Nissan Showroom with the V-kool all done-up. I find it very convenient for me, everything settled in one visit. If you have lotsa time to go delivery centre - vkool workshop, etc, you can tell your SE. But IMO, the delivery centre is kinda far and ulu.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to what you say, regarding the vkool thing, if its not done at the delivery center, most probably is the Se engaging her own contractors instead of the usual reference by the company. Thats why need to get the car out of the delivery center then call them come install. But 1 question to ask, I thought BM is using rikecool or cool n lite?? How come Vkool??<br><br>As for the asking of higher catogery of Vkool, Most probably the SE already made a deal with the contractor on the commision. Thats why if go for the higher grade, at that price of top up 150-250, will affect the SE commision.<br>Mirage for 850...hahaha.. I got mine last year april for only 599.(some more is aftermarket when my ride was 4mth old.) Aiya...see go buy vios for what... if buy lancer, the SE can throw in rikecool package worth 950 for free. lolz.. from 500 ralliart voucher can increase to 1000 + 500 cash rebate (If i get the MT sport ver). I bo liao go inside the showroom and test market one... haha.<br><br>Maybe you should have go and find out more from other SE on the package before deciding on who to buy from. Some of them desperate for sales quota can throw in addtional stuff. When the SE says, " this is the best already, you ask the others all the same one". Thats bull&amp;%it. On how much they can give depends on how much the SE is willing to give in.</div>
