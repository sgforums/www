            <div class='col-md body'>ya ain't training until ya behind the wheel itself.... but well doesnt hurt to read up and gain some knowledge.<br><br>Sorry to hear about yr cousin, but i think he already gave you a clear view of the consequences of doing street racing. It baffles me why he actually supports you in these kind of activities.<br><br>And since ya only 17 and learning about weight-transfer blahblah... do you even know how an engine works in the first place? I suggest you start from the bottom then work your way up. ITE has got Automotive Technology courses to get you started with. If you really have a passion for cars since young, then 2 years of schooling on that course shouldn't be a problem for you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stormy_turbo, as someone who's actually RACED for 3 years and had both proper training in racing and racing theory, I can only say you honestly don't know a lot. Everything u've mentioned about theory is very basic and not indepth, and your racing theory seems to be gleaned from watching Initial D more than anything else. I especially have to try not to laugh when u mention "racer's mentality" because that sounds really initial D, and what mentality are u talking about? Racer's mentality is to be responsible and race on the racetrack. If u're thinking about street racing u can't have much of a "racer's mentality". Too much initial D... look at the stupid misconceptions they put into the heads of the gullible. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
