            <div class='col-md body'>I think wherever u go, whoever u buy from, good service or empty promises, it can happen anywhere. They are all human, whichever car showroom has more ppl, their service and standards drop, like Kopitiam.<br><br>When u buy a car, dont just happily look at the car, shape, color, size, comfort, price, accessories...etc. Check their after sales service, ask wat they will do when car broke down, emergencies, wat sort of services they provide, make them pen it down and get the company to stamp it. All salesman will lick ur boots and promise u anything (verbally) when they need quota and u r buying a car. When u call them 4 problem, everything change. If the company make a promise in black and white and dont deliver, 1st - make lots of noise there, make sure u do it during peak hours and 'compliment' their service and attitude, 2nd - go to CASE and produce all the documents and 3rdly - give them a laywer letter.<br><br>When u buy a car, create as much problem and situation for them to solve it and get them to promise in writing. Be it PI or not, they all are the same and sucks. Singapore's service standards is very bad and competitive, many has no bussiness principle and only interested in closing sales. The sales person are also trained wrongly because their manager only wana see figures. Everywhere is the same, u jus need to make them 'suck' up to u and promise to deliver.<br><br>Lastly, dont buy from Pinnacles. They are most cunning, customers and competitors will also wana 'eat'.<br><br></div>
