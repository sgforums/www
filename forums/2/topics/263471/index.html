            <div class='col-md body'>I'm driving a vios and recently my car broke down. It broke down on sunday(17/6/07). So I called the tow company number that was on the sticker of my windscreen.<br>He asked where I want my car to be towed too? As I tot SIN MING was nearer, I said tow to there. ANd he said a charge of $60 will be required. But I told him my car was under warranty, den he say, it will be free.<br><br>On monday, I called sin ming to ask hows my car status now. They say need to bring to Leng Kee HQ to repair. Good, I asked do u all provide a car so that I can drive? I need a car to bring me around badly. But the sales person say NO. Cars under warranty, we do not provide cars. Cars without warranty, we provide. I mean... what the #@!$#@!? And the sales person, no they call advisor, is very very RUDE! Both at leng kee and sin ming.<br><br>I really regret buying cars from toyota knowing that their after sales services is so bad. And it been a week and still no news about my car. When I call Leng Kee just now(25/6/07) the RUDE Advisor says she dunnoe anything and need to call sin ming to check. When I called sin Ming and check, they asked me to call LEng kee!! OMG... I'm being pushed around!!<br><br>Can anyone advise me on what to do? esp those with similar problems.. thanx</div>

By far Sin Ming is the most popular location. $4000++ for a bumper, headlights &amp; labour is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DAYLIGHT ROBBERY.</span></span></strong> Minor repairs like knocking out dents, try avoiding going back to the dealership.
