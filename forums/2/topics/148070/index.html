To be very sure during the first week check the engine oil constaintly (daily) if u can. see that there is no drop of engine oil on yr dipstick. If u find a drop bring it back and ask them to check yr engine casket.<br><br>And very very important new car are not meant to be ramped and don over rev it till u run in the engine. Pls drive slowly till u run in yr engine max speed don exit 90-100. if possibe drive at 80 always.<br><br>U will learn through more as u meet ppl who drive, lots of ppl have different views on how a car should be, so u have to gamble through wat are the real good stuff and wat are the bad..<br><br>All the best!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I kept have the idea that the thread starter is asking about "per-long drive up north" kind of check-up. Anyway, from what I understand, you can do that with C&amp;C's service center (the regular maintainence guys) or can sign-up for the AAS thing.<br><br><a href="http://www.aas.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aas.com.sg/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many thanks guys for sharing your input !!!<br><br>Thanks for giving me extra info on top of my qns .... well, sending my car so service ctr periodically for regular maintenance .... such as after 1000km etc is well understood ... me only concern is to learn my own basic pre-drive check not necessarily only for long distance ride .... such as own simple "troubleshooting" can be done if i encounter small little problems instead of having to rely on towing or svc ctr to repair ....<br><br>One of you mention that is a thread very informative on this by nick ... how do i get there ?? what's the link ??<br><br>Also .. can i clarify .... car towing, car servicing is best to call C&amp;C for repair or towing service (if there's such) or go thru my insurance and get their assistance ???<br><br>Also on top of that, how will AAs be even more beneficial to me ?? like there's a course for me to attend or yet another service to get from them when my car breakdown??<br><br>for starting i can drive only at around 80km???? ahhw ... that's sad .. i was thinking of going higher than that ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>neway, i'll try and heed as many advice as possible ....<br><br>Do share more lancer inside stuffs if u have .. Hope to hear from many more of u ....<br><br>Take care !!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do read through your manual for the car as soon as you got it, I know most don't. In it, there is a section about "running-in" the car. That is where the 80kph rule apply. Below I included a link on what "running-in" of engine is. But I recommend you use the method stated in your car manual.<br><br><a href="http://209.15.36.61/rdrc/breakin.html" rel="nofollow">http://209.15.36.61/rdrc/breakin.html</a><br><br>AAS, it is a autocar association. It is a club you join to enjoy various benefits from it. Like safra club kind of thing. It does provide free 24-hrs towing servicing, pre-traveling checks and also lessons on simple car maintainences skills.
