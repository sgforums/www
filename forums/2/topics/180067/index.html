            <div class='col-md body'>Field Report by Ken<br><br>met the guys from sgforums at WCP mac at 830pm, waiting for everyone to arrive. NEC guys arrive at 915PM, have a short introduction and ice-breaker session. set some rules, and the next meeting point. moved off at 945pm.<br><br>when convoying to petronas, kinda messy as 2 forums share the same talkie channel, so unsure the message is from who and supposed to be for who. slowly things start to warm up and we are getting the hang of the game. reached petronas at ard 1015, have a final head count and moved off with NEC leading the convoy and johncooper at the back of SGF convoy with NEC last man shielding him.<br><br>toll charges is a killer man, total spent abt RM$46 plus s$6 on tolls. on the highway to YP itself, we are going at 120km/h, a comfortable speed for everyone to travel at and not road hogging. some NEC members go up further front and SGF members stay behind. driving up in a relaxing manner. Latioguy from NEC was my navigator and we discussed plenty of things on cars and such, made a new fren there.<br><br>convoying there with the help of a talkie is good, in a sense the last and 1st man of the convoy will actually have a good pix of wat's going in front and behind, and update the convoy, eg car coming behind, keeep left etc. within an hour, we reach yong peng utara exit. have a toilet break and let engine cool off for abt 10 mins before we carry on to Lucky Gardens (got the name right) for supper. food was somehow similar to sg, but the more impt part is the TCSS there, over technical issues and normal day life...<br><br>some of the NEC guys decided to go rounding at YP while the rest remain to rest for awhile more. at 1am, we moved off our convoy back to SG. this time round, most of us are trying our tops, while the rest juz cruise along. this time, everyone made it back to petronas in half the time we take to reach yong peng. top up our tanks and moved back in to singapore.<br><br>for my ride, it is pretty stock, even running on stock wheels. when we are travelling back to sg, while driving past other cars travelling at high speed or past those gigantic containers, buses, lorries, u can feel ur car is shifting left and right. this is due to the "turbulance" formed by the vehicle. so advice is keep both hands on steering when driving past other vehicle.<br><br>when u r travelling alone, it is ok to on high beam, but when u r approaching  a vehicle in front of u, off ur highbeam as it will cause glares to the vehicle in front of u. when u see a glare coming from behind, it means tt u r too slow, juz give way. this time round, there are very little sg cars on NSH. so most of the time, travelling is a breeze, as SG cars are known for either speeding or hogging.<br><br>these few points are wat i realised and learnt during the trip. those who went, do pen down ur FR and share amongs fellow forumers..</div>
