            <div class='col-md body'>To the toyota corolla : If you want to die, please die off the roads and pls you cant win a RVF on a heavy traffic situation like just now around 8pm. oh ya when you are speeding, kindly look at your blind spots cause you nearly bang a toyota starlet. By the way your car look nice but you the driver sux. When I say driver sux, meaning your skills sux.<br><br>To the Fairlady350Z : Uncle you are fast i admit but you are fast cause you are driving a 350Z. Zooming down PIE at the speed of 150km/h cutting recklessly into others lane isnt that fast you know. Im still behind you along the way in my chilli padi and mine is only a 1300cc car. Just wanted to let you (I know he wont see this) that in sg, fast car doesnt mean you are the king of roads.<br><br>Hope these two drivers hand over their IC soon<br>nick34</div>

Maybe u should go to the middle lane and let them pass loh. Chase behind them also no use wat, nothing u can do about it. Taking law into ur own hands makes u no better than they r.<br><br>As for tat corolla, mayb he just got his license and feelling a little zealous and passionate about his new ride. Or just another Shoe-marker (sorry I dunno how to spell his name) wannabe. No point blowing ur top and spoiling ur whole day bcos of it, he'll have his day, believe me. As for tat 350Z, let him be, like I said, he'll have is day too. 1 accident... itz all it takes to make them learn to be an obedient puppy, trust me.<br><br>So keep ur cool man... itz wat makes u tick.<br><br>Peace out brudders @ wheels.</div>
