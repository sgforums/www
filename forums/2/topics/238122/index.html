            <div class='col-md body'>the stretch of road at queensway between mei chin road and alexandra road; if you take farrer road and turn left towards queensway.<br><br>the leftmost lane is the bus lane. but towards the end of the stretch, before the cross junction, i think it becomes a non-bus lane. if i am not mistaken it is five lane at the junction, with the right 3 lanes allowing right turn and 2 left lanes for going straight, so if the leftmost is a bus lane then there will effectively be only one car lane for going straight - not quite sensible.<br><br>can i write in to explain that it is difficult to tell when the bus lane stops and when it becomes a normal lane?<br><br>has anyone here explained off a similar offence before?<br><br>thanks!</div>
