            <div class='col-md body'>no choice the balance of power is in their favour... sales people are supposed to be customer service oriented, to treat all their customers fairly and with respect...<br><br>but unfortunately, most big name car salespeople earn more than a large part of their customers, and cuz their brand name sells itself so well, they dun need to work tat hard still will have people walking in. So they feel that they are in a position to 'select' their customers!<br><br>Take for example Performance Motors.. my fren knows a lot of ppl there cuz his family got 3 BMWs, all high end models like 7 series, M3 and 645Ci. He told me some stories and apparently the SEs 'look down' on 318 buyers, esp. fussy ones.<br><br>Imagine la, the SE there can earn like $10-20k a month, sometimes service generous buyer who buy one M3 for son, one M5 for wife, Z4 for daughter and 745 for himself. Then later a customer who wants to buy 318 comes in and starts to fuss tat it is expensive, want more freebies, complain about lousy service cuz no one attend to him etc...<br><br>Of course the SE will rather serve the guy buying the 4 BMWs who doesn't fuss about a single thing, instead of having to pacify the fussy, demanding buyer who wants a 318 rite?<br><br>So no choice lor, in this industry, apparently things are the other way round... the SE is king, not the customer. Cuz got endless demand for cars and got lotsa rich carrots, so the SEs dun bother about the poor, fussy people. I think so far only Volvo and Lexus have good service consistently.<br><br>Just like those coffeeshop stall that become famous, got long queue, their service is atrocious also. Ai lai mai sua attitude, cannot ask for more chili or extra bowl etc...<br><br>no choice lor, unless we collectively stand up to these arrogant salespeople, we'll always suffer at their hands.<br><br>To summarise, fark them!!! Call New Paper and publicise their bad attitude and maybe setup online guestbook to solicit feedback from all dissatisfied buyers also... make them stress! kekeke... mebe can gather 20,000 signatures, see whether they still dare to yaya!<br></div>
