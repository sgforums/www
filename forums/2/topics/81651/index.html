            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone!  Am considering to buy a car.  This is likely to be the family car, so factors to consider are fuel consumption, cheap, decent performance, appropriately "mature" look.<br><br>Anyway my question is, should I get a brand new car (altis, lancer, vios?) something thats 3 yrs old (lancer, corolla?) or even older?  This is especially considering the new tax changes, which reduce the upfront ARF tax, but thus also reduce the trade in value later.<br><br>Am preferential to getting a new car, especially cos COE and ARF relatively lower now, but scared will "buang" cos new driver... then very heart pain lah...<br><br>I am open to either buying a new car &amp; holding on to it for quite a few years, or buying older one &amp; scrapping/trading in after about 2 years.<br><br>Also, if buy old car, how old is recommended?  If is 8-9 yrs old scared maintenance, but good thing is if buang then not so bad.  Dunno which models good for 8-9 yr old cars also.<br><br>How i wish the Vios was styled to my liking, (apologies Vios fans!) but right now, it just doesnt look appealing to me, but performance &amp; PRICE all good.</div>

Else, try the 3-4 years soluna. Its another cheap car and offers suffice power...<br><br>Then again, theres nothing as a cheap car, take the bus if u dun mind.<br>Be forewarned, they cheap money sometimes....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I happen 2 know some ovr at the ubi car mart dat are pretty reliable and reasonable with their prices, it'll help if u have one that is recommended by frenz ... in any case you can shop ard and compare prices if you think they try 2 keto u ...<br>one thing abt 2nd hand car is dat its not so heart pain when they get scratched or dented .. and this is sth dat will happen if u park at HDB or public lots ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you are a seasoned driver, no harm going for new cars.<br><br>if you are a new driver, which can't take a new scratch on a new car, go for a 2nd hand car, about 3 years.  Some of these cars are going near scrap value, do some huntings on your own and you can get a real bargain.</div>
