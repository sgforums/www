            <div class='col-md body'>just finished waxing my car myself for the first time. wah... hard work siah<br><br>anyway a few questions:<br><br>1. what's the difference between car waxes and car polish that are being sold widely?<br><br>2. i waxed my car using a sponge. and the sponge became progressively darker, as though from dirt, as i waxed. is this "normal", or am i simply cleaning dust?<br><br>3. as i waxed, i also discover small white specks on my car that cannot be rubbed off easily. (i mean these specks were on my car before i started waxing, but i started noticing only upon scrutiny). what are these? and how to remove them?<br><br>4. i wax by applying a small amount of wax on the sponge, and then rubbing it onto the car in a circular motion. i cover a smallish section of the car with each small amount of wax. after rubbing all the wax in, some wax can still be seen. so, i would use another unused section of the sponge to rub the wax (also in circular motion) until it totally disappears. is this the correct way to do it?<br><br>5. as i waxed, i discover specks of wax being formed on my car, much like dust. again, is this normal?<br><br>6. should there be visible differences before and after waxing? if so what should it be?<br><br>7. how frequent should i wax my car?<br><br>8. and lastly, something not related to waxing. i discover small spots on my car here and there, probably stains from things that fall on my car which i did not notice initially, etc. how can i remove these spots?<br><br>thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

(i mean these specks were on my car before i started waxing, but i started noticing only upon scrutiny). what are these? and how to remove them?<br><br>ans: not sure...  could be dried pods of wax.<br><br>4. i wax by applying a small amount of wax on the sponge, and then rubbing it onto the car in a circular motion. i cover a smallish section of the car with each small amount of wax. after rubbing all the wax in, some wax can still be seen. so, i would use another unused section of the sponge to rub the wax (also in circular motion) until it totally disappears. is this the correct way to do it?<br><br>ans: www.autopia-carecar.com<br><br>5. as i waxed, i discover specks of wax being formed on my car, much like dust. again, is this normal?<br><br>ans: some wax will leave powdery particulates. use a duster to clear them and clean cloth n water to go over it one more time to anti static the surface.<br><br>6. should there be visible differences before and after waxing? if so what should it be?<br><br>ans: gloss... esp caranuba wax.<br><br>7. how frequent should i wax my car?<br><br>ans: abt 1 per 3-6 months<br><br>8. and lastly, something not related to waxing. i discover small spots on my car here and there, probably stains from things that fall on my car which i did not notice initially, etc. how can i remove these spots?<br><br>ans: polish.<br><br>thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>hth<br></div>
