              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Alamak sorry lah bizzkit0102... dunno why
              I scroll up and down but didn't see your comments only after I have posted my
              reply! Think getting stony eyed liao. :)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Anyways, I appreciate your comments.
              Again, another one who is spot on. HolySniper and sinicker comments are
              downright immature and absolutely foolish. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Let me reiterate my point. I believe
              whether you're a school or private student, what you learn from the school or
              the private driving instructors are the basics and whatever's necessary for you
              to obtain your driver's licence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">If you manage to pass on your first attempt, I
              say, congrats to you, luck,amongst other things was on your side. Don't be so
              hao lian lah. I agree with bizzkit0102, luck plays a very important part.
              There's only so much preparations you can do lah, right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">And I've heard about the quota thinghy too
              and have no doubts there are some truth to it. I'm sure preference are given to
              school students. Ah well, I've gone through that hurdle and it was a
              bittersweet moment when I finally passed. I just want to say, don't ever give
              up if you want something bad enough. Go for it. :)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;">Goodnight everyone! :)</span></p>

              <p>Hi CannyOng!</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments. Well, I agree, there are no room for mistakes while driving on the roads. My question is however, is there anyone out there who would want to get into an accident on purpose?</p>
              <p>You see, I am not condoning my act. I should have been more alert and careful. And can you explain how is it that you find that I am not the road smart type? Are you also going to say that it's because I only passed on my 5th attempt? I would really love to get your insight on this!</p>
              <p>And yes,  my niece was frightened. She was almost in tears, and my heart went out to her at that moment. I didn't care about anything else at that point of time but her safety. Perhaps I might give up driving, perhaps I won't.</p>
              <p>I just hope and pray that if one day, something were to happen to you while you're driving (assuming that you're also a driver and a road smart type) you wouldn't have to bear with the heartache of seeing your loved one scared to death by your actions.</p>
              <p>God bless.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hi sinicker</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Looks like I also have to
              address a few issues tonight aye?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">You said: “i think mine was a rational thinking. if you cannot pass after multiple times,
              something is really wrong. like nightsky87 added, maybe one's abilities just
              cannot make it. judgement of situations all plays an important part. cycling,
              swimming, driving... i feel it's all the same. if you cannot, then you really
              cant. i admit i cant swim for nuts &amp; dont bother to learn coz' i simply cant!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I disagree. Practice makes
              perfect. In my case, I am not car stupid. I know I have the ability to drive
              albeit being a good driver. I just have a few kinks that need to be ironed out.
              Namely like lane changing (still not very confident), my habit of wide turns
              when turning right and my parking skills. These I believe you hone your skills
              on the go.<span>    </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Although I have to say I
              admit I can’t sew for nuts and I don’t bother, not because I simply can’t, but
              perhaps,I’m just lazy. :) </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;"></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">You said: "because when you
              fail numerous times, it's a clear indication that something is just wrong.
              well, that's what i feel. of course we all learn from mistakes. confirm every
              driver whether pass 1st, 3rd, 5th, nth time all commit mistakes on the road. :)
              whether it only resulted in a near-miss or an accident that's another different
              matter altogether and it isnt important whether the driver was a 1st, 3rd, 5th
              or nth attempt student when you're in an accident coz' it aint matter. the
              license to drive is. i hope you understand where i'm coming from.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> what i'm trying to bring up is, if a person fails numerous times, something
              must be really wrong right?" </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I do understand where
              you’re coming from... If a person fails numerous times, YES, something must be
              really wrong. And it’s up to that person to address it, to start thinking, how
              come I keep failing? What are my mistakes? What are my weaknesses?  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Like for instance, I am
              weak with my vertical parking and directional change. So during my revision
              lessons, my instructor made me practice many times. I focused on my weaknesses
              and improved on my strengths. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I dunno… maybe I just don’t
              know how to give up. Maybe I have the fighter spirit in me. </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings;"><span>:)</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">You are very fortunate to
              been given guidance from your father at such a young age. Don’t forget, not
              many people have that luxury. Be it of time and money. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It was settled amongst
              ourselves. I was fortunate the cabbie was a very nice guy. He was compensated
              in full, including his loss of earnings, damages etc. </span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hello soleachip, nightsky87 and so_nice!</p>
              <p>Thank  you very much for your comments.  I must say
                                  it's very heartwarming. I guess what I need right now is
                                  understanding rather than criticism huh? :)</p>
              <p>To soleachip, you're totally spot on! I also took auto lessons
                                  at SSDC and they use Honda Accords over there. I must say I found
                                  the car slightly too big and always found it a challenge to do my
                                  vertical parking and directional change. It was only after I
                                  changed to a private instructor (his car is a Toyota Vios, and I
                                  have to agree the brake pedals are indeed small!) that I realised
                                  that it was such a breeze doing the parkings, directional change,
                                  etc in the circuit compared to using the Honda!</p>
              <p>I dunno lah, maybe it's because the Vios is smaller, hence it
                                  was so much easier when it comes to the parking. And my private
                                  instructor also gave me a lot of very good pointers and tips which
                                  unfortunately none of the SSDC instructors ever did.</p>
              <p>And you know soleachip, after what happened the first time, I'm
                                  never driving my family members again. At least not for a very long
                                  time.</p>
              <p>Hunk ogling? Erm.. usually I tend to gawk at nice cars
                                  lah..always imagining how it's like driving it... :P</p>
              <p>To nightsky87, no offence taken. :) And again I have to totally
                                  agree with you. If everyone has the same mindset as you, I'm sure
                                  singapore roads would be a pleasant ride for everyone. :)</p>
              <p>And so_nice, thanks for being so kind and understanding. I guess
                                  the key point here is to learn from this mistake, move on, and be a
                                  better and careful driver. And hey, sorry if I sound ignorant, but
                                  what is defensive driving? Can you please enlighten me? Thanks in
                                  advance!</p>
              <p>Wishing all of you a nice weekend! Stay indoors, the weather's
                                  really crazy! :S</p>

              <p>Yo sheila, don’t let what other people say affect your confidence. People are born with mouths, so it's natural for them to yak. But quality of what comes out of their mouths is another matter. If you bother about what every single forumer here say, then å�šäººå¾ˆå¿ƒè‹¦çš„ã€‚</p>
              <p>Yeah the brake and gas pedal for Toyota Vios in my school are smaller than the other cars I've driven. From what I know, brake pedals are a lot wider compared to gas pedal in most designs. So don't worry too much. Anyhow when you get down to buying your own vehicle, you can test drive and most likely choose the model you feel confident and safe in. Then in time to come you'll get used to the dimension as well.</p>
              <p><br>It’s natural for friends and strangers to form their own opinions about whether or not a driver is the road smart type but behind the wheel, best to trust and rely on your own instincts. Passengers can tell you to sound your horn, bug you about switching your lane, go straight, go faster, some will ask you why you go so slow, why you afraid to die, why road hog, some will ask you why go so fast, why not afraid to die, ask you to turn here, turn there do this and that, for me just ignore. Most of the time they are all wrong. Trust your own judgement. Hehehe...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nightsky87 is right. You're already licensed, so the only one to stop you from driving is yourself. <br><br>Why spend so much money on learning how to drive and just see it go to waste? Like what my mate said, now you just drive because you have your license. Why worry so much? Relax and enjoy it.  Everyone starts somewhere. I didn’t have much confidence initially, so I started with class 3A, then with more confidence, convert to class 3. Some people who chiong lessons all the way only need 3 months, others 6 months, some even take a year. I have two friends who failed FT thrice, took 3 times to pass TP, until now accident free and it’s been 5 years. Me thinks personality plays a very, very important role. Confidence in your own judgement is good, but over confidence can prove dangerous also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imho as long as TS is not one of those testosterone driven aggressive wankers on the road with competitive and hostility issues, nothing wrong with continuing to drive, even if she’s novice.</p>

              <p>Wow, just because you can drive above 70 you're not an ah gua?</p>
              <p>ahahahah funniest statement i've heard..own the crap out of someone? is it because they spend a few thousands to zhng their car? just stepping on the accelerator and outracing someone doesn't make you a good driver..and what in the first place makes you think you're that good just because you have a good car and u can accelerate all the way to 200?</p>
              <p>if i were you, i'll not make any safe assumptions on someone who passed his attempt before yours..</p>
              <p>I am not against people who failed, but what i really think is the difference between failures and passers is their confidence in their driving abilities..get scared during ur tp and you're bound to fail, confident and posied and you should not fail your tp because 15 lessons is really all that you need for almost everyone..</p>

              something is really wrong. like nightsky87 added, maybe one's abilities just
              cannot make it. judgement of situations all plays an important part. cycling,
              swimming, driving... i feel it's all the same. if you cannot, then you really

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I disagree. Practice makes
              perfect. In my case, I am not car stupid. I know I have the ability to drive
              albeit being a good driver. I just have a few kinks that need to be ironed out.
              Namely like lane changing (still not very confident), my habit of wide turns
              when turning right and my parking skills. These I believe you hone your skills
              on the go.<span>    </span></span></p>

              well, that's what i feel. of course we all learn from mistakes. confirm every
              driver whether pass 1st, 3rd, 5th, nth time all commit mistakes on the road. :)
              whether it only resulted in a near-miss or an accident that's another different
              matter altogether and it isnt important whether the driver was a 1st, 3rd, 5th
              or nth attempt student when you're in an accident coz' it aint matter. the
              license to drive is. i hope you understand where i'm coming from.<br> <br> what i'm trying to bring up is, if a person fails numerous times, something

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I do understand where
              you’re coming from... If a person fails numerous times, YES, something must be
              really wrong. And it’s up to that person to address it, to start thinking, how
              come I keep failing? What are my mistakes? What are my weaknesses? </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Like for instance, I am

              and improved on my strengths. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I dunno… maybe I just don’t

              <p>     Well my advice to the TS will be to continue driving but be very carefull esp when driving a car which you are not familair with . Different cars have to be handled differently esp of their sizes and make . I personally got into 2 accidents in a month before . I also got a shock , not to say i lost my job partly because of that but my confidence to drive on the road also suffered a setback . But slowly i tell myself i must learn from my mistake and to drive and slowly get back my confidence . Now it has been 4 years since my last accident and i can even confidently do a u-turn driving a lorry on most of the road without having to stop and reverse . Unlike those who drive mpv , suv or even sedan cars which i have seen before . Some of those cars even have much smaller turning radius then my lorry but yet they can't do a proper u-turn . Perhaps you may say i am boasting but at least i am confident of doing that .</p>
              <p>    Last but not least whoever says those taking multiple test to pass thier tp is stupid is the most shallow . I myself pass my tp on my 5th try ( surprisingly same no of tries as my army officer haha ) . In case you want to compare using academical achievements . And whats funny was i didn't get into any accidents untill 3 years later in which some of my colleague even praise my driving skills .</p>
              <p>   But one of my colleague whom pass his tp in only his 2nd try smashed the company pickup along a slope within a month and the pickup door was totally smashed . So how do you explain that ? And even after that , whenever he drive the company pickup on the outside road , he tends to hit the kerb very often .</p>
              <p>   And one of my current colleague in my team passed his tp on his 2nd try also . And he smashed his brand new car while trying to park in less then a month also . So how do you explain your theory of those who need multiple tp to pass should give up ? If thats is so then definitely the govt will make a rule where pple can have only 1 try for their tp otherwise will be banned forever .</p>

              <p>Don't let the snide remarks affect you.</p>
              <p>Its an accident, and your feelings are natural, because the accident is not something to shout about, its embarassing. Especially more so, when people like to hype about great they are, and enhancing that feeling by belittling others.</p>
              <p>Drivers of four wheelers, have the problem of concentration. They sit in a stable vehicle, and can easily be lulled deep into thought. They see, but their minds are thinking of something else. Sometimes even arguing (in the mind) a case that happen a while back. This is a common distraction of most drivers. Not paying full attention to their driving. It happens. Even to experienced drivers. Therefore always be alert when driving.</p>
              <p>It is a painful lesson learnt. And you will become a better driver, yah!</p>

              <p>Why I see some of you mofos have a freaking problem with people
                      who take more than one attempt to pass is it? I took 3 attempts but
                      let me tell you, passing once doesn't make you a better driver.
                      It's like saying every person with a PhD is very smart. In actual
                      fact, they are just better than many of us in terms of taking exams
                      and doing research. Watch a Top Gear episode, a PhD holder can't
                      even get a manual car to move.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After passing your TP, the real driving scene is way off the
                      situation one is in during his L-plate period. If anyone still
                      thinks it is ok to drive like an L-plater after getting
                      his/her license, that fella better go jump off a cliff or something
                      lah. Crude but it is the cold hard truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In truth, passing TP is more than just preparation. I refuse to
                      believe anyone that says that there is no quota thingy going on and
                      testers do not show preference to school students. I feel luck
                      plays an important part as well. It's impossible to prepare for
                      everything in anything, one can only hope to prepare enough. The
                      rest is up to luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, I have many capable driver friends that did not clear
                      their TP on the first attempt. Sinicker, I believe many of them,
                      even perhaps me, can own the crap out of you on the roads. So don't

              <p>wah wat i said is crap sia.. yes overall still a license when passed, BUT when u can fail so many times before passing, it shows tat ur motor skills, estimation, confidence and judgement is not that good.. not good at adapting to changes? it takes me like 5mins to adapt to whatever manual/auto cars?</p>
              <p>ur passed date is same as me, but mine's in 07. =|</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
              <p>HolySniper.. only dip holder, so hao lian? Then again what have you being a dip holder got anything to do with your ability to drive? One of my friend's colleague, this super cocky guy, is extremely highly educated, drives a fancy car, but according to my friend, he's the worst driver ever! After offered a lift by him one day, my friend swore never to get in the same car again!</p>
              <p>So your theory of ''BUT when u can fail so many times before passing, it shows
                                      tat ur motor skills, estimation, confidence and judgement is not
                                      that good.. not good at adapting to changes?'' sounds so ridiculously lame, it's bordering on mild retardation.</p>
              <p>So are you trying to say if I were to pass on my first attempt, I'm automatically a super duper perfect driver? Granted, there are those who're just inclined to drive, and many others, like me, who needs more practice before getting the hang of it. Not good at adapting to changes? Nah, hardly. I grew up poor, and if there's one thing that I've learned from my humble beginnings, I've learned to adapt to everything revolving around me and not the latter.</p>
