              <p>Actually, it depends on the situation, and also on what car you drive. Using your left foot to brake does reduce the chance of lift-off oversteer, especially for those long sweeping bends. Of course, just with everything else, you'd have to use it properly for it to work, and depends on the car also.</p>

              <p>Is just like gear. If I didn't remember wrongly, my dad tried it before on his previous car. To engage such gear, while you're driving, you just need to press the huge button on the knob, and pull it down. But safety first, please let go of the gas pedal instead of stepping the gas pedal. If successful, you will hear engine kinda roar a bit, or you will see the RPM meter go up by a little, depending on what gear you engage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for semi-manual function, I suppose you're refering to tiptronic cars such as new Honda Civic or various sports car. I'm not sure of other cars but as for Honda Civic, to start first gear, just tap on the + while driving or vehicle is stationary. To shift gear a gear up, just tap on the +, and to shift a gear down, tap on the -. My dad who tried using his tiptronic on his Civic, with gas pedal down, while chanigng gear, apparently, cause the ride very bumpy, as the car will sudden jerk or something.</p>
              <p>Please don't flame me if I got it wrong or something, as all this is just base on my experience and view.</p>

              <p><br>ehh i donno those semi auto cars, i don't think i sat in 1 b4 so can't ans u.</p>
              <p>the only big difference in manual and auto car is the brake and the left leg, speed.</p>
              <p>ehh in auto car don't anyhow let go for your brake cause the car will move forward, unlike manual i can do that and the car don't move.</p>
              <p>second is the useless left leg, nth to do .</p>
              <p>speed wise since in manual we are taught to use gear 2 when making a turn or u turning</p>
              <p> (provided u don't need to stop)</p>
              <p>but in auto no gear, so i kina need to get get the feel of the speed. can't rely on the gear :(</p>

              <p>Hello guys!</p>
              <p>Thanks for all your comments so far. I have a request. Please don't make this turn out to be a sling match. I can accept all the snide remarks, for they mean nothing to me.</p>
              <p>I'm just amazed how people can be so judgmental. Come on people, don't act like you've never ever made a mistake before. Let's keep this thread free of the testerone laden macho-ism ok?</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Yo yo, relag man dudes. I don't mean that driving fast mean you are damn good or driving slow means you are crap or something. Any human being with a right foot can hit 200kmh if his ride can take it, so really theres no big deal about going fast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just pissed that Sinicker said that people don't deserve to pass after multiple attempts and giving him some sort of personal attack, as I interpreted that he was making a personal attack on people who took more than 1 attempt to pass, me included. My aggressive comments were mainly targeted at him/her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Driving is all about confidence, not about how many times or how little demerit points one gets during his TP. What I'm just trying to say is that how well one does in his/her TP is not significant to driving in the real world. It's just like learning quadratic equations. You need to know how to solve them in your secondary school maths exams, but who the hell uses them in day to day situations?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sh!t happens to everyone, even the best drivers are human. Just because it happened to someone like TS who did not pass in her first attempt, doesn't mean it won't happen to folks who passed on the first attempt.</p>

              <p>Is just like gear. If I didn't remember wrongly, my dad tried it
              before on his previous car. To engage such gear, while you're
              driving, you just need to press the huge button on the knob, and
              pull it down. But safety first, please let go of the gas pedal
              instead of stepping the gas pedal. If successful, you will hear
              engine kinda roar a bit, or you will see the RPM meter go up by a
              little, depending on what gear you engage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for semi-manual function, I suppose you're refering to
              tiptronic cars such as new Honda Civic or various sports car. I'm
              not sure of other cars but as for Honda Civic, to start first gear,
              just tap on the + while driving or vehicle is stationary. To shift
              gear a gear up, just tap on the +, and to shift a gear down, tap on
              the -. My dad who tried using his tiptronic on his Civic, with gas
              pedal down, while chanigng gear, apparently, cause the ride very
              bumpy, as the car will sudden jerk or something.</p>
              <p>Please don't flame me if I got it wrong or something, as all

              <p>actually i've been told it's fine to switch to sports mode in the middle of cruising while i'm on Drive mode. But don't want to mess about with it. Prolly a better idea to ask someone who's done it before. Don't want to mess about, scared some weird circuit thing go on or stall in the middle of highway.</p>
