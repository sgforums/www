              <p>TS, it's normal to get into an accident. as for stepping on the gas when u r confused. a good thing to do is to always keep your foot on the brake when u know u r gonna stare at something or your attention is gonna be distracted. like answering a call, changing the frequency on your radio or whatsoever. this way, u r more 'prepared' in a sense. i've got my license for 1 1/2 year already and had 5 accidents so far. only thing is, i wasnt in the wrong for all 5. lucky me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>everyone has to learn somewhere, somehow. don't be discouraged cuz of 1 stupid accident. u spent so much on your license, not worth giving it up. maybe u can try driving a smaller car and in a slower lane? once u get the hang of it, u can try driving at maybe a faster lane or a bigger car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another way is, drive a bigger car, but at a slower lane. get the hang of it. it's very useful. my 1st car was a toyota prado and chrsyler grand voyager, at the same time(google them to check out the size, 2 freaking tanks). i swear by driving a bigger car first, so that u wont have problems when driving a smaller vehicle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for those who sound as if they are damn good, most of the time, they are just too imaginative. being safe is more impt than going fast. i lost 4 frens to car accidents already(i'm only 22), so im constantly reminded to drive within my limits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope all goes well for u.</p>

              <p>Hello Unknown_X!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments. I guess what you said is true. I have already spent so much getting my licence, I don't think I'm going to give it up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know I actually prefer driving hatchbacks. One of my faves is the Honda Fit, even though I've never driven it before. I've driven a few huge sedans, and I have to admit I don't quite like big cars. I find it a hassle especially when doing reverse parking, but then again my parking skills are not really that good. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But hey, thanks for being so supportive. There are so many of you who's been supportive and understanding thus far, and I just want you to know that I deeply appreciate it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who keep harping on how repeat TP testers shouldn't be driving, not good drivers, should be banned, etc, all I can say is, you're entitled to your own opinions and I'm just glad there's only a minority of you who thinks that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Happy monday!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>how huge is huge? haha. if u r petite, even a civic can be big. it's not abt big cars actually. u need to know how the car will react under low/high speed, hard braking, turning angle bla bla bla. dun just base things on estimation and judgement alone even though driving is all abt these 2. if u r not confident, do it slowly. say parking, vertical parking, not sure whether the angle is right, try again. at most only waste a few more mins and minimal petrol, as compared to damaging the car and paying for it.</p></div>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
              <p>HolySniper.. only dip holder, so hao lian? Then again what have you being a dip holder got anything to do with your ability to drive? One of my friend's colleague, this super cocky guy, is extremely highly educated, drives a fancy car, but according to my friend, he's the worst driver ever! After offered a lift by him one day, my friend swore never to get in the same car again!</p>
              <p>So your theory of ''BUT when u can fail so many times before passing, it shows tat ur motor skills, estimation, confidence and judgement is not that good.. not good at adapting to changes?'' sounds so ridiculously lame, it's bordering on mild retardation.</p>
              <p>So are you trying to say if I were to pass on my first attempt, I'm automatically a super duper perfect driver? Granted, there are those who're just inclined to drive, and many others, like me, who needs more practice before getting the hang of it. Not good at adapting to changes? Nah, hardly. I grew up poor, and if there's one thing that I've learned from my humble beginnings, I've learned to adapt to everything revolving around me and not the latter.</p>

              <p>Frankly - if you failed that many time, it is really that your skill at driving is not really that good. The fact is if you have the right skill the accident would not happened !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for common sense, judgement &amp; adaptation ....... - if you have it, face the fact - you would not have the accident also. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a weak driver, unable to concentrate - you should drive slower, short distances and know where the damn brake is - to get use to driving first. <br><br>You just have to stop trying tell yourself that you are qualified to drive just because you got your licence !!! There is still no excuse for having the accident, you have to face it , and not try to come here to justify that it is just a moment of error !!!</p>

              <p>Well, my question is, do you have any facts to support your statement that "if you failed that many time, it is really that your skill at driving is not really that good."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So are you saying that those who pass their TP the first time would AUTOMATICALLY be inclined to drive? Even with say, not much driving experience, but just because they pass on their first attempt, it'll be unlikely that they'll get into an accident?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's a load of crap and you know it. And also, please tell me, just where exactly in all of my postings here have I ever tried to JUSTIFY my error???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You just have to stop trying tell yourself that you are qualified to drive just because you got your licence !!!"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What kind of stupid reasoning is that? I'm not even going to bother to justify such stupidity.</p>
