So it is more of a feature than a engine as compared to DOHC and SOHC and Rotary.<br><br>The technical aspects of VTEC is quite hard to explain..but what i can do to help u understand it to explain to you how it feels.<br><br>The older generation of Civics basically has a 2 band VTEC engine. This means that below a certain RPM (for eg, 5500) your car is basically more like a tame tiger. Once you reach 5500, the VTEC kicks in. You can hear the distinct VTEC sound from your engine...when VTEC kicks in, it would SEEM as if all of a sudden you are running on Racing cams....you car will have improved power and torque. Needless to say, your fuel consmption will go up to.<br><br>DOHC stands for Double OverHead Cams and SOHC stands for Single. There isnt much to explain over here that you cant already deduce from the two terms. DOHC engines generate more power as two cams are used to deliver power and torque over the entire RPM range while the SOHC uses only 1 cam.<br><br>With that i do not mean that SOHC engines are slow...properly tuned and with VTEC, they can even trash my stock TwinCam 4A-GE engine.<br><br>Lastly, Rotary engines. They work totally different from Electronic Fuel Injection(EFI) and Carb engines. I am not too sure how it works too but i have attached a link above for you to read up more.<br><br>the last link that i posted have alot of pple who are very good at the the mechanics of a car and the details of tuning a car. maybe you can find more help there.<br></div>

A V12 has more cylinders, hence the gap timing between each of the cylinders' firing order is smaller, hence it is smoother.

More cylinders also tend to have lighter pieces for a given capacity, so u r often able to run them to a higher RPM. And both of these things mean more airflow, to which you put more fuel, and that means you add more base power.<br><br>But what u do is u take off some things too. More cylinders give u greater losses thru friction. Though u are theoratically producing more power, because there are more moving parts so it takes more power for them to move, so in theory u get a situation where a 12 vs 10 vs 8, will each respectively have more power but a lot more losses, so that the actual bhp is different.<br><br>But there is obviously a lot more to it, because of the losses. More cylinders are less efficient, so you have to use much more fuel. In the end u've got a lot of things going against much more cylinders and only a few going for them.<br><br>Also considering the bore and stroke, in a V8, it has a large bore, which is god for generating power, and a short stroke, which is also good for boosting revs because the piston has less dist to travel, It has good torque. For a V12 though, the capacity must be much larger, because in any case, if u compare a V8 and a V12 both with the same capacity, the V12 is going to get better top end power because of the lighter pistons moving up n down, but it lacks low end torque.<br><br>Another problem is packaging. In designing a car, u have to decide how to package the engine. A V12, though more powerful, is longer and heavier, used more fuel, and its crankcase was so much longer that it is fundamentally less torsionally stiff. There are also more exhaust pipes to package. Also, operating with more friction, it is less heat efficient, which would imply that larger radiators are needed, which presented more packaging problems. This would also lead to increased drag, which could be undesirable for the want of a slightly superior top end power.</div>
