              <p>Still it was kinda unsightly haha. Dirty at one end of the grandstand, clean at the other! As for the Spyker, I got abit shocked when it's doors open by itself. No idea how it was done, but it was cool nonetheless.</p>
              <p>The staff only test drove the bikes at the end of the event? No supercars?!</p>

              <p>On Saturday the Ferraris and Maserati's parked in long lines down the pit lane itself next to the exhibition, and all the cars were invited to do laps. The GranTurismo's sounded good, but just couldnt match the Ferrari's sound-wise</p>

              <p>Great event! Nice collection of supercars.</p>
              <p>Question to the ones who were there: Did you happen to notice, on the  Spyker C8 Laviolette, the number shown on the side-skirt (just below the 'C8 Laviolette')??</p>
              <p>It's vaguely visible on gabriellhrteo's side-shot. This number is actually the VIN number (the last 3 digits). As a big Spyker fan, I'm keen to know what VIN it actually was, so I can update the VIN register on the Spyker forum.</p>
              <p>Gabriellrhteo, you don't happen to have a higher resolution version of your pic, do you?</p>

              <p>Honestly, I do love the Spyker because of how it looks. It is more than just a car due to its unique design, but I'm not a fan of the interior though. It looks like it was taken out of a boat.<br>But I'll definitely buy it if I had the money. Its unique. Not your everyday Lamborghini or Ferrari you'll see on the roads.</p>

              <p><br>To be honest I don't think the laps were meant to happen in the first place as we were meant to be in a procession .. but once one floored it we all did .. If I had the chance to do it again I'd expect better crowd control, because having people standing so close to the track it wasn't very safe .. anyone not paying attention (or a child) could easily have been knocked down.</p>

              <p>Wah smart idea. I should have thought of that too lol. I also wanted to go back on the last day to take better pics with my fren's 8.1 megapixel camera coz I used my lousy 3.2 megapixel handphone camera when I went there on Sunday, but in the end didn't go.</p>
              <p>Were the cars loaded up on trucks after the event?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ya they load up most of the cars onto the truck,the rest they drove off. The best part is to see the Superamerica being push onto the truck, at first some one wanted to drive it to the truck but that car cant be driving due to some technical difficaulties. Another was the Daytona, when it was being revved,tonnes of white smoke came out of the exhaust pipe almost making me to faint when i stand near it lol.</p></div>
