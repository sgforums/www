What I can say is that it probably has slightly eased the problem on the road ERP is being implemented on.<br><br>However, this alleviation of this problem obviously will cause a congestion on the alternate routes. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that.<br><br>So what I can say is that on roads where ERP is implemented, I believe that there is an easing of the congestion there. Not solved, just eased. By how much I cannot tell unless someone give me a counter and pay me to stand at the gantry there to count the number of vehicles passing by duing the ERP period.<br><br>The thing is I feel that big brother sees the congestion at alternate routes due to the ERP as a separate problem from the one they set out to solve in the first place and shouldn't be placed in the same room of discussion. They are either can't be bothered or just not capable enough to come out with creative solutions to act on the root of the problem.</div>
