For your info, majority of the Hyundai Getz bodykits are fabricated by them (much more cheaper and good workmanship)<br><br><strong>Another gd things abt kelisa is the moving off or pick up is fast but Picanto move off or Pickup is slower.</strong><br>Ans: As far as I know, kelisa is much more lighter than Picanto. Also take note of the engine design of kelisa, 3 cylinders with DOHC. Well, what can you say? Plus point for Kelisa.....hehehe....<br><br><strong>But i think i should say kelisa tense to have a bit more of vibration compare to Picanto.</strong><br>Ans: Because of the engine design of kelisa, stronger vibration is expected!
