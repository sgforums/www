I suppose you can choose your own insurance company for cheaper rate (not much difference)...1st time buyer for kalisa should be less than $1400 per year for ntuc insurance..at the age of 29 to 30...btw road tax for kalisa is ard $500 per year i think. fc is ard 15km/l ....hope this helps...</div>

I spent at least 6k cash to get my car....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but you should always book at least 2 months before your desired date to collect the car<br><br>I waited 2 weeks for the coe bid, another 1 month for the car to be delivered to SG, another 1 week for them to fix the IU, do the paint work and fix the leather seats and sport rim. For Kelisa, some parts are made in SG like leather seats, some paint work etc. If you want your desired colour, book early... I think the colors for kelisa are limited in the batches. that means, maybe one batch has only 5 blues, 5 reds, 10 silvers etc etc.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
