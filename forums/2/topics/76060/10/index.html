I follow the manual instruction, basically it's 1st gear to 20km/h max, 2nd gear to 30km/h, 3rd gear to 50km/h, 4th gear to 70km/h and go easy on 5th gear for cruising. Though I am always rushing, I do not drive exceeding 95km/h till now. I also have this habit of putting to neutral on down slope and couple hundred metres before stopping. As i mentioned earlier, I wish my fish could pick up speed a little quicker though...</div>
