Do provide them with as much details as possible, that asshole's car REG number, venue, time and car details. If u have....his IC number as well.  E ven if he did not give u his IC....car reg no good enough already. Did u have any witnesses with u?<br><br>In any case your insurance company may request u to send your car to IDAC for evaluation.....and should initiate claims against that idiot's policy once the documentation and repair work is done.</div>
