Pros and Cons. $13k for 2 1/2 years means about $5.5k per year. that's alot, for a old car, irregardless if its a levin. The market price for Truenos and Levins in Singapore are set by the owners themselves. If not for InitialD, these cars don't worth more than probably $1-2k above paper, (depending on condition) JiaYong had his car at about $9k above paper. And is deprec. at about almost $4k a year too. But at least its renewable. Honestly because JiaYong probably isn't in good terms with that Levin and gang, he is defensive with his Trueno.<br><br>But if you really want a Levin, because its rare then it may be a good choice. You can put yourself in a mind that this ride is only for your next 2 1/2 years, and you can enjoy all you want, without worrying about future maintaince. As long as the car still runs, that's all it matters, because at the end of the day, the car will be scrapped. Those whose car is to renewed after 10years, have to maintain in good condition, so to be able to sell off in future.<br><br>But bear in mind, you have to folk out $13k cash.

Do not shit-stir any words into other people's mouth and get your facts right!<br><br>And you're one POS that word have been going around that you have given a cheque as a deposit for an AE86 and because of last minute change of mind on your side, you cancelled the cheque that is already handed over.

The levin was sold to a regular customer of my mech too. Thus we are one whole group that get together very often.<br><br>My first reply was harsher cos I thot you were looking at another 86. That 86 is not worth that price in my opinion.<br><br>He is right. I paid $8K above paper value for my car. COE expired within 2 weeks and i had to pay $30K for COE thus making my car a total cost of $38K.<br>Thus making it a $3.8K  depreciation a year.</div>
