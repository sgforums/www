To get better sound effect, you need to adjust the 'fad' to at least -2 or -3. This will balance the output and not cause too mush nuisance to rear passengers.

Most sales staff would not volunteer such info unless you direct them. You need to check out with other dealer first to ascertain the best value for your export then ask the SE to seek for same if not better. He would probably ask for a token commission which I think is reasonable. Yes , the SE accepted my full LTA paper rebate value for new registration.<br><br></div>
