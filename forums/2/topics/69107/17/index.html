At one point of time, i almost drop the idea of buying altis, if it come only with wooden trimmings.

However, it's wiser to make an appointment with the BM service dept first. They will inspect and replace the parts if available otherwise will notify you by mail upon receiving the parts from thailand. My previous experience to replace the steering wheel was processed in this sequence. If you are thinking of going to the leng kee service centre, the executive-in-charge is Aaron. Should you encounter any stubborn service officer who gives you lots of excuses, do not hesitate to ask for Aaron. He is very helpful.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just came from malaysia yesterday. drove 800km altogether. did not really drive fast enuf to stretch my 1.6l altis. max i reached was 140 km/h. but still felt quite stable at that speed except when there were strong winds, then had to be very careful with the steering which is quite sensitive. noise level ok. had to turn on the ECT mode all the time for power during overtaking. otherwise the pickup is not good enuf on malaysian roads.<br><br>altis is not a common car in malaysia. saw only abt 5 malaysian altis during my 4-day stay. saw a 1.8l spore altis too. my FC is abt 14 km/l in malayisa. the ride is confortable overall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>altis owners, i haf a little question to ask.... i find the interior of the altis really appealing in terms of space.... but a bit worried dat could the body of the altis be a bit too heavy for the 1.6l engine since cars of the same capacity seems so much smaller then altis where the interior is concerned...<br><br>still remember haf tis fren who bought a 2nd hand mitsubishi lancer 1.3l but haf a body of 1.6l.... his car got a lot of probs an keep going into the workshop.... scared the same prob may happen to altis as well.....<br><br>any advise?</div>
