Only down side is lesser power. As long as you service your car regularly should not have any side effect on engine. All my friends driving 2000cc cars are using 95 (more cost effective on bigger car).<br><br>Just my own opinion... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to answer the question on what is "Pinging" and how it sounds like....<br><br>it sounds like marbles in the engine, but ur ICE has to be turned off as the "ping" sound is very soft in my case, u actually need to concentrate to pick it up....<br><br>"ping" could happen when:<br><br>1. Lower octane fuel is used<br>2. may happen with light throttle, usually with full throttle as what i described above when I do sudden depression of my accelerator pedal<br>3. Compression Ratio too high &amp; ignition timing too advanced (highly unlikely  in our case)<br><br>I think our ALTIS has knock sensors to counter the "pinging" problem...anyone can confirm if knock sensors are present?</div>
