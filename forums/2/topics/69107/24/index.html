After opening the doors and letting the heat out, you can drive straightaway. It also helps to filter out the UV which would also cause harm to interior upholstery.<br>Furthermore, I added the front windscreen 10" anti-glare.</div>

I have seen and call some advertised on newspapers as low as $300. It is really a difficult choice, but you pay for what you get, and I find that this investment is worthwhile for human and car protection. I noticed that the windows of the G9 corolla indicates UV - might be able to filter UV, but not on the Altis. I think if you go to Huper direct, the Quote is $900 for the premier. Cheaper films might just be tints, and worst is that you might fail the visible light transmission test, because I don't understand why some cars are so dark, you cannot even see the ppl inside. So far, I am pretty satisfied with Huper. During drives on sunny days, you do not feel the direct heat on you. It will lessen the load on the air-con as well.</div>

Was thinking of switching but would be such a waste throwing it away as the trade-in is low (unless someone has a better package).

No spoiler/rims/side visor/rear visor added.<br></div>
