In the last two COE bidding, the number of bidding for the cat A COE seems to be dwindling.  I am looking at the overbidding for the past few biddings to see if there is a demand for cars.  And when you see that there is a high number of over subscribed ie more bids than COE allocated, you know that demand is more than supply and the COE prices will tend to move up and vice versa.  The trend for the past few biddings are :<br><br>Mar 1st bidding 600 over subscribed   $24,597<br>Mar 2nd bidding 700 over subscribed  $24,940<br>Apr 1st bidding 1450 over subscribed   $26,689<br>Apr 2nd bidding 1100 over subscribed  $27,564<br>May 1st bidding 600 over subscribed    $27,507<br>May 2nd bidding 300 over subscribed   $27,501<br><br>I am hoping that people are holding off their purchase and we will see a reverse trend to bring the COE down.  Hopefully, the recent optimistic news released by the government and the improved sentiment will not cause people to panick and rush in to buy cars thinking that COE will go up.  And I think people nowadays are getting more cautious with money and are more prudent.<br><br>If you do not need a car urgently, why not wait and see?  But that is just my personal opinion.  If you have the means to lock in at the current price, by all means as I think the prices of COE would probably fall by just 2 to 3 thousands if it ever come down.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Its about 20% quieter than branded continental tyres. I used it for my previous corolla and was thoroughly satisfied.  As for the rim, much depends on your budget. My friend traded in his original 14" rims and tyres (after travelling 1500km) and got the 4x15" rims and Yokohama tyres for $300+. Not quite sure where he got it from but it should not differ very much. I have no plans to change mine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone, newbie here....jus booked my altis yest..due end july..so long....haha. anyway wad freebies or discounts did u guys get wif urs? managed to wrangle out an offer for vkool from the BM agent, she's offering us a choice of either vkool or huper optic for $200, seems rather good to me wad do u guys tink? but anyway just wanted to know wich one would be better, from the catalogues at the BM showroom seems huper is more ex compared to vkool (950 comapred to 850) but vkool is more established i guess. have also gotten some opinions from friends that huper is rather good, so just need some advice about wich one to choose, anyone have used both b4 or have some experience? dunno wich one would be a better choice.... cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
