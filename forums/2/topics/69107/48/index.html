            <div class='col-md body'>The 3M mat the last i knew could be got from Bukit Batok (apologies that I do not have the address anymore), apparently the shop does a custom cut for you...good deal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I am using Korean mats, which are exactly identical to 3M (thickness n softness), cut to size with velcro on the bottom. These were given FOC by my SE.<br><br>For Audio stuffs, 2nd stuffs, you may visit the links provided by our forumer in the earlier posts, else a good place would be sim lim square, but you will have to DIY or have it fitted by some installer. I do not think an upgrade of the Audio system would void the entire vehicle warranty, but probably on the Audio section only. I have changed my front speakers to CDT HD62, disabled my rear speakers, carried over my Pioneer HU and JL Audio 12" Sub from my previous ride.<br></div>
