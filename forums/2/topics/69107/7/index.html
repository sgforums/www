But I dont think BM is obligated to give you the 3.2K rebate. They just simply earn more profit after the govt change to 110%. only pass back partial of saving back to consumer. maybe you can explain more so that those that are buying an Altis know what to look out for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

OMV of car is 1.6K, so 20% reduction is 3.2K lor.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REVIEW 1.</strong></span><br><br>Ok ok my turn to contribute some reviews. I just got my car last week. Its the Deluxe version. Interior is quite elegant and classy. Nice steering wheel. But the leather color only comes in light bedge. will have to take extra care...sigh. Having the MP3 is great. Long playing hours with one single disc. Can forget the CD Changer.<br><br>Altis is heavier than my trade-in nissan sunny 99. It's firm and steady when big buses speed pass you. Engine wise is very responsive and powerful, no doubt about that. Guess i won't be activating the ECT mode. Sound level is acceptable to me. Steering and brakes might be too sensitive. Will need time to get used to it. and i still not used to the drive seat. can't really rest my head. And there's a level on left side to lower and raise spine support. Anyone used that? Feels funny.<br><br>Compare to Nissan, Altis has no Auto-Lock. Must constantly remind myself to lock all doors while driving. And it's higher, can slide in and out easily. It's also slightly longer, i think. No sure about the roofing yet. Will see how when it rains.<br><br>Great pleasure driving Altis. I think it's a reasonable quality family car build in Toyota Thailand. So far i can't find any traces of "build in thailand" quality in the car.....except for the price...$70K.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REVIEW 2</strong></span><br><br>Don't like the sound of the audio speakers. Sounds too muffy and unclear. Had lower the bass but doesn't help much. Good thing is there's no radio antenna. No worries when entering car washing bay.<br><br>Was going at 130km/h at TPE. Can feel there's still room for acceleration. That i'll have to go for the NorthSouth Highway to find out. Wind noise is moderate. Like any Japanese car. Stability is still ok due to it's weight. one hand on steering is still manageable. But then as i said before, steering is mighty sensitive, so becareful.<br><br>One thing i notice that i usually park the car in the sun without shelter. And comparing to my previous Nissan, the Altis interior roof<br>is carpet like. And it's not as HOT.<br><br>The car booth door seems very light and thin. Must really swing down to close it.<br><br>Other gadgets like frontseat roof lights and more front compartment spaces are delights to the driver.<br><br></div>
