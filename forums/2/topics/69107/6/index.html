            <div class='col-md body'>Congrats to those who just got their new Altis!<br><br>This 2K rebates are a bit fishy. Are they trying to get rid of the current stock cause a new Altis is on the way? The Altis has been in Malaysia since 2001, and The Star in Malaysia ever mentioned recently that a new Altis is coming in mid year. There were some discussions on this in the M'sia forum but most dismissed it as reporting error.<br><br>Anyway, I still love my current Altis. For the new Altis owner, welcome to to the club.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>got my car last Sunday, the metallic dark grey color. No regrets in choosing this color. It is beautiful. As for the price, got it for $70,581(inclusive of the side skirting). Skirting not fitted yet, SE explain stock not available. Should be installed during the 1000km servicing.<br>This car is great as all present and coming Altis owners will agree. So much better in terms of engine performance, cabin interior and driving. The cabin is so quiet as compare to my old 98 Nissan Sunny. Altis is great!<br>Fitted Huper Optik on the car. For those who have not, please do it, it is good.<br>Only complaint I have are the front and back speakers. They look and sound miserable and cheap. Sound not that great. Anyone know of a shop to upgrade the speakers? Am very apprehensive to just go to any car audio shop to change the speakers, afraid they might mishandle the seats or door panels when removing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Eg, COE bid need 10k, rule by gov. Therefore we hv to pay upfront 10K to BM.<br><br>Car loan is 90%/ 10%, and if the car price with coe is 70K, (loan will be 90% = 63k, downpayment 10% = 7K), therefore BM will return to you the 3 K after two months. ( 10K COE bid - 7K 10% downpayment). If this is true, then should not call rebate, but return . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  After all is the return of your money, not discount/ rebate.<br><br>2 cent worth<br><br></div>

No regrets in choosing this color. It is beautiful. As for the price, got it for $70,581(inclusive of the side skirting). Skirting not fitted yet, SE explain stock not available. Should be installed during the 1000km servicing.<br>This car is great as all present and coming Altis owners will agree. So much better in terms of engine performance, cabin interior and driving. The cabin is so quiet as compare to my old 98 Nissan Sunny. Altis is great!<br>Fitted Huper Optik on the car. For those who have not, please do it, it is good.<br>Only complaint I have are the front and back speakers. They look and sound miserable and cheap. Sound not that great. Anyone know of a shop to upgrade the speakers? Am very apprehensive to just go to any car audio shop to change the speakers, afraid they might mishandle the seats or door panels when removing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Hi, how much did u pay for the huper optik? got any idea how is it compared to V-kool?<br><br></div>

But I dont think BM is obligated to give you the 3.2K rebate. They just simply earn more profit after the govt change to 110%. only pass back partial of saving back to consumer. maybe you can explain more so that those that are buying an Altis know what to look out for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
