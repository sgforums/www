            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all Altis owners,<br>Here are 2 pics which I took for my car for the Singtel Charity Drive to Penang. The journey is damn long and tiring but it was fun.<br>Some experiences to share with you all abt driving the Altis.<br>1) I clocked 462km at half tank at 120km/h.<br>2) Upon driving up to penang, the car doesn't have that stable feeling when I'm driving at 120-130 km/h. The steering starts to vibrates. After 1 hr or so, it starts to get stable and smoother.<br>3) The max speed I tried was 155km/h (at abt 3600rpm). My wife said that it's too fast, so I reduced to 120-130km/h.<br>4) On my way back from Penang, I was doing at 130-140km/h. The car just gets better, the engine noise isn't to loud but the wind noise is. The handling is good. Glad that I bought the Altis.<br>5) Overall, I clocked abt 1600km for the whole trip. Now can go for the 5000km servicing.<br><img><br><img><br></div>

The thing is that you have gotta spend time on your computer to compile it. So you know 150 tracks is like 10+ CDs???? and you get to have your fav tracks.. not too bad i would say. I dunno about the quality of sound though, have never sat in one with the CD changer though.</div>

The hard way. For manual, warm up ur engine full then use 2nd gear drag to 3/4 of ur rpm meter. Then release the acelerator let engine brake take place. Do this for 3 times, then follow buy 3 gear and 4th gear.<br>For auto i am not sure how. Some people believes that the engine is already run in at factory.<br>But it all boils down to which way u believes in.</div>

U mean the mp3 songs that are burnt can only be played by a mp3 player or the computer but NOT an ordinary CD player. Is that what you are tryin to say?? Thanks.</div>
