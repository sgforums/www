            <div class='col-md body'>The Altis is as heavy as many Conti cars, if not heavier.<br>Selection of good tyres may depend more on:<br>- quality of rubber used (some say tyres of same brand made in Europe better than Thai or M'sia in terms road noise. Not so sure abt this)<br><br>- wet grip vs road noise (new technology may produce tyres of good grips on wet condition yet with minimal low noise. I read in some forums that Yokohama Aspec DB or AVS is one of them. There may be others)<br><br>- durability of tyres (some tyres 'run out' faster than others. Yokohama is also one of them)<br><br>- lifespan of tyres (must not exceed 5 years storage. Need to check production date of tyres)<br><br>- Road condition (can say Sin roads are generally 'softer' than Malaysian roads)<br><br>- of course, price of tyres<br><br>Comments from others most welcomed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I just got my Altis 1.6 last week. Previously, I was driving G9 XLi.<br>Here are some differences between these two rides:<br>1. Altis is more powerful. Probably this is due to the difference in engines of 1.6 and 1.5<br>2. Altis is a smoother ride than the G9.<br>3. Altis is quieter than the G9. My colleague who is driving the a.6 G9 can feel and hear the difference in the quietness.<br>4. Altis does not give me the "floating" feeling when turning corners.<br>5. Altis has ECT which G9 does not have.<br><br>Exterior:<br>1. Altis looks longer probably due to the sleek exterior as compared to G9. Some said corolla has a successful diet regime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>2. Both Altis and G9's boots are difficult to close. I have to give an extra force in order to close the boots. But this has been resolved when I sent the rides for servicing.<br>3. The headlights are different<br>4. The front grilles are different<br>5. The tail lights are different<br><br>Interior:<br>1. The interior is not much difference between Altis and G9 1.6 models.<br>2. Both have climate control (G9 1.6 model and Altis)<br>3. Both have the same leather seats and woodgrain<br>4. The dashboard lights are different.<br>5. The gear box of Altis 1.6 and G9 is the same.<br>6. Altis is slightly more spacious than G9.<br><br>In a nutshell, both rides are really good cars and i have no regrets driving them around.<br><br>Say, what about we arrange an outing? Any interested?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
