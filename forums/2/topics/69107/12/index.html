Maybe that is what i miss the most.<br><br>Previous  city 2000' is very uncomfortable car, i always complaint to friends the roaring engine noise. Sometimes, i think noise insulation was not consider at all when built.  Handling is worst. Float at high speed, roll like sampan during corner. The engine vibration can be feel inside cabin, even at idling! . The material(plastic) used is poor(weak joint), rattling noise are everywhere.<br><br>But I have to admit that the Vtec engine is good. No matter how hard i drove(40k mileage per year, drove frequent to Penang criuse 140 km/h with 1 stop for refuel only), the engine just never fail. Infact , i got so confident that i rarely check engine coolant and battery water.<br><br>Overall City vs Atlis, Atlis is the best car. Most comfortable car compare to all my previous car. And i am proud to own an altis.<br><br>I changed K&amp;N filter and I am thinking to change to denso iradium. Thus, i hope gain more power for my altis.<br><br></div>

LTA rule is 70% visibility for the front and 50% for the rear.<br>I was also concerned about this rule. So, i asked the boss to use the same type of visibility detector to check on my the front and rear.<br>Result is front is only 68%, which is fail as it is below the LTA rule. However, later the boss shows me a letter which was a reply from LTA. The letter explained that they give tolerance of -/+5% on the 70% visibility. He added that if LTA does question on this tolerance, he will then bring the letter to the LTA officer. Well, i think V-Cool did their homework before selling for 10 years in singapore. I am satisfact with them.</div>
