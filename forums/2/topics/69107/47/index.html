            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I would like to confirm the function of the passengers' window lock feature. If the window lock button is pressed, understand that all 3 passengers' window will not work. How about the 3 passengers' window control switch at the driver side, will they also not work when the lock button is pressed? Currently mine will not work. Is this normal?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div>
