            <div class='col-md body'>Go to the police station and lodge a police report against the IO, then do what tailslide asked you to do. If you think that the police officer is abusing him powers. This is not within the power of a MP well unless your MP happens to be minister of internal affairs. Since it is already a court summon it is highly unlikely that the police will take out the charges against you by merely the words of a MP.<br><br>Use of words is very important in any case, and you may have misunderstood the IO's meaning of forcing you into admission. He can only advise you on the charges and give recommendation. If he goes beyond his power like forcing you to sign it will be abusive of power. This is highly unlikely to happen in Singapore however, there are always black sheeps among every organisations.<br><br>Assisting or driving without a licences will have a charge varying from fines to imprisonment. A suspension on driving will also be impose for the two of you if both are to be found guilty.<br><br>Anyway, good luck to you.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously i feel that since the car is not moving, then it shouldn't be so serious, as theoretically you ain't considered to be driving. i don't know abt the law, maybe they can say that since the engine is on, then you pose a danger to not just yourself and the other road users. in fact you shouldn't have been taken in by the TP IO, should have taken a strong stand on the truth. so at least still can argue abt you not moving the car at all, and have no intention at all to do so. perhaps you can tell all these to your MP, and be as humble &amp; innocent as possible.<br><br>best wishes &amp; good luck. what matters now is to remain cool-headed, so you can handle things well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>try saying that u din have the idea to drive and was juz trying shift the gear to familiarise with it. as the handbrake was not up the car did or did not move by a little when u try to depress the clutch down u not sure. but under the pressing for statement and the two ways the police gave u as the minor fine or charging,u admited the car did move, but it was not as u were stepping on gas but only rolling due to uneven road.</div>

Car isn't moving. TP approach the car.<br>Not carpark, just a secluded place, maybe a park or something.<br><br>Anyway, for this case, I think the best is still the lawyer, can ask him to appeal for leniency. I guess the fault is yours, cause how are you going to prove the car isn't moving. TP can always argue your BF pull the handbrake when he approaches. The case is super-against you, plus the fact that you actually admit it in the first place. What to do, cause it is serious to drive without license.<br><br>Singapore's law, guilty until proven otherwise. Don't if true a not???</div>
