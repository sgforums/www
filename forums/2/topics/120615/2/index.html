            <div class='col-md body'>So, next time when any of u are faced with similar problems. Hold ur stand strongly and don't admit to anything u did not do, no matter what they do, they can't convict u. Bring it to court, make the matter big, u will not admit to things u did not do. That's 1 of my advices.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Ask friends or relatives for any lawyer contacts (better if they are lawyers themselves), and maybe they can give you some free consultation/recommendation first.<br><br>I don't know if this is feasible, but you could try going to any police station and making a complaint against the TP IO.

For my bf, he have asked around but no one could help us.<br><br>Sad to say, his father is suffering from kidney failure and have to go through dialysis 3x per week. He is the only one in family who support his father medical expenses. He don't have much saving, the only good thing is their NKF application just get approval recently.<br><br>Money wise, we dont have much... we cant afford to pay so much for the legal advice n proceeding. If only a minimal amount perhaps I still could afford.<br><br>I just started working not long ago and currently still pursuing my further study (part-time) which is self-financing. So... i definitely wont be able to hire reputable lawyer.<br><br>I'm thinking of trying my luck to talk to Mr Subash and see whether he could help me with a very minimal charges. He maynot agree but at least I try all the possibilities.<br><br>I may want to seek media help as well, if i have no other ways to solve this matter... I will try my best to see how I could go about getting media help as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello ,<br><br>Your time to contact Subash too short liao if your are appearing in 2 weeks time. As I think he has quite alot of cases outstandin for him. Inaddtional, If I not mistaken most of the upper class people engage him to fight, in addtional, we often see him in the news for cases like capital cases (Hangin cases).<br><br>I should not say anymore of the empathise words. An IO or a DPP is to press charges, that's their job. But by admitting something you never do is askng them charging you for nothing. Worse, you have made the statements. I believe in your words.<br><br>Don't worry, I have seen many cases, that even complainant turn against their statements made in the station. Let alone you are the accused (someone still innocent before judgement is passed from the court). If you are positively sure, engage a lawyer to advise you what you should do against statements made during threaten, unclear mind...etc..<br><br>I can tell you are a timid person, so appearin in court will be another great preparation you have to made. Do not be frighten by the looks and atmosphere of the courtroom, cisco, DPP..etc.. They will ask you if your are pleading guilty in your First Mentioned. Remember, if you do not, DPP might pressed on the statement that you made in the police station (if you did not change the statement), Court will be adjourned for next hearing date for investigatings the undue pressure you have signed on the statements.<br><br>You must be prepared to lose money.. honestly cannot help on this. I meant on a good lawyer or a medium lawyer.. cases on your records that you are afraid to drive from the practical lesson cancellation can be fetched as court evidence showing you have a phobia for driving. But of course vice-versa can be used as evidence against you too depending how good your lawyer can twist the facts.<br><br>MP as far as i understand can only help you to lessen the verdict if your BF is the only person supporting his aged father who is ill.<br><br></div>

But my luck was really down, the TP came and took our particulars.<br><br>A month later, I was asked to go to their HQ for interview... separately from my bf. I told the story from beginning till the end and I told nothing but the truth. Then the TP, force me to admit that I'm driving (the car is moving) by keep repeating the same question and threaten me that if I continue to be so stubborn... he will drag me to court. I'm a very timid person in nature, and was really scared and don't know what to do. He assured me that if I admit, the worst scenario is just a fine case as it is just a very small and minor issue. But if i continue to persist on my true story, the problem will blow-up and they will charge me to court.<br><br>Foolish me, admitted that the car is moving despite it is not moving.
