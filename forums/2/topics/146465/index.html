But wheather the models in SA gets delivered to our shores is another question.

Rather, I think you can only settle for a VW Passat 1.8T, Saab 9-3 or a Volvo S60 2.0T. 3 series, C class and A4 are priced way above 130k fyi. 320i is already priced beyond the 150k region and likewise for C180. A4 might be slightly cheaper but I do not think the difference is much. IMHO, I would think the S60 2.0T is a good buy. However, if you do have extra money to spare then the T5 would make a solid choice at 150k.</div>
