Nothing great. Same goes for GM-&gt;Saab, Ford-&gt; Jaguar, chrysler-&gt; Mercedes.  Volkswagen-&gt; Audi.<br></div></blockquote>Please tell me you are not the kind of person who won't buy an Armani shirt just because it doesn't have the logo slapped across the chest like a neon sign.<br><br>There are still people out there who buys cars for reliability, quality as well as aesthetic reasons, and not because they are spending $160k and they HAVE to buy a continental car for bragging rights.<br><br>Lexus is ranked number one in the world for reliability.<br>http://www.varoomvroom.com/jd-power-dependability-results-are-out-3906<br><br>Now, to the original poster,<br><br>First, we have to compare apples to apples. The Rx-8 is not in the same class as the IS250 / IS350. The BMW 330 and the Mercedes C350 are.<br><br>The interior IS exceeds the 3-series, in my opinion - by quite a bit. To me, Lexus has put the quality of the IS interior up towards the level of the larger sedans from Audi and Mercedes. The leather on the seats, wood trim and steering wheel is super soft and feels of very high quality. You have to start reaching down to waist level or below to find any hard materials. The interior of the 3 series feels cheap, and plasticky. And plastic do not last long.<br><br>BMW and Mercedes are filled with electrical gremlins and the cars are ALWAYS in the shop with problems. I can drive the Lexus free from worries.<br><br>IMO, the only thing that BMW 3 series exceeds the Lexus IS is the handling.<br>And yes i have test driven both in the circuit many many times. If you like the feel of the road, get the BMW. If you like the luxury floaty feeling, do not want to hear the roaring of an exhaust or feel every bump there is on the road, get the Lexus. Mercedes also has the luxury feeling but like i said, it fairs the worst in terms of reliability.<br><br>The IS250 which is powered by a 2.5L V-6 and is available with: RWD/auto, RWD/manual, and AWD/auto. The IS350 is powered by a 3.5L V-6 engine and is only available as RWD with an automatic transmission.<br><br>The 3.5L V-6 in the IS350 makes 306 horsepower at 6400 rpm and 277 lb-ft of torque at 4800 rpm. These numbers exceed the BMW 330's output by 52 horsepower and 57 lb-ft, respectively.<br><br>AND not to mention the Lexus IS250/350 is one of the smartest car out there now. It has owner's recognition features. You walk near the car, the light on the underside of the side mirror lights up and the door unlocks by itself. ALL WITH YOUR KEY IN YOUR POCKET. Not forgetting push button start,  navigation, the cruising  proximity radar where the car slows down by itself if the car in front comes too near you while on cruise mode, the reverse camera, the IPOD integration system, the Bluetooth system for your phone, etc etc.<br><br>Now tell me why on earth shouldn't I buy the Lexus IS250 and to gladly give up the rights to say I drive a BMW or Mercedes?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess you are a Lexus fan....... But also on the price commitment, the IS250 is only comparable with BMW 320i. So for money worth, it should be the IS250. No doubt about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
