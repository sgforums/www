Yes, I just collected my car yesterday. I love it totally! I was a BM fan but not for long, not becos the car is not gd but rather, i detest the way they 'lay-long' their car. More often than not, they slashed $$ and I felt sorry for the BM owners who bought their cars when first launched. Anyway, there will definitely be a no of readers here debate on the choices of car, most imptly, u've test drive the car and get the feel of it. Lexus hardly known as 'bad car'. So I dont think that shld be your main concern.<br><br>Oh btw, you cannot compare a IS250 and RX8. Its two different types of car you are talking abt here. If you are thinking of BMW, perhaps a 323?</div>

I dont drive everyday so i cant comment much on the consumption. As for a V6 engine, pls do not assume the consumption is low.. likewise for RX8 on a rotary engine. What did your wife comment on IS250? Why dont she like it? Well there are many who claimed that Lexus is not worth paying bcos its a jap car, for this price you can get a continental car easily. I can tell from your message that your wife like a sporty looking car. Well of course, a coupe/cab is gd for a 2nd car in the family OR without children. In long run, im very sure your wife will appreciate a sedan unless you have the intention to get a 2nd car. Whatever the decision is, your choice has to please both parties most imptly, get a more friendly car to your needs. My bf is driving a roaster.. but again, thats fine with us cos we both have cars. Ive driven a coupe for a short period of time, it looks nice and sporty but again, i realised i need a bigger car.<br><br>Go for a test drive with your wife, ask your wife to try it instead.</div>

Think it's one of the prettiest car in its class. There's only 2 things that I don't really like in the new IS250. One, the dash. Two, the 16" rims (if you're looking at the standard variant). The back seats are tight but which car in this Junior Exec Class isn't? If you prefer a bigger rear legroom, I suggest you look at the BMW 3-series or Audi A4.<br><br>If you do decide to get the IS250, you can look for Irene (@Leng Kee, Lexus). Very nice and helpful lady. I got my GS300 from her through a friend's recommendation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Trogen and Nox,<br><br>Yes, lexus is just a branding by toyota to enter to the luxury car market. which by far have been very sucessful in both market position as well as technological advancement.<br><br>Toyota=Lexus=toyota however corrolla ? is250 ? camry ? GS300<br><br>I previously assume that the Mark-X is a is250 but if you scutinise the specs you would realised they are basically sharing only the engine and transmission. Almost bought one but went for the IS instead.<br><br>I have nothing against toyota or parallel imports, my last car was a 2.4 harrier. only because I know the PI.<br><br>To my knowledge, with the break-away of lexus from toyota last year. Lexus will be available as Lexus in Japan market for the first time. And parallel importer will no longer be able import the "sister" car.<br><br>FYI: when asked what I drive, I always say TOYOTA.</div>
