              <p>Wah, really sympathise with you, sometimes such drivers like to do such reckless stunts and endanger everyone on the road. But glad you are ok because it could have been worse. Think very difficult to proof the van did hit you unless you have witness who are willing to testify for you, otherwise very difficult. If the damage to your vehicle is slight, ie cosmetic, you might find that it would be more viable to repair the damage at outside workshop instead of claiming own insurance, as premium will be affected.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>However you mention that you dont have the car, so presumably in the workshop, care to share with us the extent of your damages?</p>

              <p>haiya, with increasing number of vehicles on the road, chances of bumping around will also increase.</p>
              <p>just wondering, since it was a cabstar which i believe is a lorry, a car can easily give chase till it comes to a stop? did you try and lose the lorry or didn't even chase?</p>
              <p>also, any experienced drivers here to give advice on what to do during such incident?</p>

              <p>the cabstar refers to the Nissan Cabstar which is a lorry, and not literally aÂ CABstar as in taxi. The taxis in singapore which are nissan is probably the Nissan Cedric.</p>
