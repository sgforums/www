              <p>ALMOST every night, Ms Nurliah Sulaiman would sit on a bench outside
              her Yishun HDB block chit-chatting with fiance Muhammad Anis Kamsani.</p>
              <p>But their get-together proved fatal on Saturday night when a
              driver lost control of her car while reversing and rammed into the
              couple, according to witnesses.</p>
              <p>The vehicle uprooted the metal bench and drove it back 10m before finally coming to a stop.</p>
              <p>While Miss Nurliah, 23, was flung to the side, her fiancee was pinned under the Toyota Corolla.</p>
              <p>Paramedics arrived at Block 221 in Yishun Street21 before
              midnight, but there was little they could do. Mr Muhammad Anis, 26, was
              dead minutes later.</p>
              <p>Yesterday afternoon, just a few hours after being discharged
              from hospital, Miss Nurliah bade a final farewell to her fiance at the
              Muslim cemetery in Lim Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>With her swollen face bandaged and her eyes covered by dark
              glasses, she sobbed quietly as she poured water over his grave.</p>
              <p>Miss Nurliah choked back tears when she met The Straits Times later at the accident site.</p>
              <p>'We chose this place because it was quiet and we had our
              privacy,' she said. 'I still cannot believe that this is where Anis was
              taken away from me.'</p>
              <p>His younger brother Muhammad Faizal Kamsani, 24, said the family was at a loss over the accident.</p>
              <p>'They were just sitting there on the bench, talking. We have no
              idea how the car could suddenly ram into them. Everything is a big
              question mark.'</p>
              <p>The driver, a woman in her 40s, is assisting police with their investigations.</p>
              <p>The accident shocked residents of the quiet Yishun block.</p>
              <p>Mr Ahmad Redwan, 44, who lives just above the accident site,
              said he rushed downstairs after hearing a loud crash sometime before
              midnight on Saturday. He said Mr Muhammad Anis was pinned under the car
              and screaming in pain.</p>
              <p>'He could focus for a few minutes but after that he starting slipping away,' he said.</p>
              <p>Eyewitnesses said the driver was in a daze when she exited the car. She is believed to live in the neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>Miss Nurliah was bloodied but conscious.</p>
              <p>'Even though she was in pain, she was pointing to her boyfriend to tell us to help him,' said Madam Faridah Kamisah, 50.</p>
              <p>Mr Muhammad Anis worked as a furniture mover and also helped
              out at a food stall run by his parents. He would meet Miss Nurliah
              after she finished work as an assistant nurse at the National
              University Hospital.</p>
              <p>Miss Nurliah said they would then cycle together to a multi-purpose court outside her block to chat on the bench.</p>
              <p>The couple had known each other for two years and were planning to get married next year.</p>

              <p>Miss Nurliah said they would then cycle together to a
                  multi-purpose court outside her block to chat on the bench.</p>
              <p>The couple had known each other for two years and were planning
                  to get married next year.</p>
