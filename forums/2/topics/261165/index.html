            <div class='col-md body'>honestly speaking... all professional services that use any products is good..<br><br>but they dont last and cost a huge bomb to get ur car polished by them..<br><br>the advantage is.. they don leave swirl marks on ur car.. ur car looks damn good after entering their workshop..<br><br>but the downside is.. expensive and got to leave car with them for 2-3hrs each time..<br><br>i personally like this product called hi-glaze 88 and it really removes dirt and grime easily..<br><br>after effects of washing the car is very smooth and shiny..<br><br>in the past, i usually go for those nice packaging shampoo+wax.. 3 in 1.. and relatively cheap.. but 1 day i came across this not-so-nice-looking bottle.. decided to try it.. fell in love with it on the first try... heh heh..<br><br>$18 for a small bottle though.. try it 1 time.. and u might not need to part with ur $600..<br><br>btw.. hi-glaze is a shampoo cum wax</div>

BUT it dosent last long, cheap wax, workmanship lously.<br><br>Few weeks ago i tried one at SPC havelock road. It cost $158, damm happy with my car.. maybe cos i never seen my car so white, since i bought it. They using meguire OR 3M.. cant remember. So far so good. I wan to c if it can last for at least 3-4 mths + weekly washing. Then i can said its really good. But for the price, i think its good. Some place tell me $600+, but if not shiny, they will polish for free or something .. well will update in 2 mths time if the thread is still active.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
