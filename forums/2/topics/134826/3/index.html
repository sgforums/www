Is it because you had learnt it in school? I find that most car parks are wide enough for me to park head first.  I think parking head first is faster.</div></blockquote>NEVER NEVER attempt to park head in UNLESS you are left without much choice, i.e tight corners and so on.....<br><br>Why not? well, imagine how many blind spot you have to look out when you are coming out from the lot, versus reverse parking which you need to look at left and right and go.<br><br>I have seen too many cases of backside knocking and near misses from parking head in..........including 2 cars knocking each other's back while coming out!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a habitual practice, I always look for and choose to park in corner lots - parallel or reverse.<br><br>For parallel parking lots, I look for the last one that is either with a curb behind, or a wall or pillar behind in a basement carpark or MSCP. I will park and leave about 3 to 4 feet space behind, so that if someone parks really close to me in front, I can stiill work my way out later. Always make room for yourself to leave later.<br><br>In reverse parking lots, I park as close to the curb or wall as possible, but just enough for me to get out if the wall is on the driver side. Creating a lot of space from the lot next to you, makes provision for people who swing their doors open hard, thus causing a dimple of the side of your car. It sucks. But there are people out there like that.<br><br>I once experienced a Merc parked next to me when I just got out of my car. As I was about to leave, when the rear passenger door swung open and banged against the side of my car. They were a bunch of playful giggling children, and they belonged to the owner of the Merc. The driver looked at me apologetically smiling and apologizing, saying that they are children, and it didn't make any dents. Indeed it made no dents on my car, as it hit the side guards which I installed - large black rubber strips saved the side panel of my cars rear passenger door.<br><br>I didn't kick up a fuss, I inspected my car, then walked away without smiling nor saying a word. The family was Malay, the driver was a man, probably the father. I could hear him scolding the children as I walked away.<br><br>What to do. Children are indeed children. But Van and lorry drivers, aren't children, but some of their sense of responsibility matches that of children's.<br><br>Watch out! Make space!<br><br></div>

I believe you still knows the logic, but does wasn't sure where is where without the poles. Just like reverse park, soon you will find your new reference point and everything becomes easy.</div>
