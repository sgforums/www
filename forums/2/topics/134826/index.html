            <div class='col-md body'>You see, my dismay over women parallel parking or reverse parking, is that I've known some ladies, who have been driving for years and practiced parking for years, and still, when it comes to parking of any manner, they take a pinafully long time and tended to end up too much to either side of the lot she took.<br><br>However, if she parks head-in first, her car would be reasonably parked and less askewed.<br><br>Then, there are those gungho young girls who either have been taking driving lessons from a pro race-driver or have been practicing in some vacant plot of land in Singapore, who can drive and park impressively. Of course without the fancy James Bond moves, but precise, sure, and accurate.<br><br>That should be the way.<br><br>But sometimes, I find them too eager to prove a point on the road; one overtook me without checking what's in front of me and nearly crashed into the car in front of me that was cutting out to center lane too slowly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wat u have witnessed is probably a guy whos a daddy's or mummy's child. If a guy take ages to parallel park, it's not being safe that's on his mind, it just goes to prove that his judgement is poor.<br><br>Remember when we were all L learners ? your instructor always remind us to use agaration to determine how far u go before u turn or counter-turn your steering and to stop? By and far most guys can parallel park quite well, it's juz an in born thing as to gals who can whip up a storm in the kitchen.<br><br>Guys get into accidents becoz of ladies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . U will see them burn down a straight road but when the time comes to make a turn or park, u can spot one from miles away notwithstanding the few very 'cautious' guys.<br><br>The usual debate is there are lady in our own local rally scene so that proves they are on par and driving aint all that bad. Didnt we see our very own rally babe do a turn and broke the whole drive shaft by ramming the whole vehicle at the kerb? Boy were we lucky that it's juz a starlet that's involved and not an evo or wrx. Rally they can but to prove a point, juz let the matter rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My suggestion for those (male or female) who are stlil having trouble executing the right technique to park their vehicles is to add blind spot mirrors to their side view mirrors. These mirrors really help a lot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now a days when most new cars are large SUVs or MPVs, it would be much more appropriate for manufacturers to implement and install radar screens for an arial view of your entire vehicle, entering a parking space.<br><br>In fact, I believe some high-end cars like BMW, Merc., or Jags can be fitted with one on request. But it'll cost another limb...<br><br>Just imagine, not having to strain your eyes and strain that neck trying to use those tiny little spot-mirrors. Instead, you have a glowing LCD screen with green markouts around your vehicle, outlining the space you are attempting to park in.<br><br>And hey, stereotyping women drivers who can't parallel park is common, and besides, ladies always give an empty parallel lot a miss in carparks. Just that a lot of women couldn't get it right, while only a minority of super women can.<br><br>Well, us guys are more mechanically and technically inclined. Hence I believe we are progressing like Windows and are now XP, but nonetheless requires a lot of patching and updates. We aren't perfect as well, being human and all that.<br><br></div>

Many time have I seem cars that are parked at an angle, or worse right in the middle of 2. I also try to park with perfection, but will always wait for others to overtake me first, or do the first turn in quick and adjust when the cars are cleared!</div>
