            <div class='col-md body'>Ok here's my story :<br><br>I was driving through a carpark looking for a carpark lot. Had to stop to wait<br>cos there is a lady in front driving a Lancer, trying to reverse into a parking lot.<br><br>Maybe my presence made her anxious or wat. first time she hit the kerb, 2nd and 3rd and 4th .... and finally she just moved off without parking at all. Maybe paiseh or wat, I dunno. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>After moving off about 20m, she tried to park into another parking lot, I was able to overtake her cos the road was wider here.  I let my sister off, then I parked my car near her. I came out of my car, looked at her reversing in and out at least 5 times before she finally comes out of her car.<br><br>I went over to her car, thinking... hmm could be manual lah cos she take so long..... I peeped over and saw its Auto gear..... then she came back after 5 mins and then drove off....walao eh waste 10mins park then leave after 5 mins <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But I have also seen female drivers doing very tight corners and turns when parking without breaking a sweat. So there are good and bad out there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First... I almost never park head in. Cos its a mess trying to get out of your parking space.  Also, If possible, I never park next to people who park head in. They are just an accident waiting to happen. I dont have any problems with reverse parking at all. I think as long as you look at ur side mirrors enough, there really isnt a problem.<br><br>Err.. Second.. err... however..  I can't parallel park. It's not my fault. They used POLES when they taught me and then... there isn't any POLES when I need to park!!! Parallel parking sends me to tears, especially when I am at crowded areas like Siglap. I KNOW the theory... u know.. backside in.. first.. err. slant.. err rotate watever BUT i just can't estimate the distance.<br><br>I don't care if this proves male superiority - its ok with me. if anything, it just proves that males are superiorly equipped to .. drive women around.. heehee<br><br>Unfortunately almost all the men I've dated can't drive. Sigh. Neither can the husband.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, having been giving much thought over this thread about parallel parking; parallel parking is just basically overtaking the car in front in reverse.<br><br>The only tough part is judging the distance of the other parked car behind.<br><br>As accurate as I can be in writing here, I will attempt to describe parallel parking.<br><br>&gt;&gt; first, I shall position car so that my front passenger door's window<br>is exactly next to the rear passenger window of the car in front of the lot I want to park in. I would also ensure that my car is about one meter away from the car I just positioned next to.<br><br>&gt;&gt; second, I will rotate my steering wheel about one and a half turn without moving yet (hard to do without power steering)<br><br>&gt;&gt; third, I will start to reverse slowly. As reverse begins, I shall be looking at the side mirror at my left bumper corner while I also turn the steering wheel left to match angle. I'll be looking to match the left corner bumper to the curb<br><br>&gt;&gt; fourth, when I see the curb merging with the left corner of my bumper, I will begin to straighten up my steering wheel. At this point, I shall be looking at my left front corner of my car's hood, which by now should begin to line up with the front car's rear c-pillar<br><br>&gt;&gt; fifth, when the steering wheel is exactly straight, I shall monitor the rear view mirror (center mirror hanging from roof) to gauge distance of rear parked car, then start turning steering wheel right slowly to clear the right corner of front car's right corner tail lights/bumper<br><br>&gt;&gt; Sixth, once clear of the front car's right corner tail light/bumper, I shall turn my steering wheel right further until the front of my car is in line with the rear of the car in front, once aligned, I begin to straighten up my steering while still reversing slowly<br><br>&gt;&gt; Seventh, once straightened and totally aligned ( by now the rear of my car should be about less then 1 feet away from the car behind me) I will move forward slowly until the bumper of the car in front is slightly obscured by the hood of my car. That should leave about 3 to 4 feet distance from the car in front and behind, depending on your car this distance can be up to 5 feet if yours is a hatchback or mini car.<br><br>Done.<br><br>Well, the above description works for me. But if you try to follow the above guide, it will totally be at your own risk, and by your own judgement.<br><br></div>
