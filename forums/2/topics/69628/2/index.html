Jerry told me that this model will be in by July.<br><br>The 1000 may be over kill for smaller cars but great for SUVs, it can even be used as a room ionizer.<br><br>Keep it touch with Jerry for new developements as he has just returned from the Hong Kong Electronics show and has many new developements.<br><br>Hope it is helpful.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thanks....</div></blockquote>Hey Bro, the XJ1000 is a very good machine and can be used in a minibus or an room area of 150 sf - and it comes with both the car and electrical adaptor.  Consequently, you can use in the car, get home and plug it in your room also....cool.  The XJ2000 also can.  Only problem with the 1000 is the cleaning is a little more tedious - must remove screws and open up.  But works magically is cars to remove smoke and durian smell or other odours.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> Brothers all beware, SARS on the way back, better be safe.<br><br>The 802 has some special considerations but as I mentioned earlier, the new 802 solves all these problems. Also found that the 802 works better through cable and not batteries....<br><br>Keep the questions coming ok guys ?  Have done good in depth studies on this topic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Jerry just showed me how to clean the unit without opening the 1000.  He has used a new cleaning liquid from the UK which is biodegradable and with no alcohol (so it will not discolour or eat into any plastic sufaces).<br><br>He just put 3 drops onto a cotton bud and cleaned the 1000 from the bottom of the unit.<br><br>I understand he will be soon package this new liquid for sale.  I have already gotten a sample from Jerry and it works magically and is very safe - no need to use gloves and he showed me that he can use it as a hand wash. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
