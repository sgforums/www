            <div class='col-md body'>AQI means Air Quality Index: The <strong>AQI </strong>is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and its effects on you. EPA calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (or particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.<br><br>AQI is a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. An AQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little potential to affect public health, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.<br><br>On the other hand, <strong>PPM </strong>means Parts Per Million, a measure of the concentration of a specific component.<br><br></div>

Been to East Coast Mac and once was at Katong Shopping centre, tat was a long time ago, dun know if it is still around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looked for Roxy square &amp; think I found the shop, it is at the new roxy square II &amp; its located next to Cenosis. Not sure if it si the same place as what halokitty mentioned. I bought a few air ionizers. The air ionizers are very portable and best of all, it is ozone free. It is also free from NOx. Details can be found in their website:  www.pura.com.sg<br>So far so good &amp; I'm more than happy i found this air ionizer.<br></div>
