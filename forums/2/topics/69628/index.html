            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone heard that there is a new Air Ionizer for cars ?  The brand is Neo Tec and the latest model is a very sleek radar detector shape one.  According to my friend, it gets rid of the ciggie smoke and smell and even durian smell.  Was sold in Guardian (Mount Elizabeth) but now no stock.  Apparently the agent is doing a test with about a hundred cab drivers to combat the sars fears ?? Any info will be appreciated.  Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the site but the one shown is the XJ600 which the agents are using for the taxicab tests.  The one my friend bought is the XJ802 which is sleeker and has motion detector.  Dunno about cleaning but he says works like a dream as he has to do long distance driving, he says that the ionizer keeps him alert ?  He bought the unit at S$48.  Any info is appreciated...

            <div class='col-md body'>Exciting news, the ionizer can be opened up and cleaned.  Also the unit has a 1 year warranty.  Managed to find the agent in Singapore called Ionic Air Pte Ltd - Tel # 62444055.  Found out that they have all sorts of sizes for different size cars.  Very effective......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, bought NEOTEC car ionizer yesterday from Ionic Air (Jerry) and since I am driving a RX300, he reccommended that I take a XJ1000 which is bigger than the XJ802.   Used it immediately and after about 1 hour, it took away the smell of my dog(always bring my dog out).    Felt quite good after some driving.    Found out from Jerry that the XJ1000 can be used in a small room(150 square feet) as it comes with electrical adaptor.  Jerry also sells ionizers for offices, rooms, closets, fridges, shoes, pet brushes, night lights.  Friends - he is a very nice guy, can support or not ??? A bit teochew but ok leh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad you were able to get some fresh air in your car and home.  I found the night lite one very good for my bathroom - to get rid of the smell and yet not hurt my eyes when I wake up in the middle of the night.  Do you notice any difference in your car yet ?  If not for your boyfriend, I would ask you for a ride in your new legacy.  I heard that it is a really fast car and looks good too but a bit unusual that a girl like you would buy such a car......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was at the place at Jln Saudara Ku, and brought 3 car ionisers ($28/each)  (gave one to my bro), the guy recommended a better model with six points unit rather than the 2 points unit($48/each) as advertised on the papers. The more ionise points would give a better output. The advert product, 2 points unit, definately has better look and features.<br><br>Got one for the room and a Night light version for my nephew's room.<br><br>So far all the units work well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
