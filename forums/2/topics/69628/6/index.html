Wah, so many units, should have caught you 1st.  Dunno where Sunnygirl is now and really need to get the bulk purchase going.<br><br>You are right, the 2100 is slightly larger(10%) than the 2000,  agree that may be 2 big for small cars.  The performance of the unit is stunning.  Jerry showed me the smoke test done with the 2000 and 2100, the 2100 cleared the smoke in 15 seconds compared to 40 seconds for the 2000.<br><br>Especially with the UV light sterilization function, all Sars and bird flu viruses and bacteria will be killed.  Since the UV light is concealed, there is no risk of cancer from exposure.<br><br>Am going to buy one with my bulk purchase.  Apparently he doesn'thave very many left....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Since your car has the space, I reccommend the XJ1000 or XJ2000.  If you want to put the ionizer under your seat, try to use the 2000 as its more powerful and will do the job in a much shorter time.<br><br>The chord supplied for these 2 models is exceptionally long to fit bigger cars.  You can lay the chord under the carpets.  I think the chords are about 4 meters in length.<br><br>Hope helpful. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
