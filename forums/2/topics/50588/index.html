Thank you.</div></blockquote>I installed it in 2001...<br>so far fuel consumption is improved by abit(abt 1km/l)<br>but the main saving comes from using "95" petrol instead of usual 98 and "premium" like V-Power and Platinium...<br>I am using the in-tank drop in, so i got a down side, which is that i must pump petrol at night... let it soak over night, then start driving the 2nd day to feel the full effect... if not when you just pump only, you start driving, you will feel that the car is very "sluggish"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Draka,<br><br>I didn't really study on the drop in unit, but if you are saying 1kn/l more, that would mean about 40-45km more per tank, which would mean saving of $4-$5 per tank. And if we were to pump 5 tanks a month, that would mean saving of abt $25 per mnth. And 1 yr we'll save $300. and 1 yr plus we shall take back the amunt pay (cos the fuel chargr cos $380, not drop in unit). Well can consider.<br><br>But then. I'm more interested to knw abt the power increase. Do you actually feel a different??? Like i say, I never know about the drop in unit, but if it do, I'm sure the fuel charger will perform even better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Draka,<br><br>Smoother as in when increasing speed??? Or when normal crusing???<br><br>I donÂ’t expect it to increase a lot of cos but do hope that it does at least increase a bit of power. But from what you say, seems like it donÂ’t.<br><br>The person once told me that can feel the power increase most when rumming the accelerator hard. Think a little bullshit I guess.<br><br>Any1 else tried this thingy before? Pls advise as well, thanks a million.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's applicable to all. But I'm not sure if its that good. That's why till now haven't install. Seems good though.<br><br>The most basic model cost $380 (NOT drop in tank type). It's for car with under 150 horse power.<br><br>As for where to install, there's a website "broquet.com.sg". You can surf and see how.<br><br>If you did install, remember to tell me if it works, heh........<br><br>Regards</div>
