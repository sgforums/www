            <div class='col-md body'>THEY will drink and they will drive - never mind that they could cause accidents in which people might die.<br>Concern for others, and for themselves, be dashed.<br><br>This despite headlines in the past two weeks alone focusing on at least one woman who was killed in a drink-driving incident and two celebrities landing up in court for driving under the influence.<br><br>And on May 1, a 28-year-old suspected of drink driving slammed his car into a bus stop on Penang Road, injuring three women.<br><br>This newspaper got a first-hand look at the problem on Friday and Saturday, observing two late-night police roadblocks and conducting breathalyser tests of its own.<br><br>At roadblocks in Outram and Tampines roads between 11.30pm on Friday and 4.45am the next day, one in four of the 39 motorists tested were arrested for drink driving.<br><br>The roadblocks come after about 60 people were charged with drink driving last week alone.<br><br>Till March this year, 914 motorists - 141 of whom were involved in accidents - were held for drink-driving. In the same period last year, 753 people were held, including 134 involved in accidents.<br><br>Last year, 25 people died in crashes involving drunk drivers, up from 20 in 2005, and 336 were injured - a 50 per cent jump from the previous year.<br><br>Armed with two machines from Draeger Safety Asia, the journalists met sales executive Freddy Tan at around 2am on Saturday at nightspot Zouk.<br><br>He agreed to take the test, confident he would be fine - but he failed. He logged 37ug (microgrammes) of alcohol per 100ml of breath, just above the legal limit of 35ug.<br><br>Despite having had five mugs of beer, he said: 'I'm driving later tonight, and I can reach home safe and sound. I feel alright.'<br><br>He was among 35 motorists tested by the Straits Times at Zouk, Clarke Quay and St James Power Station between midnight and 4am on Saturday. Many who refused staggered into their cars and drove off.<br><br>Five people failed the test, including Mr Tan and one Ms Goh, a business development manager partying at St James.<br><br>The 29-year-old took the test just as she was about to drive away at about 3am.<br><br>The result: 62ug - nearly twice the legal limit.<br><br>She said: 'I have never been stopped before at roadblocks even though I drank. Even if I were to be stopped, I think I could wing it.'<br><br>But, in the end, a friend drove her home.<br><br>While it was not clear if Mr Tan followed through on his intention to drive home, nine others who did ended up being arrested by police.<br><br>Current laws state that first-time drink drivers can be fined up to $5,000, jailed for six months and banned from driving for at least a year.<br><br>While some have called for jail time and fines to be increased, former district court judge Lee Teck Leng believes that that might not help.<br><br>'What may actually be more effective is imposing a significantly higher driving disqualification,' said Mr Lee.<br><br>Now a lawyer, Mr Lee sat through more than 100 drink-driving cases in 1995 when he was judge in the Traffic Court.<br><br>On May 9, the same court saw ex-show host Benedict Goh, 37, being charged with two counts of drink driving. The next day, actor Christopher Lee, 35, was sentenced to four weeks in jail and fined $4,500 for drink-driving and hit-and-run offences.<br><br>Straits Times 14 May</div>

We should lower the legal limit, like Norway did. Since 1936, Norway had a legal blood alcohol limit of 50mg/100ml (Singapore:80mg/100ml). Since Jan 2001, even that has been reduced to 20mg/100ml, which means essentially that you cannot drink any alcohol at all if you drive.<br><br>Incidentally, the normal punishment for exceeding alcohol limit is 3 weeks' imprisonment in Norway.<br><br>There is no safe alcohol limit.  Moskowitz &amp; Robinson found that impairment of attention occurs below 20mg/100ml and 60% of studies report impairment at or below 50mg/100ml.<br><br>Moskowitz, H and Robinson, DC, "Effects of Low Doses of Alcohol on Driving-related Skills: A Review of Evidence," SRA Technologies, Inc., sponsored by U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C., DOT HS 807 280, July 1988.<br><br></div>
