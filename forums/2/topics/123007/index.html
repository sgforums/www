My toyota camry's petrol cap has a label saying Premium Unleaded only. Some petrol stations grade RON 98 as Premium Unleaded, RON 95 as Unleaded. I pumped 95 before when I first started out driving because I didn't know that my family uses RON 98. The car is running fine. I <strong>GUESS</strong> that it is alright.<br><br>2. Some cars require RON98 only like the Mitsu Evo 8MR FQ400 (heard from top gear video). But I believe for the average cars on the road, it is possible to pump higher/lower grading of petrol. However, I do not recommend mix between the different RON. Stick to 95 or 98 whichever you are using.<br><br>3. Diesel and petrol has different combustion temperature. If I'm not wrong, different engine too which has different fuel injection technology. Thus cannot use diesel for a petrol engine.<br><br>4. In previous threads, other forum members have said that V-Power is also RON98. However because of some chemical or whatever processing Shell does to it, it is more volatile, thus burning easier, giving more power. I maybe wrong.<br><br>5. Not sure, but I guess different grades does not vary fuel consumption (contributes to the size of the hole of your pocket only  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>6. Yes, definitely can. I'm not saying that they cant be mixed.. but. RON 95 means RON 95. RON 98 means RON 98. try not mix the grades.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Answers to the frequent asked questions.<br><br>1. Yes lower graded oil or higher graded oil can be used. However the use of undergraded oil may cause the performance of the car to loss its peak and result in more carbon build up that will be left after combustion has taken place.<br><br>2. Yes difference company petrol can be mixed in one single tank. Even if 95 RON with 98 RON. Although it is not recommended as the reason being of what that is stated above.<br><br>3. Pumping of diesel into a petrol tank , will result in the car totally un runable and cost will be incurred draining diesel out from the tank.  To make it simple for understanding, Petrol running engine need a purer form of fuel for combustion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He He He .. Part of my research so think could assist in the answers..<br><br>1. 1OO RON ? You must be driving a top end sports car. F1 ?<br>Even european cars usually recommended 95ron as min.<br>Jap/Korea cars could take 92r min. 100 ron is quite difficult to get at<br>common petrol stations.<br><br>2.  Whether petrol of lower ron could be used depends on yr make.<br>Ron is to prevent "knocking". A better indication would be MON.<br>If lower ron used may cause engine damage over prolong period.<br>So how low depends on low long u intend to drive yr car ?<br><br>3.  Diesel &amp; gasoline ... Different products suited to different car engines.<br>Cannot mix as the engines works drastically different. Ask yrself, why<br>for gasoline &amp; Diesel cars, the taxes are vastly different.<br>In Europe, mostly cars are diesel engines. ie BMW, Merc etc.<br>Nowadays, diesel cares are actually more advanced, powerful and cleaner<br>than gasoline engines in terms of emission etc.. Gone are the days where<br>Diesel engines cars means loud, low performance..<br><br>4. What is the difference between normal 98 and Vpower??<br>Something to do with the chemical composition of the gasoline itself.<br>Ask the insiders and they told me that something to do with some ron<br>booster additives etc that they use. Think Vpower is the better grade<br>as per advised by them.<br><br>5. Is there a great difference in grading in term of power and fuel    consumption.<br>In terms of energy caloric value, the higher grade gasoline do have heavier<br>density translating into higher energy. So leave it to you to interpret.<br><br>6. Can petrol of difference company be used in mixtures??  For eg, mobil with shell.<br>Cannot see why cannot as the main difference in different companies gasoline is in their additives package. Think most will be conservative to say pse do not mix the brand to incultate brand loyalty &amp; to avoid problems etc.<br><br>Tat's all folks !.. Hope u like the answers.<br></div>
