            <div class='col-md body'>You are cruising in the left lane at about 70km/h.... you want to change to the middle lane.... you turn on your right signal lights... the car on your right doesnt seem to give way to you... you shift down one gear and floor the accelerator.... overtake him and then cut into his lane abruptly.... then wind down your window, raise your right hand and show him your middle finger...<br><br>That's how you change lanes...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi alba<br><br>I'm a new driver, passed last year.  But I still remember what my instructor told me.  And till today, I do that whenever I change lane.<br><br>Check rear and wing mirrors.   Signal.  Then check rear mirror, check wing mirror again.  If the car (which you wish to cut into its path) can be seen on your rear mirror (at least 1/4 of rear mirror - actually, I think as long as it can be seen), it means the car is behind yours, check wing mirror again, check blind spot. Then lane change smoothly (at the right speed accordingly).<br><br>You need to do all these very fast.<br><br>If you're afraid, just make sure the car (which you wish to cut into its path) can be seen fully on the rear mirror.  That means a very clear path.<br><br>Lane changing has always been my greatest fear too but  I am no longer afraid.  But one of my instructors at Ubi would always take me along Eunos Link to practise over and over again.  I give him the credit for taking me along the busy Eunos Link during peak hours to help me overcome my fear.  Not all instructors are willing to do that because the risk is of course higher.  Sometimes they make us practise on easier routes which iseasier for them.<br><br>But keep in mind safety always.  Do lane change only when you are sure.  Once you're certain don't hesitate.  It's worse when you hesitate.  It can be extremely dangerous in fact.<br><br>I hope you overcome your fear soon.<br><br>By the way, when I passed.  What I did was: I stopped at my carpark with parked cars behind.  Looked into the rear mirror.  See if I could see a car.  Then turned my head and looked back to help me uderstand/realise how far the car was away from mine.  I stopped at various distances (car on rear mirror of different sizes) etc.  That really helped me to estimate distances of cars behind me.  It helped me a great in my lane changing a lot.  But of course, my carpark is a private carpark and so the traffic is controlled so it was not dangerous to do that.  If you wish to do that in public carparks, do be very careful.<br><br>Learning to drive is fun.  But driving is a heavy responsibility.  I am responsible not only for my own safety but for my passengers' safety AND the safety of all other road users.<br><br>Enjoy driving!<br><br></div>
