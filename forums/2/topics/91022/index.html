            <div class='col-md body'>Dear skywalker,<br><br>A simple illustration.<br><br>1)Car park charges- $65 for open car park, $90 for carpark with roof (HDB), for private apartments, should be covered in conservancy charges. Private houses, 0. you paid for the land.<br><br>2)Insurance - varies with age, NCD, classification of cars, sometimes they may check on driving history. i would say on the safe side, as a first time buyer of a small car, set aside about 2k per annum for that. Honda is more expensive and not talking about higher performance cars that cooper, suzuki ignis sports, yrv turbo, yaris turbo etc..<br><br>3) Road tax - Depends on the displacement of your car. you could refer to one motoring. varies.<br><br>4)Petrol - based on your mileage daily. I have assumed $450 monthly, on the safe side. (roughly, 3000km per month, based on fc of 10km/l) excluding rebates from cc, discount from petrol station.<br><br>5)Servicing - perhaps for the first 3 yrs, you would have to pay less. Safely set aside about 500-800 a year for servicing and maintenance should be sufficient.<br><br>6)Wear and tear - changing of tyres every 40000-60000km. That will cost 100 -200 for a 15inch tyre each.<br><br>I have not considered ERP charges, parking coupons, maybe about 20 - 50 dollars a month.<br><br>I have also not included minor accidents, due to negligence or carelessness of others.. leaving dents/scratches on your car. Varies.<br><br>Beautifying of cars, some may splurge to make it look more sporty, comfortable. Thats really up to you.<br><br>Summons, car accidents/repairs (own negligence, claiming on insurance, premium may go up- payyourself)can be other factors. I would not go into details.<br><br>Signing off.<br></div>
