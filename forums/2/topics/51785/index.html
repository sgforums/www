            <div class='col-md body'>U have to 1st be involved in some form of motorsports. not competitively.... but lets say u have to have a machine u can race and get some decent practice in it.<br>Then u go to SMSA clubhouse cum office which is at lock road.<br>The address is:<br>Singapore Motor Sports Association, Blk 9 Lock Rd #03-01 S(108937)<br><br>They will give u some forms to fill out, and a medical card. 1stly u need to be a member of a motorsports organisation in SG, so i would recomend u join SMSA as a member.<br>Next... the med card. U need to get a doctor to fill out your card, which means a medical checkup. A GP is fine. u also have to provide details of any road accidents u've been involved in as well as any old injuries. Whether u r fit for motorsports is up to the discretion of your doctor. When u go n collect your racing licence, u have to bring the medical card along and 2 passport sized photos(or was it 4? bring 4 to be safe).<br>What grade of competition licence u get depends on what the competition commitee thinks u r capable of. I got a International Senior 'C' n my 1st application. but then, b4 that i had been practicing for over a year and some of the commitee members have seen me during practice so it helps.<br>Thats all there is to getting one. Gd luck!</div>

AE86Tofu is just a boastful guy who is only 17 and he is not my team mate although  i know him.... he doesn't even do any racing practice or training yet... only on arcede machines. And any teammate of mine would never do stupid stuff like modding a worthless x-trail... or something stupid like boasting about it... or something stupid like boasting about how it can beat an Airtrek Turbo R Ralliart... when it can't. He is just a boastful guy who doesn't even know there was a EVO8 until very recently...... and he says a lot of stuff that r empty claims... or are just plain dumb... im sorry... apologising on his behalf also... sorry.......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

As for how good or bad a driver you are, we'll leave that up to SMSA to decide 'k? haha...</div>
