I was told the actual intervial milage depends on several factors such as time from last service, the way the car is driven, mileage covered  etc.  So, 20~25K is about right.<br><br>If my memory serves me right, BMW is the 1st to introduce the extended servicing intervial in the early 90s.  At that time, they claim they have improve their manufacturing process and material selection.  They claim their wear &amp; tear is so low and reliable that they extend the service milage to 15K i think.  They are, I "think" the 1st to claim their cars do not need "running in" as they "match" every component perferctly during manufacturing. (if you remember, in those days.. running period is around 5K.)  You know lah.. the Germans.. really good at precision engineering, so I believe their claims.</div>

I clocked about 110 - 120km each day... Don't think my interval can stretch for 20 - 25000km based on the factors. But still better than a Lexus with its interval is at 5 - 10000km.

If it's really 25k interval, maintenance could be lower than the Lexus. I don't know the service interval of a Lexus.

So do you math.<br><br>on the other hand, it is advisable to change engine oil often if you are driving a performance car and in tropical country. shorter service interval will also give you the opportunity to check your car for any fault.
