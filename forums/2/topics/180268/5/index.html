I happen to like my BMs because of the finish and the way the car handles etc. So if I have 3 what is it to you? Are you now going to tell me that I am making a big mistake? If you go to other threads, you will know that I am neither of what you say I am. I am an architect. I demand perfection in my vehicles and in my opinion and mine only, I think BMW gives me that. Not that I have not owned other cars before, but if I listed all of them here, you would probably say I am lying anyway. You don't think that BM is a special brand, then you are entitled to your opinion.<br><br>even in singapore, I know many people who keep 3 cars of the same brand. Both within my family and our friends. Mind you, they are not BMWs like I said each of us have our own preferences so we buy what we like if we can afford them.<br><br>the transportation system here is not like in singapore super efficient and readily available, the wait time between buses is almost 3/4 of an hour and there is no such thing as the MRT. We also have different conditions from singapore, which necessitate the 3 different vehicles for different purposes.<br><br>- a small car for city/town driving<br>- an suv for off road trips and lugging the dogs and all the DIY stuff and building materials and ladders etc<br>- a medium/large sedan for interstate trips and to take clients around in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Have a good day.</div>
