I believe she also felt pampered in the Lexus. It was silky smooth and quiet. The Mark Levinson sound system is AWESOME! 14 speakers man!!! OMG... Think the package offered by Lexus is hard to beat even when compared to the true Contis.  I'm not taking anything away from the Audis, Beemers or Merc. I mean I love the A6/A8, the 6/7-series and the SLKs/CLKs, but Lexus is simply irresistable... Think I'm a practical/rational guy. Thanks for your active participation in this thread.</div>

My pervious experience with the previous GS300 was soso, it was fast and quick but a bit soft and the gated shift on the earlier model which I had really annoyed me.

If you are really such a gentlemen, I think the first thing you should do will be get 2 cars instead of one.

First of all, we're not blowing all of our transport budget in the new car. We're actually buying below our means. It doesn't make any sense to me in buying 2 cars unless you have a big family. There're other more important things to spend your money on. First on the list should be property. How to house a good car when you don't even have a good house?<br><br>Satisfy my manhood? Egoistic? As I mentioned before, if I wanted attention, I would have gotten a SLK or an Audi TT... Think we're on the opposite side of a bandwidth.
