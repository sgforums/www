            <div class='col-md body'>beemer is for the name. But in terms of design, orginally when the new 5 series came out... it looked really good to me with those fierce eyebrow like headlamps. but then again it has been for a few years already... the design to me is getting boring and it is EVERYWHERE.<br><br>lexus on the otherhand, looks really really sleek and expecially with the pearlescent white paint.. or silver... For comfort i sat in a 520i before... its really comfortable but i dont know about driving it. GS300 with lexus's famed low NVH score would really be a winner i guess.<br><br>on the technical side... i think spare parts would be alot cheaper for the lexus than the BMW.<br><br></div>

I don't have any friends driving a BMW. Most of them are Merc/Lexus fans.<br><br>I'm not bothered by the fact that a Lexus is afterall an upmarket Toyota. I think the only relation is the parent company. Lexus's build quality/comfort is legendary and on a totally different level from Toyota. Even when you talk about Toyota, it is also very well-built. Relatively problem-free. Even those from Thailand. I sat in my friend's Altis once. Very quiet. I must say I was pretty impressed.</div>

I was beginning to wonder about the $14k differences for the parking system differences.  The OMV diff is around $4k only.  Of course, for some, they may say $14k is nothing to me as it is not coming out of their pockets.  For me, I can parallel park well and I don't need no silly system to help me.  Have you gone down for a test drive?  The 523 is definitely out of my list.</div>

I drove 3 BMWs before (E36 320, E46 320 and last E39 520). I am in the same situation as you when I changed to Volvo S60 T5 3 months ago, main reason is when I test the E60 523 I think it cant even match my E39 520 in term of feel and handling.<br><br>My T5 thought not so good in handling compare to the BMW but in view that I dont really push the car to the limit to feel the difference and at the same time it is cheaper and more powerful than the 523, I got the T5.<br><br>I will choose GS300 if I got to choose between the 2, for reliability, quietness and power.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I have a few friends from BMW club also change camp, E60 and E90 not very attractive; unless your pocket deep enough for 525 or 325 and above.</div></blockquote>Hi CoolBlue,<br><br>Thanks for your input and support!

It's really everywhere! My condo's got a couple already. Same color as well! OMG...<br><br>What's a NVH score? Something to do with cabin noise? Lexus is really comfortable. Sat in my friend's SC430 a few times. Wind noise is minimal even when the top is down. No need to shout when you wanna have a conversation. That's QUALITY for you! Cheers!</div>
