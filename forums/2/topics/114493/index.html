Furthermore I believe AIG has a higher coverage compare to NTUC.<br><br>When comes to claim, AIG will be faster and efficient... NTUC being a government (oops, can I mentioned this)... will be more stringent..<br><br>But do note that AIG will be slightly expensive than NTUC...<br><br>It really depends on how you look at it... As the saying goes... yi fen qian, yi fen hou.<br><br>Ultimately if you choose AIG, you may wanna PM me for quotation.<br><br>Regards,<br></div>

In my opinion, they take a fairer approach in processing claims. Remembered a case regarding flooding in Cisco building in Paya Lebar.<br><br>AIG - covered 2 cars for total loss in 1st year<br>NTUC - heard it only pay out 60 -70 % for 1st year cars<br><br>Nevertheless, at the end of the day, most consumers would go for a most competitively priced package. If given a choice, I would go for the cheapest package available just to save costs. It's all down to the driver's sense of responsiblity in keeping the road safe as well as having some luck with you. Just keep your fingers crossed that nothing will happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I do not have much experience with AIG insurance.<br>But I can share with you what I know about NTUC Car Insurance.<br><br>I have a car that is happily insured with NTUC Income.<br>I can see that most of the complains and frustrations with Income are about having to report to IDAC after an accident which people felt is time consuming. I guess the reason why there are so many complains is because Income is the largest motor insurer in Singapore so naturally whenever there is a complain about motor claims, Income will "ganna" the complain.<br><br>But to think of it in a positive light, if you report at the IDAC centre after an accident, people at the centre will be able to guide you on the claim processes (rather than being totally at loss what to do after an accident). At the same time, the claim will be treated legitimately and there will be lesser disputes about your vehivce damages. IDAC will also conduct a quality check after the repairs.<br><br>That's what I feel. Feel free to share your views.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have also faced the same tough choice when renewing my insurance couple of months back. In the end, I opt to stay with NTUC. First the premium was much lower and secondly the bank that I loan from offers additional 5% discount and provided personal courier service to pickup the cheque, process it and return the new insurance cert to me...talking about customer service...2 thumbs up...<br><br>End of the day, drive safely. That should be the main focus.<br><br>Cheers!</div>
