Comes with waranties and stuff.<br><br>Personnally, I am not very sure about V-cool, but I think Rikecool's workmanship is seriously below what they are charging. Rarely I encounter people who only visit them once. 3 times is the average. They are the quantity over quality kind. Can finish doing in 1-2 hours, when everyone else is doing 4 or more. Worse is they don't provide you with a decent waiting area. Not recommended unless your SE is doing it for you.</div>

So many areas to cover. I am not sure about the other brands, but when I done mine with Rikecool, there is only 1 package. And also, I only comment about workmanship. Because I been to other tint shop (sadly only after my installation, helping friend look for cheap tint.) and feel a little regret. Plus, I have seen many who went back to complain, some with very fired tone.<br><br>With the speed they are doing the films, I can only say "Luck" plays a important part to a satisfied customer. The third time I went back, I complained about multiple spot in between films. They say dirt, even if redo will still have.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

Some cheap ones are Lextint (also known as perfect tint), tintsycool (quite popular in Vios club). Both have shown reasonable workmanship and have films not exceeding S$400.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks wbucket, my SE was not offering it for free, but with 20%discount.
