What we are talking about now is Airtrek... they can be 500 horses... very powerful. But they are not meant and tune for drag racing and track. First they are auto... If Mitsu wants to design a car to handle drag and track will they have them in auto transmission? Of course not! What I meant by saying "Turbo is not everything", I also mean power is not everything. In any race, the most important aspect are weight and handling followed by power. I just feel that Airtrek just simply lacked of both despite whatever horsepower they can induce. The fastest turbo or NA car in japan mean totally nothing if they handle like s.h.i.t. But most of them are not, that's why they're great! Most of the time, a 1000 horses Skyline can hardly beat another car half it's horsepower in a track if not setup properly.<br><br>But then again... all talk but not action mean s.h.i.t as well. You should track with your Airtrek and you will know what I mean. All theory and what you read in magazines doesn't mean much when you are personally behind the wheel at a high speed corner...

Remember this thread start off from Airtreks and Civics...<br><br>As a matter of fact, they did! I personally have tracked once with Airtrek Track Day at Sepang. During the open cat 5 lap race, there's S15, Evos, Rexs, Civics, DC5, CL7 and many Airtreks. It's pretty intimidating to be in the mist of them taking the bend! But of course they're in for the fun and joy of tracking. Certinaly none of them came in top 5 but thumbs up for their participation.<br><br></div>
