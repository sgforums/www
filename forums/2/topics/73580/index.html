            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>There are a few models of Celica available, which one are you talking abt?<br><br>The most basic model is the SS1, follow by the SS2 and the top of the chart is Sports M.<br><br>SS1 comes in auto or 5 speed manual, a stock of 145 bhp, 1800cc non-turbo engine. Price range (as of last yr, now should drop a little) if abt 95-100k.<br><br>SS2 comes in auto or 6 speed manual, a stock of 190 bhp, 1800cc non-turbo engine. Again, price range as of last yr is abt 110k.<br><br>Sports M - Not too sure cos few pple buy them in S'pore, though there are a few. Believe its 220bhp, and costs over 120k (as of last yr).<br><br>A celica is more than powerful enough for daily use but then, as its only 1800cc and non-turbo, it cannot outrun a Type R or any turbo charge car when stock, except for sports M maybe. However, a SS2 with some mob should do the trick.<br><br>However, maintenance of a celica will definitely be cheaper than then a turbo car, and fuel consumtion is pretty okie! In fact, the fuel consumption is even better than some 1600cc saloon car! And of cos, another advantages is the slightly cheaper road tax as compared to other 2000cc car, but its not really that big of a sum.<br><br>I personally drove the SS2 a couples of time before, as my brother own one SS2 (bought last yr April/May and cost 111k). Fixed with Veilside bodykit which look terrific i should say. Overall, not a bad car, and so far so good I should say. If not, you won't be seeing so many Celicas ard on the rd.<br><br>Of cos, unless you are really that power crazy, then go for a Rex! But then, the petrol consumption and maintenance will kills you. Insurance should be more or less the same.</div>

RX8 spec E where got powerful? think a ss2 can jolly well keep up with it. only spec S is considered "powerful" IMO. but i do agree that in terms of "niceness", the RX8 wins hands down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The very fact that the primary mode of a VTEC engine is fuel economy detracts from the tractability of its power.  Sure, once the power kicks in, it's great, but you'll have to wait for the engine to spool up to that point first.  At the end of the day, it's as bad as lag, if not worse, depending on how the turbo is set up.</div>
