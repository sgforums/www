Couldn't pass up the 17K savings and $800 discount on road tax.  Hoping this will work out!

Plus it takes me longer to drive to work than by MRT.  Some pple say that the discount is not worth the restrictions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, you can just expect your buyer to factor that in too, meaning you would have to sort of share the $17,000 to your buyer in the sense of a cheaper price to them. E.g. Normal car price is 60K for new car. OPC is 43K. After 7 years, normal car may sell at 25K, but an OPC may sell at 20K.<br><br>But actually, the bigger problem I would worry about if I get an OPC is the number of buyers out there who are willing to buy it. Since it is not the mainstream, you can expect less buyer and thus it is harder to sell.<br><br>Of course, there is also this option of converting the car back to a normal car before selling, but that means you will have to pay back the balance to LTA. In this case, the amount will be 30%*17,000 = 5,100 + administration charges.<br><br>The last option would be to scrap the car pre-maturely just like what you will do for a normal car.

This is where I am not sure how it is calculated -<br>(1) reduce COE by 17,000 then calculate COE rebate OR<br>(2) Calculate COE rebate without reduction, then subtract unused OPC rebate<br><br>I was assuming (2), but having think about it, (1) make more sense.

So, perhaps 14K would be an appropriate resale value.<br><br>But note that the above assumes stable COE value which is probably a very bad assumption. The resale value of a car is very much dependent on the price of a new car. And if a new car is a lot cheaper or more expensive, then the resale value is lower or higher accordingly. Most buyer do make a comparison of the cost of buying a new car compared to the cost of a resale car. And if it make sense to buy a resale car, then the demand will push up the resale value. During the time before 1997, I have even heard of stories of people earning money after using a car for 1-2 years, since the COE is raising rapidly during those period.</div>

The 17k rebate is used to offset COE, unless yr COE is lower than 17k, watever excess rebate will then be used to offset yr ARF which is tied in to yr PARF. Otherwise, no effect on PARF.<br><br>No need to pay back LTA regardless when u de-reg car. Only need to pay back pro-rated rebate it u want 2 convert it back to normal car.</div>

I am quite interested to know. You said you can buy as many as you want to but how do you show to the authorities that you are using a valid coupon? Is it like parking coupon where you tear off or is it like different colour for different day as in those used long time ago for cbd before the erp started? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I guess you are right in the sense that converting back to a normal plate and sell off make sense as you can probably fetch a higher price if the mileage is low.</div>
