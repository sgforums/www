If u really out to try yr luck, dun put coupon at all. At most fine $5000. If caught tempering then TP throw in free lodging.

If you want to convert a second hand car to OPC, only the road tax rebate of $800 applies.<br><br></div></blockquote>INFORMATION FROM LTA<br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br>You can apply to the LTA to convert your normal car to an OPC. Upon receiving a letter from LTA, you can proceed to change the car number plate to red and have it sealed by an authorised Inspection Centre. To complete the conversion, you will need to submit the required documents as listed in the letter from LTA and pay the conversion fee of $100.<br><br>You will be given the $800 discount on the annual road tax subject to a minimum road tax payment of $50 per year. No tax rebate on your COE quota premium or ARF will be given.<br><br>If your car is de-registered before it is 10 years old and is eligible for Preferential Additional Fee (PARF) benefit, an additional PARF may be granted on top of the normal PARF benefit. This additional PARF is computed as follows:<br><br>Lifespan of the car as a converted OPC (in months &amp; days) x ($2,200/12)<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Essentially, I read that as you get more PARF value if you convert a normal car to OP car. And this amount is $2,200 per year. If you look at it over 10 years, you actually get $22K worth of rebate which is more than the $17K rebate.</div>

No matter how high or low the COE is, if you really need a car for your work and daily activties, you'll get one, at any cost. OPC is for pple who don't need the car during weekdays, as they don't need to drive to work (or if the parking at their workplace is too $$$, and so you'd rather take public transport instead).<br><br>It really adds up knowing that you save $800 per year over 10yrs plus $17K upfront for a total of $25K. In most other countries (maybe all other countries) you can get a brand new car for that amount.<br><br>Its bad enough we're paying through our arse in Singapore just to own a car (Some pple mentioned using one-third of their pay for the car?? That's totally ridiculous if you ask me!!). So should you get a normal car and let it sit at the parking lot most of the time if you're not using it actively?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nick28:</div><div class="quote_body">me tempted to get a toyota vios auto OPC at $57,776, so after rebate is $40,776. With a downpayment of $3776, loan will be $37,000. Based on 2.2% for a 7yr loan, the monthly instalment is about $500. on a 10 year loan at 2.4%, the monthly instalment is about $375. (based on HSBC's 1 year interest rebate)<br><br>based on a $100 petrol per month and open carpark of $65, it works out to be $665 per month for a 7 yr loan. Thats like 25% of my take home pay. Do u guys think its ok to spend this proportion of pay in a car? Just need some views. Thanks.<br><br>just curious, how much petrol do u guys use for an OPC per month? Also, how frequent do u need to service an OPC scheme car? How much is a round of  maintenance servicing?<br><br>In addition, how much is the road tax for a 1.5l vios after the $800 rebate?<br><br>I am currently 29 with a year's licence. My wife is 28 yrs old with 7yrs licence. Is it more worth it to buy the car in her name? Whats the premium like for our age range?<br><br>Lastly, any other recommendation of cars with similar price range of $50k - below $65K cars?<br><br></div></blockquote>100 is a good guide for OPC Vios, cause Vios is known to be a fuel saver. But then again, have to see how you drive and where you drive. If you drive to work during non-peak hours, you will be looking at 200-250 per month.<br><br>For me, I set aside 1k (half of my take-home) for the car for just in case senario. In actually fact only spend about 800. Better to calculation how much you need to survive, keep some for rainy days, especially since you are married.<br><br>Car under your wife's name should be better. Or should I say insurance under her name. Cause a 1 year old license definitely kanna chop by insurance company, no matter how old you are.<br><br>As for cars,<br>Japan: Lancer, City, Swift, Jazz(1k over budget).<br>Korea: Getz, Cerato.<br>Others: Aveo, Optra, Gen2.<br><br>Above listed are cars people buy nowadays that I actually think worth looking at. Of course always go for the Japanese car first, but if you want to try other variations, please do......at your own risk.</div>

Insurance cannot be included in the loan amount.  Can I check which model u looking at? Auto or Manual? what freebies did they throw in?</div>

I think the monthly installement should be less than a third or quater of your salary, something like that! Anyway, recently Toyota SE got a bit of problem with their attitude, I would strongly advise you to try Honda or Mitsubishi if you are not overly impressed by Toyota's car.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ekit08:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, Juz to ask all bros for advise... normally i reach my work place at 7 but i go home between 5.30 to 6.30.. i will not be driving during the peirod.

Traffic is smoother then, more relax to drive. So depends on you, if you die die must get out of your workplace ASAP, then OPC doesn't work.</div>
