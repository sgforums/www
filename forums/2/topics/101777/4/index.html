Under the scheme, OPC owners are given substantial upfront tax rebates and road tax discounts in return for restricted usage of OPCs during certain time periods.<br><br>The quantum of tax benefits provided to the owners of OPCs is determined based on the periods of their usage restriction.  Any change to the restricted time periods, whether on weekdays or Saturdays, will require a review of the tax benefits given.  We have recently reviewed and decided that owners of OPCs should continue to enjoy the tax benefits at present.<br><br>We are sorry to inform you that we are also unable to accede to your suggestion to change the day licence fee for OPCs.

Well, have you consider getting normal car then? Judging from the trade off from your rebate and road tax, even if you buy coupons for all sat for 10 years, you still save S$12k++. Anyway, I am driving a normal, so naturally I would prefer a more spacious road since I pay the road tax and COE.<br><br>Instead of justifying your stand as a OPC driver, think in terms of a normal car driver.</div>

It might help rather than writing to LTA and getting same reply over and over again. You dont know where you letter goes to....It could be some automated machine... I think it is a good idea to lift the restriction for sat since govt promoting 5 days week, and LTA is not in line with the govt's policies...</div>
