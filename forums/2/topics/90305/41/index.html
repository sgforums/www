I kinda like the side vents on it... and its cute small antenna... hee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Buona Vista also has a few nice cars... NUS alone has 2 350Zs, 2 Z3s, saw one SL55 driving around, as well as the new SLK, 2 CLKs, a whole lot of Beetles, including one or 2 convertibles... One old celica, think that's driven my an MO... saw it coming out of NUH... One black Silvia S15... which, surprisingly, has an undercar neon kit... hee... saw it driving out today...<br><br>Oh yeah... there's a pink beetle in NUS... totally pink... including the seats, dashboard and 2 furry pink dice at the rearview mirror... hee...<br><br>Oh, and numerous new Celicas, and one Rx8 too... some students are really rich... or have rich parents... one of the Z3s are driven by a female student...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
