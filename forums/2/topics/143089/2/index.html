            <div class='col-md body'>its true that cats leave scratches on the car... i've seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>i know it was the cat because while the car was being washed in the morning, there were no scratches noted. but in the afternoon, i saw a cat jump off the bonnet and hey presto... scratch marks at the same spot. these are fine but deep scratch marks that can't be polished away... unlike the shallow ones caused by wiping the car with a dirty cloth.<br><br>unfortunately, the cat kept coming back over a period of 3 mths or so, sometimes it left new scratches, sometimes it didn't. i finally called AVA, they loaned me a cat trap and 2 days later, the culprit was caught and collected by AVA. since then, no new scratches have appeared on the car.<br><br>it's not an uncommon problem. i'm a partner in a car grooming business and we see plenty of customers with similar scratches and stories to share.

You shld seen it for urself!! They get some indian man to catch them, and they actually put 5-6 cats in 1 small cage!! can u imagine how uncomfortable is that? And worse still they put some in a rice sack!! The big brown one!! Machiam they're snakes, and if the cat let out a scream, they'll kick it in 1 hard blow to get the cat shut up!! Rice sack leh!! Siao one!!<br><br>And pls lor, maybe some scratch marks are left by the cats, but not intentionally one lor, imagine u are losing your balance, die die u would grab hold of something!!

You shld seen it for urself!! They get some indian man to catch them, and they actually put 5-6 cats in 1 small cage!! can u imagine how uncomfortable is that? And worse still they put some in a rice sack!! The big brown one!! Machiam they're snakes, and if the cat let out a scream, they'll kick it in 1 hard blow to get the cat shut up!! Rice sack leh!! Siao one!!<br><br>And pls lor, maybe some scratch marks are left by the cats, but not intentionally one lor, imagine u are losing your balance, die die u would grab hold of something!! But jumping onto the bonet is an easy case for an adult cat, chances the cat would use claws is very small.. Please think b4 u post, some ppl would take ur suggestion and put them into action, and who do you think would suffer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>Do u pay service n conservancy charges urself or other pay? How uch per mth? U own a car n wat car? How much do u spend on ur car every mth? Wat is ur income, if above 8k i got nothing to say then. I`m just earning peanuts n u dun expect me to use those peanuts to clear up those shit tat some irresponsible fella left behind. Cats population must be kept under control. Dun believe me, go ask the gov. HDB dun allow house owner to keep cat/s but why they allow dog/s? there must b some reasons behind it. this policy been there for donkey years n they dun anyhow implenment policies waiting to get shoot back by others. Stray cats/ pet cats at home problem been discussed in the parliament before but how? till today they still dun change the rule.</div>
