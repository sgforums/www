His driving a manual SS2.<br><br>Anyway, i always thought the SS2 is having 190bhp until i saw the advertisment for it. It claims to be 180bhp......... nevertheless, i believe its enough already for daily drive. I would be more than happy to own an ss1 now, let alone a ss2, haha...........<br><br>Like what you say, with a little mod here and there and its 200bhp easily.<br><br>I drove my brother celica a couple of time before, and I must say its a fun car to drive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

JDM celicas howver have 190bhp on tap..as quoted from the australian toyota site which imports JDM celicas.<br>/////<br><br>As you'd expect, the Celica has an impressive engine. The powerful 4 cylinder, 1.8L twin cam engine with intelligent Variable Valve Timing and Lift (VVTL-i)is nothing less than Toyota's latest technology.<br>This is not so much an engine, more a rocket. It's bred for driving excitement, with an explosive 141KW of power and a hefty 180 Nm of torque.<br><br>2ZZ-GE engine<br>A 1.8 litre Alloy twin cam multi-valve 2ZZ-GE multi-point sequential EFI engine with VVTL-i, making this sophisticated engine powerful, yet fuel efficient.<br><br>The 2ZZ-GE engine is an in-line, 4 cylinder engine with two intake and two exhaust valves per cylinder.<br><br>VVTL-i makes the Celica a car with brains as well as brawn, a car which instinctively drives better. It lets you fully assert all Celica's power, and it even gives you better fuel economy.<br><br>So how does VVTL-i work?<br>Toyota's advanced technology optimises efficiency and air flow by varying open and close timing of the intake valves, giving you more power in every gear.<br><br>And it does more:<br>By increasing the intake valve lift when the engine speed is high, VVTL-i allows greater volumes of fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber for increased power.<br><br>In addition, Celica is fitted with Toyota's Direct Ignition System which provides a powerful and clean spark while lowering vehicle emissions.<br><br>Celica has a highly developed 6-speed manual transmission, to give the car a sporty, belongs-on-a-racetrack feel. For better shift feel and control, this transmission adopts double-cone syncro for the second gear.<br><br>And the four speed automatic transmission employs the latest technology.<br><br>The automatic transmission, features Electronic-shift (E-shift), allowing you to choose between the standard shifter in the centre console or twin switches located conveniently on the steering wheel.<br><br>Celica's suspension adds to its sheer drivability. There are Independent MacPherson struts at the front, and at the rear a double wishbone type suspension glues you tightly onto the road. A toe control function helps both operability and stability. Everything adds up to a car which is easier to handle, more stable and more comfortable than ever.<br><br>/////http://celica.toyota.com.au/Celica/HomePage/Article/0,1278,136-160-2633,00.html<br><br>141 kilowatt = 189.084115 horsepower [international]; 190hp<br><br>Think the singapore version shld be 190 becos the fuel here isnt THAT bad.<br><br>Hey whoever bro owns a celica.<br><br>Tell your bro for best games get an AEM CAI + a Fujitsubo cat back exhaust + power FC GUARANTEED low 14s on street tyres or even flat..<br><br>AND for the guy that says tuscanis rock....right, DC5s do a 6.6 0-100 and celicas when driven properly will give you ard 6.8 (less than 7) th ereason behind this is that drivign a celica is tricky at bast because the VVTL-i mode only kicks in above 6.5k rpm, and you need to shift at around 8k rpm in order to land back in lift, you mess up and become a lot slower if you fall out (thnik turbo lag for turboed cars) ..<br><br>And the tiburon is not a fast car, just go to any integra, eclipse, celica site and ask them and they will show you vids and timeslips that will prove my point.<br><br>you are welcome to go try, just do a search for hyundai or tiburon(same as tuscani) in any of these forums if you don't believe me.

The powerful 4 cylinder, 1.8L twin cam engine with intelligent Variable Valve Timing and Lift (VVTL-i)is nothing less than Toyota's latest technology.<br>This is not so much an engine, more a rocket. It's bred for driving excitement, with an explosive 141KW of power and a hefty 180 Nm of torque.<br><br>2ZZ-GE engine<br>A 1.8 litre Alloy twin cam multi-valve 2ZZ-GE multi-point sequential EFI engine with VVTL-i, making this sophisticated engine powerful, yet fuel efficient.<br><br>The 2ZZ-GE engine is an in-line, 4 cylinder engine with two intake and two exhaust valves per cylinder.<br><br>VVTL-i makes the Celica a car with brains as well as brawn, a car which instinctively drives better. It lets you fully assert all Celica's power, and it even gives you better fuel economy.<br><br>So how does VVTL-i work?<br>Toyota's advanced technology optimises efficiency and air flow by varying open and close timing of the intake valves, giving you more power in every gear.<br><br>And it does more:<br>By increasing the intake valve lift when the engine speed is high, VVTL-i allows greater volumes of fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber for increased power.<br><br>In addition, Celica is fitted with Toyota's Direct Ignition System which provides a powerful and clean spark while lowering vehicle emissions.<br><br>Celica has a highly developed 6-speed manual transmission, to give the car a sporty, belongs-on-a-racetrack feel. For better shift feel and control, this transmission adopts double-cone syncro for the second gear.<br><br>And the four speed automatic transmission employs the latest technology.<br><br>The automatic transmission, features Electronic-shift (E-shift), allowing you to choose between the standard shifter in the centre console or twin switches located conveniently on the steering wheel.<br><br>Celica's suspension adds to its sheer drivability. There are Independent MacPherson struts at the front, and at the rear a double wishbone type suspension glues you tightly onto the road. A toe control function helps both operability and stability. Everything adds up to a car which is easier to handle, more stable and more comfortable than ever.<br><br>/////http://celica.toyota.com.au/Celica/HomePage/Article/0,1278,136-160-2633,00.html<br><br>141 kilowatt = 189.084115 horsepower [international]; 190hp<br><br>Think the singapore version shld be 190 becos the fuel here isnt THAT bad.<br><br>Hey whoever bro owns a celica.<br><br>Tell your bro for best games get an AEM CAI + a Fujitsubo cat back exhaust + power FC GUARANTEED low 14s on street tyres or even flat..<br><br>AND for the guy that says tuscanis rock....right, DC5s do a 6.6 0-100 and celicas when driven properly will give you ard 6.8 (less than 7) th ereason behind this is that drivign a celica is tricky at bast because the VVTL-i mode only kicks in above 6.5k rpm, and you need to shift at around 8k rpm in order to land back in lift, you mess up and become a lot slower if you fall out (thnik turbo lag for turboed cars) ..<br><br>And the tiburon is not a fast car, just go to any integra, eclipse, celica site and ask them and they will show you vids and timeslips that will prove my point.<br><br>you are welcome to go try, just do a search for hyundai or tiburon(same as tuscani) in any of these forums if you don't believe me.

I have driven my share of fast cars too, s15, porsche boxter Ss, porsche RS4s, Skyline  R33 GTRs and R34GT-Ts, I'm not trying to trash the tib; I'm trying to give ppl an idea of its actual speed rather than say that its actually fast when its really not. I'm sorry that you take offense at that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>However anything can happen on the street I spose <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> I can say that my races were real, they were in Australia tho, and the scag, rolls , porches belonged to my relatives/friends, so they would have no problem racing me. Believe it or not, I own a celica and those were genuine.<br><br>I haven't seen many if not any modified tibs in Aus, only kitted ones. However I already said earlier that if you throw enough money at the tib or any other car for that matter it will go fast. I also said one of my acquantances has a supercharged tib that does low 14s...It is still my firm opinion and his that that car is slow in stock form.<br><br>Maybe I will rephrase my point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> To sum it up the tib is a value for money car, however if your looking for performance and street cred, look elsewhere <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Not looking for a flame war here but I spose maybe I was abit too enthusiastic in pushing my point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> To the Hyundais credit I can say they are good everyday cars, they have torque at the bottom end whereas the celica lacks bottom end, they have a bad top end tho..<br><br>PeaCe</div>
