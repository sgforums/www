            <div class='col-md body'>These pple (parking attendants) are not thinking public servants (not like SAF, advocating the thinking soldier).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>For eg, if you sit in your car waiting for someone and you park in a lot to avoid obstructing traffic, they expect you to put coupons. If you do not park in the lot but stop your car somewhere else in the car park AND having your hazard lights on AND with no one in the car AND on top of that obstructing the whole kampung, they do not book you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> I ask the attendant and explained the logic and she told me that as long as you are in a lot you should display coupons and its ok to obstruct traffic in a carpark. So what is their primary role? As law enforcers to ensure that traffic inside the car park is in order or collect as much money as possible? I think the answer is obvious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So next time if you need to run some errands which takes less than 15 minutes, park your car anywhere in the car park but not in the lots.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just my tots.<br><br></div>

The traffic wardens here DO operate on a commision. They are sharp and eagle-eyed, I've seen tons of cars being clamped. I've even seen them clamp a tlelephone repair truck which was there to do repair works. Being a repair truck of course it wouldn't have a valid parking permit for the local area, but did they care? Nooooooo.... and then when u get clamped, which usually comes with the ticket, it means u're S$1200 poorer.</div>
