Someone claimed that he changed his car fuel tank which reduced his FC... i wonder if it's just a bunch of crap? further more, he claimed that he's FC is low coz his car is heavily modd ( I thought it should be the other way round?)..<br><br>And then the most ridiculous thing is that...he claimed that he's driving an Evo7, and i asked about the FC of his car, it took him a while.. and he said "13KM/L" PENGZ i nearly fell off my chair... lolx...that was his initial answer.. later when i commented about "HOW THE HECK COULD IT BE 13KM/L?" he gave loads of reasons why his evo is running 13KM/L , after which he said he's just joking, and it's only around 7.8 to 8.2km/L.Hmm this made me wanna ask u all.. if u know the actual FC of Evos?<br><br>This person's quite young .. so i asked said to him " You must be a rich kid to have your parents to buy you such a car..."  And he replied " He used all his savings...." hello! Even people who earn $3K per month take up car loans..esp in Sg when cars are so expensive...! I wonder if he really knows how much an Evo costs...<br><br>So based on everythingI have said... do you think this person is faking all these? What for anywayz... it'll make him look more like an idiot than make him look good.<br><br>Anywayz, after getting a reply, i'll be removing the contents of this post. Coz this person's from the Sg forums too.<br><br>Cheers and thanks anywayz  </div></blockquote>tell him NPNT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>i have a good idea who also. sounds like he tua kanging. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
