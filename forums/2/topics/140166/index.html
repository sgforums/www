            <div class='col-md body'>I was cruising on the expressway at 90km/h when all of a sudden I saw a pair of headlights charging down the right lane at breakneck speed. As he approached, I saw his speed was 140km/h. As he zoomed past, I saw the words on the side of his car. It as an AE86 from Mount Fuji Tofu shop. In an instant, I cut to the right lane and tailed him for a while. Suddenly, he down two gears and tried to speed off. I could see he is now doing 165km/h. Enough is enough, I said to myself as I switched on my siren and pulled him over. It was Takumi behind the wheel and I had no choice but to send him to court to receive his harsh and extreme punishment. Let this be a lesson to all of you law breakers.

They're both modded over the limit. I still give way to people who for some reason, feel that they must go first. I mod my rides not to race or outshine others, it's my hobby, and I respect everyone's right of way. Unfortunately, most don't respect my right of way, and do not know what I'm capable of because I don't decorate my rides to look like some raleigh car. They're mostly left aghast after I blasted off from 90Kmh if I get overly annoyed.<br><br>Like I've mentioned many times before; spot others, before they spot you.
