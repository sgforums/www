Something worth considering esp in Singapore where the ratess of petrol is unrivally high.<br><br>For VIOS, good handling and feel, looks solid on the outside however when veering bends it is probably not as stable as the Honda City. Then again there are not so many major bends in Singapore too.<br><br>Also you might want to find out more on its production countries</div>
