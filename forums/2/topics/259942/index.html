Is the acceleration and top speed figures really so important in the context of Singapore? Haha..getting a 320i may not be a bad thing..a lot of journalists have commented that the 320i is actually is the best handling BMW 3-series because the engine is small and light..as you know, nose-heavy cars aren't nice to drive.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Went to performance motors. The price they offer you is a bit high now as compared to the ones which they offer me a month back. I think PM offer me 120K for 320 and lexus offer me 129k. PM did offer me a higher overtrade of my previous can than others like merds and lexus.<br><br>Well, 320 is a 4 cylinder whereas 325 is a 6 cylinder. Totally different. Power, spec, total different. The worst thing is that the interior of the 320 suxs big time as compared with the 325 and IS 250. 320 for me is that it is too dull and plain... i would prefer my '02 corolla design than the 320 interior. Or i think the previous 318 design looks better than the new 320 design<br><br>In the end, settled for the IS 250 instead. Although it cost more than the 320, but still prefer the 250.<br><br>What i personally feel is that if you wanna buy the 320, you are just buying the badge. 320 does not totally have the BM feel in terms of performance and style. If you really want to get a BM, then at least go for a 325. If not, like me, buy a lexus then. At least i know that i am getting a better customer service and reliable machine.<br></div>

Haha..If it's C-class, everyone buys the C180K, if it's E-class, they buy E200K. A lot of people also buy the BMW 6-series in 630i, cheapest model again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Added this: I have to add that I actually have no right to comment, but that's what I think honestly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
