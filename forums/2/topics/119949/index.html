Ceramic window films have reset the standards in the window film industry in heat control, visibility, and fade control.<br><br>Ceramic Advantages:<br><br>Ceramics utilize advanced nano-technology similar to that used on the NASA space shuttle to dissipate heat.<br>Ceramics, unlike metallic films, will not appear shiny and have very low reflectivity.<br>Ceramics, unlike dyed films, will not fade, turn purple or bubble while giving you maximum heat rejection.<br>Ceramics have lasting superior durability and are non-corrosive in sea air conditions.<br>Ceramics reflect the heat while allowing the visible light to enter permitting a clear view both day and night.<br>Ceramics, unlike metallic films, deter wavelength interference with GPS systems and cell phones.<br><br>Ceramics Superior Aesthetics:<br><br>Made with 100% metal free materials. Ceramic films will not have a shiny metallic appearance.<br>Made with 100% dyed free materials. Ceramic films will not fade, bubble or turn purple.<br>Ceramics Superior Performance:<br><br>Up to 67% total solar heat rejection.<br>Ceramic films deter wavelength interference with GPS systems and cell phones.<br>Decreases distracting glare, increasing the overall comfort.<br>Up to 91% infrared light rejection (IR)-the main cause of heat.<br>Virtually clear visibility during nighttime driving.<br>Ceramics Superior Protection:<br><br>Greater than 99% UV light rejection-the main cause of fading, cracking, heat and common hot spots.<br>SPF 200 protection from the suns cancer causing rays.<br>Helps to hold shattered glass together.<br>Helps to lower emissions - helping to protect the environment<br>Ceramic Based German Technology<br><br>Huper Optik uses a uses a unique German technology that creates a ceramic coating, which can spectrally select the rays to transmit. Alternate layers of ceramic coatings are deposited onto a continuous reel of ultra clear film to form the super heat rejection Huper Optik polyester shield. The end result is a high performing product that has its claims to being the first and the premier in the advanced window film industry.<br><br>Scratch Resistant Hard Coat<br><br>All Huper Optik Smart Films come with an acrylic based, pure hydrocarbon molecules hard coat. This protective top layer acts as a scratch resistant barrier to any minor abrasion through the normal care of the windows. All Huper Optik films are tested under ECE 43 abrasion test with the result of 1.3% haze measurement after test.</div>
