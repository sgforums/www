            <div class='col-md body'>I had a similar parking fine outside Parkway Parade.  Parked at the bus parking zone, but also has no waiting sign.  Only left for 5 minutes to pick up something inside.  Came back, the Cisco officer just printing the fine.  Say just appeal and he will agree to cancel.  I appeal, and he never responded, so TP refused to cancel my fine.  $70.<br><br>I didn't realize parking fine can get demerits.  I thought only moving violation can get demerit?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
