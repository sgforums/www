            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I'm truly shocked after reading the post by hippo-banana. That is exactly what I'm experiencing right now. They sent me an email saying a member reported damages after my reservation. And they're going to send me the damage repair invoice soon. The thing is, those scratches were already listed on their vehicle condition summary. In fact, the car has many other scratches.<br><br>Now, however, they're accusing me of not reporting the damages and because of that, I'll have to bear the cost of repair, supposedly "in accordance with their rules and regulations." I'm having none of that though as I have reasonable grounds to believe that those damages/scratches were already listed on their vehicle condition summary. I have since shot back an email to them and still awaiting their reply since.<br><br>What is troubling me now is the uncanny similarity between the situation hippo-banana faced and the one I'm facing now. I'm beginning to wonder, is this some sort of unscrupulous business tactic adopted by Cityspeed in getting members to foot the cost of repairs/maintenance of the cars? And how do we actually verify the exact cost of the damage repair? Let's say, they're accusing us of causing scratches to the front right-side of the fender. So how do we know that the cost of repair only pertains to that particular scratch and not repairs/maintenance to the whole car?<br><br>Besides CASE, are there any other legal avenues we can pursue? After all, I believe I've already abided by their rules and regulations in making sure that any defects not listed on the vehicle condition summary are promptly reported.<br><br>I sincerely hope all those who've experienced or are experiencing a similar situation with Cityspeed would come forward. Perhaps it's time we stand up for our consumer rights. For a start, I might be going to CASE soon and hoping to highlight this issue by writing to the forum pages of our print newspapers.</div>
