            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purpleAkira:</div><div class="quote_body">Hello Everyone here!!<br></div></blockquote>Hi ,<br><br>First, some common terminologies used in the trade to help you along.<br><br>New car - self explainatory.<br>2nd hand - Not brand new but the car is less than 10 years old.<br>COE car - Not brand new, but car has already exceeded/about to exceed 10 years, which means that the validity of the 1st 10-year COE has expired/about to expire and a second COE for the next 10 years is required.<br><br>Scene 1 - Imagine that you are a new car. Before the 1st owner buys you, he needs to have a COE. Price of the COE is dependant on the monthly bids (the one you hear on the news every month). After he gets successfully bids for COE, he registers you (together with the COE) at the LTA on 1st June 2000. The REGISTRATION DATE (1/6/2000) is therefore the official date that you are allowed to be driven on singapore roads. COE will expire 31/5/2010.<br><br>Scene 2 - 3 years passed, owner 1 decides to sell you. You are now to be sold as a 2ND-HAND car. Note that the COE that was bought previously stays with the car and not the owner. Therefore the selling price of the car would include the remaining validity of COE of the car. No need to buy a new COE. Owner 1 successfully sells you to owner 2.<br><br>Scene 3 - 7 more years passed. It is now early May 2010. Owner 2 has to make a decision. He can either scrap you (you will be scrapped at the scrapyard or exported out of singapore) and buy a new car, or pay for another COE to extend<br>your life on Singapore roads.<br><br>Scenerio 1 - he decides to scrap you. He sends you to the scrapyard and de-registers you. He receives a Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) certificate, which can be used to offset the cost of the next NEW car he buys. The value of the PARF is calculated by a formula depending on the age and the Open Market Value (OMV) of the car. The OMV is a portion of the total cost that Owner 1 paid when you were first bought as a new car and would be stated on the registration card. Note that the PARF value of a car is $0 after 10 years, which means that there will be no PARF value if the car is older than 10 years.<br><br>Scenario 2 - he decides to keep you. He would then need to pay for an "extension" COE. This "extension" COE need not be bidded. All cars are allowed to be extended and the cost of this "extension" COE is calculated from the average new COE prices of the last 3 months. This "extension" COE is also called the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) and is always also listed in an additional column when they announce the monthly COE results. By default, the PQP is also valid for 10 years, after which the owner can decide again whether to extend for a 3rd 10 years and so on... However, PQP can also be bought for 5 years validity at half the price. The condition for this is that the car would be required by law to be scrapped after this 5-year period. (There was a question abt this ruling recently in the papers and LTA's reply was that since the owner only decide to extend for 5 year instead of the normal 10 years, LTA assumes that the owner made this decision because the owner thinks that the condition of the car can last only 5 years more and therefore LTA regulates that it would have to be scrapped after the 5 years is up.)<br><br>This is the life-cycle of a car in Singapore. hope it helps you understand the system better. As for the dates that you mention, they would normally refer to either the registration date or the COE expiry date. Can use some common sense here to decide which is which. For example, now is August 2002. 7/2000 or 7/1999 would normally mean the registration date of the car, since it is before the current date. If it is 7/2004 or 7/2011, then it would normally mean COE expiry date.<br><br>You can also visit www.onemotoring.com.sg website for more info. It is the official commercial site for LTA and will explain alot of what I've explained above and much more (can also check for average used car prices as a guide etc).<br><br>And finally, just to share my personal budgeting principle when i first went about looking for a 2nd hand car... the value of downpayment that I will pay will be equal to the PARF value of the car (abt 10K for a 1.6l car). This will also be the money I get back (after the COE expires) to offset the next car i buy. I will also set what I am willing and can afford to pay as monthly downpayment (say $500/mth). With this in mind, every bloodsucking dealer i meet, I just ask for 3 numbers.<br>1) selling price<br>2) PARF value<br>3) no. of months more till expiry<br><br>Then I calculate... (1-2)/3 = $???. If $??? exceeds $500 then the car is too expensive for me... I stick to this principle, or else those glib-tongued dealers will definitely make you pay for more than you can afford...

It is a method of allocating a loan's interest and principal.<br><br>The Hire Purchase Act requires use of the rule of 78 for car loans where the car is valued at less than $55,000 without COE. (This is about $88,000 with COE.)<br><br>The rule applies most installment payments in the early years of a loan to payment of interest rather than principal.<br><br>Therefore, if you repay a 10 year loan in just 4 years, you will have more than 6 years of principal to repay.<br><br>An alternative to the rule of 78 is known as Â“monthly restÂ”. It is a variable rate which calculates interest charges using the effective interest rate (EIR). With this method, you pay interest charges only during the period that you borrow the money.<br><br>For this reason, Â“EIR with monthly restÂ” is considered a fairer method of calculating interest rates, especially when the loan is repaid before the due date.<br><br>HISTORY<br><br>Rule of 78 was popular as a short-hand method for calculating the remaining interest on a loan in the days before financial calculators.<br><br>In those early days, the rule of 78 was applied to all loans. Today it remains only for car loans.<br><br>In other countries, like the US, the rule of 78 has been dropped. It is not permitted for car loans of more than 5 years and it is rarely used for loans less than 5 years.<br><br>BANKS: THE RULE OF 78 IS OK!<br><br>Singapore banks take the position that the rule of 78 results in a fixed-rate loan which car-buyers prefer.<br><br>Banks also point out that the rule of 78 makes it only slightly more expensive to repay a car loan early. As an example, take a $90,000 7-year car loan charging 2.5 per cent flat rate interest.<br><br>If redeemed at the end of year 3, it will cost $240 more under the rule of 78 than it would if interest payments were calculated using the effective interest rate (EIR) with monthly rest. (This is a variable rate where interest rates are recalculated monthly).<br><br>While $240 on a $90,000 loan is not much, it is a substantial amount when aggregated over many car loans.<br><br>If banks switched from the rule of 78 to EIR, the total foregone interest would likely amount to tens of millions of dollars, which may explain the preference of banks for using "the rule of 78 + flat rates" for car loans.<br><br>HOW ABOUT "FIXED RATES WITH NO RULE OF 78"?<br><br>Banks state the problem as a choice between two alternatives: (i) fixed rates -- (which use "the rule of 78 + flat rates") OR (ii) variable rates -- (using EIR with monthly rest).<br><br>Banks overlook a third possibility: fixed rate loans using EIR without the rule of 78.<br><br>Other familiar loans use EIR without the rule of 78, including home loans, personal loans and credit card loans.<br><br>Take home loans. They offer two choices: variable and fixed rates -- with fixed rate loans costing more.<br><br>Home loans also quote only the effective interest rate. They do not quote a flat rate and do not use the rule of 78.<br><br>If applied to car loans, a buyer could choose between a 10-year fixed rate loan costing, say, 5 per cent vs. a 10-year variable rate loan costing 3 per cent. Both 5 and 3 per cent are effective rates. Since these are the interest rates you are really paying, there is no need to mention a flat rate.<br><br>It is not clear if banks will (i) follow a fixed rate model such as this or (ii) hang on to the antiquated "rule of 78 + flat interest rates".<br><br>When the Hire-Purchase Act is amended (by Oct 1), it will likely give banks more leeway to set terms and conditions as they see fit. Then, the principal of "buyer beware" will become more important for car loans and other installment loans.<br><br>FORMULA<br><br>Assume a loan is repaid early. Here is the formula for calculating the remaining interest to be returned to the borrower on a loan using the rule of 78:<br><br>Rebate of interest = [(n (n+1)) / (N (N + 1))] x TI<br><br>n = the number of months remaining on the loan<br><br>N = the total loan period<br><br>TI = the total interest charged over the period of the loan<br><br>You may recognize this as the sum of the yearÂ’s digits formula used in accounting to determine the rate of depreciation of assets.<br><br>This depreciation method is not permitted under Singapore or US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) because of the same problem that arises in its use under the rule of 78: it charges most depreciation in the early years which results in overly aggressive depreciation of assets.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
