            <div class='col-md body'>(Honestly and politely)<br>i sold my bodykit from tan chong for $300(if i can still remember) late last year, TC Body kit is so-so and the worst part is that once you take over the Tan Chong Kit to install it onto your car, the installer will have to drill holes into your chassis in order to fix the side skirt onto it-not good at all, ideally you should not be drilling holes into the body for obvious reasons such as rust(if rust externally is ok but due to the drilling rusting from internal may happen?)<br>Don't believe me about the holes, ask the guy that is selling you the kit to remove the side skirt and show you the side of his chasis.<br>then when you sell your car be prepared to fork out a couple of hundreds to get the sides fix if the next owner is not interested in your kit and tells you to remove the bodykit. oh yes, look at the front kit and you will notice that its not one full piece, there is a joint in the middle and it looks horrible...<br><br>I suggest that you look at other aftermarket kits which is installed without drilling holes into your chassis.<br><br>Sorry i do not log on to this site if you are planning to reply back,  occasionally i  do get a call from friends telling me to check out sites such as your postings so sms me if you have any questions.<br><br>Best<br><br>Lennie(97607170)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nitrate:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys/gals,<br><br>Anybody willing to sell your bodykit(original that came from Tan Chong)?

            <div class='col-md body'>1. What are the main lubrication problems in passenger car engines?.<br><br>MostLubrication problems for passenger car engines fall primarily into the following areas: [/color]<br><br>Â•Low-temperature or light-duty operation. This is when a car makes a lot of short trips that never allow the engine to reach its optimum operating temperature. Partially burned fuel byproducts can result in sludge deposits and excessive rust.<br>Â•High-temperature oxidation. Engine operating temperatures today are extremely high while the amount of oil in the sump is small, as little as four quarts. This severe heat stress on the oil can accelerate oil oxidation, resulting in oil thickening, loss of lubricating properties, varnish and piston deposits.<br>Â•Passenger car engines deliver high horsepower in relation to the size and weight of engine components. This places great stress on engine parts such as the valvetrain, which strains to provide the high cam lift and spring loads required for efficiency and high engine speeds.<br>Â•The use of air-pollution control devices such as positive crankcase ventilation and exhaust gas recirculation can increase the heat stress on an oil and increase the amount of contaminants in the oil.<br><br>2. How can I be sure I'm getting high-quality oil?<br><br>Ok, Throughout the world there are many differences in the oils. In general, name brand oil meets or exceeds automobile manufacturer specifications, industry standards and governmental regulations. Users should use the type of oil recommended in their vehicle handbook/owners manual or an oil that claims to be approved by the manufacturer of their vehicle. After this, owners may look to an industry standard, such as from JASO, ACEA or API, for guidance. The licenses ILSAC Certification Mark or "starburst symbol" to be placed on the front of oil bottles, certifying that those oils are the appropriate oil for gasoline-powered passenger cars, light trucks, minivans and SUVs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Vandagal,<br><br>Yes I saw you too in Braddel Rd.<br><br>Shanghai was quite happening and a real eye-opener.  Travelled the usual route to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing and back to Shanghai. Unfurtunately since I cannot speak Mandarin, I could not quite enjoy myself.<br><br>Foodwise, I think the standard in Sgp and HK is much better. I think the northerners prefer to drink more than to eat, whereas the southerners are the opposite.<br><br>I probably can not make it for this Sat as I still have a number of things to prepare for my trip this Sat to NZ. Only going to stay in North Island, not much travelling. Should be back on Nov 11<br><br>Do you know if March Moo has the r/c cars? I e-mailed her but have not received a reply. If you are in touch tell her to keep the cars for me till I return.<br><br>Cheers for now,<br><br>Toadie</div>
