U have to sound the horn by pressing on the left or the right side of the round piece where there's a trumpet logo on it. that's the only 2 parts that u can successfully sound the horn of our marchies without any great effort!<br><br>hope i have not confuse u any further.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>oh ya 1 more thing.....u do not need to remove the front bumper to change the horn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  couple of our guys have done it already. no prob at all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
