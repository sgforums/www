You will feel the ultimate difference..for best effects,it will be good if you can put a coat of HIGLAZE88 directly from the bottle without mixing water and polish for the 1st time onli....HIGLAZE88 is a sealant...i have been using it for the past 4yrs..ultimate product..<br><br>the above is up to individual..cheers</div>

Just like the 2-in-1 shampoo some of us use. Sure there's a difference between the 2-in-1 shampoo and stand alone shampoo and conditional.

Soft99 Authentic Excellent (for gross finish), Water repellent wax (you sould see how the water slide off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ), Fuzzo Coat (it's a sealent).

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello e-blossom!<br><br>I was in the same boat as you! Booked my car in early october. Couldn't get my COE bids after 2 consecutive bids! At around 3.10pm today, I was advised by my agent to pay an extra $1k more to revise my COE bid upwards for this bidding. I agreed as I didn't want to wait anymore. Within 10 mins, my bid was revised to $14,001, which was exactly the closing price of the COE!! You can imagine how my heart nearly missed a BEAT when I saw my reserve price is exactly the same as the closing price. I was quite lucky to have secured the COE right on the dot! Maybe you can try this method for the next bidding.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I will get my car in mid-dec. CAN'T wait!!!!!!!!
