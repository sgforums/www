This is to project the character and image of the model/make the designer wants to project.<br><br>Racing Red looks nice on a Alfa Romeo, but try putting that on a Jaguar. similarly Yellow is nice on a Lamborgini but not on a Mercedes, or dark green on a VW beetle...<br><br>That is why you see only a few selected stock colours on the colour chart of a model and make. of course economy plays part of the role. but mainly its the suitability of the colours to the car.<br><br>the march is a "lively" and "happening" car, its for youngsters, ladies or happening pple. apart from being suitable in serious colours like black and brown (sexy!), it can also accomodate bold colours like bright yellow, orange or brown.<br><br>its like Brad Pitt will look nice even in singlet and slippers. Ah Bengs will look like Ah Beng even in tuxedos.<br><br>this is one wonderful feature that not many cars can shout about, and we should be proud of it.<br><br></div>
