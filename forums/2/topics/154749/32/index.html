It depend on whether TC can negotiate wif Nissan to fit in the old 1.4l into the facelifted model. Oversea spec may or may not follow japan. The thing i see is tat TC is stopping sale of March since it is not a volume seller.<br><br>I dun think there's any production problem since the facelift model was launched abt 5 mths back. Even the cefiro which was facelifted last mth is scheduled to arrive here in April.<br><br>I heard that Note is strictly a domestic model for the time being. No further info on tat. Anyway, it would be impossible to get a new March now since there's no more stock left or coming in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear potential and existing owners,<br><br>We have been reading trends and posting abt the new 1.5L march facelift launched in Oct 05, other models replacing the March 1.4L and lastly retain the existing model with stock replace scheduled to arrive in April 06.<br><br>In conclusion, whatever models of Nissan cars being imported into Singapore it is base on market demands here, cost, retail pricing and etc ! Sad to say a lot of beautify japanese cars manufactured in Japan will never be seen here regards to specs/demands/cost.<br><br>The truth is TC is an agent for Nissan Japan, whatever models will be sold here, depends on them and the market. What comes into SIN and what is not meant for local market. We being the smaller group who loves march can never decide or create more demands to turn our march into a cash cow for them and replace the latio/sunny. Domestic market here is small !<br><br>For sure there are other solution which will be parallel import !<br><br>Â“To each itÂ’s ownÂ” &amp; Â“chose and purchase what you desireÂ”<br><br></div>

News were flying around and we had posted it to share. It just news without confirmation "if you ever read the trends".<br><br>It all depends on TC, as mention how the furture/fate of the "MARCH" depends on the market demands. And the volume of sales for march is not like the latio or sunny !<br><br>There are 3 Scenario here which we have been sharing since,<br>1. The present model march might not be imported in and replacing it with other new models. ( not sure no true facts yet )<br><br>2. Hopefully, the new facelife of 1.5L CVTC march will be launch here and replace the old model... May be pricing is an issue for the 1.5L and low demands for march = low sales. Might not be importing into SIN, becos demand is low ?  ( not sure no true facts yet )<br><br>3. Repenish stock of the 1.4L (AT4) BK-12 March in april. We dun work for TC, but we do hear news. (May happen or May not)<br><br>I hope you are clear now and be ready to make your own decision.<br><br>"TO EACH IT'S OWN"<br><br></div>

Although it may be a bit more pricey than the K12, it will prob have all the bells and whistles from the Elegance model, ie. keyless entry, digital climate control, 6 airbags, 15" rubbers, and not to mention a much livelier engine! All this will more than make up for the increase in price, can't wait to see it!<br><br>If I hear anything from Evelyn, I'll be sure to let the rest of you know. For all of you who already own a March, congrats! You are the proud owner of a limited edition, out-of-production k12 Marchie haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  For the rest of ya, eat your heart out.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rumors or facts, at this point if you should understand the domestic market demands from the trends that you read. Mobile phones and movies vs cars are different market overall. The value of goods are different....!<br><br>With Acquisition power as a buyer and also understanding the market demands for certain particular models, can tell you why higher sales volume cars will always be the priority to car Agents ! Some car designs only appeals to some potential buyers but might not appeal to the mass..!<br>Is all abt business !!! Sunny is a cash cow....!<br><br>We cannot be writing or posting untrue information hereÂ….. News are out, is just pending confirmation. Like Blade, Wheels on Fire, Karman and some others here are trying to share an overview.<br><br>Decision making is on you and yr bf, Answers are thereÂ….! May be time is a critical factor for you at this point.<br><br>1. The 1.2 L Ak12 / 1.4L bk12 was launched in 2002/03 by TC and other parallel importersÂ….(the rest is history !) Indeed this car won the euro design of the year in 2002, but does it mean it is selling like hot cakes here, compare to the sunny that sells better ! Till today you dun see a lot of march on the road... and dun forget some of them crash out or being export out ! (The offical launch of the march was in 04 Nov.. after 2 years of arrival ?) ?????<br><br>2. stocks in Singapore are out at present and indeed we are exclusive becos of discounted possibility for now,(" is limited edition Â” for all existing k12 owners )<br><br>3. Is either, Â“replacement stock of 1.4L AT, bring in "C+C" or replaced by other models Â“ By March / April all of us will know, when TC management breaks the news with the announcement. They always change decision to suit the market demands... let's wait ! (the 1.5L is not coming in )<br><br>My personal feel, no offenceÂ… I would prefer the idea of replacing the Â“March k12 seriesÂ” with other designs. The C+C can blow your minds away... !<br><br>to each it's own ! good luck...........</div>

Although it may be a bit more pricey than the K12, it will prob have all the bells and whistles from the Elegance model, ie. keyless entry, digital climate control, 6 airbags, 15" rubbers, and not to mention a much livelier engine! All this will more than make up for the increase in price, can't wait to see it!<br><br>If I hear anything from Evelyn, I'll be sure to let the rest of you know. For all of you who already own a March, congrats! You are the proud owner of a limited edition, out-of-production k12 Marchie haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  For the rest of ya, eat your heart out.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Yoyoyoyoyo all the K12 owner all stand up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>long time no see lah,<br>i would say the car sales peeps know shit abt wat model will be coming cos the only concend is the sell the current stock they have...<br>and i dun think TC management will tell them in the 1st place.<br>so in a nut shell this is wat they will say"march no stock leh,How abt a latio? or sunny? also not bad"<br><br>The all time low COE means peeps who buy the new K12 will get all the freebies throwed in."that is provided is TC bring in the new facelift k12,shf not see so much of a price up..even if a price up i will not mind cos more<br>BHP=a better pull=a better ride=more peeps getting smoke by a cute car=a happer driver <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What i"m more worried is that K12 gets knifed by TC<br><br>Limited edition =high or no spare parts and body parts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>BTW any of the boys here know how to replace the spark plugs? i try the whole day can't fig where to screw out the plug.
