Thurs 8 Dec, 6.30pm, yellow box junction of Balestier Road and Jln Datoh. I was on Balestier Road going straight towards Whampoa. The orange March driven by a young lady with short hair was trying to turn left from Jln Datoh to Balestier Road. She was at the yellow box, 45 degrees on first lane and turning to 2nd lane. I was going straight on 2nd lane approaching yellow box. Although I had right of way as I was going straight on main road, I was driving at low speed and I could easily have stopped for her to turn into 2nd lane. It was also the safer thing to do since any collision would be from my front into her driverÂ’s side. Instead, I tapped my horn twice, she stopped her car and I went straight. She turned after I passed. I glanced at my rear view mirror and saw what I thought could be a P plate. I couldnÂ’t tell the number of the car.<br><br>IÂ’ve thought about it over the weekend and I felt really bad.

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>I just scratched my poor little marchie!!! I was turning out of the tampines mall carpark and I was too close to left side, before I realised, my car just brushed past the walls of the carpark and all I heard was the "screeech" sound. I was like "OH NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>Quickly went back home to check the condition of the car. GOsh! There are some scratches on the left back door and somewhere near the left rear wheel.<br><br>Immediately went down to the Nissan service centre and they touched up the scratches for me. For re-spraying, I need to pay abt $190 per panel!! Its super expensive lor. Does anyone knows of a reliable shop who can do the job at a cheaper price?<br><br>*sobz sobz*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Vellerina<br><br>$190 per panel sounds expensive. Does TC have an in-house spray paint bay, or are paint jobs outsourced? If it is outsourced, you will be better off going straight to the workshops that do the job.<br><br>There are two workshops that I have good experience with for my car. The first is Hup Seng at Blk 1003 Bt Merah Lane 3 (Tel: 62719909). My Volvo agent outsources paintjobs to this workshop. The 2nd one is Yew Lip Spray Painting at Blk 15 Sin Ming Industrial Estate (Tel: 64536600). The owner is a lady called Angie and the workshop is very popular among car clubs. She's very well-known for repairing curb rashes at $25 per rim. Her charges are not expensive and workmanship's not bad.<br><br>Hope this helps. I'm not linked to both businesses. Anyway, no harm calling them up to get an indicative quote and if you are happy, make a trip down and bargain.<br><br>If you hang around car clubs, a handful of common workshops for body panel touch-up jobs keep coming up. They are Lye Design at AMK Industrial Pk 2 and ADSM at Kim Chuan Drive. I don't have any experiences with them so can't comment.</div>

I did something that I wasnÂ’t proud of, so the least I could do is find out where the Nissan March drivers hang out and hopefully find the driver and make an apology.<br><br>What happened? Thurs 8 Dec, 6.30pm, yellow box junction of Balestier Road and Jln Datoh. I was on Balestier Road going straight towards Whampoa. The orange March driven by a young lady with short hair was trying to turn left from Jln Datoh to Balestier Road. She was at the yellow box, 45 degrees on first lane and turning to 2nd lane. I was going straight on 2nd lane approaching yellow box. Although I had right of way as I was going straight on main road, I was driving at low speed and I could easily have stopped for her to turn into 2nd lane. It was also the safer thing to do since any collision would be from my front into her driverÂ’s side. Instead, I tapped my horn twice, she stopped her car and I went straight. She turned after I passed. I glanced at my rear view mirror and saw what I thought could be a P plate. I couldnÂ’t tell the number of the car.<br><br>IÂ’ve thought about it over the weekend and I felt really bad. If there is any mitigating factor, I was running late for my evening class, but thatÂ’s really no excuse for bad driving behavior. Worst, I was a bad example to a P-plate driver.<br><br>In the remote chance that you folks here know the driver or know the incident I've related, do let the driver know that:<br><br>Â“White Volvo S40T4 says sorry to you. My driving behavior was unbecoming and I was unkind. I should have stopped and given way to you, rather than using my horns and insisting on my right of way. This is not how I normally drive, IÂ’m not proud of what I have done and IÂ’m truly sorry. Please accept my apology. whitet4@lycos.com.Â”<br><br>IÂ’ve posted this at MARCH1Z folder at sgforums and Nissan Club at Delphi. Have I missed any other popular hangouts? If I have, let me know and thanks in advance.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Hi,<br><br>I know which orange nissan march is that as that is my area. She ain't a member of our club though i have stick flyers on her car before. I will paste your apology on her car.<br><br>Good luck and keep driving safely.<br></div>
