            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i been told by a friend via msn that your car have been broken into thus my reply to you.<br><br>The car alarm would have stop them from creating greater damage.<br>As to break into the car engine to stop the alarm, its not an easy task to do that nor is it hard to stop the alarm but it will be a real challenge for them to disable the alarm as security guards might just arrive due to all the noise and lights from your car..<br>But i will still say that a car alarm would/might have scared them away for obvious reason(s)..<br><br>I have a car alarm installed(crimestopper) and my sensitivity is set to medium..anyhow thats beside the point, if you are interested in getting an alarm please email me and i will tell you the cost and where to install it because not all alarms are compatible for the k12, if you install the wrong alarm then you might run into alot of problems with the immobilizer and of cos you wouldnt be able to use the auto engine start function etc etc that comes with the alarm as well, but the good thing is that you are still able to use the remote door commander that came  from Tan Chong...<br><br>i hope this is of help to you.<br><br>regards,<br>Lennie<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by faded mango:</div><div class="quote_body">don't know about car alarms, they always go to engine to stop the alarm..smart robbers</div></blockquote></div>

However, went to Tan Chong recently and was told that they will be bringing in a new model (i.e., not March) and that there are no more Marches for sale.  But they don't know what new model it will be yet.  I told them someone here in the forum mentioned a facelifted March using the 1.5 Latio engine, but the SE said no, not facelifted March, it will be a totally new model.  What is it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Is true that our MARCH k12 is discounted in japan and it is being replace with a new facelift which was launched in Oct 05 in japan. www.nissan.co.jp click on march and you will be able to view the new facelift. What you see on road will be those you can get your hands on for 2nd hand. Is true that TC no longer carrying this modelÂ…. Â“MARCHÂ”<br><br>News have been flying around abt the arriver of the new facelift in SG, again Â“willÂ” TC bring in to market it in Sg is another question???? The market demand for march is much lesser thanÂ….. the latio and sunny. As sunny is cash cow for TCÂ…! For us it will be good news if TC decides not to bring in any more March for the 1.5 L in 2006. We will wait for the news....!<br><br>Secondly, there will be more new cars from Nissan launching and arriving here next year which is true for TC to advise on the up and coming models. These models will appeal to the majority of the crowd believe me the march only appeals to those who like it. It is your call to wait till Feb/ March 06 or hunt for a 2nd march now. If you are looking for a 2nd hand March, do take note of the 1.2L and the 1.4L.<br><br>Do email us march1z@yahoo.com or micrarider@yahoo.com to chat and understand more on the march.<br><br>Cheers and Happy New Year.<br><br></div>

(Admittedly, I like the March myself too.)  However, went to Tan Chong recently and was told that they will be bringing in a new model (i.e., not March) and that there are no more Marches for sale.  But they don't know what new model it will be yet.  I told them someone here in the forum mentioned a facelifted March using the 1.5 Latio engine, but the SE said no, not facelifted March, it will be a totally new model.  What is it?</div></blockquote>I guess the SE is referring to the new Sunny (or bluebird slyphy in Japan) that just went on sale. It's also equipt with Latio 1.5l engine or 2.0l Cefiro engine. Price will be significantly higher than current Sunny.</div>
