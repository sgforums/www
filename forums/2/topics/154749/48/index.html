            <div class='col-md body'>No offense to the brothers and sisters of the Nissan March club. The March K12 is a wonderful car, the club has nice people, but I have problems with people who sprout bullshits.<br><br>Let us look at some of the mod advise/definition given to the club here:<br><br>They are to the equivalent of saying:<br><br>"A non-mod car is a stock car" and "A non-stock car is a mod car"<br><br>and another:<br><br>"A mod is a mod"<br><br>even a retard in a hurry, can tell that this is the purest form of bullshit.<br><br>What kind of self respected modders can go away with this nonsense, and the more so "yaya papaya" than I am?! This is not an issue of "2 each his own" anymore, this is an insult to all modders.<br><br>Yes you all are right, I do not have much time to go about other's forum. I happen to stumble on this and see someone giving stupid advise. Your nice club should not accommodate such kind of bullshits.<br><br>There is no need for a Mazda 3 to hide under the name of M3. Mazda has their strong areas and they are proud to carry their own name. To say Mazda 3 is an M3 is an insult to the Mazda instead.<br><br>I met up one of your committee yesterday at his "invitation" and have noted his points. He is right, I had better Â“hands offÂ” this forum before the flame war spread to between the Mazda club and you.<br><br>Yes, I have many partners both female and male to occupy my lifestyle, I really donÂ’t have time for this forum as much as I would like to, but you can PM me on other interests if you like.<br><br>Not all who own a decent car are out to woo girls, this is too shallow for me.<br><br>Happy modding and wish you, the Nissan March club all the best!

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Marchies,<br><br>Here are some engine oil tips,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>1. What are the main lubrication problems in passenger car engines?.<br><br>MostLubrication problems for passenger car engines fall primarily into the following areas:<br><br>Â•Low-temperature or light-duty operation. This is when a car makes a lot of short trips that never allow the engine to reach its optimum operating temperature. Partially burned fuel byproducts can result in sludge deposits and excessive rust.<br>Â•High-temperature oxidation. Engine operating temperatures today are extremely high while the amount of oil in the sump is small, as little as four quarts. This severe heat stress on the oil can accelerate oil oxidation, resulting in oil thickening, loss of lubricating properties, varnish and piston deposits.<br>Â•Passenger car engines deliver high horsepower in relation to the size and weight of engine components. This places great stress on engine parts such as the valvetrain, which strains to provide the high cam lift and spring loads required for efficiency and high engine speeds.<br>Â•The use of air-pollution control devices such as positive crankcase ventilation and exhaust gas recirculation can increase the heat stress on an oil and increase the amount of contaminants in the oil.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">2. How can I be sure I'm getting high-quality oil? </span><br><br>Ok, Throughout the world there are many differences in the oils. In general, name brand oil meets or exceeds automobile manufacturer specifications, industry standards and governmental regulations. Users should use the type of oil recommended in their vehicle handbook/owners manual or an oil that claims to be approved by the manufacturer of their vehicle. After this, owners may look to an industry standard, such as from JASO, ACEA or API, for guidance. The licenses ILSAC Certification Mark or "starburst symbol" to be placed on the front of oil bottles, certifying that those oils are the appropriate oil for gasoline-powered passenger cars, light trucks, minivans and SUVs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

The March K12 is a wonderful car, the club has nice people, but I have problems with people who sprout bullshits.<br><br>Let us look at some of the mod advise/definition given to the club here:<br><br>They are to the equivalent of saying:<br><br>"A non-mod car is a stock car" and "A non-stock car is a mod car"<br><br>and another:<br><br>"A mod is a mod"<br><br>even a retard in a hurry, can tell that this is the purest form of bullshit.<br><br>What kind of self respected modders can go away with this nonsense, and the more so "yaya papaya" than I am?! This is not an issue of "2 each his own" anymore, this is an insult to all modders.<br><br>Yes you all are right, I do not have much time to go about other's forum. I happen to stumble on this and see someone giving stupid advise. Your nice club should not accommodate such kind of bullshits.<br><br>There is no need for a Mazda 3 to hide under the name of M3. Mazda has their strong areas and they are proud to carry their own name. To say Mazda 3 is an M3 is an insult to the Mazda instead.<br><br>I met up one of your committee yesterday at his "invitation" and have noted his points. He is right, I had better Â“hands offÂ” this forum before the flame war spread to between the Mazda club and you.<br><br>Yes, I have many partners both female and male to occupy my lifestyle, I really donÂ’t have time for this forum as much as I would like to, but you can PM me on other interests if you like.<br><br>Not all who own a decent car are out to woo girls, this is too shallow for me.<br><br>Happy modding and wish you, the Nissan March club all the best!
