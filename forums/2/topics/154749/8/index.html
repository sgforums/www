( tho can i do that with my stock setup? what are the cons in lowering my ride?)</div></blockquote>It depends on what you are looking for, and only a few brands will have a fit for K12. Is better off understanding what you want a comfortable ride or better handling. What is your aim to lower your car.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>1. Lower springs<br><br>Just the springs only u can go to Ubi "fong kim" abt $300 plus and u can use the stock socks.. life span may be 1 to 2 years....before you change the socks.<br>- kg/mm ( Distributor in sg, closed down ) not sure if you can find it.<br>not bad for mid feel, not to hard. ( after lower springs - front 3 finger, back 2finger)  The other porduct is the Tien lower springs<br><br>2. COil Overs<br><br>Replacing the springs and socks ! Tien is good... but is hard. Not sure if you can handle that kind of hard ride..! After lowering is abt 2 fingers for front and back..! used to use tien coil overs for abt 2 weeks...! is too hard for a small car to take in hard beatings on the road....! again it depends on what you want..! The nismo coil overs are considered the top suspensions for K12 !<br><br>For sure coil overs are 100% better than just lower springs..! As for what MC well is selling, you can go try it and check it...! We have pple in de club using Tein coil overs,  tein lowered springs, KG/MM lower springs and Nismo G attack coil overs.<br><br>"to each it's own" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

Was trying to upload photos on this site but couldn't leh... When I first opened the box of the remote control Marchie, I was cursing my luck cos I didn't know that I have to self-assembled it and I am never good in assembling model planes, cars, etc.  Moreover, the instructions are all in Japanese.... Surprisingly, I managed to assemble both of the cars and felt like a great achievement in the end....Perhaps its my never die spirit to get the Marchie done that I manage to overcome all odds to get them done....The Kiwi Green Marchie cost HK$ 90 plus while the Citron Yellow cost HK$ 60 plus....Cheap cheap lah.... Both are of the same size but the Kiwi Green Marchie is powered by a better motor and is claimed by the manufacturer (Tomy) that it can go faster than the Citron Yellow one....I have tried them out but seems like their speed is almost the same.....Maybe we can have a race one of these days.... Urrgghhhh....Unfortunately, they dun have a bean green one....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  I also bought some cute small Marchie replica cars, similar to the Orange ones that you can find in the market here but they are in Kiwi Green, Citron Yellow and Lavender colour instead.... Very rare colours indeed....<br><br>Will buy the remote-control ones for you on my next trip to HK on 4 Nov...The Citron Yellow and Kiwi Green, right?

I wish I was there. I drove my Marchie along KL and Petaling Jaya districts over the past few days and it gathered a lot of attention among the local folks. Was driving around 160km/hr for an hour or so along the NS highway and was eventually pulled over by the traffic cops who gave a second look at my car and then decided to let me go, probably thinking that such a small car couldn't possible go above the speed limit of 110km/hr....This also happened to me on my last driving trip up North...I think our Marchie is now Malaysian traffic cops-friendly..One more reason for me to buy the Marchie in the first place...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety74</div>

As what you see in Jap car mag... less than i finger above ground...!<br><br>If your car is E model, there is no worries for scrapping the belly if you are lowering springs only, as the stock front, side add ons are not that huge and what rims will you be changing..! lower your car 1st before you change rims...! 15/16 inch..rims. Even with Nissan stock stocks and springs try 1+3 load you will cream you car...! ( have to let the E model folks to comment on that)<br><br>Your stock camry socks are soft, and also the way you drive should be zig Z. Strait in or down you will cream the bottom with so many pple.<br><br>There is a OEM stopper to hold the springs from lowering further when you have passagers.. if you install  OEM lower springs to prevent it from lowering further. OEM springs are harder ! your march will not face the same problem..Stock socks with full load will cream hums and slops in multi carparks.<br><br>If you are looking for lower springs is abt $400+ install. Dun need coil overs ! Springs will never give way or spoil easily is the socks that u should worry abt when you lower springs and use stock socks....!<br><br>Try to understand your ride from stock before you change any thing... i bet you can feel the body roll of your stock car when cornering or even turing. Not forgetting hard braking you can feel you car lowering forward when trying to stop quickly. Stock springs are too soft. after you lower, you can feel better handling when taking a corner and lesser body roll.. the size of rims effects it and the rest comes in as higher FC and etc. And it goes on and on..! i guess you will understand. You change some thing you will lose something..!<br><br>Need any lobang call me 81630325 or sent me a PS. tks...!<br><br></div>

It depends on the level of damage to your paint work !!! Did the streak marks rub through your 1st and 2nd lever of lacquer, a normal japaese factory car has 5 layers ( 1 base code + 2 layers of paint + 2 layers of lacquer). Too often machine buffing will cause your lacquer to wear off quickly...! if the streak marks are Superficial, a buff can do the job to restore shine.<br><br>No point heading to TC, as they will charge you a huge amountÂ… there are shops around to restore paint work and also repair rim damages..! cant help unless the damage is being access.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Kamen for the pics and for organising the event last Saturday. Really had a great time. Only thing is that the stretch of TPless road is too short. Should have u turn and go one more round <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> However the waterfall was very refreshing even though a couple of us donated blood  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, Javanese massage was bruising for some but relaxing for others and also some can't seemed to have enough "purging air" by wacking the ginger ale. Seafood dinner was good but shopping at Giant was a bit shacked due to the size of the place and the days activities.<br><br>Anyway good first time for us and also good first time for Elainey who daringly joined us even though she never met us before. Welcome to the family  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . And good to explore some not so popular spots in JB. Someone called me this morning after joining us last Saturday and was asking us to organise Melaka this Saturday, so Kamen what say you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
