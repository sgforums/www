What are you doing?'<br><br>But the man did not respond. Nor did anyone come to Mr Wei's aid.<br>As the cars in front drove off, the thief seized his opportunity and sped away, throwing him to the side of the street.<br>Mr Wei shouted for help and finally found a driver who picked him up and gave chase.<br>But after 10 minutes of searching, they gave up - the thief was gone.<br>The whole incident lasted about 15 minutes.<br>Mr Wei's wife, meanwhile, called the police.<br>Johor police later arrived on the scene and drove the couple to the Central Police Station to make a police report.<br>When interviewed yesterday, Mr Wei told The Straits Times that he saw no signs of tampering with the car door or the window when he approached the thief.<br>He said he goes to JB regularly to have his car waxed at a shop in the basement of the Holiday Plaza. This was his 12th visit in 18 months.<br>Mr Wei said he will lose nearly $30,000 worth of cash and items, even with the payout from his insurance company.<br>Among the items in the car were a notebook PC, two iPods and a newly installed stereo system worth $5,000.<br>He also suffered minor cuts on his hands, face and elbows. Both his knees were bleeding.<br>He and his wife have been shaken by the incident.<br>Said Mrs Wei: 'We hope to warn other Singaporeans going to Johor to take extra precautions with their vehicles. You can never be too careful.'<br>In a bid to crack down on street crime, Johor police say there are plans to enlist bus and taxi drivers as lookouts as part of a community-based initiative.<br>A network of street cameras will also be set up around the city.<br>The cameras will be wirelessly linked to a police control centre.<br>Last year, Singapore visitors made about 7.06 million trips to Johor.<br>About 150 motorcycles and more than 70 cars from Singapore were stolen in Johor last year, compared to about 180 motorcycles and 100 cars in 2004.<br>zengyan@sph.com.sg<br><br>sian.................................... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
