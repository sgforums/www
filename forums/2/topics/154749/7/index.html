ICE-MAN and the Gauges dude ! hahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Why would you consider Vacum, for a start a Tach meter is the most important part of your running in peroid.  If you want to change bulb you should change your delay together with the bulbs...! what you will encounter will be changing of bulbs every 6months if you dun change delay, the bulbs will blow off quickly, dun forget the fuse too !... secondly the delay will burnout after a year or so ! cost of replacement is abt $300 plus for the delay... ! Best solution a pair of OEM HID headlamp set cost abt $600 plus, remove all your future problems..!<br><br>ICE, can be mixed and match ! It also depends on what you want (entry level or mid level). You can check out what kind of package the above shop will offer you and what "brands"... ! ! You can ask TC to remove your head unit and ask for solar firm or other goodies to replace the head unit...! the stock head unit is "trash ". .. sorry pple is true. ! rather you exchange for some thing else..! Is not even worth $50 in the second hand market. Our stock speakers are paper con... can't produce much impact...! go shop around audio shops ! need recommendations for good service can msg me.<br><br>2 Twitter<br>2 front speakers<br>2 back<br>1 sub<br>2 Amps<br>1 head unit ( single or double )<br>1 pre-Amps<br></div>

How much do you spend per month depends on :<br>a) the type of petrol you prefer<br>b) the amount of distance you travel per mth.<br>c) car wash (this is subjective, some prefer to pay a sum to get it done by others while others prefer to DIY)<br><br>Servicing will comes in 1k, 5k, 10k, 20k, 30k.... (refer to your driver's manual). You have a choice of either going back to TC for servicing or you can find your own workshop.<br><br>2) As for fuel consumption, maybe the rest of the guys here may poll in?</div>
