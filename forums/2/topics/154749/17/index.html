Would say you follow your heart in chosing a March. Chosing the Toyotas will be following your head.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Was in your dillema a year and a half back but guess i never regretted getting a March as i drive among the Corollas and Vios.

            <div class='col-md body'>Topic: OIL FILTER CHANGE !<br><br>The oil filer's primary function is to "sift" or remove oil contaminants. The filter allows oil to flow through while restricting solid contaminants, preventing them from re-entering the engine lubricating areas. When the oil filter element becomes full or "clogged", the oil and contaminants flow around the filter element. This is called "by-passing." Â….. By-passing occurs, contaminants return to the engine, possibly causing damage to moving parts, accelerating sludge formation.<br>When Automotive air filters have always required periodic maintenance. An automotive engine runs much smoother when the air filter is clean. If the filter is wet, damaged, or dirty, it should be replaced with a new one designed specifically for your engine. Running your car with a clogged filter could result in hard stalling, stalling and poorer Fuel Consumption. An air filter may become clogged or loaded with contaminate quicker, depending on the nature of the area where the vehicle is driven, such as dusty conditions. A damaged filter can cause the engine to have excessive wear.<br>The most common way to determine if a new filter is needed is by a visual check and judgment call. If you have loads of cash, then change the oil filters every oil change..!<br></div>

By still you can try asking TC if they have stocks for the next shipment for this old model ! No harm trying.<br><br>There is also a new model March launched in Oct 05.. it might be coming in, more fresh and sleek colors to chose from. www.nissan.co.jp. check it.<br><br>Take your time to decide...! good luck and cheers !<br></div>
