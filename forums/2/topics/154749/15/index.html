What are the main lubrication problems in passenger car engines?.<br><br>MostLubrication problems for passenger car engines fall primarily into the following areas: [/color]<br><br>Â•Low-temperature or light-duty operation. This is when a car makes a lot of short trips that never allow the engine to reach its optimum operating temperature. Partially burned fuel byproducts can result in sludge deposits and excessive rust.<br>Â•High-temperature oxidation. Engine operating temperatures today are extremely high while the amount of oil in the sump is small, as little as four quarts. This severe heat stress on the oil can accelerate oil oxidation, resulting in oil thickening, loss of lubricating properties, varnish and piston deposits.<br>Â•Passenger car engines deliver high horsepower in relation to the size and weight of engine components. This places great stress on engine parts such as the valvetrain, which strains to provide the high cam lift and spring loads required for efficiency and high engine speeds.<br>Â•The use of air-pollution control devices such as positive crankcase ventilation and exhaust gas recirculation can increase the heat stress on an oil and increase the amount of contaminants in the oil.<br><br>2. How can I be sure I'm getting high-quality oil?<br><br>Ok, Throughout the world there are many differences in the oils. In general, name brand oil meets or exceeds automobile manufacturer specifications, industry standards and governmental regulations. Users should use the type of oil recommended in their vehicle handbook/owners manual or an oil that claims to be approved by the manufacturer of their vehicle. After this, owners may look to an industry standard, such as from JASO, ACEA or API, for guidance. The licenses ILSAC Certification Mark or "starburst symbol" to be placed on the front of oil bottles, certifying that those oils are the appropriate oil for gasoline-powered passenger cars, light trucks, minivans and SUVs.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main reason oil goes bad is because it's viscosity breaks down. In other words it gets thinner. Heat cycles break down the viscosity. The more the oil goes from room temperature to operating temperature to room temperature again the faster it looses viscosity. The limiting factor would be the oil filters ability to keep the oil free of dirt/deposites. If a car is taken on alot of very short trips the limiting factor will be the viscosity because of the heat cycles. Your engine manual will give you recomended changing intervals. ( The handbook is just a guide)<br><br>Synthetic oil is not always desirable because of it's inter action with some material. Do some reaserch on your particular application and always consult the owners manual.<br><br>1. 5W-30 is around 60 cST at 40Â°C and around 12 cST at 100Â°C.<br>2. 10W-30 is around 66 cST at 40Â°C and around 12 cST at 100Â°C.<br><br>The generic interval is 5000 km + - but the true interval is found in the owners' manual. Second, your particular type of driving affects when it is time for an oil change. If most of your driving consists of short trips or commutes (under 30 km) and a lot of rush hour, stop-and-go driving then your oil changes are under the 5000 km "severe" service schedule. Oil needs to be hot (about 1500 degrees) for maximum flow. Short trips and frequent stops do not allow for ideal oil circulation to moving parts inside the engine. If the car is used primarily for short trips ( city driving), or routinely operated in dusty conditions or slow-moving traffic, the oil should be changed more frequently. In general, changing the oil at more frequent intervals will help better protect the engine, and promote longer engine life. Oil should be changed every (5000 km).  However, if your commute is mostly highway driving greater than 30 km + -, one way with few stops and outside of rush hour traffic, oil changes can be extended a bit (about 5000 Â– 7000 km). Finally, if your engine is serviced with synthetic oil your intervals can be extended beyond 5000 km + -<br><br>To each it's own ! logically speaking changing of engine oil at every 5k interval is good for you car, especially in this local climate. Is like changing new or fresh blood just at the Optimal level, is nothing under Optimization / usage. What do you gain of stretching the oil to 7,000 km-10,000 km. Compare to you purchasing your ride at $50k-$80k for your March vs servicing cost of a few hundreds to maintain your car for a period of 3-5-7-10 years. Your call...!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  Dun forget the other factor the Car itself.. ! performance Car, turbo cars or just a normal saloon Car will affect the interval and how often you need to charge oil.<br><br>I personally change my oil at (5000 km +-) for 5w30 Mobil One USA Version. $16plus per bottle. I tried 5w 40 shell from 11k-19k before i switch to 5w 30.<br>I am 80% driving on highway and per trip from home to work is abt 31km x2 for one more trip back to home. BUt i still change at abt 5k.<br><br>"Love your ride and she will treat you well"<br><br></div>

In de house.<br>Do come on down for meet ups.. By any chance is your number plate starting SFP**** E-model.<br><br>If you want your dashboard to be pink you can wrap pink leather over it.<br>Secondly spraying the dashboard pink, the idea is not reversible once you spray it. Will cost you much more to re spray if you decide pink dun fit in the interior color, after which. Thirdly, you can use stickers to paste it over your dashboard, at any time the process can be reversed.<br><br>Two thumbs up for you ! Ya, customized your ride to your own believes and styles to show your passion ! Way to go..... Welcoming all march owners mod and non mod, under one roof as long as it is a k12.<br><br>cheers !<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the tips on engine oil. Think i'll change it every 5K after my next scheduled checkup. As I will be doing my checkup in Mobil, think I'll stick to Mobil One engine oil. TC charging too much for these checkups, anyone got any good places where they perform their checks? Maybe at the same time I could change like my wheels or something to improve the car's performance.</div>

Check it, a few of the march members here visit them for Servicing ! $ is reasonable and value added service...!<br><br>1. change like my wheels or something to improve the car's performance ?<br>- Are you refering to rims or tyers.<br>2. There are a few steps to better road handling, change rims / suspension and Etc. It depends what is your question.<br><br>Call, text or email : 81630325 / micrarider@yahoo.com for more questions abt mods and good duels !<br><br>cheers !</div>
