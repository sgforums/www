You guys had done it before dun need any more experience. Investing on a walkie is not a waste of money, unless others think differentlyÂ….! By using a mobile phone can do the job, why not again to Â“each itÂ’s ownÂ”.<br><br>Besides I am not familiar with the roads in Malaysia, wrong instructions will cause a convoy accident with other road users. This is a serious matter, i treat it with respect... and convoying have to be coordinated and rules are meant to be followed. I am no one to make decisions Â…even i am at the backseat.

My Marchie will never be the same again....The unbelievable low COE price also dampen my mood these days..<br><br>Am driving to KL tomorrow and returning on Sat night so will have to miss the driveaway to JB....Wish the driveaway was on any other Saturdays.<br><br>Since my last update, my fuel economy has worsen....From as high as 14km/ltr to about 12km/ltr now even though 80% of my trip is spent on the highway these days. Just changed my engine oil at the 10k mark. Now I have achieved 15k mark in terms of mileage so maybe I will change my engine oil and now and not wait for the 20k mark.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I have fixed up both of my remote-control Marchie car which I bought in HK last month....Will be going there again in early Nov. If anyone is interested to buy the self-assembled Marchie, let me know. It is available in 2 colours only: Citron Yellow and Kiwi Green.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety74</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In all fairness bad drivers can be found anywhere and anytime especially in our lil island, their 'crime' seemed to be the very common road hogging, tailgating, straddling between lanes, speeding up when you signal to filter lanes and the list goes on and it is not limited to any particular type of car model or even vehicle (trucks and buses). But to show the middle finger... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Obviously you are very sure that its a K12 (new nissan march) and not the older version thats why you come here to release your frustration. Believe me I have similar experiences with other car types as well EVERYDAY, hogging the road but minus the middle finger. Anyway we do not have 100% of the K12 in here and would say the chances of finding the person or getting your msg across to that fella is relatively slim.<br><br>But i am sure if we practise some road manners and exercise some sense, our roads will be more pleasant to drive on.</div>
