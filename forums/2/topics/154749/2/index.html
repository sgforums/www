            <div class='col-md body'>tyre upgrade<br><br>buy a set of better tyres. ask anyone here in the club who has changed has stock tyres to aftermarket tyres. they will swear the difference in handling and grip. if you own a comfort model, don't mean you have to throw away your 14 inch steel rims, although if you have the budget for it, 15 inches would give much better results. For comfort spec: 165/70R14 change to 185/60R14. getting a decent model will offer much better grip and shorten your brake distance by quite a bit. For elegance spec: 175/60R15 upgrade size is 185/55R15 tyres. if your tyre shop tries to pull a fast one by saying he does not carry this size, you have probably approached a non-professional dealer. insist on the size that you require and not what he has in stock cause the repercussions are severe. eg. inaccurate speedometer reading, grazing of wheel arches or unsightly gap from tyre to the wheel arch. If you do change your original rims to aftermarket ones, this gives you a larger range of tyre widths to play around because the wheels are wider than stock. options are 195/55R15 or 185/55R15.<br><br>air filter upgrade<br><br>buying an aftermarket drop-in filter is NOT going to transform your k12 into an ignis sport. however it does bring about an improvement in air flow efficiency to offer better throttle response and  improved response at higher revs. for the money you are paying at about $100, the relatively low purchase cost justifies the benefits that an aftermarket drop-in filter offers.<br><br>iridium plugs upgrade<br><br>when you purchase a set of iridium spark plugs, it does bring about an improvement in throttle response and sensitivity. again, this will not turn your car into a YRV turbo, but the advantages are obvious and can be easily felt. again the relatively inexpensive cost and obvious benefits offer a strong argument for this case. expect to spend about $100, model IKH16 or equivalent. remember, H for holland. anything else is not the right one.<br><br>summary is that these three things are the most effective upgrades that you can do to improve your k12. the results are well-worth the effort.<br>you can spend money on a whole ton of other stuff, but if these three things are not touched, the saying goes that you would be putting the cart before the horse. white bulbs do not make your k12 go faster. even an idiot can tell the difference between white bulbs and real xenon lights, so please do not be a fool and cheapen your car. strut bars work, provided suspension upgrades have been done and your wheel sizes are low profile and performance oriented. buying one when your suspension is original and stock tyres, you are just kidding yourself dude. might as well keep the bar in your car so can can knock someone in the head during your ensuing bout of road rage. voltage stabilizers claim a lot, but i have yet to meet someone who can actually provide me with factual claims to those improvements. sometimes the fact that you spend your money on something, you actually convince yourself that you feel something special.</div>

There can be significant advantages associated with cooler running temperatures: The amount by which running temperatures are reduced with nitrogen inflation compared to normal compressed air will depend on the specific application. As a rule of thumb, the closer a tyre is to its maximum heat handling capabilities, the greater the reduction in running temperatures will be experienced with nitrogen inflation when compared to inflation with normal compressed air. The tyre's service description describes a tyre's heat handling capabilities.<br><br>Example #1: 205/65R15 95H, 95H being the service description. The load index of 95 indicates this tyre can carry 690kg at a speed of H, which is 210kph, at the tyre's maximum inflation pressure. For this example the inflation pressure used is appropriate for the load carried, or slightly over-inflated for the load carried. In this application, nitrogen filled tyres would only run marginally cooler than with compressed air. The expected increase in tread life from this marginal decrease in running temperatures would be expected to be very small.<br><br>Example #2: 185R14C 102/100S. In this example, this tyre is not being used as a dual set, therefore 102 load index will apply. The 100 load index quoted applies when the tyre is used in a dual fitment. The load index of 102 indicates this tyre is rated to carry 850kg at a speed of "S", which is 180kph, at the tyre's maximum inflation pressure. In service, these tyres are often over-loaded or under-inflated compared to the load carried, for a large percentage of their life. Where these tyres are run near, at, or at times over their maximum load carrying capacity, running temperatures will be high. In applications similar to example #2, inflating tyres with nitrogen would significantly reduce running temperatures and should also improve tread life significantly compared to inflation with compressed air.<br><br>http://www.btc.net.au/tyrecare/nitrogen.asp ...check it.<br><br>" Take care of these, and your tyres will ride more safely and wear better, irrespective of the choice of inflation medium."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With additional money to spare, you can consider forged Rims which maybe lighter then Stock Rims. Tyres are important too especially the grip of the tyres during wet weathers. Tyres with good grips are much noiser then normal ones.<br><br>As for air filter, an aftermarket drop-in filter will do the trick especially for Auto cars. As for those driving Manual, they can consider doing Open Pod.<br><br>Those driving Manual may consider de-cat the exhaust, this will void the warrenty for sure. Drivers on Auto, please ignore this as auto car's require back pressure from the exhaust to change gear. Changing of Manifold may be helpful too.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BoringSilver:</div><div class="quote_body">tyre upgrade<br><br>buy a set of better tyres. ask anyone here in the club who has changed has stock tyres to aftermarket tyres. they will swear the difference in handling and grip. if you own a comfort model, don't mean you have to throw away your 14 inch steel rims, although if you have the budget for it, 15 inches would give much better results. For comfort spec: 165/70R14 change to 185/60R14. getting a decent model will offer much better grip and shorten your brake distance by quite a bit. For elegance spec: 175/60R15 upgrade size is 185/55R15 tyres. if your tyre shop tries to pull a fast one by saying he does not carry this size, you have probably approached a non-professional dealer. insist on the size that you require and not what he has in stock cause the repercussions are severe. eg. inaccurate speedometer reading, grazing of wheel arches or unsightly gap from tyre to the wheel arch. If you do change your original rims to aftermarket ones, this gives you a larger range of tyre widths to play around because the wheels are wider than stock. options are 195/55R15 or 185/55R15.<br><br>air filter upgrade<br><br>buying an aftermarket drop-in filter is NOT going to transform your k12 into an ignis sport. however it does bring about an improvement in air flow efficiency to offer better throttle response and  improved response at higher revs. for the money you are paying at about $100, the relatively low purchase cost justifies the benefits that an aftermarket drop-in filter offers.<br><br>iridium plugs upgrade<br><br>when you purchase a set of iridium spark plugs, it does bring about an improvement in throttle response and sensitivity. again, this will not turn your car into a YRV turbo, but the advantages are obvious and can be easily felt. again the relatively inexpensive cost and obvious benefits offer a strong argument for this case. expect to spend about $100, model IKH16 or equivalent. remember, H for holland. anything else is not the right one.<br><br>summary is that these three things are the most effective upgrades that you can do to improve your k12. the results are well-worth the effort.<br>you can spend money on a whole ton of other stuff, but if these three things are not touched, the saying goes that you would be putting the cart before the horse. white bulbs do not make your k12 go faster. even an idiot can tell the difference between white bulbs and real xenon lights, so please do not be a fool and cheapen your car. strut bars work, provided suspension upgrades have been done and your wheel sizes are low profile and performance oriented. buying one when your suspension is original and stock tyres, you are just kidding yourself dude. might as well keep the bar in your car so can can knock someone in the head during your ensuing bout of road rage. voltage stabilizers claim a lot, but i have yet to meet someone who can actually provide me with factual claims to those improvements. sometimes the fact that you spend your money on something, you actually convince yourself that you feel something special.</div></blockquote></div>
