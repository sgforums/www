            <div class='col-md body'>With all the hype about Taxis being converted to CNGs and SMART taxis facilitating 2 more new CNG pumps in mainland SG (The only one available is at Jurong Island), would you convert your car to CNG?<br><br>According to ST Sunday Times 3rd page, the guy responsible for CNG conversions Gilbert Aue says it provides cleaner emissions but a possible 10% loss in power. Still with the increasing petrol prices i might just consider converting. That extra 300KM comes with the loss of 2/5 of my boot space.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it take as similar time as filling up patrol lah. and can just convert your patrol car easily to CNG/LPG car. diesel a bit difficult... i used CNG and LPG before.. power loss is a little, but hay,,, its far cheaper than patrol.<br><br>but i dun dare to say it'll be cheap in singapore, coz our gahmen want to suck up as much as they can from us.<br><br>CNG full tank doesn't last long, but LPG could be a good alternative to patrol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I'm from the company that is referred to in the News Article - C. Melchers.<br><br>Just wanted to clarify a few things:<br><br>1) The loss is UP TO 10%. The amount of loss depends on how well your car is tuned after the installation. We have a standard tuning program for all cars, but since each car is unique in its own way, there might be more or less loss of power. Seriously though, with a normal car even 10% is not much unless you like to be first off the mark at the lights and you might feel a bit of loss of power during hill climbs.<br><br>2) The stations. Three stations will be running by the end of this year<br>- Toh Tuck Ave (big parcel of land just before the PIE ramp heading towards Tuas). Its bordered on one side by Toh Tuck Ave, other side is Toh Guan Rd East.<br>- Mandai Road (Near the old Shell station)<br>- Serangoon Rd Nth Ave 5<br><br>The two equipment for the stations in Mandai and Serangoon have already been purchased and are on their way. However these stations are called 'daughter stations' and rely on a 'mother station' to transport the gas to their location. The 'mother station' is the one in Toh Tuck.<br><br>The station in Toh Tuck is huge and tender for the construction for it has just closed - we know, since we took part in it. The station MUST be completed by the end of the year.<br><br>So this should qualm some of the worries people have about "IF EVER".<br><br>3) The filling up of the cars depends very much on the compressors used at the station. If you size your compressors correctly, the filling up time is about 1 1/2 minutes for a car and about 3 minutes for a bus.<br><br>I won't talk much more about it here since I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk about the conversion kit too much since I would be "marketing" it. If you are interested more, have a look at the website www.cng.com.sg and you can email your queries there.<br><br>Rgds, Gilbert</div>
