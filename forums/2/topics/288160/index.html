            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>FINALLY!</strong></span><br><br>SINGAPORE : The government is calling for proposals to build a permanent race track in Changi.<br><br>This is to help make Singapore into a regional motor sports hub by riding on the F1 fever that has hit the country.<br><br>Due to its size, the proposed Grade 2 track is not designed for F1, but other smaller races.<br><br>Races like the A1 are just some of the exciting events that could come to Singapore should this proposed track design materialise.<br><br>A 20Â—hectare land off Changi Coast Road will be the site for the permanent facility.<br><br>Its seafront location will make it one of the most scenic circuits in Asia.<br><br>More importantly, the track will allow yearÂ—round usage and have benefits beyond sport.<br><br>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports said: "It is also an industry that we want to promote. A lot of people think the production and building of cars is not something that Singapore has a role in. But contrary to that, if you look at modern cars, there is a lot of research development, highÂ—tech planning and design which goes into it and as Singapore moves up the value chain. SingaporeÂ’s high precision engineering and our past experience will give us a competitive edge."<br><br>Testing of cars aside, driver training courses can also be conducted.<br><br>The track will cost some $84 million and the ministry said there are interested parties.<br><br>It will be the most compact and efficient in Asia Â— measuring about 2.8km.<br><br>"With limited space, there will be a compromise because the longer the track, the more corners there will be. This also means the track is likely to be slower compared to a shorter track. But having said that, you also depend very much on the design of the track," said Fan Chien Jen, Deputy Director, Motor Sports Development Division, Singapore Sports Council.<br><br>The track will also allow the sport to grow here and develop future champions at a racing academy.<br><br>"A chance for a driving school perhaps... some kind of academy thatÂ’ll give the driver a chance to get on the pathway. It will allow the masses to enjoy this, not only as a spectator but also to drive," said Oon Jin Teik, CEO of Singapore Sports Council.<br><br>The ministry will not fund the project. It will call for proposals both here and overseas in May 2008.<br><br>The track is expected to be up and running by 2011. Â— CNA /ls<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 4, 2007<br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">A track to grow motorsports </span><br>Motor enthusiasts see Changi circuit as vital in promoting racing culture<br>By Leonard Lim &amp; Wang Meng Meng  </strong><br><br>TO MOTORSPORTS enthusiasts, the permanent track to be built at Changi is more than just an alternative to the Pasir Gudang or Sepang circuits in Malaysia.<br><br>More importantly, it represents an integral piece of a jigsaw in the promotion of a motorsports culture here.<br><br>'It will be crucial in building up an awareness and culture of motorsports,' said Singapore Motor Sports Association (SMSA) president Tan Teng Lip.<br><br>'Having events there year-round will also be the perfect complement to Formula One.'<br><br>The fraternity had been lobbying for a permanent track for the past few years, after a re-emergence of interest in motorsports not seen since the Singapore Grand Prix days at Thomson Road from 1961 to 1973.<br><br>Last Friday, their wish was granted when the Government announced that it would invite the private sector to submit proposals for a racetrack around the middle of next year.<br><br>The news, coming five months after Singapore announced it would host its first F1 race next September, got fans like Tony Tan 'visiting a new high'.<br><br>Said the SMSA official: 'For any sport to grow, you need facilities for people to go to. It's like football, you can't have an international football competition without a proper stadium.<br><br>'We've sometimes had to stage our events, like go-kart races, at car parks around the island.'<br><br>'When completed, the Changi track will truly be like a home to us, to host events and high-speed demonstrations.'<br><br>Local enthusiasts who have had to endure the inconvenience of travelling to Sepang on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur or the Pasir Gudang circuit in Johor to get their fix will soon have Changi at their doorstep.<br><br>Said manager Stanley Song: 'The biggest drawback of Sepang is getting there and back, which takes a few hours. There are also multiple toll fees and a high dosage of petrol needed.'<br><br>The Government has said that the privately funded track, once completed around 2011, must stage at least three international races and two national series annually.<br><br>The Grade 2 facility will be able to stage the likes of motorcycling's MotoGP, the A1 Grand Prix and the Japan's Super GT races - basically anything except F1.<br><br>The buzz from such races, along with industry roadshows and exhibitions that will almost certainly be staged, will ensure that the fever created from F1 does not cool down after the street race.<br><br>Said regional IT manager Christopher Ng: 'Other than F1, Singapore needs feeder races such as the A1 Grand Prix to help the country gain a strong foothold as a motor-racing hub. Building the track will certainly make these other races a reality.'<br><br>It is understood that parties in Singapore had been approached to host an A1 or World Touring Car Championship race in the past.<br><br>But the absence of a permanent track was a stumbling block.<br><br>For professional racer Hafiz Koh, who competed in the A1 series last year, the Changi track will allow him to practise locally instead of having to go to places like Sepang.<br><br>He said: 'Depending on how the Government wants to market the area, other motor-related businesses, such as car workshops, could be located there.'<br><br>SMSA president Tan hopes to nurture more racers like Koh, with the mandatory driver training school to be built with the track.<br><br>'A training programme for youngsters can be worked out, starting them with go-karts at ages eight or nine,' he said. 'They can then progress to other forms of racing when they grow older.'<br><br>CIMB-GK economist Song Seng Wun is rubbing his hands with glee, even as he thinks it is too early to put a dollar value to how much the motorsports industry would potentially be worth to the economy.<br><br>The self-confessed fan of multiple MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi hopes to see his idol racing at Changi in the future.<br><br>He said: 'There'll probably be some small industry that springs up here once F1 comes around. The activities at the track will help sustain it for the whole year.<br><br>'Perhaps, one day, we can produce someone to race in a world-class competition.'<br><br>limze@sph.com.sg<br><br>meng@sph.com.sg<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Local car enthusiasts react<br><br><strong> GREAT NEWS FOR CAR NUTTERS</strong><br><br>'I hope to see a really great track at Changi, which will invite international competitions here to make it a viable venture. Changi's proximity means saving drivers two or three tanks of petrol driving on the North-South Highway to Sepang. It is also much safer driving in Singapore.'<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20071103/ST_IMAGES_LLMOTOR04-D9O.jpg"><br>- JAMES MITCHELL (left), 37, head of IT development for a bank and an ex-co member of the Traction Circle Club, a car club with 400 members.<br><br>A BOOST FOR CAR TUNERS<br><br>'It's a positive move for tuners of performance cars like us. Every weekend, there are easily 60 to 80 Singaporean cars driving up to Sepang. The Changi race track can be what the Zhuhai International Circuit is to Hong Kong. Out of the 80 events held at Zhuhai every year, at least 60 are catered for Hong Kong enthusiasts.'<br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20071103/ST_IMAGES_LLMOTOR04-E15.jpg"><br>- LESTER WONG (right), 35, director of car tuners Garage R<br><br>KEEP CHANGI RACETRACK FEES AFFORDABLE<br><br>'Sepang's biggest drawback is its distance from Singapore. It takes a few hours for a return trip, multiple toll fees and lots of petrol. I hope the Changi racetrack will charge affordable fees for public use.'<br>- STANLEY SONG (left), manager of an energy company<br><br>INCORPORATE SAFETY FEATURES<br><br>'Sepang is a beautiful circuit and a joy to drive on, with numerous safety run-off areas should things get too hot. A long straight would also be very desirable, to allow for drag races.'<br>- CALVIN CHIN (centre), supply-chain leader for a global management firm<br><br>FEEDER RACES NECESSARY<br><br>'Singapore needs feeder races such as the A1 Grand Prix to help it gain a strong foothold as a motor-racing hub. Building the track will certainly make these races a reality.'<br><br>- CHRISTOPHER NG (right), regional IT manager<br><br>ST PHOTOS: CHEW SENG KIM<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 4, 2007<br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Local go-karters want shorter racetrack at Changi</span><br>AS SINGAPORE looks forward to the Changi racetrack, has the interests of go-karting enthusiasts been neglected?</strong><br><br>After all, the sport has groomed Formula One aces Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost and, more recently, Kimi Raikkonen, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton.<br><br>The Government has announced plans to build a Grade 2 track suitable for all classes except F1, but the local karting community is not entirely overjoyed.<br><br>A major bugbear is the 2.8-3.5km track, which exceeds the 2.5km maximum set by the world governing bodies of motorsports (FIA) and karting (CIK).<br><br>And, as Jonathan Lai (right) explained, Changi will be too long for the 10-minute sprint format that local racers prefer.<br><br>'The Changi track is a good idea but the better option is across the Causeway,' said the karting enthusiast, who races at Johor's Permas Karting Circuit monthly.<br><br>'A typical race takes just 10 minutes. We will not be able to complete that many laps at the longer Changi track.<br><br>'The Permas circuit is 1.31km long and it is well-maintained. The fees there are very reasonable, ranging from RM40 ($17.30) to RM55 for a 10-minute session, depending on engine capacity.<br><br>'Hopefully, the government can take on board our opinions.''<br><br>Lai estimates that on a typical race day in Johor, up to 80 per cent of the drivers are Singaporeans.<br><br>Nic Chee, another karting fan, added: 'If we are aiming for a motorsports culture, karting should not be ignored.<br><br>'I hope the Changi track can be made affordable. A $40 fee for a session will be reasonable.''<br><br>But, according to Lai, staff at the Permas track go the extra mile.<br><br>He said: 'I pay a RM100 monthly parking fee for my kart. But they help check tyre pressure and top up the engine oil and brake fluid.<br><br>'I hope the Changi track can provide similar nice touches, while being as challenging as Permas - which goes up and down and has 14 tricky bends.''<br><br>To the racing fans, karting is akin to F1 as the dynamics are almost similar.<br><br>As Tony Ho, a karting enthusiast with two years' experience, put it: 'The go-kart has an unobstructed open view and the driver sits lower. The kart does not roll over easily and has no mirrors.<br><br>'Drivers have to be focused. A slight distraction or hesitation could be costly. There is no room for errors.<br><br>'That's why karting has produced so many top F1 drivers.''<br><br>Wang Meng Meng</div>
