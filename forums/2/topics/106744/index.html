            <div class='col-md body'>Anybody know why Mitsubishi is raising their prices week after week?<br><br>Im talking abt the lancer manual (basic model):<br><br>Mid Nov: $59,9xx<br><br>Late Nov: $60,9xx<br><br>Early Dec:$61,9xx<br><br>Now: $62,4xx<br><br>Bearing in mind, the COE from Mid Nov till now is only increase of 400plus dollars...<br><br>So, is it still a good deal??<br><br>Or is it becos the increase in price is a gimmick to cover the 1st yr insurance (up to 1K) and 2 free installments??<br><br>Cheers!</div>
