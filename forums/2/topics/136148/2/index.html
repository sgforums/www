I remembered when I was learning driving a few months ago, there was once I had to change lanes quickly and also overtake the front car. The next lane had a car that was quite far back from mine but also travelling fast. At that point of time I was already close to the speed limit, but the instructor told me to floor it and of course I went over the speed limit just to flow with the traffic according to the other lane. Imagine, if I kept within the speed limit which was 50km/h, I could not have possibly change lanes quick enough and that might have caused the fast car to brake hard just to keep to my 'L' plate 50km/h speed limit. I guess in everything we do, we have to be flexible and that includes driving too eh? </div></blockquote>Anyway, wat u mean "you agree its legal"? Based on wat? u seen the relevant gazette? It might be common sense, but doesn't mean its legal.<br><br>Road Traffic Act don't say anything about it and no other legislation I know of says its legal.<br><br>To reiterate, I know we have to exceed the limit from time to time, otherwise how to overtake rite? But don't tell ppl its LEGAL if you're not sure, pls!<br><br>Otherwise, next time ppl discuss "Can we throw cigarette butt on floor if there is no dustbin within 50m, since all dustbin have been removed due to bomb scare?". Then a few ppl agree that its ok to throw on floor, means become legal? hahahah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it is true that I am not sure whether it is legal or not but I am quite sure that if you exceed 10km/h or 20km/h, it will not be a v big issue when it comes to overtaking. If exceeding the limit will help prevent an accident then I see no wrong in it(my personal opinion).<br><br>Anyway, don't you think your cigarette example is a little too far fetched? Come on, we're here to share out knowledge so spare the sarcasm. I know you must be thinking, "my own mouth la i say what i want y u care" but I mean, will it help in this discussion?<br><br>You said "Anyhow, ppl here are very passionate. A little flame or even amicable discussion and all start to get very worked up and want to show off their knowledge and bring in their job and education level all.

Motorists who go above the speed limit are breaking a traffic rule and should be thoroughly despised. Speeding kills, as many signs on the road warn motorists.<br><br>Motorists who try to get away with speeding (or argue their way out of it) are no better than coupon parking cheats.

Lane 1 is for overtaking and even if there is not much bloody car on e road ppl should stick to lane 2 if there are not overtaking e front car. i get ppl coming here and sayin its alright to cruise leisurely at lane 1 as long as u re travelling at e road limit eg 90kph. bloody stupid comment.  perhaps their poor and lousy genes enable them to think this way.<br><br>doesnt matter if someone is driving a performance car or a small cc car. the person should not road hog.</div>

He will sure to du lan those ppl at 90 on the rite lane, whom he classify as 'road hoggers' even though they are observing the law. So let's say ppl move aside for him.<br><br>And he continues at 110 on the rite lane becuz at tat speed, if he move back to middle lane, very soon he will run into another 'slow' car and have to overtake again. That is also dangerous, having to switch so often.<br><br>So while travelling at 110 on rite lane, a guy at 130 comes up menacingly from the back. The 110 guy sure have a bit of du lan feeling "wat the heck? Drive so fast for wat? going to reincarnate?). Becuz 110 consider quite fast liao, yet got ppl coming up faster.<br><br>So the 110 guy gotta give way, either have to slow down a lot to fit back into middle lane or cut dangerously or speed up to 130.<br><br>So lets say now the cars travelling 130 on rite lane. But one fella come at 160. By what you guys say, those 2 guys at 130 should siam for the 160 guy rite?<br><br>At 130, its gonna be even harder to cut back into the middle lane.<br><br>So without ppl observing the speed limit, and only observing the rule that whoever is faster deserve the right to use the right lane, we are going to end up with an expressway of ppl cutting all over the place from right to middle to right and happy speedsters zipping away on the rite lane.<br><br>Dun tink tis is an extreme example becuz ppl usually drive around 110-130 and the news showed ppl being clocked at 170 before also.<br><br>If you've noticed, chain accidents almost always occur on the right lane! Ppl like to drive fast but when something occurs, there's no time to react! If everyone travel at the speed limit, there won't be a need for uneccessary overtaking and trying to 'push' ppl out of the way.<br><br>90 is actually quite a decent balance between speed and control. Can get from Queenstown to Changi in 15 mins on a clear expressway. Not fast enuff meh?<br><br>So if you ask me to choose between following the law and taking the law into our own hands, I choose the former.<br><br>I only personally classify (my own opinion) road hoggers as ppl who are extremely slow by general standards. Like travelling 40-50 in middle lane is ridiculous. But if travelling at 90 on rite lane (its the law, too bad), he can't technically be called a road hog.<br><br>Most ppl tink 90 is slow, and prob travel around 110, tats why they can't stand those 90 drivers blocking them on rite lane. But when those 110 ppl kena those 130 types, then they will experience how inconvenient it is to have to accomodate the guys speeding offence. And the higher the speed goes, the more dangerous it becomes to give way and switch lanes and to brake.<br><br>So its all about a balanced, decent speed fast enuff to get u to places but within control of the car. Otherwise there's no end.<br><br>And your comment about ppl being genetically stupid and all, go complain to govt la. They set the speed limit wat, and din legislate rite lane for overtaking only. So they are the stupid ones?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Keep left unless overtaking, no matter what speed you are in. If I can drive lane 3 at 90kph, overtaking those lane 2 cars, then isn't it obvious those cars are rod hogging?

            <div class='col-md body'>This is quite lenghty but read on. helps to get this whole matter laid straight.<br><br>Okay actually i flipped through the BTT textbook because this is what we all must learn to get our license... I believe some of us have warped the entire theory. Okay first lets clarify Lane 1. On page 42 of the TP edition of the book. Point 42 says "<span class="large">On a three-lane carriageway, you may keep to the centre lane when the left-hand lane is occupied by slower moving vehicles. The outer (right-hand) lane is for overtaking and emergency vehicles only</span>."  Okay this is taken from again the Basic Theory of Driving (6th Edition) It is stated black and white that the right most lane is for overtaking only. All i can say is for those people who drive at 90km/h on a 90km/h speed limit on lane 1 throughout the entire journey should go and take your test again. The book also teaches us to practice the keep-left rule, so are you practicing that by driving on the right most lane?<br><br>From my interpretation of the rules laid out in the book depending on the way they phrase it, some rules are written with a hint that it will only apply on a case by case basis. The rules also state in the direction that the priority is the safety of all people using the roads. The rules are written in such a way that it can be flexible if needed to be.<br><br>So for those who say that rules are rules and we should follow them, IMO i think that you are a little too resistant to changes in environment. (I have no intention to flame anyone but don't you all think so too?) okay i know you are not doing anything wrong at all if u abide by the rules, all i am saying is that we cannot be so rigid. Road conditions change all the time so we must adapt accordingly.<br><br>Also another point to note is that speeding does not kill.. The term speeding is also subjective. Reckless driving is the main culprit that we all should aim to eradicate. I can drive at 60km/h and still get into an accident by suddenly changing lanes without signalling or jamming on the brake and tailgating people etc. I can drive at 120km/h and be safe at the same time, signal early, maintain safe distance with car infront 3-second rule. So which one kills? I believe reckless driving is more dangerous than speeding.<br><br>Okay here is a scenario. One fella/joker (shall name him car A)driving 90km/h on lane 1 on a 90km/h speed limit.<br>- He can get fined by TP for roadhogging. (refer to extract from basic theory textbook above)<br><br>then a faster vehicle(ordinary car car B) comes along and signals to overtake.<br>- Car A should give way even if the car behind him is breaking the speed limit. (he could be in an emergency)<br>- Car B should return to the speed limit. Otherwise he is in direct violation of the speed limit. ( Again it is flexible if he is really in an emergency)<br><br>Quote from guitarman1<br>"WRONG WRONG WRONG, u guys are wrong. The person have the right to travel 90 on the right lane. Anyone speeding past 90 to overtake is considered speeding. "<br><br>Guitarman.. No one has the right to claim Lane 1 as his or her own by driving at the speed limit. If a faster vehicle comes by, the car in front MUST give way. I sincerely hope you phrase yourself clearly as many people might misinterprete you. By being inconsiderate you are already wrong if not it defeats the whole purpose of the Courtesy Campaign? no intention to flame you but ur perception of the law is somewhat incorrect.<br><br>Quote from guitarman1<br>"Since the speed limit is 90 kmh, you will obviously find some ppl travelling in middle lane at 90. Then the only logical way is to speed to about 110 to overtake on the right, right? So people will definitely think its right? Although this is all logical, but if a TP happen to be there clocking cars, you will still kena. " - this depends on a case by case basis. If the car returns to speed limit he is deemed ok. But in the first place why would u need to overtake a car at the speed limit if you have no need to go faster than him unless emergency?<br><br>Quote from guitarman1<br>"He [TP] will tell you 'overtaking' is for overtaking cars in the middle lane travelling around 70-80, then you are allowed to go 90 on the right lane to overtake. "   -if it is so we all will see different signs indicating the speed limit on each different lane. so in this case u are wrong.<br><br>Quote from guitarman1<br>"I'm not saying the law is right, it is indeed pretty inflexible and not applicable sometimes. I'm juz asking ppl here not to justify it as if its people's LEGAL RIGHT to speed and overtake, becuz in the end when they kena caught, they suffer." - A mix of both right and wrong. The traffic law is flexible depending on circumstances. Yes it is not applicable sometimes thats where MORALS come in and Courtesy. It is a right we all have to overtake and to speed again only in emergencies.<br><br>I believe the unwritten rule is it is okay to break the rules in order to<br>1. prevent accidents. - this includes safety of pedestrians as well<br>2. for life saving.<br>But as responsible citizens we MUST NOT AND CANNOT abuse this rule by cheating on other people's morals for our own benefit.<br><br></div>
