He's juz inconsiderate.<br><br>Inconsiderate doesn't make the person wrong. We shouldn't be giving other road users wrong info like "Can!! Can overtake.. its ok one, rite lane for overtaking.

In the end, when the fella who read the forums is caught overtaking at 110 kmh, he suffer, not us.<br><br>Or maybe he tot he in the rite so he flash flash flash a guy travelling on rite lane at 90 until the fella du lan then start driving dangerously or jam brake kinda thing.<br><br>So although its good to know what is the practice, u should also know the law, cuz when it comes down to accident or suing, its the law that u will have to follow.<br><br>Drive safe.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the policy of keep left unless overtaking is to signal to road user to be considerate (which is not really applicable in singapore)<br><br>The ideal scenario is that even if you are travelling at the speed limit of 90km/h and if there isnt any cars within your sight of view on the extreme left lane, then you should keep to the left lane. This occurs usually in wee hours of the morning when the expressways are basically empty without cars.<br><br>If a car is in front of you travelling slowly, then you may overtake by using the the next right lane. Similarly, the rule stay for lane 2 and lane 1(rightmost lane)<br><br>Unfortunately, this is usually not the case as the expressways on other time are full of cars. This means that people like to stick to the right lane (so as to avoid the hassle of changing lane often) as it is presuming the fastest lane even if one is driving at the speed of 90km/h.<br><br>The utopia situation is of course on a 3 lane expressway, when cruising, everybody keep leftward till the 2nd right lane, leaving the right lane just for overtaking.<br><br>With the mentality of Singaporean, it probably does not and cannot be applied here<br><br></div>

Since the speed limit is 90 kmh, you will obviously find some ppl travelling in middle lane at 90. Then the only logical way is to speed to about 110 to overtake on the right, right? So people will definitely think its right? Although this is all logical, but if a TP happen to be there clocking cars, you will still kena.<br><br>He will tell you 'overtaking' is for overtaking cars in the middle lane travelling around 70-80, then you are allowed to go 90 on the right lane to overtake.<br><br>I'm not saying the law is right, it is indeed pretty inflexible and not applicable sometimes. I'm juz asking ppl here not to justify it as if its people's LEGAL RIGHT to speed and overtake, becuz in the end when they kena caught, they suffer.<br><br>Ambulance is diff case, once siren on, its life and death. Ppl in a rush to go meet frens to makan or boyracer trying to test his top speed or someone late for meeting dun have the right to push traffic out of their way. I agree that we should observe courtesy and let people pass; no harm driving in middle lane.<br><br>But to those 110-140 kph travellers, pls also be courteous in the way you 'push' on the right lane as if its your right.

Let said the express way is 90km/h and your are travelling at 120km/h on lane 1, you can be book road hogging instead of speeding. Because lane 1 is for EMERGENCY VEHICLES and OVERTAKING VEHICLES ONLY. However, many Singaporeans drivers think that as long as they are within the speed limit, they are safe from booking, WRONG.<br><br>Yes, in NE highway some ignorant S'pore cars still cruise at 110km/h on the extreme right lane and still thinking that they are right. Don't play play at NE highway with so many Malaysia cars. Anything happen we are the lossing parties.....</div>

Even if you travelling at 120km/h still have to give way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I agree with demolition that exceeding the speed limit on the road to overtake is legal but not constantly over the speed limit... I remembered when I was learning driving a few months ago, there was once I had to change lanes quickly and also overtake the front car. The next lane had a car that was quite far back from mine but also travelling fast. At that point of time I was already close to the speed limit, but the instructor told me to floor it and of course I went over the speed limit just to flow with the traffic according to the other lane. Imagine, if I kept within the speed limit which was 50km/h, I could not have possibly change lanes quick enough and that might have caused the fast car to brake hard just to keep to my 'L' plate 50km/h speed limit. I guess in everything we do, we have to be flexible and that includes driving too eh?</div>

Of coz we all commit traffic offence here and there like speeding and illegal u-turn.<br><br>I am merely don't get the impression that exceeding the speed limit to overtake is LEGALLY RIGHT. So if the situation don't allow, and you can't move to middle lane, and got some a#$%hole closing in at 120 kmh, its ur call whether u wanna speed up or continue driving at speed limit.

A little flame or even amicable discussion and all start to get very worked up and want to show off their knowledge and bring in their job and education level all.
