            <div class='col-md body'>Mazda 2 should be compared to Honda City VTEC (16 valves) but not Honda City i-DSI (8 valves). Honda City i-DSI does not have ABS and airbags (see http://www.honda.com.sg/hondaclub/price_city.cfm) but you get these in Mazda 2. As for the FC, a friend driving Mazda 2 quoted 13Km/L  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> but I am not so sure about City. Both are also made in different countries.<br><br>I have been eyeing Mazda 2 for some time and is almost giving up by settling for another less exp but Japanese-made cars. Mazda is really over priced  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  at the moment. For the same price of Mazda 2, you can get a better and larger Jap car. As for Honda City, you actually pay for the brand rather than the car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>same feeling..... Honda City i-dsl OMV is abt $13.6k while M2 is abt $14.4k.... but look at their selling price......<br><br>Mazda is really overpriced, juz my opinion..... but there is a keen following....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Allow me to make some correction. Yes the City is a 8 valve engine BUT it comes with the new tech iDSI engine configuration and CVT, coupled with 7 speed steermatic. Although max power is 88 kwh, it comes in max torque at 2700 rpm.<br><br>iDSI stands for Intelligent Dual Sequential Ignition, meaning 2 spark plug per cyclinder as opposed to conventional single plug layout. That means City has 8 plugs instead of the normal 4. What this translates into is ultra high fuel efficiency and max torque at low rpm until redline at 6500 rpm. CVT is a high tech expensive stuff and what this translate in automatic gear is seamless, stepless gear changes. You dont feel the knee jerk effect at all and its smart fetaures is that it adapts to changing road condition and speed. Same pressure on the pedal but when you are hitting into a slight gradient, the rpm automatically rev up and adjusted back when you have passed the gradient. Thats the beauty of smart CVT.<br><br>Read about international review on the City and find out more. Thats what I did before I chose the City.<br><br>Last I heard China having waiting time of 6 months for City (known as Fit there) and 3 months in Malaysia. In Japan, it is a top seller in its class and oh yes, in Japan it does not belongs to the K-class catergory, which means small compact like the Nissan March.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one is quite diff from the other, which means your preference plays a big part.<br><br>size, city big<br>transmission, city better<br>passenger, city better<br>style, m2 better<br>speed/pick-up, city better<br>u turn radius, never a Mazda<br>ergonomic, m2<br>ease of load/unloading into boot, m2<br>sleekness, m2<br><br>what a mess</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>madza2's styling is better i agree.... but i haf to admit city's looks kinda grow on me.... the more i look at it, the better i nicer i think it looks....<br><br>i'm concerned oso abt the lack of airbag and ABS in the city isdi model.... it seems like a poorer cousin of the vtec version.... why i'm looking at idsi is becos of the excellent FC.... the SA told me 16km/l on ciy rds.... but if M2 can mnage a not too bad 13km/l, then mayb.....<br><br>another thing abt city is cvt and steermatic.... seems quite interesting... but any concerns abt the gearbox?  seems like tis is quite a new technology and not time proven yet...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The present City is equipped with improved CVT tech from previous generation CVT. So far, it has not given any problem but watch the maintenance requirement. Yoi got to strictly follow the servicing schedule and use the Hondamatic transmission oil and also service by the agent, please. Don't save a few bucks by sending it to the private workshop.<br><br>I recall the Subaru Justy was among the 1st to introduce the CVT and well, there were negative feedbacks but things has improved since and nowadays, CVT is the trend, even in upmarket models.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honda City does score points for space and FC which is most likely due to the type of engine.<br><br>Honda markets their technology as iDSI (new) and VTec (new), Toyota calls theirs VVTi (new new), Mitsubishi terms their's as MIVEC (new new new). Mazda, er...not yet...spent too much research on good 'looks' I guess. It would be great to see how each brand market their engine's technology.<br><br>Come what may, take a test drive on Mazda 2, Honda Jazz/Fit and Mitsubishi Colt. These are jap cars in the same category.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah...<br><br>I think a reasonable comparison should be made between the Jazz and MZ2, as both of them are in the Kei Class.<br><br>Though the City has more space, the MZ2 has more loading configurations.<br><br>But for FC, City should be much better, for both the VTEC and the iDSi version.<br><br>I am driving a Honda Civic 1.5 VTEC, but now waiting for my MZ2.
