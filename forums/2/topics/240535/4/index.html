Monaco race is the shortest race on the calender and it is also one of the most demanding and unforgiving track which involves constant gear change and corners. The narrow road and corners are also a test of driver's gut, skill and their concentration and this help to seperate the man from the boys.<br><br>What I can say to you is that there are more than OBS and AT that is interested to host a F1 GP here in Singapore, and the reason why we are seeing a renewing interest is because of MM Lee's comment about his regret for disallowing motorracing. This is not about putting cart before the horse, it is about there is too many horses but none are strong enough to pull the cart on its own.<br><br>Organizing an F1 race will bring your more fame than $$ and thats the reason why so many race organizers around the world are "bleeding".</div>

One has to note that the harder it is to organise one, it will mean it will be more difficult for other countries or cities to challenge us.<br><br>As for using coffer's money, it will depends who we look at it, because by having a race here will also mean creating alot of jobs and opportunity for many people, and at the same time those Singaporeans who regularly travel to Sepang for F1 will be spending their money in Singapore instead, which means money will go back to the government.<br><br>USD75 million is not a small sum of money and I am not sure if OBS and AT can pull this through by themselves. If government is not willing to take the lead, then I think OBS will probably have to work with companies like Genting or Las Vegas Sands to share the cost. Ultimately they are the 2 companies that has the deepest pocket and is going to gain most of out this event.<br><br>I personally think that Singapore shouldnt just stop at organizing F1, we should also include MotorGP (if possible) or some other Asian formula seriese where there is a REAL singaporeans representing our country.<br></div>

The other series can easily be incorporated into the support races and need not have a separate race day.</div>

I think US$412m might be too optimistic, however the unique part of the shanghai race is that CCTV is broadcasting it national wide for free and that itself is going to get in alot of TV ad money.<br><br>In general the economic return for the hosting city is around US$150m per race.</div>
