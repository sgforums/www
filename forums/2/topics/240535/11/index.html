            <div class='col-md body'>From today's BT.<br><br>Citigroup sees $200m F1 tourism earnings<br><br>Its estimate, higher than govt's $100m, is based on other host countries' track record<br><br>By RONNIE LIM<br><br>SINGAPORE'S Formula One race starting next year could generate tourism earnings of $150-200 million - versus the government's $100 million estimate - based on the track record of other host countries, says Citigroup.<br><br>Mr Ong: There will be a cap on the profit that race organiser Singapore GP can earn from staging the F1 race<br>And the US-based banking giant sees big spin-offs for the economy at large as the race exposes the 'Singapore brand' worldwide, saying F1 is the third most-watched sporting event after the Olympics and World Cup.<br><br>'It is watched on average 58 billion times a season through television broadcasts to over 200 countries. Singapore will suddenly be on the map for these millions,' says Citigroup economist Chua Hak Bin in a report. 'The immediate costs to the government coffers will likely be defrayed over time by the branding and advertising gains.'<br><br>The Citigroup report comes as news emerged yesterday that there will be a cap on the profit that race organiser Ong Beng Seng's Singapore GP can earn from staging the F1.<br><br>Any amount above this cap, which is confidential under the terms of the deal, will go to reduce the government's future grants. But any losses incurred will be borne by the race organiser.<br><br>This previously unknown arrangement has emerged amid questions over the government's commitment to bear 60 per cent - about $90 million - of the estimated annual cost of $150 million to stage the F1 here.<br><br>It has been asked why the government should use taxpayers' money to help Singapore GP, which will foot only $60 million, organise the race, thus enabling Mr Ong to make a bundle.<br><br>But Citigroup's estimates, if they turn out to be correct, mean a 'win-win' F1 for all parties.<br><br>'We think tourism earnings could be higher, closer to $150-200 million, with the right promotion,' the bank's report says. 'The government forecast looks conservative when compared to the earnings of other F1 hosts.<br><br>'Valencia (the latest Spanish venue on the F1 circuit) is hosting the race early 2008 and estimates about $190 million of earnings, based on Barcelona's experience. Bahrain earned $600 million in 2006 and Shanghai $653 million in 2004. Malaysia generated $175 million of earnings.'<br><br>Citigroup says the winners from the Singapore F1 will include hotels, retail, private banking and the media. 'The integrated resorts should also gain when they are ready. The F1 crowd is primarily the rich and middle class,' it says.<br><br>Hotel rates typically rise by as much as three times on the race weekend, as in Melbourne and Monaco, while the Australian GP generates about US$10.5 million in advertising and promotions during the four-day event.<br><br>Annual budgets for the auto race participants are also huge, totalling some US$1.5 billion, with Toyota the biggest spender at US$290 million, followed by Ferrari (US$250 million) and Renault (US$155 million) based on 2005 figures.<br><br>Some of the manufacturers also spend a big sum on hospitality, with Toyota reportedly shelling out almost US$7 million last year.<br><br>Red Bull Racing spent US$6 million, including setting up a floating energy station in the harbour for the Monaco GP and a US$1.2 million Chinese village at the Shanghai GP, Citigroup says<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I strongly support having the F1 in Singapore.<br><br>My view is that it will help to boost Singapore's image around the world. You and I both know that although a lot of people have heard about Singapore, but have very little idea of where and what we are. Having images of Singapore beamed around the world would really help to generate more awareness about Singapore (i.e. that we are more than just another "small asian country").<br><br>This awareness, coupled with F1's glamour factor and following big money circus (actually, who follows who is up for debate) will inadvertantly have significant spinoffs, especially when the track is actually in the city itself, instead of some track in the moddle of nowhere.<br><br>In the long term, the benefits of the exposure we'll get through F1 will probably be difficult to calculate and put into bare numbers, but it's definitely there.<br><br>I am very sure that the Singapore F1 GP will be a good thing for the economy, provided its organised and run well, without any embarrassing restrictions (both on the race and spectators) that will demonstrate our Government's penchant for going overboard in being totally kiasu and kiasi.<br><br>My personal view, Singapore F1 GP is a watershed in some ways for the Singapore govt. It shows that the govt is seriously looking to go upmarket and attempt some risk in the chase for economic gain. Yes, it took LKY to complain about F1 to get them moving, but at least its a positive move. Singapore has to make brave decisions if it wants to stay ahead in the economic race, and I think this is one of them.<br><br>Oh yeah, and in the end, we also get to have a premier motorsport event right at our doorstep! I mean, how cool is that?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>

What I said was that if, after 5 years, the event loses money rather than bring in revenue (like the ill-fated Albert Park in Australia), then there is no reason to renew the contract after 5 years.</div>

If you say "there must be a weighing of the cost-benefit ratio in every policy", and that Singapore has decided to build the IRs because the economic benefits outweigh the dangers of the IRs, then it means that Singapore has already given a great deal of thought into whether F1 will be an economic benefit or a economic disaster.<br><br>As we all Singaporeans know, our government will never do anything that is detrimental to our economy and our government are just as "kiasu" as Singaporeans.

And that's the reason why we went full steam ahead to try to sign a contract with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to host F1 races in Singapore for 5 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

However, I do not see any evidence to support taking yet another risk and incurring further public spending for a permanent race track. I have no objection to the race track itself, if a private enterprise wants to take it up after doing its own sums and if we have a suitable piece of land lying vacant for rental. That's fine by me. If it works, the public purse benefits from the taxes. If it fails, the taxpayer is not hurt by it.<br><br>That said, nothing remains static and things change quickly. Despite our best projections, we may be wrong about how things will look in a few years' time. If the F1 fails to deliver the economic benefits we expect, then it should be killed off when the contract comes for renewal after 5 years.<br><br>If you read carefully, you won't be confused.

YES, there are times when even our government makes mistakes, but it is rare. To plan 5 years ahead of time is simply not enough for our government.<br><br>A good example of Singapore planning very long ahead of time is our reserve sand. Tell me, how many of us Singaporeans would have predicted that Indonesia would one day stop selling sand to us? No one did, but our government predicted that long ago and started stocking up on sand.<br><br>That said, I believe that our government has already thought of nearly every pros and cons of hosting F1 races and that pros outweigh the cons. So I believe F1 in Singapore will definitely make profits, boost Singapore's image in European countries and boost tourism too. I'm all in for it.<br><br>And that part you said about many students failing English Comprehension, sorry to disappoint you but I'm not one of these students that failed English Comprehension.
