If and when we get an application to run a night race, that will have to go to the circuit commission, and that will go to the safety commission, and eventually the world council.<br><br>"And there will be criteria - there will be criteria for armco, safety barriers, run-off areas. There would have to be criteria for the lighting, and all this would be looked at. We obviously would not approve a night race unless we were satisfied with the safety levels."<br><br>Mosley also suggested that the FIA might be reluctant to authorise a Formula One night race without testing the concept on another category such as GP2 first.<br><br>"I suspect that, as is also usual with new circuits, that we would want to run some sort of other racing that way before we committed the world championship," he added.<br><br>http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59124</div>
