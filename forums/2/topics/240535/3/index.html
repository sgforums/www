            <div class='col-md body'>And take a look at this article on yahoo news dated 5 march 2007..<br><br>Singapore mulls F1 move<br>Singapore is taking a "very serious look" at hosting a Formula One Grand Prix to give the city-state appeal outside the world of business, a top trade official said Monday.<br><br>"The F1 is the highest echelon of motorsports and is said to be the third most watched sporting event in the world after the Olympics and World Cup," Minister of State for Trade and Industry S. Iswaran said in parliament.<br><br>"The attention and buzz that it generates will expose Singapore to a very different audience from that in the business and financial world."<br><br>While Singapore has gained a reputation as a favoured site for meetings and conventions and as an international business hub, it has to do more, Iswaran said.<br><br>"We must have an exciting and fun living environment offering not just a wide variety of quality lifestyle, leisure and entertainment options but also world class events," he said.<br><br>"This is why we are taking a very serious look at hosting a Formula One Grand Prix in Singapore."<br><br>Neighbouring Malaysia hosts a Formula One Grand Prix at Sepang as well as an A1 and MotoGP Grand Prix.<br><br>Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew said two years ago that he regretted not having built a Formula One racing course that would have generated money for the local economy.<br><br>See the last paragraph? LOL..LKY regretted not building an F1 circuit..so I'm now quite sure some way or somehow, Singapore will host an F1 race in 2008..my fingers are crossed..i cant wait to see Kimi Raikkonen in action in Singapore..LOL.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>P.S.: Here's the link for the article..<br><a href="http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/070305/1/472kc.html" rel="nofollow">http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/070305/1/472kc.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another article on CNA's website..dated 18 march 2007..that's yesterday..lol..<br><br>SINGAPORE: Many were expecting to hear the good news this weekend about the possibility of Singapore staging its first Formula One race.<br><br>But so far, no decision has been made after the F1 race in Melbourne, where Singapore government officials and some private investors have gathered.<br><br>Disappointment aside, industry watchers said the delay could have other repercussions.<br><br>Over the past few weeks, the hype about Singapore hosting a F1 race was gathering pace.<br><br>Many had speculated Melbourne was where the decision would be announced.<br><br>Now industry watchers feel the earliest date may be next week or even April.<br><br>But to the Singapore Motor Sports Association, any delay would mean less time to prepare the manpower and logistics for the race.<br><br>Tan Teng Lip, President, Singapore Motor Sports Association, said: "Since we are doing it for the first time, a lot of training needs to be done for our officials and marshals, to get them ready. This is a more critical issue."<br><br>Being a street race also means more planning in terms of crowd control and emergency evacuation.<br><br>But no matter when the decision would be made, one thing is certain Â– the economy, especially tourism, will get a boost.<br><br>Chris Quek, who organises tours for Singaporeans to overseas races, sees a reverse influx of fans from Malaysia and the region.<br><br>The fact that it could be a night race also gives Singapore more advantages.<br><br>"Because it is held at night, people have no choice but to stay the night. From what I heard, it will probably be a midnight race to cater to the overseas market," said Mr Quek.<br><br>Singaporeans are already gearing up for the event with a forum called "Motor Sports Asia" planned for April, and some big names have been invited as guest speakers to give insights on why Singapore should be part of the fast action.<br><br>Here's the link for the article.. <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/264823/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/264823/1/.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. The drivers interviewed so far say they will race as long as the lighting provided is adequate, namely Alonso, Webber, Barrichello and Davidson. Night races are done in touring car series and in the USA as well.<br><br>2. The roads will be repaved with a slightly different asphalt, and even permanent circuits also have their repairs.<br><br>3. The cars are not that wide, and there are sections of the which are wide enough for passing.<br><br>4. That's what the free practice sessions on Friday and Saturday are for! F1 teams also have their own simulation programmes.<br><br>5. You can incorporate security gates, and tags for ticket holders.<br><br>6. They don't have to, have you forgotten about the underpasses? Race fans need to eat too you know!<br><br>7, 8. There are fans who come simply for the race itself. F1 fans watching on TV are only interested in the racing itself, no need to go into the touristy bits. And they come from all over the world.<br><br>The central location of the track is so much more convenient to get to and away from. If you've been to Sepang for the race you'll know what I mean.<br><br>9. That is not the point. And they will benefit intangibly. Wait til get up close to the cars, the drivers, and hear the roar of motors at 19,000rpm. It's much less formal than the IMF/World Bank conference.<br><br>10.
