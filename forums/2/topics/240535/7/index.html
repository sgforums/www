Singapore should not compete with Malaysia," Sports Minister Azalina Othman Said told reporters. "I am not worried. I have no concern with Singapore hosting the F1 race."<br><br>Commercial negotiations are under way and the wealthy Singapore government is prepared to offer support in order to host a F1 race in the city-state. A decision is expected after this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.<br><br>Azalina said Malaysia had a far superior track and touted the country's hospitality service, which she said was a draw for race teams as well as tourists.<br><br>"I think Malaysia has one of the best tracks. We host the hottest race in the world. I don't think Singapore can challenge the F1 race in Malaysia," said Azalina. "Singapore and Malaysia should be complementary," she added.<br><br>Her comments were in contrast to those from Mokhzani Mahathir, chairman of the Sepang International Circuit, who told AFP last week the move by Singapore would create more regional awareness and interest in the sport. "With Singapore hosting the race, it will only create more interest and we will probably get more spectators at Sepang," he said.<br><br>However, Mokhzani warned against holding the F1 races back-to-back, as that would 'cannibalise spectatorship.'<br><br>Malaysia has stressed its commitment to ensuring it remains one of the legs of the F1 race beyond 2010. The country hosted its first F1 Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999 and last year promoters SIC renewed the contract for another five years.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it seems that everyone agrees that F1 is a great idea, but who's gonna foot the bill? According to the ST (quoted in below report), even the idea of racing at night appears fraught with problems..<br><br>So, erm... what happens now?<br><br><strong>Hopes fade for Singapore GP</strong><br>10/05/2007 10:03  - (SA)<br><br>Singapore - Hopes are rapidly fading that an agreement will be reached in time for Singapore to host a Formula One Grand Prix in 2008, a report said on Thursday, citing sources familiar with negotiations.<br><br>The city-state is keen to host a street race and the government has given its blessing pending ongoing negotiations between local business tycoon Ong Beng Seng and F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone.<br><br>But the Straits Times said financial and logistical hurdles have slowed progress on a deal.<br><br>"He (Ong) wants the government to foot a large part of the bill, but the government thinks that is unwise," a source familiar with the negotiations told the paper.<br><br>The government said it was "willing to support such a venture up to a level commensurate with the broader benefits to the economy."<br><br>The cost of hosting a race, which has been tipped to be the sport's first night race, is estimated to be $70m.<br><br>Aside from the costs, the paper said the task of working out logistics, particularly maximising public safety and minimising disruptions to local businesses in the area earmarked for the race, was proving to be a nightmare.<br><br>It said roads would have to be widened, kerbs remodelled and crash barriers erected.<br><br>However, lighting was the main challenge as Formula One has no standards for this, having never before hosted a night race.<br><br>A senior member of Ong's team has previously said a decision needed to be made by April this year if they were to be ready for a 2008 race.<br><br>http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/More_Sport/0,,2-9-32_2111269,00.html<br><br></div>
