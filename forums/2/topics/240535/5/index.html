SGP roads generally  too narrow and overly confined to be able to hold a race where there can be overtaking, etc. i can't think of a 5km stretch ring road that can facilitate that. [b]that's why monaco race is one of the most boring. </strong>there's few stretches of the road where 1 can overtake a car.

And unlike you, I will answer the questions posed to me. I do notice them, but does it register most of the time? No, becos Vodafone is not available here. Furthermore, I am focusing on the racing.

Another forumer said that monaco was relatively boring becos of the lack of overtaking areas. You said he was not a real F1 fan - becos obviously his opinion differs from you. But I am (and have been) asking you whats wrong with his statement? Does Monaco have relatively less ovetaking areas than other tracks? You tell me about the driver's points-of-view, F1 viewers point-of-view, Mark Webber being in 3rd position... you must have been SO disappointed that Mark Webber did not stop next to a side advert...</div>
