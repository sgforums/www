            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>Its wonderful news that F1 is coming to singapore! I think its 100% gonna be a night race. Its to cater for the european viewers. Bernie has already openly admitted to that. I think a night race is a great idea for singapore,<br><br>Singapore will be mentioned in national news papers round the world for the night race, How can singapore miss this???<br><br>One of the benefits of staging an F1 race is the media buzz around it. Make full use of it!!<br><br>Although the race is held on a sunday, traffic disruption may start around Monday or tuesday leading up to the race on sunday and if they get the job done quickly, Monday morning might be cleared for commuters.<br><br>THe track needs to be resurfaced prior to the race. barricades and kerbs have to be fitted and the FIA will do a check by wednesday or thursday. so work might have to start from tuesday latest. Friday is already practice and saturday quali. So its a minimum of 5 to 6 days disruption during the grandprix weekend.<br><br>Are there any clubs or pubs in sg where F1 fanatics meet?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes you are right. UK time is 7hrs behind sg and most european races are screened around 11 to 2pm. So, a 11am race start in the UK will be 6pm in singapore. I think it will not turn completely dark until 7.30pm right?<br><br>However, dusk is the time when it looks most gloomy. There is this 30mins of really gloomy time, i think around 7pm, depending on the time of the year. I never liked that time of the day, neither here nor there.</div>

What if it rains? Drivers like us can hardly see anything w/o headlights in the event of heavy downpour in late evening, less F1 drivers who sit low in their cars w/o any lighting assistance (lightning not counted). The race may be started with the safety car in front, and ends with the safety car in front too. Unless they wanna hold it in afternoon, it is unlikely that they can save on lighting equipment. Thus, might as well have it at night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the flood lighting will literally light up the whole track. I've seen a pic of an american series that races at night and its almost as bright as daylight on the track. ONly problem maybe the reflection of the light on a wet track.<br><br>Any support races you reckon? There are no formula racing in singapore, perhaps touring cars?</div>
