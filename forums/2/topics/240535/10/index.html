A smaller track is cheaper to maintain and run, and subsequently more affordable for groups to make use of. </div></blockquote>I agree with you and rojak about the circuit. I dont think we need to jump in the deep end and spend hundreds of millions on a modern F1 spec race track. A circuit designed to accomodate the lower formulaes like A1GP, F3, F3000, touring cars, Super GT etc should suffice. But it should have the option to be upgraded to F1 standards if the need arises.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I think F1 spec circuits are not all about the track itself. F1 tracks have more stringent safety requirements and run off areas, but i think a considerable portion of the costs are channelled to the infrastructures like the media tower, garages, and hospitality suites. So, if we're going to build a modern race circuit, the track/circuit itself shouldn't be far off from the F1 track designs.<br><br>I think a good location for a race track will be around the tanah merah ferry terminal area. There is a huge plot of reclaimed land and while we're waiting for the sand to settle, its perfect for a race circuit. Reclaimed land takes like 10 to 15years to settle down if i'm not wrong.<br><br>rojak, I made a mistake about the international B licence, its in fact a MSA national B. My Bad!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I will have to upgrade later after some more race experience, but i'm not sure if SMSA will recognise a foreign national licence. I think it should, since the MSA and SMSA are both governed by the FIA.<br><br></div>

This is assuming that it is an intermediate track for touring cars up to <strong>Formula 3 or V8</strong>. We could then host SEA legs of Japan GT Touring championships too. It should be a multi-use track, for karting and Moto GP class events too. This track need not stand alone, but be part of an integrated facility.<br><br>Maintanence and operation will probably be done on a partnership basis with private investment and operation taking the major shareholding.<br><br>Any RFP will more or less be easily snapped up, I totally agree.<br><br>Better to race on the track, and allow for a safe avenue for like-minded petrolheads to use, than for them to speed on the roads. It will create and foster a more responsible motorsports attitude, especially amongst the young drivers.<br><br>Lastly, this track need not be more than 1km in length. Remember that a track winds inwards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">HERE is the million-dollar question: Why is the Government spending so much to help race promoter Ong Beng Seng stage a Formula One car race?<br>That is what seems to be bugging some Singaporeans ever since the announcement on next year's Singapore Grand Prix was made - that the Government is using taxpayers' money to co-fund what is seen as a private entrepreneur's business deal.<br><br>Last Friday, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced that it will pay 60 per cent of the estimated $150 million cost.<br><br>In return, the Government expects the race to generate incremental tourism receipts of $100 million a year, part of which will be paid by hotel guests in the form of a special F1 cess on the hotels lining the 5.2km route.<br><br>The STB believes that F1, with all its hype and hundreds of millions of television viewers, will add lustre to the name of Singapore, with the resulting branding leading to intangible benefits for the island's image, tourism and business.<br><br>This point has been strongly emphasised, but some still maintain that as a businessman, Mr Ong is in it for the money, and yet he somehow managed to convince the Government to foot the bulk of the cost.<br><br>But this is too simplistic a conclusion to make, given the complicated nature of the F1 business mechanism.<br><br>There are several issues at work here. One is whether the Government could have sealed the F1 deal without Mr Ong, who is a personal friend of F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Mr Ecclestone said no; he would not have signed on the dotted line if not for Mr Ong.<br><br>Two: Does Mr Ong stand to make a bundle of money by getting the Government to take such a huge stake? He said no. Given his low profile, we may never know that. But from past experience in other countries, race promoters do not break even, and hence need government support to make the whole thing work. So the conclusion here is that Mr Ong did not want to overextend himself financially and would have withdrawn entirely if not for the Government's support.<br><br>Three: Why even go into something like this when nobody makes any money, and an event like the F1 is so disruptive to those living in the host country? Three reasons: Prestige, prestige, prestige. Conclusion? Prestige at all costs.<br><br>Given the reluctance of all parties to clarify the figures involved - which are bound by confidentiality agreements - perhaps the next best way to look at this matter would be to examine Malaysia's experience with F1.<br><br>Compared to Singapore, Malaysia is a veteran. The 'set- up' is similar - it is a joint venture between the Malaysian government and the Sepang International Circuit (SIC), which, without the government's involvement, would run an annual deficit. Yet the SIC will mark its 10th race next March, six months before Singapore's five red lights get a chance to go out next September or early October.<br><br>The Malaysian government has been behind F1 since the first Grand Prix race in 1999.<br><br>Putrajaya underwrites it as a national project and will continue to do so because it is the country that benefits, and the money is recouped through various corporate taxes. And as part of a larger motorsports policy, the SIC's permanent track - as opposed to Singapore's street circuit - allows other events like the Moto GP, Japan GT Championship and Merdeka Endurance race to attract tourists all year round.<br><br>But even with government help, the organisers have to work hard to gain maximum mileage from F1. Just getting the fans to turn up and buy a ticket is not enough. In addition to watching the race, they have to be convinced to stay on for ancillary events like live concerts and mega street parties.<br><br>Of course, all this does not mean that Singapore's experience will be exactly the same. But to help allay people's concerns, the Government and/or Mr Ong may do well to shed light on how they derived the figures that they have thrown up.<br><br>For example, while Singapore says it will cost $150 million to stage F1 here, the corresponding figure across the Causeway is said to be about US$70 million to US$75 million, roughly $106 million to $114 million at today's exchange rates. And although Singapore is said to expect tourism revenues of $100 million, Kuala Lumpur is understood to enjoy around US$100 million.<br><br>Perhaps these variations could be easily explained by the fact that a debut race on a street circuit at night will cost more, and the tourism receipts are just a conservative estimate by the Government.<br><br>Notwithstanding the arguments for and against financial help, or the figures, what is certain is that the Singapore Government must have been convinced of F1's bigger economic gains after witnessing Malaysia's success. And that is why it is supporting Mr Ong. Now it just needs to convince the public.<br><br>BUSINESS TIMES</span><br><br>(Straits Times 19 May)<br><br>Indeed the government must release more figures to convince the taxpayers that this investment in F1 races will make sense and have good returns. Prestige is not enough. There many other ways to gain prestige for Singapore. The only consideration is economics. We have decided it is worth our while from the financial point of view, despite the huge initial investment. Now it is essential that the goverment brings on board the taxpayers.<br><br>Talk about a race track for other categories is far too premature when Singaporeans have not yet been convinced of the economic value of the F1. The Australia experience at Albert Park has not comvinced me that there is an ecomic case for a dedicated race track. Here are excerpts from a report on the matter (<a href="http://www.save-albert-park.org.au/sapweb/Summary%20Submission%20to%20AG.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.save-albert-park.org.au/sapweb/Summary%20Submission%20to%20AG.doc</a>):<br><br><strong>"There is no real evidence that the economic benefits  of staging the Grand Prix event in Albert Park Â‘far outweighÂ’ its cost to the Victorian public,  as claimed in the 2002 annual report of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation. The cost is significant and will continue to increase  annually..."<br><br>"Â·	An indicative cost-benefit analysis carried out by Save Albert Park, using the   ACT Auditor GeneralÂ’s methodology, showed the event produced a loss or                                                                                       only a relatively small profit.<br>Â·	The event incurs a substantial annual operating loss which to date amounts to a total of over $40 million.  The loss for the 2003 event is expected to exceed $11 million.<br>Â·	Capital (establishment) costs, ie. 1995 construction costs, plus subsequent race related costs total over $73 million, which represents an annualised cost of approximately $4.75 million.<br>Â·	There is no evidence that  the media exposure generated by the event has any<br>significant effect in promoting Melbourne as a tourist destination."</strong><br><br></div>

The success of our tourism industry will be very important for Singapore as this will be singapore new engine of growth. hence I can understand and fully support our government decision to subsidize part of the bill<br><br><strong>c) Will OBS be able to capture F1 hosting rights without our government's support?</strong><br><br>Most definitely not, because no private entity will be able to profit from such mega event, unless it is a consortium that owns all the hotels around Marina Bay area.<br><br><strong>c) Will Singaporeans benefit from F1?</strong><br><br>F1 is just part of the overall marketing strategy of our government to promote Singapore tourism industry, hence I am confident to say that Singapore is moving in the right direction to acheiving it's tourist target.
