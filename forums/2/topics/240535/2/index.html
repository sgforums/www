Today's "source" is a bit too quick off the mark then?<br><br><strong>No deal yet on Singapore race, says Ecclestone</strong><br>By Alan Baldwin<br><br>LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone denied on Monday that Singaporean property tycoon Ong Beng Seng had secured the rights to host a grand prix in the island state.<br>"<strong>We haven't entered into any agreement with anyone at the moment," the Briton told Reuters.</strong><br>Ecclestone, 76, said he had been talking to interested parties in Singapore for three years but rejected media reports in the Far East suggesting that Ong's Hotel Properties had secured the rights.<br>"I don't know anything about it," he said.<br>Ecclestone, who would not say who he was talking to in Singapore, added that he was keen on a night-time race but no announcement was imminent.<br>"I think it would be good, I was the one who suggested night races to them (the Singaporeans), and not only them but other countries in other parts of Asia," added the commercial rights holder.<br>Shares in Hotel Properties rose as much as 15.8 percent on Friday on local market talk about the deal.<br>Formula One has 17 races this season but Abu Dhabi is due to host a race, the second in the Middle East, from 2009 on a street circuit using part of the harbourside. South Korea has also been scheduled for 2010.<br>NIGHT RACES<br>Ecclestone has talked before about night races in the Far East, which would be far more attractive to the European television companies.<br>The Malaysian Grand Prix, on the same time as neighbouring Singapore, is broadcast live at a time when many European viewers are still in bed.<br>"I would like to do one or two night races. It could be good in Japan or China," the Briton told reporters in Abu Dhabi last month.<br>Circuit designer Hermann Tilke said recently that advances in technology had made the concept of night races, a novelty for Formula One, a realistic proposition.<br>"The basic problem is lighting," he told the Autosport Web site (www.autosport.com) last month. "You need a certain amount of brightness in order to allow the cameras to show the cars properly and not as a blurred streak.<br>"But then again, both in lighting systems and in camera technology, we have seen tremendous developments so I cannot imagine that those would be real problems."<br><br>http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-6458348,00.html<br></div>

Unfortunately they dont own a single one. Hence the only people who can make this happen will be the Singapore government. To have the ministers talking about it in the parliment, is already a clear sign that PM Lee has already approved the budget and it is a definite go and they will make it happen, or else they will be embarrass if they fail. (AGAIN)<br><br>US$250 million for 7 years will only cost Singapore government about US$35m per year, and I cant think of a better marketing strategy for singapore than this, especially if you consider the immediate spill over effect on the 2 IRs and other industries.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Casting aside the F1 vs IR comparison, I believe that F1 hosted here will have positive spillover effects, i.e. tourism, business attraction. Like what the papers today said, it's going to open the world's window to our country. So far, I'm not sure of any huge scale event that has taken place here that has captured international attention from all walks of life. And I doubt we'll ever have a chance to host Olympics nor World Cup.<br><br>Well for the race itself, I think it's gonna be really interesting if a night race were to be held. So far, teams have had to work under the limitation of tyre wear made worse by the heat. For a night race, they have at least one load off their mind and can concentrate on making the race a more competitive one. Well one thing is that we may be deprived of the all-out engine scream like on the racing circuits as I doubt our roads are long and wide enough for a roaring stretch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The teams will need to make the gears shorter for this course. The engines will be at their loudest along the pit and back straights, and in short spurts between some corners when the drivers don't shift up. We won't be denied the aural spectacle...if it happens.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Theatre Of Dreams:</div><div class="quote_body">Well for the race itself, I think it's gonna be really interesting if a night race were to be held.

However, the hilton and FS's have one of highest ADRs in Singapore. You can be pretty sure that the OccRates for luxury hotels will benefit whether over looking the track or not if the F1 comes to Singapore.</div>
