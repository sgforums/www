ONly problem is not many people can see thru the intagible benefits.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Its going to be hard to stage the first night F1 race, no doubt, but lets not be so pessimistic!!!<br><br>I've been to the london street demo a few years ago when F1 was even considering a street race in london. The turnout was close to 500,000 if i remember correctly. The streets were packed with people and it was a really great experience. Engines screaming at 19,000rpm, i think everyone should experience it!<br><br>Don't forget, F1 will not be in town for just 1 day. Its the whole week! (so disruption to the traffic maybe even worse than you tought) The media, drivers etc will arrive by tuesday or earlier. They will get acclimatised first, then practice runs, etc. Friday will be practice runs, saturday quali, and sunday race! And no, they wont open the roads in between the practice runs on friday and saturday, because the circuit will become dirty from the traffic. so i wonder what are they gonna do about that. But i'm sure, fOr the whole week, singapore will be F1 mad!<br><br>I can see just how singapore's going to benifit from all the buzz in the media!!!!<br><br>Even my malaysian friends has told me that they will travel down just to watch the race. There are australians who replied in other internet forums supporting the singapore GP. They have a very good impression of singapore and think its a good idea for a sg GP! Tourists from around the region will flock in big time!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why the government kept saying they support the idea of an F1 race here in Singapore, but they need the cooperation of the private sector too..the govt already said they will try their best to help the private sector when it comes to the high cost..so it shouldn't be a problem..hopefully this problem is solved quickly and an announcement is made soon..here's hoping.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The recent comment by government that F1 will have to be lead by private investor sort of worries me. Honestly how many businessman in their right mind would dare to commit to a US$35m x 7 years hosting fee upfront if they dont have to any committment from government.<br><br>I hope this is just a wayang show by government to cool of the worries that Singapore is going to use coffee's money for F1.<br><br></div>

What's 3 nights of road closures when we have had roads closed for weeks?<br><br>And if I'm not wrong, they do allow normal traffic to resume between the practice runs, qualifying and race at the street circuits like Monaco. Sure the track gets dirty and I'm sure they do clean it up but you'd probably have heard the commentators mentioning the "dirtier" condition of the track at the start of Monaco cos of the "Ferraris and Lambos the night before".</div>
