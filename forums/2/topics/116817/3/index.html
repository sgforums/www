Any overtaking or dragging of gear like insulting other people's manhood. Want my car to look the way i like it, drive it the way i like it so hard meh?<br><br>Got incident on cte where i was on right lane keeping pace with the cars in front of me when a modified lancer originally behind me cut to center lane, accelerated, forced himself into my lane then immediately cut three lanes to the left to exit at outram. turn around and wave to me some more.....so i just smiled and waved back. what the hell did that accomplish?</div>
