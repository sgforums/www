AE86 are the purest breed car at that categories at that time and even till now. AE86 is a miracle...<br>S15 are also miracle...... Altezza are good but it lack the pure breed taste compare to that 2.<br>AE86 and S15 are made with the mindset of enthusiasm buy the engineers and designer.<br>Whereas altezza is good but is a bit more commercialised now....

You mentioned that you are driving a 2 yr old car which u think is horrible..Since its pretty new, why the sudden change of mindset? I mean you couldnt have felt it was horrible and bought it two years ago right?<br><br>Well lets say it was a mistake. On choosing your next car, do a through research before deciding on one. Best if you can find a friend who can let you test drive it or go down to the show room to test drive it.<br><br>When test driving the showroom car, DO NOT be modest. It is not a test drive car for nothing. just whack it hard to find out its maximum performance and see if it suits you well. what i mean in suiting you well are not the power figures but the how well the car balances and handles the power that its engines curns out. You will love your car when you know you are able to control it accurately and precisely. almost like when car and driver is one. haha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On your current car, minor mods should be no problem when it comes to selling car. For example, Cold Air Intake, Bigger rims etc.<br><br>Bigger wheels are said to worsen your FC as the tire is now broader and has more contact point with the road, thus giving rise to added friction. You engine has to burn petrol to over come this extra friction. However, pple do feel that a right sized rim will improe handling of the car.<br><br>For mods that are illegal, not only will you have problems selling them but it would be difficult to pass inspection of the car. An example would be adding a turbo to your car.<br><br>However, the easy solution would be to remove illegal mods before selling the car and hope that the inspection pple like to drink coffee cos you will be paying them coffee money.<br><br>I hope this has helped you? if not feel free to ask more questions and i try to help you again.<br><br>Once again, i apologise for misunderstanding your intentions.<br><br></div>
