Just get used to it... i think it happens even more to P-plate drivers... some people tend to hate p-plate cars....<br><br>Just avoid the extreme right lane if you think you wont be going fast... last time, i will purposely slow down to disturb tailgaters... usually i will get angry stares... but now i grew out of it liao... if i see a tailgater behind me, i change lane.... however, if im not on the extreme right lane and im already going moderately fast, but there's still a tailgater, i wont give a damn about him... just drive as per normal... he will overtake soon....</div>
