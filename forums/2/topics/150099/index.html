They also have additional air inlet to suck in cooler air from outside as seen on the right side of the W 124 taxis e.g. Therefore those petrol models with the sound deaftening material on the bonnet only (instead of full encapsulation underneath as well as with the diesels) cannot be of any significant fire hazard as since the vehicle can 'tahan' a full encapsulated environment without fire, no reasons why those with only the padding on the bonnet would catch fire with any high likelihood !<br><br>Therefore any incidence of fire would have to be 'externally' caused, especially for a make of finer repute.

They also have additional air inlet to suck in cooler air from outside as seen on the right side of the W 124 taxis e.g. Therefore those petrol models with the sound deaftening material on the bonnet only (instead of full encapsulation underneath as well as with the diesels) cannot be of any significant fire hazard as since the vehicle can 'tahan' a full encapsulated environment without fire, no reasons why those with only the padding on the bonnet would catch fire with any high likelihood !<br><br>Therefore any incidence of fire would have to be 'externally' caused, especially for a make of finer repute. Wonder how many people bother to check on the quality of maintenance they give to their vehicles like who they entrust it to for servicing ?<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
