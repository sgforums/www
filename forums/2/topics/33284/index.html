            <div class='col-md body'>if ure interested in purchasing products like fuel energizer as advertised in wheels (jan/feb 03) than this is a warning to u. i bought this product coz i wanted better acceleration for my car as well as better fuel economy. i also liked the product as it was realli cheap compared to the rest of the competition. a similar product to this is the calski ion accelerator. i wanted to get the calski instead but was hated the high price. (1 for $280!!!) 1 fuel energizer costs only $60. anyway i bought 6 sets for my lancer glxi. at first there was noticeable results and i enjoyed driving my car more. however after abt 2 months, i felt my car was getting slower and slower and my fuel conumption was getting higher and higher. after 3 months my car felt very much slower than before. i was realli frustrated so i decided to try the calski ion accelerator coz they were offering a free test drive wif the product. if u dun feel results, u just return the calski. so when i went for my 1st test run, my fuel energizers were still installed and 3 calski ion accelerators were added. after 5 mins after the installation, i could feel the difference already. the car was definitely more responsive. then for the 2nd test run, the fuel energizers were removed. wah after that my car felt EVEN better!! i purchased the 3 calskis after that and threw away the fuel energizers. my wallet was tight but i knew that the product realli works. now even after 3 months, i still feel the full effect of the product.<br><br>my point to this is that if u want to get gd results, be prepared to spend a bit more. if not then dun spend at all coz u'll be wasting money on stuff that don't work.</div>
