            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on the person.<br>Well if u are the kind of person who travel alot for buisness purposes, u can't afford to take public transport every now and then. and if u would given a option of driving your car / take a public transport, what would u choose.<br>As for me i would choose to drive, cause i can go anywhere i want at anytime of the day. I can even drive to J.B is I want. There are advantages and disadvantages of having a car. There is nothing "FREE" in singapore. If u need gain something u have to loose something. So here u loose is the value for yr car after certain years of driving.<br>So what  ppl think abt this issue!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having a car in Singapore is a luxury. It is not a necessity..with the convenience of our transport system.<br><br>Having a car improve your image to your prospective client..relatives and friends. The type of car you drove..reflect your status and achievement. Sad to say..we are living in a real materialistic country.<br><br>Having a car has it's disadvantages too..like the road bully and hogging...lack of car park space..cost of maintaining the vehicle like servicing, inspection and occasional breakdown so forth.<br><br>When you consider buying one..think carefully before you put down your downpayment.Dakar miss out on the Insurance coverage, other car park charges and the ERP toll deduction from your cash card..and that will set you back by at least another $100/- per month.<br><br>In Singapore..you will still reach your destination on time and safely..irregardless of whether you are travelling on the public transport or in a private car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having a car in Singapore is really expensive.  Imagine you will have to fork close to 100K including COE for a 1.5 litre Proton car.<br><br>Whereas just across the causeway, one only need to fork out RM55000(S$25K) for a 1.6Litre Proton car.<br><br>Even a Honda, Daihatsu, Toyota and many other cars are far less cheaper.  A E200 Mercedes in Singapore will cost at least S$300K.  While in Malaysia is about RM200000(S$95K)and in Thailand is about Baht 2.0million (S$97K).<br><br>Aiyoh why Singapore cars so expensive.  I dunno also.  Even local transport like SBS, MRT and TIBS are getting more expensive. Imagine taking a bus ride from orchard to Changi will need to fork out $1.50 or more if you need to change bus.  While in Malaysia you need to pay only about RM1.50(S$0.65) if you need to travel the same distance.<br><br>Wah Pian, even petrol money is rising over the past months.  Now LTA is adding the ERP time from 5pm to 8pm.  Wahkao.  It is getting damn hard to live in Singapore.<br><br>If you just earn 2K to 3K, better stick to local transport.  Think about having a HDB flat will kill you already.<br><br></div>
