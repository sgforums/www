            <div class='col-md body'>recently had the same incident with my Sunny.  neighbor saw Lexus reverse ram my parked car and run away.  neighbor-of-the-year left me a note with his contact and the culprit's plate # on my windscreen saying he is happy to stand witness anytime to what he saw.  my bumper was hanging loosely after that.<br><br>after that was a learning experience for me, but well worth it.  u must do these steps to take the culprit to school, effort on your part but we need to punish nonsense like that if not they keep on doing it:<br><br>1. call your witness to thank him and confirm with him that he is willing witness.  you then prepare a typed testimony based on your witness' story and get witness to sign off on it.  make 5 copies (1 for yourself, 1 for witness, 1 for IDAC, 1 for police &amp; 1 for 3rd party mechanic)<br><br>2. take your car with registration card plus insurance papers to IDAC in Vicom Sin Ming to have your car damages accessed.  they will confirm the culprits's registration plate, take damages photos with you &amp; your witness' testimonies and prepare forms for your 3rd party mechanic.  keep a copy of whatever forms.<br><br>3. go to any 3rd party mechanic willing to claim on your behalf, there are many.  IDAC has a list of 3rd party mechs.  they will look at extend of damage and probably multiply their own claims by 3-4 times the regular amount.  this is the amount that they will claim against the culprit's insurance and will cover all legal fees.  they will also arrange for you to send your car in for repairs and rent another similar car for you to drive in the meantime.  cost of rental will go to culprit.  keep a copy of whatever forms.<br><br>4. almost done, but we need the culprit to kena jialat in hopes the culprit will learn.  go to your neighbourhood police to make HIT &amp; RUN report.  show cops all the forms from witness testimony to IDAC report to 3rd party claims.  everything.  cops will thank you for reporting the culprit and they will chase the bugger down to fine him jialat and dock him 12pts for the crime.  no arrest will be made coz no one injured.  but cuplrit might be banned from driving if exceed points.<br><br>5.  car repaired in a couple of days, good as new plus YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SEE THE CULPRIT'S UGLY FACE OF CRIME. and culprit's yearly insurance will double because of his evil deed.<br><br>hope these procedures will help anyone who have similar situations.</div>
