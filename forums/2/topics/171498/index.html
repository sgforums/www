            <div class='col-md body'>Went looking for a new BMW today and the people at BMW Adelaide gave me the keys to a facelifted BMW 740i to test drive for a day. I am still grinning from ear to ear... it is a fantastic piece of machinery. This was a black car, with the sports kit and 20 inch rims. For sports suspension and big rims, the ride was very comfortable!<br><br>It cossets you and is so comfortable on the inside, the multi-adjustable seats are just so nice! Initially took a bit of getting used to coming from the older E39 528i, with the i-drive and all, but what a wonderful car! The gearbox is silky smooth and why would you even play with the manual mode with this box? Leave it in D sport and just press the loud pedal! Accleration is not what you would expect for a car of this size... I took out two new wrx's with this, I know that round the twisties, they probably would have my car, but in a striaght line, it is ballastic. That is not to say that it dosen't handle well, it drives smaller than it's size and is very "chuckable" for its bulk! A very pleasant driving experience indeed.<br><br>Steering is a bit light, but has an ease about it, though going down the high way at almost 200km/h, it was rock steady and very planted! I could not resist, so I took it up the highway again, just got back. I have the car till tomorrow afternoon. Inside, the sound system is phenomenal, the kit is just so good and the sound reporduction is amazing, something the would please most audiophiles. Now if I can only figure how to put one into my five series...<br><br>Still there are so many things to learn about the car, it is a shame i only have it for a day... but tomorrow, I will be test driving an X5 4.8is... a whole different kettle of fish! Just thought I would share my thoughts.<br><br>Anybody have any experiences with the new seven? Any niggly problems? Please let me know so that I can make an evaluated opinion... appreciate any feedback.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are overpaying for it. Redbook lists the new price as $178,300. Furthermore, with it being the end of the year, can usually get onroad costs included and knock it back another 1k or 2k.<br><br>I guess it doesn't matter, coz once you drive it out of the dealership, the value price is going to drop by a quarter anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
