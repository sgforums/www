            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone able to advice if there's any harm to release brakes and just let an Auto car "balance" itself on a slope (not steep enough for the car to roll back) while waiting for traffic light to turn green? Or should the N gear be engaged and then press the brakes to avoid roll back?</div>

I left the Merc E200 Kompressor on a really steep slope. Perhaps 15 to 20 degree slope. with D engaged, even though im not on the gas, the car managed to roll UP the slope! of course we were at a dead crawl, but most cars i know would be nicely balanced without moving forward or backwards. this one definately need to hold brakes. no wonder brake wear n tear a bit high.</div>
