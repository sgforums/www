              <p>I don't get it. It's just a car, if you can well afford an expensive one, by all means be a proud owner, exude equal class. Both should come together in one package tastefully.</p>

              <p>It's very common for drivers to cut 3 lanes in one shot. See it all the time. No gripe over it, so far they've all been able to navigate expertly. As long as they don't cause me an accident, by all means go ahead. But the moment they pose serious danger, then I'll react.</p>

                                <p>Yeah sometimes you really wonder why they do the things they do.
                                There is no sense in it.</p>
                                <p>It's very common for drivers to cut 3 lanes in one shot. See it
                                all the time. No gripe over it, so far they've all been able to
                                navigate expertly. As long as they don't cause me an accident, by
                                all means go ahead. But the moment they pose serious danger, then
                                I'll react.</p>
                                <p>Btw I declare every friday night, dangerous driving night. For
                                unknown reasons, people seem more reckless on the roads.</p>

              <p>No way. It depends on how experienced the driver in the Civic Type-R is. You should see the power output to see how weak the Honda's engine is in the torque department. WRX might have turbo lag, but once the turbo kicks in, the Civic Type-R can eat its dust. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yeah sure. But most of the time I see that happening due to poor route planning or just pure bravado. But hey what can I say, not an expert driver either. If I could I'll cut across 3 lanes too but the thing is I've got neither skills nor the balls for that kind of stunt. </p>
              <p>When I make my way out around 10 plus eleven on friday nights, notice more drivers speeding recklessly about town. Maybe they're all rushing to clubs and pubs or home sweet home with loved ones. Sense of urgency is heightened! haha...</p>
