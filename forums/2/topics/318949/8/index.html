              <p>lol..."words of wisdom"...more like ur 2 cents worth...actually make that not even a cent worth...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">...u saying that people who spend 100K on their cars without a turbocharger are daft? ...so people who own Merc C, E, S klasse (excluding AMGs), BMW 3, 5, 6, 7 (excluding M series) series and a whole loooooooooooooooong list more are penny-wise pound-foolish? So we should have bought the V50 T5 instead of the 2.4i? What kind of logic is that?
