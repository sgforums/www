              <p>Drivers like that are oblivious to everyone else but their own ego. No matter how you sound your horn, scold or even remind them politely, they wouldn't give a damn one lah.</p>
              <p>But nice design, see it around the roads frequently. Didn't know it costs 100K though.</p>
              <p>One time peak hour at Cathay parking lot, female mercedes driver was waiting for another car to exit his lot, but didn't realise she's actually blocking his way. The fellow had to horn several times. She took 5 minutes to inch her car towards room for him to exit. I'm not joking.</p>
              <p>Next she took another 3 or 4 minutes to park. I didn't even horn. Why? Because this kind of driver is oblivious one. Get angry also no use.</p>

              <p>I disagree. Sometimes you need to sound the horn continuously to drive your message across or prevent an accident from happening.</p>
              <p>I was traveling along the city area going straight at 60km, a fleet of stationary cars on my right waiting to turn and one single joker swerved out of the line suddenly and wanted to cut in front of me. Why anyone would do that, I have no idea. That's just asking for trouble. It was a fucking stupid thing to do. He had a passenger on his side.</p>
              <p>I sound my horn immediately. The bugger stopped and waited. I could've crashed into his side.</p>

              <p>i was in the middle lane, and this mofo tried to one shot cut 3 lanes to the right, i jammed e braked, and i thought i was definitely gonna bang into him.. blardy hell..</p>
