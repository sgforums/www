And I hope you know Singapore ONLY relies on CNG to generate electricity..and by burning MORE CNG, does it produces MORE harmful gases and carbon dioxide?

But you still say there's no choice for some people to stay near the powerplant and breathe dirtier air? Aren't you contradicting yourself? You want everyone to have clean air, but you say some people LAN LAN have to breathe the dirtier air near the powerplant? Why not YOU go stay near the powerplant instead? Then I see whether you want so many electric cars or not.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You and reddressman like to think until so far, why not think of ways to remove carbon dioxide from the Earth's atmosphere?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. From a topic like the least km/litre to a raging war on if electrical vehicles are the cars for the future.<br><br>Yes, according to COE (conservation of energy), the propulsion energy has to come from <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span>. Either through petrol, diesel, sloar panels etc. Why the hype behind electric cars?<br><br>1. They are more efficient. A simpler mechanical design (I think) will lead to less energy loss. Compared to a conventional car, the pollutive parts tend to wear out and increases waste gases that are harmful.<br><br>2. Economy of Scale. For a power station to produce power, it is more efficient to burn CNG compared to our small engines. As such, (as I do not have the data to show the difference in power efficiency), I believe this would reduce the amount required.<br><br>3. Singapore may not install renewable energy generators in the foreseeable future, but there is always a possibility. Tidal power, nuclear, whatever.<br><br>4. Singapore can actually reduce the tax levied on such cars. S$80K is an artificially high price caused by tax, and it can go down much if that is the Govt's intention. Govt revenue will not decrease from the petrol taxes, if you consider the much costlier changes in other sectors. Furthermore, the prices of cars have been going down. Hybrid cars can decrease prices more than proportionally. Those are Govt incentives to make us choose what type of vehicles we want. People still look at their wallets before buying.<br><br>5. If you see, there is actually an increase of luxury vehicles on the road. BMW 320i, E200s etc. I believe they are more expensive than CNG cars, but yet the brand is more important to this group of consumers. CNG E200s are rare in Singapore. It is not that we can't afford hybrid vehicles, the issue is whether we want it or not. Instead of just one pump of CNG at Buona Vista (other locations I am unaware), build up the infrastructure first! What 12.5 million bridge connect Kent Ridge to Mt Faber. Is that necessary?<br><br>6. It's just priorities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gevo:</div><div class="quote_body">Sigh. From a topic like the least km/litre to a raging war on if electrical vehicles are the cars for the future.<br><br>Yes, according to COE (conservation of energy), the propulsion energy has to come from <span style="font-style: italic;">somewhere</span>. Either through petrol, diesel, sloar panels etc. Why the hype behind electric cars?<br><br>1. They are more efficient. A simpler mechanical design (I think) will lead to less energy loss. Compared to a conventional car, the pollutive parts tend to wear out and increases waste gases that are harmful.<br><br>2. Economy of Scale. For a power station to produce power, it is more efficient to burn CNG compared to our small engines. As such, (as I do not have the data to show the difference in power efficiency), I believe this would reduce the amount required.<br><br>3. Singapore may not install renewable energy generators in the foreseeable future, but there is always a possibility. Tidal power, nuclear, whatever.<br><br>4. Singapore can actually reduce the tax levied on such cars. S$80K is an artificially high price caused by tax, and it can go down much if that is the Govt's intention. Govt revenue will not decrease from the petrol taxes, if you consider the much costlier changes in other sectors. Furthermore, the prices of cars have been going down. Hybrid cars can decrease prices more than proportionally. Those are Govt incentives to make us choose what type of vehicles we want. People still look at their wallets before buying.<br><br>5. If you see, there is actually an increase of luxury vehicles on the road. BMW 320i, E200s etc. I believe they are more expensive than CNG cars, but yet the brand is more important to this group of consumers. CNG E200s are rare in Singapore. It is not that we can't afford hybrid vehicles, the issue is whether we want it or not. Instead of just one pump of CNG at Buona Vista (other locations I am unaware), build up the infrastructure first! What 12.5 million bridge connect Kent Ridge to Mt Faber. Is that necessary?<br><br>6. It's just priorities.</div></blockquote>You seem to think deeper than reddressman and mitsubishi hater, but not deep enough..if reddressman and mitsubishi hater is stuck at Level 2, you are at Level 3 at most..still not thinking deep enough..<br><br>1) No doubt electric cars are more efficient than petrol/diesel cars, but I have asked once and again can electric cars match the mileage of a equivalent petrol/diesel car currently? The answer is NO and this is why nobody considers it a viable alternative to petrol/diesel cars yet. Of course no doubt in the future, matching the mileage of a petrol/diesel car may be possible with better batteries pack and even more efficient motors, but for NOW electric cars is a big no-no.<br><br>2) This point agreed, so I've got nothing to add on or correct.<br>But when CNG burnt, still produces CO2, so at the end of the day it's 90% LPPL.<br><br>3) As I've said in my previous post, it is really quite impossible for Singapore to generate electricity using 100% renewable energy because we simply do not have strong winds for long periods of time, we do not have rivers that have powerful currents, our sea also do not have powerful waves and we cannot tap into our lucrative solar energy because we are so land-scarced..And nuclear is not considered renewable energy FYI.<br><br>4) Yes, you are right to say hybrids is expensive due to our unfriendly taxes. Our government sure can lower prices of hybrids/electric cars in the future by levying taxes. But this is quite impossible to happen in Singapore because, first, you have to ask yourself why is Singapore imposing sky-high taxes on vehicles? They want to control the amount of vehicles in a land-scarced Singapore. So how much tax can the government levy for us? If they make the cars too cheap, everybody flocks to buy it. If they don't offer any levy, nobody wants to buy it. In any case, electric/hybrid cars will be hard to make a stand in Singapore.<br><br>5) Again, half plus six ideas and thinkings. You answered your own question isn't it? You wanted to know why so little Singaporeans bought CNG cars? Because there are very few top-up stations for CNG. And why is this so? You answered it yourself by saying we lack the infrastructure. Then you said built more CNG stations. Here's when you never think properly. What if they built up the infrastructure and still nobody wants to buy CNG cars? How can you be so sure people are not buying CNG cars because of a lack of infrastructure? Maybe they are not buying CNG cars because mileage not any better and it's weaker than petrol engines? When you are not sure of the cause of a lack of buyers, don't jump to conclusions. Our government will never make assumptions. They will never do things they do not have 100% confirmation in. To put it simply, our government doesn't like to waste money.<br><br>Added: To clarify myself, I am not saying electric cars will never be a reality. I am SURE electric cars will be reality in the near future. I am just saying for NOW, it is still a big no-no. But reddressman and mitsubishi hater seem to think electric cars should be used now and right away. Stop being childish and THINK WHY it cannot happen NOW.</div>
