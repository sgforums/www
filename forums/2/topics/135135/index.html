I guessed it all boils down to luck.  My friend bought a Toyota Camry, 6 months visited workshop 4 times.  Another bought BMW, also visit workshops until the mechanics also know him.  All are brand new cars.<br><br>On the other hand, I have been driving an Accent for the last 3 years.  I make sure I go for prompt servicing and dun do unneccessary mod...thus far only voltage stabiliser, grounding wires and cold air intake to make the transmission smoother.  No prob or whatever.  And now that I probably need to change car to accommodate another member, I am still looking for another Hyundai.  I have trust in the make and my luck.<br><br>I do not think you have owned a Korean car before, so I supposed your perceptions are based on what you hear......so now as a Korean car driver, l am clarifying the issue.<br><br>I feel that a lot of people here are not comparing apple to apple.  Korean cars are value for money and was never meant to be a status symbol.  So if you are buying the car to impress, then it is not the right car to buy.  Who dunno STIs and Lexus, just to quote a few are beautiful and powerful?  But do a comparison of price and needs, guess it is quite clear cut.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Military Officer. I bought a brand new Accent(FL version) back in 2003. Most people based their perception on korean cars based on what they heard and not what they have experienced. My car is more than 2 years old and it has been serving me well and good. There's has been no nasty surprises and the interior is still as good as new. For your info, I drive around a lot and I have already covered 80,000km on my car with only wear and tear parts to change. I am getting around 14km/l and I do ram the car at times.<br><br>If given a choice I will still buy another Hyundai but of course, a bigger one such as the Trajet.<br><br>If you are into image and style, pls dun buy Korean, they were never meant to be so.</div>
