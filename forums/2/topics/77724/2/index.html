Ya, the J-series ended so fast, car business must be booming, huh?<br><br>Great!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  You long-neck wait is over soon. Whether you get your car earlier or not may depend on your choice of colour. It seems like every shipment, the distributor will bring more of those colours prefered by most customers. What's your car's colour?<br><br>In S'pore, I noticed a lot of pple's cars are in silver (also my previous car's colour), light grey, champagne, etc., all the light metallic colours. I believe you know why. Even some of those car polishing services charge more for darker colours of the same make.<br><br>I saw another thread started by you complaining about (toyota) BM's SEs. I did not encounter any unpleasant incident recently ..... coz I never go there mah! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Some of my friends said so much good things about altis, but the thought of difficulty to find my car in the carpark puts me off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  Actually ha, I just don't want to squeeze with so many pple at the showroom. I did go to BM Leng Kee once 2 yrs ago, and was pretty happy there bcoz nobody bothered me. That's the positive side of it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , so I could climb in and out of all the cars there, tried out everything. Of course I did not get to test drive any, but what the heck, I did not intend to buy then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Ok, not to detract to another topic, you'll be asked to collect your car at Mandai, been there b4? Very ulu place, but can ask your SE to bring you there. Keep your excitement checked for the moment, coz you'll jump with that when you first see your new baby. Enjoy it !</div>

Of course driving a new civic makes it doubly exciting!<br><br>Wow, you really look into the details huh? For me, the sporty optitron instrument is the best part, which is also one of the factors that made me chose this car. Why? It just brightens me up whenever I turned on the key <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  exaggerating a bit lah.<br>The Kenwood stereo is also a nice gadget, with the changing colour LCD. The cassette slot, however, is a redundant feature juz to fill up the gap. It would've been better if that was a 2nd CD slot or something else, I have not been playing cassettes for years!<br><br>BTW, wat is "toughseal"? (sorry, me a bit suah-gu in that) Does it mean you don't have to polish your car after that? And they have a regular car-wash service similar to those at caltex?<br><br>I sent my car to Alexandra for 1Km servicing recently coz it's nearer to my workplace. The service there is quite ok, though the waiting lounge is so-so  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> . Not sure about Ubi. The technician who attended to me was polite and enthusiastic, and that's the minimum I asked for. Of course I trust that they know their stuff well, unlike my previous car's servicing agent who didn't really instill much confidence in me. I may go to Mandai for my next or 3rd servicing coz my company is moving to Woodlands prob in Dec. But i'm not sure how to get out from that place other than calling a cab if I didn't want to wait thru' the servicing hours. Any advice?</div>
