            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, everyone.<br>Me new to the forum, happened to "tripped" over it while surfing for info about Civic which I intend to buy.<br>Anyway, I bought one already, getting my new Civic (2003 version) next week....ya, it was during that promotion period that I signed on the dotted lines.<br><br>So far, I know there are a lot of Honda's enthusiasts out there, judging from the amount of topics related to Civic and all the mods that can be done on it. But I'm not so knowledgeable in this aspect. pai-seh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>From another angle, not sure if there are folks like me who know or just like to know about Civics in everyday use. That's why I started this new thread.<br><br>Perhaps for a start, anyone knows what series of engines (all those EG, EK codes...) are the current Civics running on? How different is it from the older ones?<br><br>Any hiccups faced by you in driving the 2003 or 2004 Civic?<br><br>Hope to see your inputs soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>What's the difference between 2003 and 2004? So did you get a good buy? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I am currently driving a 2000 Exi, the ECU was giving me problems during the inital months.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, TAL, nice to hear from you.<br><br>According to some reviews from foreign websites, there are only a few differences between the 2003 and 2004 versions. Most noticeably are the front grille and bumper.<br><br>The 2004 version has a curve bar bending towards the Honda logo, a sharper tail-end for the head-lamp, and outward "teeth" on the bumper next to the fog-lamp pockets, giving it a shark-like appearance. The 2003 one has a horiz bar instead, orange-tinted signal lamp cover with a rounded tail-end for the head-lamp, and inward "teeth". Putting them side-by-side you will know what I mean. Other than some other minor upgrades or changes (not too sure about the details), both are practically the same car.<br><br>So, after some deliberation, I decided to go for the 2003 version when its price was tagged at 74.5K in early April. Considered quite a steal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Dun have too much bargaining power as the SE said he "barely earn much" from clearing these old stocks. Only got the leather seats. Hmm... wonder if I was too "kind-hearted",.... or simply stupid?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, it's me again.<br>2 weeks liao, since I got my new blue civic. As usual, first 1K-km drive is always about going &lt;3K rpm. Nothing to shout about.<br><br>However, I do find that somehow my steering (or wheel set) seems to bias to the left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Experimented it driving on a straight road and lifted off my hands for a while. Anyone got this "problem" before with the new civic? I guess should not be too bad and could be fixed easily during service, huh?<br><br>Tyre pressure: stated optimal 210 kpa (30 psi) each for all 4 tyres. If I were to travel to KL, normally the pressure needs to go up a bit more. What pressure do you suggestion for my current tyres (bridgestone potenza 195-60-R15)?<br><br>Another discovery: when unwittingly hit &gt;3K rpm, the engine sounds a bit rough. Is it normal during this break-in period?<br><br>BTW I'm going for the first 1K-km service at KM (leng kee) tomorrow. Any advice or what to expect when I send in the car? Normally how long will the servicing take?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, TAL,<br><br>I drew experience from my old car, and also advice from some magazine articles that for long distance driving, the wear on tyres is quite jiat-lat, not to mention the air temperature inside the tyre is going to be higher than normal. So a slightly more inflated tyre (not too much, about 10~20 kpa above the norm) will help to reduce wear, but with a slightly more bumpy ride.<br>Did I sound right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Done my first 1000km servicing yesterday.<br><br>HENG@ is spot-on (pei fu pei fu !), the steering alignment is slightly off, but wheels are ok. The technician drove me one round to check against my claim. Also learnt a bit more about the car:<br><br>(i) more sensitive to the tilt of roads that are purposely built (my old car was not that sensitive), hence can always feel that the car is bias to the left;<br><br>(ii) tyre pressure not recommended to go higher than 210kpa even for long distance drive (sorry my previous msg should not be taken as a general statement) coz it might affect road-holding, not to mention the bumpy ride.</div>

I didn't smell anything funny inside the cabin, other than the usual "new car" smell. However, I did found burning smell around the back of the car during the first week after collecting the car. It's now gone, though, so I attributed it to "normal burning in" of the parts, or just the tyres.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  actually sound like professional but don't know exactly wat happened...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
