            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like that car still has some reliability issues to be sorted out. Looks like it may not be able to do long distance high speed cruises ala Gumball  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  The guy who bought it just for the rally was so pissed. Speedo blew at like 240 miles I think. Radiator cap went bust and he couldn't get a replacement. Clutch got screwed and he was leaking some coolant as well. Heh. But it's really one hell of a car. Would love to press the button starts on that one!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
