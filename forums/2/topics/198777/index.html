            <div class='col-md body'>Driving instructors are nasty?  Yeah, I've had some too......but they're nothing compared with some of the testers.<br><br>I had a tester who just shouted and accused me of things I didn't do.  He even scolded me because he didn't like the dashboard of the car!!  When I answered, he would threaten loudly "You come here to argue or to sit for test? OK, I put down my pen, we argue, come come".   Then he slammed his pen onto the table.  He was the lin-pei kind of attitude....just some power-hungry civil servant (not sure, but maybe ex-TP too).<br><br>He failed me.  A few days later, I read in the papers that he was whacked by another guy, who sat for his test the same day as me.  hahahaha.....<br><br>After reading about the case in the papers, I wrote in to complain about the tester that day too.  For my next test, somehow I had a super friendly tester, who asked me how I was, joked with me, and passed me (my 5th test).<br><br></div>
