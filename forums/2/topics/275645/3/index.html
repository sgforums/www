You don't really think the people up there are that dumb right?<br><br>They obviously know way beforehand that increasing the ERP gantries and prices will never reduce traffic congestion. Even those who do get deterred in the slightest possible way would give in and rather adjust their expenses over time.<br><br>So who wins? 1. More $$ for them. 2. People would complain less as they would be seen as "doing" something to "address" the issue.<br><br>Who loses?

ERP prices increase again and two more gantries being put up in CTE.<br><br>ERP is good but when a problem such as congestion keeps recurring, they can't keep using or I think relying ERP to solve the problem. As quoted by a CNA analyst report mentioned in the earlier post, the increase of prices does not really help or alleviate the problem of congestion due to the few reasons.<br>I guess bus fare hike  looks imminent. If I am not guessing wrongly, taxi fare too in the near future.<br><br>Instead of whining about the new "unpopular" policy, are there any viable solutions that we can feedback to the authorities?<br><br>I can't of any right now. lol.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>actually there are lots of solutions..<br><br>but they are all more expensive to implement than ERP. ERP just build gantry put a price and switch on can liao.<br><br>and btw KPE won't alleviate the problem completely. the bulk of the traffic northbound on CTE are all going towards AMK and woodlands. i would say less than 1/3 is going towards punggol sengkang etc.<br><br>so u remove this less than 1/3 traffic and dump it on the KPE, u still have the other 2/3 to jam up the CTE.<br><br>regradless, traffic flow is like water flow. a lot of the CTE exits are poorly designed. look at the CTE to PIE(Changi) exit.. every evening jam.. cause it's too windy and heavy vehicles move through too slowly and it's a single lane and plus they have to merge {fyi nobody bothers to merge. in the end cars side by side on a single lane. how stupid can LTA get} with southbound CTE traffic joining PIE(Changi) also at the end of the sliproad and then most of them end up on the left most lane of PIE(Changi) then even though got chevron markings all ignore and try to cut across to the right lane sometimes completely stop there zero kmh forcing everyone behind to stop - once that happens it's a chain reaction leading back to the CTE and forcing cars to stop and queue up to join the PIE(Changi)<br><br>this point already feedback to them one million times still nothing done. instead come out with more ERP. i tell u i bet they will ERP this sliproad one day.<br><br>aiya. LTA sucks. give them better feedback they give u standard reply that it can't be done. even simple things like putting up bollards or repainting certain sections also die die don't want to try -_-<br><br>think their thoughts stuck in 1985.</div>

This has been mentioned before though.<br><br>I just feel that this whole thing is a vicious cycle. After solving the problem of economic recession due to SARS in 2003, the economy rebounds and people are experiencing higher standards of living. Hence more people can afford to have cars since COE of cars decreases.<br><br>When more people can afford to have cars, congestion and environmental problems come in. And since the economy rebounds, more people are more willing to shop outisde, contributing to the high vehicle population. ERP charges have to increase again and again.<br><br>Sigh!!!

THIS MUST BE CORRECTED BY EDUCATION.<br><br>oh the worse ones COMPLETELY stop at the end of the accelerating lane.. that kind might as well paint a give way line for them still call accelerating lane for wad.. this is during off-peak, but at peak periods, one car do this, whole lines of cars joining expressway come to a stop, thats it liao.. start of traffic jam..<br><br>can't they just look at the left lane traffic earlier and find an empty space between two vehicles and pace their speed to reach the space at the end of the accelerating lane properly so they can merge properly?<br><br>2) flyovers, underpasses.. paya lebar flyover and eunos flyover of the PIE slows traffic down every morning and evening.. cars n vehicles climb a steep slope until 4.5m peak height then go back down.. before traffic jams start, these hills already forcing cars to slow down.. traffic is always smoother after the flyovers than before the flyovers.. some cars realli CMI lose 40kmh while going uphill.. dunno why sia.. force traffic to back up and slow tgther.. same problems on CTE but i not sure of the exact slopes.. why cant they do a 50-50.. the expressway rise 2.25m above ground level and the road below sink 2.25m to achieve the necessary 4.5m clearance between the two roads.. that way the slope of the flyover will be HALF its current steepness and that means vehicles can flow more freely.. definitely expensive to do this rectification but wth its their bad design in the first place..<br><br>3) traffic lights near expressway exits.. example is the thomson road exit for pie(changi).. 6pm traffic still quite smooth.. then u see thomson road the exit like a lot of cars going out that way then few hundred metres later got one junction got red light.. when that red light stay v long, the cars will queue up until reach the expressway.. in the situation i saw.. it back until the left most lane is a queue to go thomson road exit.. then when too long other cars dunno is queue for that exit from 2nd lane try to cut in between the STATIONARY cars on the left lane, they force in between two cars they stop on 2nd lane - 2nd lane comes to a stop. now left 1st (overtaking lane) open.. lorries buses all must filter right to go past them, speed of that lane drops to abt 20kmh.. just replace all the junctions near roads leading to/from expressways with underpasses/flyovers so u get a traffic light - less system that keeps traffic flowing without stopping.. of course again, this is heck a hell lot more expensive than an erp gantry.. but hey! its their poor planning again!!<br><br>eh still have a lot more but ya..</div>
