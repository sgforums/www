            <div class='col-md body'>let's see more BS from Raymond Lim's speech today...<br><br><strong>ERP is Necessary</strong><br><br>14. But a good public transport system in itself will not ensure that our roads are free-flowing. There will always be people who choose to drive because of individual circumstances or personal preference. Without an effective traffic management system, our roads will still be congested. For example, Tokyo has a first class public transport system but the expressways are still very congested and it takes on average two hours to drive into the city during the morning peak hours. Similarly, Seoul has a good public transport system but it suffers terrible traffic jams during the rush hours. Singapore must avoid this outcome.<br><br>15. If road usage is not priced, our roads will be overused, resulting in congestion. As you know from your own experience, when anything that is desirable and limited in supply is given free of charge, demand will exceed supply. If FA Cup final tickets were free, the number of people who want them will be greater than the seats available. If you do not control entry, there will be people who may well be crowding onto the pitch itself, ruining the event for everyone.<br><br>16. Similarly, many people want to use expressways such as the CTE during the peak periods, but roads have a fixed capacity. When the road is free, people will continue to use the road until traffic during peak hours slows to a crawl.<br><br>17. This is why, in addition to the various measures that we pursue, such as road building and a better public transport system, we also need ERP or congestion charging. Of all the different measures to deal with congestion, ERP is the only one that deals directly with the problem by requiring individuals to take into account the costs of congestion caused by their driving to others.<br><br>18. Many more cities are coming to the same conclusion after trying different approaches. I met Jay Walder, who used to be a Managing Director of Transport for London last year. He told me that 30 years ago, London and Singapore took different approaches to dealing with congestion in the city. While, Singapore went for congestion charging by introducing the Area Licensing Scheme (ALS) in the Central Business District (CBD), London decided to build more roads such as the M25 ring road around the city. He said that the M25 did not resolve LondonÂ’s congestion problem. On the contrary, by encouraging people to drive more, it created more congestion and London ended up with a giant car park for a ring road. London eventually decided to go the way of Singapore by introducing congestion charging in 2003. They started with Â£5 (S$15) and later raised it to Â£8 (S$24) per day per vehicle Â– much higher than our ERP charges. Congestion in central London dropped by some 30%. London's experience shows that even though it seems that the obvious solution to traffic congestion is to simply increase road capacity, this is not a sustainable solution as traffic will expand to fill up the additional road space.<br><br>19. Other European cities are closely studying SingaporeÂ’s and LondonÂ’s example. Stockholm has just introduced congestion charging, after a successful trial last year. In the United States, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is proposing a US$8 (S$12) toll to deal with congestion in New York City.<br><br>20. Our ERP system has been effective in keeping our roads and expressways smooth-flowing, above 45 kph for expressways and above 20 kph on arterial roads. ERP helps to manage congestion by encouraging motorists to change their period of travel, mode of travel or use a different route. Had it not been for ERP, we would be facing traffic gridlock on numerous roads. Take the case of the ECP. Before ERP was introduced in 1998, the travel speed was as low as 36 kph between 8.30 am to 9 am. Today, the average speed is above 55 kph during that half hour. Similarly for Orchard Road, average travel speeds on weekday evenings and on Saturday afternoons have improved from about 17 kph to 23 kph since ERP was implemented in October 2005.<br><br>21. Furthermore, with the introduction of ERP in 1998, the Government has been able to rely more on car usage charges and less on car ownership taxes to manage traffic demand. Vehicle ownership taxes have been reduced and as a result, annual vehicle ownership revenue fell from $3.4 billion in 1997 to $1.7 billion in 2006 compared to about $90 million in annual ERP revenue collected during that period. ERP has thus proven to be a more effective approach to managing traffic demand, and it costs motorists much less overall. Indeed, ERP is meant to be a congestion and not a revenue measure, so if motorists drive less and the roads are smooth-flowing, the Government will be happy to collect less. In effect, ERP rates can be adjusted down, as much as up, depending on the traffic speed on the roads.<br><br>22. With the use of ERP to manage traffic, this has also made it possible for more Singaporeans to own cars. Our vehicle population has grown from 680,000 in 1998 to 800,000 in 2006. However, to accommodate more vehicles on our roads, we have had to expand the ERP system from time to time. ERP started in 1998 on the ECP, CTE, PIE and around the CBD. It was then expanded to the AYE, and the arterial roads to relieve congestion at the Outer Cordon in 1999. It was subsequently extended to Dunearn Road in 2002, and more recently in 2005 to the northbound CTE in the evening and to Orchard Road on Saturdays.<br><br>23. To keep ERP effective, we need to continually adjust our ERP coverage. The traffic situation is always dynamic; changes in income levels, vehicle population and driversÂ’ travel patterns all affect traffic demand.<br><br>24. In this regard, over the last two years, traffic levels have been gradually but noticeably building up. More roads are congested, especially during peak hours, including in the evenings. The LTA has reviewed the situation, and decided to build a few more ERP gantries and extend the ERP hours on the CTE. LTA will be announcing the details of its review later. Overall, these changes will help to improve traffic conditions on our roads.<br><br><strong>Ensuring ERPÂ’s Effectiveness</strong><br><br>25. Now, we sometimes hear criticisms of the ERP system. Some have observed that introducing or raising ERP charges relieve congestion temporarily, but after a while, the congestion comes back. Others, especially those using the CTE, have complained that the ERP is unfair. They say that depending on where you join the expressway, some motorists add to the congestion without paying for it. This is feedback that we value. It shows that ERP coverage may need to be more extensive or pricing better fine-tuned. This is why we need to review the coverage of ERP on our roads regularly.<br><br>26. In the longer term, the LTA is looking at how to upgrade ERP technology to put in place a more effective system of congestion-charging. One possibility is to use GPS technology. We are working on this, but it is probably still a few years away as the technology is not quite ready.<br><br>27. Looking ahead, we can expect traffic on our roads to get heavier, particularly the roads leading into and out of the city. Today, ERP is introduced principally on a point by point basis. LTA is studying how we can deal with peak hour congestion more holistically and effectively, taking into account overall traffic conditions, for example in the CBD. LTA is also reviewing the optimal speed ranges on our roads and the response of motorists to the present structure of our congestion charges.<br><br>28. Our vehicle growth rate will also have to be reviewed. We must remember that the current 3% growth rate cap is on an ever increasing base. In 1990, when the 3% cap was introduced, it amounted to 16,000 additional vehicles a year. Today 3% amounts to 24,000 additional vehicles every year. Against this is the fact that road growth was only 1% per year in the last 15 years, going down to about 0.5% over the next 15 years.<br><br>29. As long as we want more cars on the roads, ERP coverage will invariably get more extensive and charges higher over time. This is a key trade off that we have to make if we want both car growth and smooth flowing roads. The Government is thus looking at what the appropriate balance should be in the future, between vehicle growth rates, usage charges and ownership taxes.<br><br>30. These measures will be part of the current comprehensive review of our land transport policies. We will need to make significant changes in order to keep our roads free flowing, our trains and buses efficient and convenient, and our city liveable and both people- and business-friendly. We are studying these measures carefully and will announce them early next year after the completion of the review.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>31. Our aim is to have a sustainable transport system that supports continued population and economic growth and the higher expectations that come with being a first-world city.<br><br>32. Building a better public transport system is a critical part of this. Refining the ERP system in tandem with other measures such as road building and controlling vehicle population growth are equally important. Together, these measures ensure that we have a quality urban living environment - a city in a garden and not, as in many cities of the world, a city in a car park.<br><br><a href="https://app-pac.mica.gov.sg/data/vddp/embargo/10676575.htm" rel="nofollow">http://app-pac.mica.gov.sg/data/vddp/embargo/10676575.htm</a></div>

But if you plan well, you can try to avoid it," said another.<br><br>A third motorist said: "It's the shortest way to town, so I'll still pay."<br><br>Most drivers are reluctant to let go of the wheel and take public transport simply because they've grown accustomed to the comfort and convenience of driving around in their own cars.<br><br>So even though it's going to be a more expensive ride ahead, they said they are willing to pay the price.<br><br>Dr Lee Der-Horng, Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at National University of Singapore said: "Pricing can be effective, so no matter how much you charge, some people may be affected. But I think the motorists or the general public are looking at whether we have a more comprehensive, integrated and overall solution.<br><br>"It will be too naive to expect that once you increase the price at this particular (area), the overall traffic congestion there will come down. For the car owners, we cannot just naively expect them to give up driving and switch to public transportation."<br><br>One solution offered is a public transport so good that even drivers are willing to give up their wheels.<br><br>The other is to charge more till motorists feel the pinch, like what London plans to do.<br><br>"People in London, they're paying five pounds... Personally, I think when the situation becomes necessary, the government may take the action to charge a very high ERP rate," said Dr Lee.<br><br>New York also has plans to charge motorists about US$10 when the city implements a similar road pricing system soon. - CNA /ls<br></div>

Now, we sometimes hear criticisms of the ERP system. Some have observed that introducing or raising ERP charges relieve congestion temporarily, but after a while, the congestion comes back. Others, especially those using the CTE, have complained that the ERP is unfair. They say that depending on where you join the expressway, some motorists add to the congestion without paying for it. This is feedback that we value. It shows that ERP coverage may need to be more extensive or pricing better fine-tuned. This is why we need to review the coverage of ERP on our roads regularly.<br><br></div></blockquote>lol? you must be kidding.. people complain the ERP is useless on the northbound CTE and the possible solution is to add more gantries and extend the coverage of ERP and charge even more?! WTH?!<br><br>why are they so stuck in their ERP only mindset?! ****!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think now the only solution to sort of alleviate the CTE congestion is the long awaited KPE.<br><br>Sigh!! ERP prices increase again and two more gantries being put up in CTE.<br><br>ERP is good but when a problem such as congestion keeps recurring, they can't keep using or I think relying ERP to solve the problem. As quoted by a CNA analyst report mentioned in the earlier post, the increase of prices does not really help or alleviate the problem of congestion due to the few reasons.<br>I guess bus fare hike  looks imminent. If I am not guessing wrongly, taxi fare too in the near future.<br><br>Instead of whining about the new "unpopular" policy, are there any viable solutions that we can feedback to the authorities?<br><br>I can't of any right now. lol.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
