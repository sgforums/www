              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Let me warn you about my experience. I would like to warn you about a guy from Zenith motoring whose name is Joe and number 91528168. This guy has serious credibility issues. Very recently, he bought my 2004 Volvo XC90 (ie: mileage 72900) and he informed me that he will be exporting my car.</p>
              <p>I had asked him several times that i did not want my car to be sold in Singapore and i wanted it to be exported. He told me not to worry and my car will be exported. Little did i know he actually sold the very car to Presto Motoring. I am not sure what kind of arrangement do they have but i am really angry about the whole episode.</p>
              <p>The main thing that really annoyed me is that how he was trying to be so reassuring and that i did not have to worry and he is very concerned about delivering good customer service. To make it worse, he was trying to sell a beat up Toyota Wish to us and claimed it is a good deal. We did not buy the Wish though.</p>
              <p><br>This car was sold by us to Zenith Motoring for $69,000 and now the same car is being sold for more than $76,000 at Presto Motoring. The license plate number is SJB7779L. All, i can say is that i have some concerns about this car and there was a reason why i wanted the car to be exported.</p>
              <p>Please contact me directly and i can share it with you. In a nutshell, it is better to export your own car if you can or trade in at reputable dealers. Please beware and hope you don't make the same mistake i did by selling to this guy.</p>
              <p>Also, the guy at Presto Motoring claimed it was an expat driver who sold the XC90 to them and i can assure you i am Singaporean. I am really dissapointed.</p>

              <p>noted.</p>
              <p>but as long as there is no contract stating the car is meant to be exported, there is nothing u can do i guess.</p>
