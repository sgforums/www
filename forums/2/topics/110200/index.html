Have you went down to their showroom, test-driven it? I know Picanto auto is really weak and have very bad FC. If getting it, go for the manual one. My bro test-driven it and said, it is about what you expect from a 48k (the price then) car. So I guess it is OK.<br><br>As for the cost, other than the installment, it is save to include $500 for other expenses. Fuel, carpark (home and out), road tax, insurance, minimum maintence.<br><br>As everyone is thinking COE might drop after around March again, you might want to wait til then. Save up some money (1k per month, if you can't, don't get a car) for more downpayment. Try to decrease the loan period to 7 years. It is only about 100 more per month, but you save thousands!!!</div>

The fixed costs of the car such as the actual price of the car are things you can see. But there are a lot of hidden costs such as maintenance, petrol, road tax, insurance, carpark (season and outside), interest for the loan and the number of years you are going to loan that you must take notice of because these are the costs that are actually going to kill you. The time when you breakeven your loan is also important.<br><br>If you are even going to struggle a bit in paying just the instalments for the car, then please do not get one. You might end up making a huge loss if you find that you can't upkeep the car after a short time and have to be forced to sell it due to the loan. Lastly, know what you are getting the car for. Plain transport or whatever.  Consider how long you will like the car you want to buy, FC, leg and boot space and whatever you consider to be important and compare it with your budget. You can narrow down your choices fairly easily then. Hope this helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If you can do it comfortably, than it is OK. Someone who earn 3-4k per month, but spend it all most of the time wouldn't be able to support the car, whereas some thrifty guy who take home 2k might be able to afford it. However, remember that 1k per month, we are talking about budget car with a decent FC. One that doesn't breakdown offen, or isn't expensive to service. Vios seem to fit the bill.<br><br>As for the COE, if you really wants the car, go for the comfirmed COE package. If I am not wrong, it is 1k more. The refund thing, you have to check with the SE. I heard even 1-2k drop in COE, they will refund you, for BM. Other dealers' practice is usually only when COE drop until 16k will they refund you. It is under a agreement you would sign before they bid for you.</div>

I think its the most value for money in tt range.<br><br>Certainly (assuming all else the same) less usage will means less maintenance.<br><br>err...the 8-9 yrs concept or 4-5 yrs thingy, i think u got it mixed up. its not meant to be this way.<br><br>When ppl say for 10 yrs loan the breakeven is abt 5yrs it means that if u wish to sell your car anytime before the 5th yr, u might have to pay the bank $$ to get it sold off.. break even means the value of the car matching the outstanding loan amount. this translates to you having to pay the bank money when you sell the car before the break even period, and receiving money nett if you sell after break even period.<br><br>So normally, it means tt if u go for 10 yrs loan, u must be prepared to stick to your car for at least 5yrs. Else, be prepared to cough up $$ just to sell it off.<br><br>I dont drive as of now...but i will soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
