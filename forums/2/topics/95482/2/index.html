From what I notice, those cars that the bulb can adjust to shine higher will shine not directly into another car / driver even if set to the highest setting.<br><br>High beam is high beam, which will make one feel irritated. This is one of the reason why high beam is designed for. To catch the other party attention so that you know something is wrong with the other party or you in a way that the other party is trying to warn you. Of course, the other reason is light up the road IN SITUATION WHERE THERE IS TOTAL DARKNESS.<br><br>Bottomline is that if you want to high beam, make sure it is used for a purpose and make sure that you do not affect other motorists.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>these taxi drivers r making a living on the roads. 10 to 12 hrs a day. why make their life difficult? they drives almost non stop....their driving experience is double or even triple to any of u drivers on the road. Blame the taxi company for the faulty head lights not them. the maintainence is done by the taxi company not them. if their old type of headlights r consider highbeam, wat abt those of u who had change the bulbs to helium? it shine the whole of the car cabin thats in the front to daylight!!!! it is not until u have to be on the road to make a living that u will understand the life of drivers of watever trades on the road. its becos of those dum dum drivers that cos all sort of probs. admit it that there r arse taxi drivers out there....esp the yellow cabs!! definately there r onli that few..... do give them the benefit of the doubts man...... how will u feels if someone comes &amp; break ur rice bowl? think abt it.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some more usage for highbeams, it is generally practiced by taxi drivers and truck drivers to communicate or alert other drivers of your presence (also used in EU, USA and other western countries).<br><br>For example, when you are making a right turn and a taxi going straight ahead (opposite side) but you try to proceed to make your turn.. may be you assume that he is stoping or turning left, in this case he will use the high-beam (just a single flash) to warn you that he is proceding straight ahead.<br><br>Another common usage is in freeways to alert someone cutting into your lane with bad judgement of your speed. I noticed that people usually horn but it is useless because your horn is very feeble on freeways (remember most drivers turn-on their stereo, horning is a very bad idea). You can double flash to indicate that it is difficult to slow down, and prefer to proceed first.<br><br>you should also use it when travelling along sharp bend on two way roads to alert the drivers on opposite side.<br><br>There are many more usage, and commonly practiced in EU and USA, try searching for usage in google.<br><br></div>
