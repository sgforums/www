              <p>Note that reposessed cars are usually reposessed without the knowledge of the owner, hence the term. As such, when you buy reposessed cars, most likely all you have is the 'Master' key, or even no key at all. While the alarm can be recoded, things like the physical key design is a bit harder and more expensive to change. You then have to change the license plate number (or you'll just be inviting the previous owner to "REPOSESS" your car).</p>
              <p>Another thing is, when buying reposessed cars, getting a loan is nearly impossible from the bank, and much harder to get from so called used dealer's 'finance' company, unless you have the cash for full settlement.</p>
              <p>Do not think that you are playing on level ground with the rest of the used car dealers. While the price is cheap, do note that you are not the only one bidding, and it is common knowledge that the bigger used car dealers have the privilege + advantages in getting first dips on the better (ie lower mileage, better condition, original parts such as original alloy rims) cars before the cars are put up for auction for the rest of the general public. As such cars that you see on auctions are usually the 'leftovers' that the used car dealers do not wish to take in (used car dealers are in this business way longer before you were born. If they think the car is not worth buying, what makes you think you should?).</p>

              <p>In any case, I thought I would like to devote a point specially to thank you, seykai, for your contributions in upping the activity levels of cars forums. Without your nonsense, you would have certainly have not encouraged other sleeper forumners, like nox, allegrita, etc to come out of hibernation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think your you have proven to us your knowledge with respect to cars several times, be it gearboxes, or brakes, and now used car industry. I have nothing to prove, I am not afraid of being proven wrong, I am humble enough to accept that I make mistakes and am very willing to learn from other forumners.</p>
              <p>You, my dear Seykai, has proven that you are truly a worthy contender of mh2. If there ever was an awards ceremony for the self-pwn of the year, you would have been nominated - and most certainly would have - won that award.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day!</p>
              <p>Do remember to spend some time on your childrens' studies. I think they will greatly benefit from a parent who bothers to spend time with their children studying instead of asking for help on sgforums (I seem to remember you had certain issues with your son's grades in school.) It would be much more constructive to tutor your children if you yourself can't. If you like, I will be more than willing to introduce a couple of good tutors to you.</p>
              <p>After all, you wouldn't want your son to grow up to be just like you.... would you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              i thought all repossess car will be auctioned? 
              
              u mean some will be sold to dealers b4 they are auctioned? To save auction fee? 
              
              anyway, i think auction price will still be damn cheap....but must pay cash.... and shd be technically ok cos they are repossessed when the owner din want to part with it...

              <p>Yes they will be auctioned.. but to who first? Considering the high number of reposessed cars each month, don't you think its surprising where all the cars went? Sgcarmart is but a fraction of the total reposessed cars.</p>
              <p>Technically ok? Let me give you this example of this subaru owner, who knew that the car was going to be reposessed, so he literally 'dekitted' the car, from the high mount spoiler, rims, sports seats, etc etc. Who knows if the turbo inside is missing?</p>

              <p>Pretty sure the turbo is in there.. the question is whether its the stock standard one.. or worse.. some crappy turbo from some old 1980's car. haha</p>

              <p>Lol no idea what the owner did with his original parts, but sure will have people who will buy. Think about it, if externally the owner is smart enough to fully dekit anything that can be dekitted, I'm sure the internals will not be left alone as well..</p>
