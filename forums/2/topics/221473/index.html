            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm i have no idea how to do it, but seriously if i were you i will leave the airbag as it is.<br><br>Why?<br><br>1. Insurance<br>If one day u kanna accident (touch wood), and got seriously injured, i wonder whether your insurance company will compensate you since you deactivated the airbag. They can say it's your own action that caused you to be injured to this extent. Sure..you can sue them etc., but it will take a long time and provided you are still alive to do so.<br><br>2. Safety<br>Yeah airbags are expensive. But they are there for a purpose. Your seatbelt may save u from hitting the airbag, but one day you may be involved in such a serious accident that the whole steering column is pushed towards you. True, in the event of a serious accident, you may not be alive with or without airbag. But surely you will wanna take your chance.<br><br>3. Odds of meeting with an accident again<br>Well I dunno about you, but I guess you don't meet with an accident every month right? If so why not leave the airbag alone? If you wanna take it out, you still need to find a workshop to do it for you. Most prob it won't be free.<br><br>At the end of the day, i will rather pay $3500 to replace the airbag and walk out of a crash alive rather than deactiating the arbag (it costs money, time, effort plus you may not live to regret it). Besides, what is your car insurance for?? Dun think you will be the one footing the bill. Besides that, in an accident,the air bag is normally not the most ex item to replace anyway..<br><br>just my 2 cents  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but what if your face hits the steering wheel instead... or the sudden seat belt arrest restrains yr body but your neck snaps forward?... the idea of the air bag is to cushion the blow to the head, which i believe is the most vital part of the body. Would you rather slam your head to a steering wheel, the dashboard, the pillar (in a case for rear passengers)... or to an airbag which is much less than a solid impact? of course you wouldn't want any airbag to be activated by the slightest knock on the bumper... nor do you want it NOT activated when the entire front end has caved in... in the end its your own call.<br><br>i'd would say, ya spending $ on a big risk.</div>
