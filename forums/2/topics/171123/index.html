            <div class='col-md body'>a couple days ago i was driving home from work, came across a cabby who had trouble keeping to his own lane. not only that, he had no passengers so he was like going at almost unbearably slow speed. since i wasn't rushing for anything, i tailgated him and at the same time, enjoying the the view of his taxi drifting from in and out of his lane. along the way he also flashed at any bystanders on the road, in hopes of turning on his hazard lights in an instant and jamming his brakes with no regards for whoever's behind him. In addition, he had 3 near misses where he could've hit any of the passing cars on the next lane.<br><br>After a while i felt that i should make my presence to him... that he's being watched.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>first of all, i followed him as close as i can and making sure that at least 1/4 or maybe 1/2 of my car in his rear side view. next, everytime his cab starts to wonder off his lane, i flashed my lights.  then i had to make a lane change to go to my disired exit on the road. so i overtook him, just like any other pissed driver would do and i noticed he wanted to do the same. just when i was about to completely pass him, i slow down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> not only that, i dileberately wondered my car near the lane markings. after hanging there for 10 secs or so, i sped off and left him in the dust.<br><br>feels good to piss a cabby  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its very common for taxi doing alot of annoying stuff. 1 eg. travelling at 50 in small rd, the taxi all of a sudden midway of a bus bay, hazard on and jam brake to pick up customer. Imagine, total distance is only less den 10m, he jam brake, I got no choice but to jam together and horn him for 10secs while the passenger get on. Once my right lane clear, before the passenger close the door, spin tyres and screech the taxi driver ears. really dulan ... never check his back see got other cars or not juz jam brake. I ever horn from 1 traffic light to another about 50m becozz the taxi can't keep to his lane and eat in 1/4 to mine, I squeeze in and horn.<br><br>Next time dun press foot brake, tah lek hand brake, the taxi see no brake light if bang, he sure late to respond if tailgate.<br><br>Using high beams to brighten up their cabin would be bext if going downslope. sure bright de... add HID light or xeonT some more, at night they sure cannot tahan and change lane 1.<br>Got quite a few encounters with taxi, hate them alot.<br><br>But then again, there are still some minority taxi driver who are courteous.<br><br>But due to alot of monkeys, giving taxi drivers a bad reputation.<br><br>Even complain to their respective company, not much action would be taken except for a warning letter. Stupid taxi company in order to get more drivers to loan their cabs, they are actually letting loose alot of monkeys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have attended one Road Traffic Accident where this taxi hit a lorry at a junction. The taxi had the right of way as it was green light. The lorry driver hit and run , but the driver was caught a few hours later. It turned out to be a Bangladesh Worker....<br><br>So sometimes   there are worse drivers out there.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
