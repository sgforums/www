            <div class='col-md body'>Hello. So finally got your car huh?<br><br>Ok. This is about what u asked me earlier today.<br><br>For washing...any kind of car shampoo would do. However, if you intend to wax your car or do a sealant on it, then it would be better to get those kind of shampoo that are NON wax stripping. It would be written on the bottle.<br><br>Now washing should should be more than enough for most cars if you do it like once a week (this is excluding white or black cars). So if you wish to have that extra shine, you can try waxing your car. There are many different kind of wax in the market. From DRY to LIQUID kind...personally i prefer the liquid kind due to ease of application.<br><br>Now a sealant does exactly what the name says. Most sealants will be liquid and will form a thin layer of arcylic on top of your paint work. This serves as a protection for the paintwork against our harsh environment.<br><br>So in order to make your car's spanking new look last long...do all your washing and waxing till you feel that you car is looking its best...then apply a layer of sealant across it. For the first few times, i would advice to get a few THIN coats of sealant over it.<br><br><span style="color: red;">WHAT?? I have to do all that all the time?!!!</span><br><br>Well no..once you have done the above...your car should only need a gentle weekly wash to bring its perfect shine back. If you can try to add another layer of sealant monthly or so.<br><br>Welll, thats all i can think of at the moment. I am sure other pple have different methods. But this is the method i use. So feel free to try and if it doesnt work out for you then can try other pple's method.<br><br>Have fun washing your new car! And rem to ask me out for tea someday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
