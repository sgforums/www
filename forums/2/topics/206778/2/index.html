I'm afraid to disagree about your "backbone" point. Singapore is very much unlike Australia or America, where cars are much cheaper to own. A young adult here doesn't earn that much, and the cost of living is already good enough to take out a huge chunk of his pay. As a result, not everyone has the same mindset to "work their as5 off for the car". It really becomes more of a liability than a convenience, which is where the alternative stands, at public transport, for those who have "tight budget constraints" and yet want a car.<br><br>The matter I believe tofu is trying to point out is that these people are making really bad choices, given the kind of reputation that chery has. It could boil down to a couple of thousand dollars worth of savings for them, but many don't look like they realise that it's at the cost of a lot less safety and quality. It really gives the "cannot afford car comfortably yet die die want one" impression.<br><br>I know some of us here are better off than others to have their parents car to drive around, or to have their parents buying them cars. It's not their fault, nor is it their parents. You can't blame someone or call them "no backbone" just because their parents are well off enough to dote on them that way.<br><br>Hope you can understand our point is not to lambast those drivers, but rather voicing our opinion that they've made extremely terrible choices.</div>

I'm afraid to disagree about your "backbone" point. Singapore is very much unlike Australia or America, where cars are much cheaper to own. A young adult here doesn't earn that much, and the cost of living is already good enough to take out a huge chunk of his pay. As a result, not everyone has the same mindset to "work their as5 off for the car". It really becomes more of a liability than a convenience, which is where the alternative stands, at public transport, for those who have "tight budget constraints" and yet want a car.<br>[/quote]<br><br>You are right about this but you still fail to get my point.  Yes, not every one wants to work their arse off for a car..so if the QQ falls within their budget, why not?  These are the people who take the car as a form of transport, not something to shout or boast about ie. status symbol.<br><br><blockquote><br>The matter I believe tofu is trying to point out is that these people are making really bad choices, given the kind of reputation that chery has. It could boil down to a couple of thousand dollars worth of savings for them, but many don't look like they realise that it's at the cost of a lot less safety and quality. It really gives the "cannot afford car comfortably yet die die want one" impression.<br></blockquote>But who are we to condemn them for their choices?  Or even to start multiple threads poking fun at these owners?  Their own lives is for them to control.  Right?  Just like if I say no backbones, some people will take offence.<br><br>[quote]<br>I know some of us here are better off than others to have their parents car to drive around, or to have their parents buying them cars.

So you know they are terrible choices, I see no need to rub it in or to put forth your comments on the car in a very insulting way.  I would rather the thread be less insulting just like the earlier ones showing the crash tests.<br><br>You mentioned your point is not to lambast those drivers...look at the various thread your friend has started...I think they lambast the owners till death.<br><br>I still think Singapore is full of marketing hype.

Smart move by the dealer.<br><br>Unfortunately the local mindset of people is that, for certian things, the more it costs the better. And even if they did buy a lemon at an expensive price, their pride and ego will not allow them to admit that they bought a lemon. Cos they're afrad that they'll lose face and rather bite the bullet and complain.<br><br>honestly, we all know the QQ ain't a fantastic car. But please compare apples to apples. you can't compare a no frills car with one with a slight luxury standard.<br><br>QQ came into the market as a budget economy car. Is there anything wrong with that?<br><br>Their target market is for those who have just started working and can't afford to buy an expensive car.<br><br>Some of the comments made here (in the forum) are totall uncalled for. You people call other people's car CMI.<br><br>Make that statement when you OWN your own car. Not a car where you DAD or MUM pays for it. Then let's see if you'll say that a toyota wish with gauages is CMI.<br><br>It's interesting that all of you are trashing Chery. Not that i'm a big supporter of the brand. But all of you have to remember that at the end of the day, be it a QQ, or a Ferrari, it's still parting with hard earned money.<br><br>There are people out there who can just barely afford to buy a car, but they need one because of job, necessity, or family. There are reason why they need the car. But when a statement of Buying a QQ or Picanto, 2-3k more, it seems that the value of money to you forumites don't mean squat to you.<br><br>2-3k to you may be nothing, but 2-3k to other people could mean meals on the table for months.<br><br>I've been sitting in the backlines and reading how you people trash QQ, car owners, etc etc. I can't help but come forward and post this.<br><br>Like what spec said, till the day you own a car, then you'll know the feeling. If people just just barely afford to buy a car, and their choice is to purchase a QQ, so be it. But unnecessary calling it names, well, that's uncalled for.<br><br>You pay for what you get. Like what some people here said, maybe the purchased the QQ for just the sole purpose for getting from Point A to Point B. Who knows, maybe that owner has a nice sports car at home?<br><br>So don't judge. Even more so for those of you who aren't even working and driving your Dad's or Mum's Cars around. Earn your own pay cheque and buy your own car, and when kids start slamming and calling the car you purchased a CMI one, then you'll know the feeling.<br><br></div>
