            <div class='col-md body'>Anti AhSiah, Madafaka and Spec, relax. We're not here to pick a fight with you guys, or anyone at all for that matter. Especially when it comes to Tofu, whom if you knew him, I'm sure you'd know he's not that kind of person.<br><br>We're not trying to implement any standards or anything along those lines. We're just giving our opinion on that car. I know it might have been something that the owner has worked hard for, but we're not trying to insult his hard work. We're talking about the choice of car here.<br><br>Some people, as you have mentioned, worked their asses off to get a car. What we're saying is, if you can afford that 32k, what's another few more thousand spread over that long period during which you are keeping the car? A toyota with a cockpit full of gauges obviously doesn't say "economy", so that's out of point. We understand the convenience that comes with having a personal vehicle, but you guys should also understand what we're trying to say - that the chery is definitely not the way to go, simply because it's a trash car and an effing ripoff, so why are these people still going for it?<br><br>If you're going to spend 30+ thousand on a car, because that's about all you can come up with, and you don't even do a little bit of research to see what could be better, then I've really no comment.<br><br>The same way you don't like us talking about these cars and their owner's tastes is the same way others might get aggravated because you don't like them for their fortunes. If someone here posts a new mod on his spanking new sports car, you guys won't keep your comments away also. Come on, it's not like we haven't seen you guys at it too.<br><br>I admire pluck and hard work as much as you guys do, but that's no excuse for these people not using a little bit of common sense.<br><br>Just in case you're wondering, I'm no "ah sia kia" myself. I paid for my own vehicle with my own money.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I stand corrected on what u typed below. Are u implying that we possess a tinge of jealousy on people's fortune that we have to resort to aggravation? Sure hell no. It is the blatant display of show off, reckless speeding on the roads and bad examples of kids glorifying such acts that irks us. Money can buy u nice cars but never build character. QQ drivers may have made a bad choice, at least they stand proud in what they can afford. QQ, Picanto or not. <blockquote>Originally posted by Kr0n:<br><span style="color: red;">The same way you don't like us talking about these cars and their owner's tastes is the same way others might get aggravated because you don't like them for their fortunes.

I'm pretty sure you've met some like that.<br><br>And yes, I do agree that money can buy nice cars but never build character. But that's not quite related to why we don't like the QQ right? Like I've mentioned earlier, we don't like it because it's really a rubbish choice. It's a blatant ripoff and we can't understand why people will still buy it. Imagine someone going off to buy a Slim10 after the court case has proven the company guilty of the charges. Kinda like the same thing, you'd say wtf?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's THEIR choice, it's THEIR money. What they wanna do to their cars, sticker or not is their business. The postings here havent been very objective. Yes, u may screw its safety standards and quality. But insulting the owners is a bit 2 much.
