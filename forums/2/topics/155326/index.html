            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, was travelling on ECP on 30th sept around 4pm. Was heading to prince Edward exit for a 5pm deadline. Was travelling extreme right lane above 90 below 120 when i spotted 2 TP bikes approx 50 metres on my left hiding under tanjong katong flyover. Managed to slow down to 90 when at shoulder length with them. They looked at me. But did not chase me. They were only holding out a notepad with a pen and scribbling other things. Or something like that. I Already know the rough estimates if i possibly get a fine. Question now is will i get fined as they did not stop me?<br><br>Comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, nowadays TP don't have to stop you and tell you you are booked for speeding, they ambush you with their mobile cam and issue the speeding tickets right up to your doorstep and you are required to turn up at TP HQ to pay the summon if you not happy with TP and refuse to concede your mistake and want to appeal or challenge the TP to produce evidence that you exceed speed limit the TP will show you the photos of your car and the device which clocked you speeding but you have to pay them a sum of money a lot of people kenna already receive the speeding ticket in their mailboxes hahahaha in the future, mobile cams will be rolled out onto more roads to tackle people flouting the speed limit and virtually all major roads in singapore will be monitored with this device hahahaha i see many vehicles still exceeding the speed limit these days and seems that these drivers are either not aware or they are not very intelligent lol but i can tell you a lot of my friends kenna already so i advice you to be prepared for the worst and check your mailbox regularly for summon letter issued by TP and fork out a sum of money to pay for the fine hahahahahahahahaha not that i want to scare you but this is really true so next time try not to go above 90 very dangerous in the sense that you will be secretly snapped by laser mobile sensors without even knowing and one day you will regret when you receive the summon letter for speeding in your mailbox, very foolish and stupid to speed in singapore because i think nowadays singapore roads so highly congested and traffic junctions are everywhere so driving at 89 makes no difference from driving at 120 once i saw a BMW zooming past at 100 on bt timah road much much faster than other vehicles by in front when the traffic light suddently turns amber, the stupid BMW still have to e-brake and stop at the red traffic light so i laugh at this stupid BMW driver "hahahahahahaha drive so fast for what, in the end when traffic lights turn red u still have to stop hahahahahahaha stupid dumbass you are a disgrace to our country hahahahahahahaha freaking stupid dumbass hahaha" so in singapore no point driving so fast but i still see a lot of kan cheong aggressivce driver on the roads who think driving very fast will save them a lot of time our country is filled with stupid drivers hahahaha<br><br>and one more thing even if you slow down to 90 when approaching the TP also no use cos from far if you claim you are going at 120 the device will nab you already a lot of people still not aware of these facts laser devices can detected the speed of vehicles from as far as over 10km so TP will surely have clocked your 120km/h speed from far already and since you claim they look at your vehicle and one of them note down your plate number meaning more or less you have been caught already, anyway no use worring now, just face the music there is one saying if you dare to speed, you  shall dare to pay the fine and face your penalty so i really don't understand why are you still worrying in the first place, if you don't dare the face the penalty then in the first place you should not be speeding and obeying the speed limit so i think this is very contradicting anyway don't worry lah ahahahahahahahahhahahahaha</div>
