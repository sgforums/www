My wife is alright now. I agreed wif kops21, I sometimes really feels like putting one in the car, but due to the heat, it will damage the V.cam or camera. Considering now to fix the camera on the car like the adsvvertisement in Wheels Magazine, but no budget. Still waiting to post this in Toyota Club Sg</div>
