              <p>Hi peeps,</p>
              <p>I need some advice with regards to a car accident that i have gotten into in April. I was driving my friend's car and i hit a Nissan Selphy while coming out from a side road. His bumper was slightly dented. We met up the next day again to discuss and we decided it will be better off leaving this to the insurance companies to settle this as we couldnt come to a compromise to settle this on a private settlement as the driver insisted he wanted to change the bumper as it's a relatively new car. I can totally emphatize as i know its my fault that caused the accident.</p>
              <p>I got a lawyer letter lately on the breakdown of the damage costs. It sums up to 6k and it's quite ridiculous to have such an inflated amount. However my cause of concern is that what should i do next as i am still a newbie driver? I don't want this case to linger anymore as i think what's done cannot be undone and i just want to move on and regain my confidence again in driving on the roads. In addition, i would want to repay my friend on the loss of NCD and the increment in premium.</p>
              <p>I will be contacting my friend's insurance company again on Monday to inform them of this letter i received. Should i request any supporting documents from the insurer side?</p>
              <p>What should i do next?</p>
              <p>Sorry for this lengthy post but i just want to be clearer on the procedures just in case complications occur.</p>
              <p>Your comments will be greatly appreciated.</p>

              <p>since you know its your fault you should have settled it privately.</p>
              <p>since now you received the lawyer's letter, there are only a few outcomes.</p>
              <p>1. your friend's insurer pays up. close case.</p>
              <p>2. you pay, close case.</p>
              <p>3. he withdraws the letter and agree on private settlement. then close case.</p>
              <p>4. civil suit. which is most likely a losing case for you.</p>
