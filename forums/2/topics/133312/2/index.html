            <div class='col-md body'>my 2-cents worth of advice for those taking their tp..<br><br>don't forget, don't ever forget, to check your blind-spots... this may carry small pts but it may bring a lot.<br><br>n of course don't mount the kerb. that is immediate failure.  (duh!!!)<br><br>s-course, crank-course... open your eyes. if u must, don't just sit back. move your body forward to check left &amp; right.<br><br>in the circuit, listen properly.. sometimes instructor say go here or turn here. check if there is any arrow or sign that says whether can or cannot. sometimes they want to see whether you know how to read  the signs but sometimes they see some obstructions in front so he wants to go short-cut (to finish the circuit faster).. thats y, check the signs then tell him "Eh, the sign say no left turn!" .... n see what he reply...<br><br>there! my 2-cents advice..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess it depends on your luck of getting a lenient tester...took my TP at SSDC in mid April this yr at the 2pm slot.

Really like lucky draw but I can say that all the 10 routes aren't much diff...just have confidence and you'll make it through without much demerit pts.

If you clear the circuit without much hassle, you're 95% there. I really feared the reverse vertical parking as that was my weak point.
