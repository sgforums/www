And why are you talking about privacy of the Ferrari when it's parked in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-Storey Carpark</span>? EVERYONE can access the MS/CP and see the Ferrari (and scratch it if they want to)..even if KhidMasAE86 didn't reveal the whereabouts of the Ferrari, people that live near the MS/CP where the Ferrari is will see it when they go to the MS/CP to drive their car off to work..he/she will later go on and tell his/her friends about it..isn't it the same effect as someone PM-ing KhidMasAE86? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Its not my concern if its been revealed anyway. Passerby sees, its their choice, what im pointing is theres no need to broadcast or even an invitation to bring people there.
