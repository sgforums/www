            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah..i agree with sand king..dun flame until so jia lat la..But I still have to say that I simply cannot believe a 612 Scaglietti can be converted to a F430..the bonnet of the F430 looks too short to accomodate the V12 in front..and I believe changing a car's body usually doesn't involve shifting the engine anywhere..the chassis and the drivetrain usually stays in their original place..only body change..the body must acomodate the drivetrain and chassis..not the oter way round..</div>

My uncle knows the owner as the owner happen to be one of my uncle workshop customer. He told me that his car got a accident and the body got badly damage, he sent his car to one of my uncle friend workshop and his friend helped the owner to change the body to a F430 want. But all the part except the body is sure 612 Scaglietti. </div></blockquote>So u mean its an F430 with a scaglietti interior and engine? And may i know where ur uncle got the F430 shell from?<br>Aiyo.. u think playing model kits ah..<br>Isnt it easier just to say, 'sorry guys, i cant tell a scaglietti from a F430' instead of trying to cover up with ur ridiculous stories? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
