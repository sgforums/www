            <div class='col-md body'>The other night i saw a Nissan Silvia S15 that looks really evil... very nice... It has a body kit like JGTC race car... the additional body works are all in unpainted carbon fibre while the car is in some sort of dark color, either black or dark blue. It has a big GT wing that has a Nismo decal. both front &amp; rear wheels are very wide now... I am impressed by the rear bumper diffuser design. Very cool. The huge exhaust is above this diffuser, which is also bolt on unpainted carbon fibre parts. It is quite loud of course...<br><br>The rear widening parts i can see the fender, arche part is like rivet bolted onto the original bodywork from below the window line... kind of cool... it is curvy. i dun like the other seamless widening kit that makes the rear portion squarish... tat one is more common but less nice.<br><br>Anyone seen this car before or have photos of it... it is a beautiful &amp; evil wide looking Silvia S15, very unique...</div>
