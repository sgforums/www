            <div class='col-md body'>what u all said is true, a lousy victory. but i can understand what ferrari chooses to compete coz F1 is about a team sport! Michelin screwed up and the teams that work with Michelin has to pay the price by not competing. Think about it, it not good for the competitors, but it suddenly gave teams like jordan and minadi a break, they may be lousy teams, but competition is competition, a win is a win whether its a walkover or not</div>
