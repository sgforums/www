            <div class='col-md body'>Sometime back I was driving along Upp Seragoon Road and stopped outside Potong Pasir MRT station as the traffic stopped.<br><br>I was on the 2nd lane from right and I saw a middle age guy crossing the road w/o checking. When he walk past the front of my car, he just walked into at the extreme right lane without checking and ........"BANG !!". A bike hit this middle age guy and the middle age guy fly into the air with a somersaut. (I tink i saw ppl by the roadside took out score boards and give this middle age guy '9,9.5,10' score for the somersaut. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>anyway, i got down immediately and help the middle age guy as he bled badly fr his head. He insist of leaving and i told him no. I called ambulance and i held on to him until the ambulance came. The ambulance immediately said the middle age guy must go hospital. I also help the biker up and I agreed to be his witness as the middle age man crossed the road carelessly. The young biker was grateful. Other motorist who saw the whole episode give me thumbs up for help. I tot..one good deed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But the next day I went to the coffeeshop near my office and the usual kopi kia served me.
