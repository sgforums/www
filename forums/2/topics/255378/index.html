It should display a mugshot of the driver, information about his traffic offence, the penalty and demerit points, and a 1-800 number clearly visible so that the offender can be reported should he be seen driving badly again.<br>Apart from this sticker on his door, there should also be one on his car bonnet, as well as one at the back of his vehicle.<br><br>These stickers will serve to warn other drivers to be mindful around this driver, just as rookie drivers need to have the red-and-yellow tag on display when they drive. Taxi drivers should not be exempt from this shaming punishment.<br><br>The other important aspect of this punishment is to curtail the performance of the car driven by an offender.<br>The easiest way to do this is to have ultra skinny temporary spare tyres installed for all four wheels. These tyres are good for up to 80kmh, which is close to the legal limit anyway.<br><br>As these rims are often painted in bright yellow or orange, they will serve as a visible and clear signal that this driver is a traffic offender.<br><br>The cost of the three stickers and the set of temporary tyres should form part of the punishment meted out to the traffic offender.<br><br>The idea is to get drivers to realise that they are responsible for their behaviour on the road.<br><br>I hope the authorities will take steps to let other road users know who the recalcitrant drivers are.<br><br>Lee Chen-Chung<br><br>Straits Times 19 May</div>
