              <p><strong>LTA annual report shows traffic on expressways eased, cars achieved better mileage</strong></p>

              <p>RISING fuel prices helped put the brakes on driving in Singapore last year, new Government data suggests.</p>
              <p>The average car owner covered 20,840km last year, about 1 per cent
                  less than in 2006, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA). Based on
                  Singapore's car population of about 500,000, that works out to a
                  cumulative cutback of 116.5 million km.</p>
              <p>This came as pump prices jumped almost 50 cents a litre - or roughly one third - between January and December last year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The numbers were contained in the LTA's 2007 annual report, which
                  The Straits Times received yesterday. The report also revealed that
                  Singapore's expressways flowed more freely than they did the year
                  before.</p>
              <p>Just over 97 per cent of expressways experienced average
                  speeds of above 45kmh during the morning rush hour in January this
                  year, up from 93 per cent in the same month last year. In the evenings,
                  97 per cent of expressways hit the 45kmh range, a slight improvement
                  over the previous year.</p>
              <p>But conditions on main roads were not as rosy, with the percentage
                  of streets that saw speeds over 20kmh falling slightly to 97 per cent
                  during the morning peak period and 94 per cent in the evening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Singapore drivers seem to be getting better mileage.</p>
              <p>The average small car (with an engine of up to 1,600cc)
                  consumed 9.6 litres per 100km last year, while big cars (above 1,600cc)
                  used 12 litres per 100km. These were the best economy figures recorded
                  in recent years.</p>
              <p>The LTA's road-building programme has been picking up speed in recent years too, according to its annual report.</p>
              <p>Last year, 718 km of new lanes were added, the most in five years and double the length built in 2003.</p>
              <p>Observers reckon that may explain why traffic remained
                  relatively free-flowing despite a record 6.5 per cent increase in
                  vehicles last year, bringing the total to more than 851,000.</p>
              <p>A further $54 billion worth of projects are planned over the
                  next 10 to 15 years as part of the Land Transport Master Plan -
                  Singapore's roadmap to a commuter-centred system that will see new MRT
                  lines, more bus services and an expanded road network.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LTA chairman Michael Lim said the authority will engage the private sector in the ambitious roll-out.</p>
              <p>'We have already begun to reach out to regional companies and
                  professionals who are keen to participate in Singapore's land transport
                  infrastructure expansion,' he said, without giving details.</p>
              <p>For the financial year ended March 2008, the LTA posted a net
                  surplus of $37 million, down from $44 million the previous year. This
                  was largely on the back of higher operating expenditure and a dip in
                  government grants.</p>
