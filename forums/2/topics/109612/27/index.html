            <div class='col-md body'>juz came back from malaysia, wah already saw 2 marches from spore zipping around JB. guess these marchies must have had lotza attention.<br><br>one is a malay family SDW paprika. the other is mango orange.<br><br>heard angpow got her beanie yesterday, congratulations!! double happiness for her cos her birthday is also coming.<br><br>her beanie was also "commissioned" when she scratched her alloy wheel on the kerb on the first day. congrats on your commissioning angpow!<br><br>i actually went up to kuantan for a funeral, didnt get the chance to exercise my march cos i gotta fetch some old folks up northeast thaz why gotta drive the family car, else they may have broken back/arse or worst, travel thrombosis (blood clotting from too cramped seats made famous from aeroplane stories) and make to attend another funeral!<br><br>i was the only spore car which went along with the super long convoy and up the super duper steep hill (it was a mountain in fact! spore's vigilante drive is peanuts if i want to compare) for the burial. i was imagining what a sight it would be if our marchies convoy came along, man, must be damn colourful, matching the beautifully decorated coffin lorry, pickups and cars.<br><br>the thought of it made me laughed to myself amid the solemn event, the old folks wondered why.<br><br>upping the mountain was very challenging, bends were very sharp, paths were very narrow and angle super steep. many cars (mostly mountain trucks) when turning, needed to reverse and adjust before moving on. the march would have no problem managing these.<br><br>the entire trip there and return to spore clocked above 500km. kuantan is a very beautiful place, esp the mountains. quite a number of roads i went between 140 - 160km/h when travelling, aircon was running on high speed as the weather was very hot.<br><br>would worry if i had been driving my march, firstly, heart will feel damn pain if i abuse it like this family car. secondly, do i dare to go 160km/h long distance when i carry 4 adults in it, bringing along loads (and i mean loads) of luggages, and worst, more of those vegetables and fruits and peanuts filled to the brim when returning, given by those long lost relatives? afraid not.<br><br>in some areas the cross winds were also very strong, the already heavy family car was blown to sway quite a bit when you pass by them.<br><br>but sure hope to run this march for high speed once in a while, to exercise her engine a bit. seems like only malaysia highways can offer this opportunity.<br><br>but only when i am driving alone, not full of old folks and vegetables and peanuts.</div>
