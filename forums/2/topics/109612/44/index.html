There are a couple of us who will leave notes on fellow Marchies. Is your note a piece of typed out paper? printed wordings with Orange Marchies? Or a piece of used coupon with handwritten words? Anyway welcome and hope to see you soon. BTW whats the colour of your ride? I left a note on a Mango Orange or is it Bean Green ??? on the 7th at Suntec.

            <div class='col-md body'>the BBQ is either tomoro night or the day after's night (15th or 16th Feb) we have to decide on one. apologise for such short notice. address will be given by Valour later, its a chalet somewhere in Changi. i post earlier post again:<br><br>ok guys, it seems that Valour21 didnt have enough of conquering the eastern spore, so he's now got a chalet at Changi and asked me to post the following on his behalf as his computer died on him:<br><br>the chalet is available for Tue OR Wed (15th or 16th), choose 1 date. we can BBQ there, pool in money only for the food (no need for the chalet as its provided by Valour). we all can go down after office, starts evening till kingdom comes.<br><br>need to confirm this by monday 9pm.<br><br>think most suggested tuesday evening. it will be automatically ON if we have more than 5 marchies.<br><br>so, here goes:<br><br>1. KamenRider - both dates can<br>2. kkt - tues....<br>3.<br></div>
