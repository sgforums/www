What's more, you can look forward to an enjoyable driving experience with confidence and peace of mind, knowing that your car and your family will be well taken care of throughout the trip. As with all AA Auto-Ventures, this guided motoring holiday will be led by our professional Auto-Venture team and accompanied by our ever-reliable recovery crew.<br><br>NOTICE<br>The Association is mindful about the safety of all participants especially in the wake of the recent tsunami that hit the region, particularly the beach resorts. We wish to assure that checks have indicated that the situation in Penang is back to normal as the damage inflicted at the popular beach and tourist spots at Batu Ferringhi area is minimal compared to neighbouring countries. Sunway Hotel where the participants would be staying is also located in the city area away from Batu Ferringhi. The safety of all participants remains as our highest priority in our efforts to organise motoring holidays for you.<br><br>Date: 12 - 17 March 2005<br>Brief Itinerary<br>Day 1<br>Singapore to Kuala Lumpur<br>Check-in at MINES Beach Resort &amp; Spa<br>KL city shopping (transfer via bus from hotel)<br><br>Day 2<br>Kuala Lumpur to Penang<br>Check-in at Sunway Hotel Penang<br>Free &amp; Easy in Penang<br><br>Day 3<br>Guided drive to Penang's attractions (optional)<br>Free &amp; Easy in Penang<br><br>Day 4<br>Penang to Cameron Highlands<br>Check-in at Equatorial Hotel Cameron Highlands<br><br>Day 5<br>Guided drive round Cameron Highland's attractions (optional)<br>Free &amp; Easy at Cameron Highlands<br><br>Day 6<br>Cameron Highlands to Singapore<br><br>Package Price<br>$498 per adult (Single)<br>$348 per adult (Twin-sharing)<br>$328 per adult (Triple-sharing)<br>$288 per child, aged 3-11 years (with extra bed)<br>$148 per child, aged 3-11 years (without extra bed)<br><br>Package Includes<br>Â· 5 nights hotel accommodation<br>Â· Daily breakfasts and 3 dinners<br>Â· All local guided driving tours round Penang /Cameron Highlands<br>Â· Pre-Trip Briefing and Vehicle Inspection by AA Technical Services<br>Â· Experienced professional Auto-Venture guides and Recovery Crews throughout trip<br>Â· Group personal accident insurance; and<br>Â· AA goodie bags for the family<br><br>Registration closes 25 February 2005; sign up early to avoid disappointment.
