I probably need to join you all on the 15th in order to witness the excitement. The sharp reduction in price came just too sudden for me to take it.

I don't think it will be too expensive since we are printing each shirt separately (we don't have enough ppl to bulk print anyway). We can print in high res the design on a piece of paper..then go to those t-shirt shops and heat treatment it on. Not too expensive! I think that will look very striking!

Looks like we have 3 beanies now......<br><br>COE price has dropped...AGAIN....... If I have waited for a little while (less than 2 weeks), I may have saved some money (S$5 to S$6K perhaps). Can't believe that it will drop so drastically. I thought I am already very smart to move in fast, alas....... Everyone has been telling me not to look back after I have bought the car but its just too difficult not to feel heartache and bothered by it. Just my luck.....<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>hey tweety, think about it.....these pple who book it at these low price might not get their COE n they will get low COE price which will amount to low OMV. so it workout to be about the same just that u'll have to fork out more at the initial stage lor....think positive k?!<br><br>we welcome in open arms n will sayang u on the 15th k? do come down ya! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The highlight here are the cars, so i'm thinking HOTstuff might want them to be the focus. The best way to avoid clash (because the cars are a rainbow of colours) is for everyone to wear white tee with jeans. Alternatively, everyone wear a tee in the colour of your car with jeans. Berms are too hard to coordinate - everyone will come in khaki, blue, black, etc.<br><br>Just to be sure, maybe KamenRider can call the editor Terrence to check with him how he wants the picture to be taken and if there is a preference for clothes. Terrence should be able to tell you. Usually when we do photoshoots, we'll tell the subjects what to wear to avoid them turning up in the wrong colours and styles. (Kamen, if you're too busy, I can help you call and get a better idea.)<br><br>And just some early heads-up, because there are going to be so many cars there, I have a feeling they might do a long shot in order to capture everyone. There are actually many other ways to do it, not sure what's their story angle and coverage extent. It all depends.<br><br>okies, just my comments lah... maybe the shoot is really straight-forward and my suggestions won't apply. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> good luck!</div>
