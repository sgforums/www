I applied it some 15 years ago to my first brand new car.  It was a nuisance.  They sprayed some kind of 'oil' under the body and the inner parts of the door, even on the paint work.  Thus you get your cleaning cloth often stained by the 'oil' and find yourself rubbing the 'oil' into other parts of the car body.  Forget it. It's just a gimmick.  The current range of new cars, especially from Japan/Europe/USA are normally already undercoated protected by the manufacturer against at least the salts they used to melt the snow.  So don't worry.  Our local conditions are not even that corrosive.</div>

He mentioned that there is already undercarriage protection and we do not need it. He mentioned something like if the job is not performed correctly, it might stain the paint work. Just my 2 cents worth.</div>

We will monitor for a while with the usage of 98. we will feedback when we go for our 5000 service and I am sure by then we are able to know better on cause of this noise.<br></div>
