If you or AngPow wants to know more abt ToughSeal goto www.toughseal.com.sg. My decision to do it as i am lazy to clean the car regularly. It also claimed that nothing will stick to your paint work and can be cleaned easily. But ... tell you when we meet the next time lah. Anyway you can also go back to them for car wash for $10 and they will powerjet your car and vacuum interior and go over your car with some 'spray' they provide to provide that gloss finish. there are also some others around such as Amazing Glaze which is suppose to be used on aircraft, blah blah blah. As for reverse sensor, the car is pretty small and don't think a reverse sensor is neccesary. And it is also irritating. Spend the $200 on something else. just my 2 cents worth lah.</div>

Called my SE today and he said most prob early Feb... so I guess I'll be out of the photoshoot on 15th too... but i'll try to make it...<br><br>Just wondering... did anyone ToughSeal their cars? My SE said it's not neccessary, but a lot of my friends with cars have done it. SE said Nissan cars' paint has been "galvanised", so no need - does anyone know if it's true?<br><br>Also, for those already driving their marchies, is reverse sensor neccessary? It's going to cost me about $200 bucks to install it with Nissan, that's going to make me even more broke. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> My SE didn't throw it in as a freebie. So i'm thinking if it's not necc, i won't...<br><br>can anyone help? thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>galvanising is the base coat on bare metals. its the last line of defence, to prevent rust in case the paint and the top few coats fail. however quality differs between makes, some coat it thicker some thinner.<br><br>on top of galvanising are a few more coats like primer, paints etc etc. some good cars like volvo has a total of like 12 coats, dunno what the march has, need to find out.<br><br>toughseal and some other brands are sacrificial paint protection, it protects the acrylic coat of finished paint so that the gloss look of your new paint can stay longer. however it will diminish over time, different brands claim different duration and performance, some can last like 18 months (!). check them out in their websites or ask the marchies who have tried it.<br><br>also can see <a href="http://www.mycarforum.com" rel="nofollow">www.mycarforum.com</a> to read about protection and detailing, very informative.<br><br>as for reverse sensor, if you are a new driver and no so confident then pay the $200 lor. for me i think its not necessary, the march is a small car[/url]</div>
