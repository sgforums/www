I was deciding between the paprika and c. yellow - very tough fight.  My husband wanted the paprika and in the end I decided to shoot for c. yellow (since I'm the driver, I get 2 votes!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Actually, I had a tough time deciding whether to even get the March.  Basically, didn't know whether I shld even buy a car in the first place.  Then, I saw a c. yellow zoom past me and that was it!  Absolutely too cute to resist!  So, if Tedz was the one who drove past that day (along Pasir Ris Dr 1), THANKS ALOT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Easy to recognize me on the road!
