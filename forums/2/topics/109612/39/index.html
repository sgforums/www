I'm also worried about that happening once I get my ComfyChoc. Dunno why got such boliao people, think Kamen is right, they are just jealous of our beauties, most likely they are students. Do you live near any schools? I live near an ITE, always got these students hanging around my void deck and stairwells smoking, eating and leaving their rubbish behind, making lots of noise...<br>Anyone got any ideas on how to prevent this kind of vandalism? Besides hiding in a corner 24hrs a day trying to catch the culprit red-handed of course keke...</div></blockquote>blade,<br>this type of vandalism cannot be avoided..if the guy wana do something to ur car, they will find chance to do it..even if you are supermen also cannot 24/7 on the lookout rgt????even if caught, that guy will not go to jail as this is private property and not government, therefore cannot really classified as vandalism....they will qoute it as mischief, which is a civil suit against the other party</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of scratches, not sure if this will help or not, but I read an ad in Torque magazine about a film which can be applied to the body of the car, looks like gladwrap but its supp to be really tough, and its laser cut to fit the contouring of any car, no creases or air bubbles in between too. Its supp to prevent flying sand or stones from scratching your paintwork, so guess it should help against accidental scratching from handbags or watches too, but not against vandals hell bent on leaving their mark.<br>Anyway will call up to find out more details like cost and stuff... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The sales girl was really great, been scouting out the car since Sept last year, sending her queries through email and sms, going down more than once for test drives, and not once did she give up on me! Then, when the price of the Comfort fell to $58K last month, I finally made my move! Managed to squeeze from her a Mirage Vkool on top of the interest rebate of $900 from the Maybank loan package... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hi Blade, good for you.

The sales girl was really great, been scouting out the car since Sept last year, sending her queries through email and sms, going down more than once for test drives, and not once did she give up on me! Then, when the price of the Comfort fell to $58K last month, I finally made my move! Managed to squeeze from her a Mirage Vkool on top of the interest rebate of $900 from the Maybank loan package... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Hi Blade, good for you. Nothing paiseh for driving an OPC. infact i'm driving one too, so is Citrus.<br><br>BTW, why would u need Vkool when u r most likely to drive at nite <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Hi WheelsOnFire,<br><br>Well, cos the Vkool looks great haha, and the SE offered to throw it in, so what the heck, I took it! Anyways, I hope to convert to normal plate in a few years time too, so it should prove useful then...not to mention going out with all you crazy people on weekends! Ah, glad to know i'm not the only one driving red plate keke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
