The highlight here are the cars, so i'm thinking HOTstuff might want them to be the focus. The best way to avoid clash (because the cars are a rainbow of colours) is for everyone to wear white tee with jeans. Alternatively, everyone wear a tee in the colour of your car with jeans. Berms are too hard to coordinate - everyone will come in khaki, blue, black, etc.<br><br>Just to be sure, maybe KamenRider can call the editor Terrence to check with him how he wants the picture to be taken and if there is a preference for clothes. Terrence should be able to tell you. Usually when we do photoshoots, we'll tell the subjects what to wear to avoid them turning up in the wrong colours and styles. (Kamen, if you're too busy, I can help you call and get a better idea.)<br><br>And just some early heads-up, because there are going to be so many cars there, I have a feeling they might do a long shot in order to capture everyone. There are actually many other ways to do it, not sure what's their story angle and coverage extent. It all depends.<br><br>okies, just my comments lah... maybe the shoot is really straight-forward and my suggestions won't apply. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> good luck!</div></blockquote>the march itself is a fun car to drive around and we should not spoil the image....even if the editor is not gona feature us in his shoot, as long as our cars are better known to other drivers as a wonderful car rather than a sissy car, and the fact that this club is in town, itz good enough....though we may not be experts, but itz good to have an insight of it noot.....thanks</div>

I don't think it will be too expensive since we are printing each shirt separately (we don't have enough ppl to bulk print anyway). We can print in high res the design on a piece of paper..then go to those t-shirt shops and heat treatment it on. Not too expensive! I think that will look very striking! And it won't take too long to make ...just in time for the meet!</div></blockquote>It will be gr8 to have it before the meet but we must decide on logo first. So far there is one proposal, so unless we can concur on that we can get the decal out as well. Some bros here say need only 2 days to get it out.

We've been to West Coast Mac 2 times, Kallang Mac once. Yishun Dam once. So far the meetings are during the weekend but sometimes we do meet up for coffee at night. The next official meetup is on 15th Jan at Kallang Mac at 1700hrs. Do come and join us during the meet and when you are more comfortable with us then can give us your details lah. If not this site will be good enough to get info and updates. Just post your queries and the pple here will try and help. We have some very helpful pple here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
