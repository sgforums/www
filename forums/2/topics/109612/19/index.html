You referenced two websites that said our marchies use VVT technology for her engines.  I checked the websites and found that the 1.4L engine mentioned only produce 88PS.  However, our local specs. seem to state that our 1.4 engine output 98PS.  Any comment on whether our engines are different from the British?  Also, their Micras (so called in Europe) have the movable back bench.  How nice!  </div></blockquote>Our local March follows the Jap spec, so it's 98bhp. Other than the type of petrol available, the main factor that can result in diff horsepwr by same engine is the ECU program, which is def differenet in this case.<br>VTC is def in altho TC doesn't use that as a selling pt.<br><br>Dun have to envy them lah, we got 6:4 split fold seat, lagi better (which even a corolla dosen't comes with).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
