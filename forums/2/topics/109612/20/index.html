But I'm not complaining... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Anyway, I've compiled the latest list of our members including Mark(Red March12) and Alex(Black 17" rims March12).<br>There's one thing I would like to bring to you guy's attention... Could members who are using <strong>HOTMAIL</strong> address, please change it to Yahoo as it offers much larger space. I'd trouble trying to send mails with photo attachments to you. Wanted to share the photos we took yesterday but I can't send them out as it keeps bouncing back to me... I'm sure a number of you will experience the same problem.<br>Btw, I've also created a group in Yahoo! Groups and started a poll for the activities that we will be doing today. Please log on to it and start casting your votes.(Its for people who are a bit shy in expressing their violent objections) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Lastly, Addygal!!!

So we can still have our own website but can still post in this forum. Forum has been good to us and we can also learn from others in the other car threads and share lobangs in other threads.
