I would die a happy man (choy choy! new year cannot say such things).<br><br>Anyway i think the passerbys were probably too engrossed with taking down your car plate number lar, for 4D of course. dun worry about them thinking less of you.<br><br>there was once (many yers ago) i picked up an aunty who got knocked and fell off her husband's ridden scooter. there were lotza blood from her leg and she was crying in pain while her husband tried to get help. I was passing by and offered to drive her to the TTSH which was nearby, instead of waiting for an ambulance.<br><br>i beat every traffic lights and rules and sped off. was even overtooked and blocked by an id**t driver who thought i was someone playing punk with him when i overtook him in a U-turn.<br><br>wah, in the end my rear seat was full of blood as she was lying down behind. lucky it was leather seat.</div></blockquote>Choy Indeed ! CNY cannot say such things...anyway I'm sure all the marchies are safe and responsible drivers... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hmm...u could be right, they were taking down my car plate number...think i'll buy too..just in case...haha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway, hope the biker is fine. He should be ok cos i watched his blood stopped at the cut.  Poor fella must be quite shocked cos his hands were trembling...wondering if i could've done more to help....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>wow, that was quite a good deed that u've done...think saving a person's life supercedes everything else, no hesitation at all..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

U haven't seen the last of me....yet...<br><br>It's my first gathering and I did enjoyed myself getting to know the rest of the marchies and now i can put a face to all the nicks!  Some of the conversation that u guys/gals share really cracked me up big time....esp Tedz and Angpow(aka Lek Tow)!<br><br>Anyway just to share an incident  that happened yesterday which i titled  "[b]Misunderstood".   </strong>Was driving towards CBD area yesterday in the afternoon and the weekend traffic was pretty quiet then. Came to a traffic junction (I was the only car) and as I brake gently to stop at the red lights from a distance, saw a motorbike that was lying on the ground (horizontal position) at the pedestrian crossing area.  The male biker struggled to get up on his two feet, holding his hand, seems that he was hurt and was using one hand to press on to the other hand which was bleeding.<br><br>He had lost control by himself and the whole bike just topple over. As there was no car around except from the opposite direction whom witness the whole incident but couldn't help, I stopped my car in front of the bike with hazard lights on, grabbed some tissue, got out of the car and pass it to him to stop his blood. Saw a small cut around 2cm around his wrist and asked him if he needed to call ambulance, but he said it was ok and the blood seemed to have stopped.  Seconds later the traffic from behind begin to came forward and I signalled to the first vehicle to stop and it was a cab driver.

U haven't seen the last of me....yet...<br><br>It's my first gathering and I did enjoyed myself getting to know the rest of the marchies and now i can put a face to all the nicks!  Some of the conversation that u guys/gals share really cracked me up big time....esp Tedz and Angpow(aka Lek Tow)!<br><br>Anyway just to share an incident  that happened yesterday which i titled  "[b]Misunderstood".   </strong>Was driving towards CBD area yesterday in the afternoon and the weekend traffic was pretty quiet then. Came to a traffic junction (I was the only car) and as I brake gently to stop at the red lights from a distance, saw a motorbike that was lying on the ground (horizontal position) at the pedestrian crossing area.  The male biker struggled to get up on his two feet, holding his hand, seems that he was hurt and was using one hand to press on to the other hand which was bleeding.<br><br>He had lost control by himself and the whole bike just topple over. As there was no car around except from the opposite direction whom witness the whole incident but couldn't help, I stopped my car in front of the bike with hazard lights on, grabbed some tissue, got out of the car and pass it to him to stop his blood. Saw a small cut around 2cm around his wrist and asked him if he needed to call ambulance, but he said it was ok and the blood seemed to have stopped.  Seconds later the traffic from behind begin to came forward and I signalled to the first vehicle to stop and it was a cab driver. Asked him to help the injured driver lift up his heavy bike and push it to one side so as not to obstruct traffic...as much i would like to help lift it up, don't think the bike's gonna move since it's a few times heavier than me...haha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seeing that he was ok, (after reminding him that some liquid, think it's petrol was leaking from his bike), and not to obstruct traffic, me and the cab driver moved off...<br><br>As I moved off slowly, can't help but feel that the vehicles around me are watching me and checking the front portion of my car to verify that....then I was thinking....in that situation, the drivers around probably thought that I knocked him down, what with me being a lady driver blah blah blah, it's probably the first thought that came to their minds........my heart was screaming loudly and adamantly, "Hey I didn't knock him down, I was helping him!"...was on the verge of winding down my window to explain myself....but then, heck lah, my conscience is clear right...so i just moved on.<br><br>So that was my first encounter on the road the involves a minor accident.
