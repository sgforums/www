            <div class='col-md body'>that night after seeing the runway we went to Changi village for dinner.<br><br>We had LouHei (at the request of those Marchies there that day, no posting of pics of the dinner are allowed as it would show a big mess of the dining table after the LouHei, the stuff were simply flying everywhere. also the pics will show the guys savaging and scavenging, so they are all banned. can get from Angpow if you still wanna see).<br><br>the dinner was good, each one only paid abt $10 for everything, well worth.<br><br>Some went for part II after the dinner. think they went to the beach, or see Ah G**?.... I heard some Marchies who left earlier came back, must be something very exciting....<br><br>maybe someone can post what happened in part II.<br><br>here are somemore earlier pics.<br><br><img src="http://www.msnusers.com/_Secure/0QQAAABMS1DMDYKOAbQT!bHj8MufQTHGSEHyRZR4LQzqp9M*phkRISUzh0AxlQJsORPoLeYOIeMmB8maQMXwyTYkG6tXol2*bWq0lNAWKEZM/PICT0512.jpg?dc=4675509910205574058"><br><br><img src="http://www.msnusers.com/_Secure/0PQDyAosR2Q5NXHFyjRAv3JrL1PerW0b1tDx35fGANFF1cW4Qhu4pgHoE9KON9WkxELkTg7Fyo1oTCw0MRTTEbODiPA*rkIRw/pic4.jpg?dc=4675509965185964219"><br><br><img src="http://www.msnusers.com/_Secure/0QQCz*xgS8jRSI56R!HrWWQAwlLG7o5trr3P2swWNlrdeN43IN*tY4ckRFECMOu16CJ5caddmHNEP181lPm11alKep!6hy9fIqUk3ir1auDY/PICT0490.jpg?dc=4675509965066559356"></div>

March K12?...<br><br>for now letz decide on Valour's chalet (see earlier post) first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good Morning Marchies!<br><br>Hey Kamen, enjoy reading your detailed recount of events as usual! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I'm not really that shy lah......haha... U haven't seen the last of me....yet...<br><br>It's my first gathering and I did enjoyed myself getting to know the rest of the marchies and now i can put a face to all the nicks!  Some of the conversation that u guys/gals share really cracked me up big time....esp Tedz and Angpow(aka Lek Tow)!<br><br>Anyway just to share an incident  that happened yesterday which i titled  "<strong>Misunderstood".   </strong>Was driving towards CBD area yesterday in the afternoon and the weekend traffic was pretty quiet then. Came to a traffic junction (I was the only car) and as I brake gently to stop at the red lights from a distance, saw a motorbike that was lying on the ground (horizontal position) at the pedestrian crossing area.  The male biker struggled to get up on his two feet, holding his hand, seems that he was hurt and was using one hand to press on to the other hand which was bleeding.<br><br>He had lost control by himself and the whole bike just topple over. As there was no car around except from the opposite direction whom witness the whole incident but couldn't help, I stopped my car in front of the bike with hazard lights on, grabbed some tissue, got out of the car and pass it to him to stop his blood. Saw a small cut around 2cm around his wrist and asked him if he needed to call ambulance, but he said it was ok and the blood seemed to have stopped.  Seconds later the traffic from behind begin to came forward and I signalled to the first vehicle to stop and it was a cab driver. Asked him to help the injured driver lift up his heavy bike and push it to one side so as not to obstruct traffic...as much i would like to help lift it up, don't think the bike's gonna move since it's a few times heavier than me...haha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seeing that he was ok, (after reminding him that some liquid, think it's petrol was leaking from his bike), and not to obstruct traffic, me and the cab driver moved off...<br><br>As I moved off slowly, can't help but feel that the vehicles around me are watching me and checking the front portion of my car to verify that....then I was thinking....in that situation, the drivers around probably thought that I knocked him down, what with me being a lady driver blah blah blah, it's probably the first thought that came to their minds........my heart was screaming loudly and adamantly, "Hey I didn't knock him down, I was helping him!"...was on the verge of winding down my window to explain myself....but then, heck lah, my conscience is clear right...so i just moved on.<br><br>So that was my first encounter on the road the involves a minor accident. Choy! Let it be the last I hope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
