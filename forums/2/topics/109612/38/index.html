Anyway last weekend sent my car for 20K service and when i collected my car, i found scratches all over. Probably from the cloth they used for wiping the car. I complained to the supervisor of the workshop. What they did was to apply some cream on the scratches and and used their buffer (a rotation handheld thing) and go over the sratches. And I would say the scratches were gone. Dunno if this could help fixed your problem. I got it fixed in 10 mins. Maybe NYC 'wonder gel' can do the trick also. Apply some and rub in circles. It got rid of the silver stains on Tedz car.</div>

So met NYC at 2pm, go collect car at TC BT and met Tedz and Elvis. After makan convoy to BT for lunch and then to Bt Batok to see rims. Was at AutoBacs and saw 2 other K12 March, one bean green where we 'ambushed' for 15 minutes but did not return before we left and a Sliver driven by an uncle. We suspected he might be Uncle Flee but turned out otherwise. Left a note on the Bean Green though, number plate reads Mobus. Drove towards NUS to meet kamen and FadedMango. Tedz and NYC did a Too Fast too Furious and left me Too Far Too Furious but i figure out better not play with the kids. Anyway met the 2 Marchiz and without fail FadedMango brought snacks. Her 'tapioca' crackers were delightful and the butter cookies are simply irresistable.

Tedz, Melvin, NYC, RoyCindy, Valour and myself was there. After the game went rounding and Tedz is still doing the Too Fast Too Furious. The rest of the group have to try and keep him on the leash. But he is too Untamed. Rounded to Great World City to say hello to kkt, then to Havelock road where we spotted a Chocolate K12. Then to Orchard, then to Boat Quay. We ended up in Lau Pa Sat at 2 plus in the morning for satay and gave Tedz a post mortem on the convoy movement. He was slapped with a fine of "a round of drinks" for making us break "formation".

I'm also worried about that happening once I get my ComfyChoc. Dunno why got such boliao people, think Kamen is right, they are just jealous of our beauties, most likely they are students. Do you live near any schools? I live near an ITE, always got these students hanging around my void deck and stairwells smoking, eating and leaving their rubbish behind, making lots of noise...<br>Anyone got any ideas on how to prevent this kind of vandalism?
