But have to wait another 3 weeks before I get to see it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Would like to join your club, can? But I won't be going down for any meetings yet coz I don't drive...yup, virgin new car owner here, its going to make me broke but I know its going to be worth every cent keke...<br>Btw in case you wanna know, I got the Chocolate Comfort (or ComfyChoc as I like to call it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) from Tan Chong Toa Payoh at $41K...its an OPC, *cough*...yup, can't afford to get normal plate yet, sigh...but anything just to get to drive my new March! The sales girl was really great, been scouting out the car since Sept last year, sending her queries through email and sms, going down more than once for test drives, and not once did she give up on me! Then, when the price of the Comfort fell to $58K last month, I finally made my move! Managed to squeeze from her a Mirage Vkool on top of the interest rebate of $900 from the Maybank loan package... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>I'm really over the moon to be a March owner soon, and I'm hoping I can share my enthusiasm with some like-minded people. Oh, and I'm definitely going to be horning and beaming every March I come across on the roads once I get my wheels, I don't care how crazy they think I am! </div></blockquote>HEY blade28,<br><br>Welcome to our MARCH1Z club!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> so glad to read that u r going to own a chocolate marchie! yeh! we are still short of that colour in our club! there were a couple of choco who came n check out this forum once in awhile but M.I.A. after that! really hope u can join us soon n be active in the club to share the passion for our marchies! me n the club members will be soooooooo happy to see u n ur comfychoc real soon! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>how did u get to know our forum? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>cheers!<br><br>MAR-ARC-CHIE....MAR-ARC-CHIE....MAR-ARCH-CHIE....hahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I looked back, OMG, all the cars stopped were sporeans!<br><br>"Encik, boleh tolong (sir, can help)?"<br><br>i knew what was going to happen next, heard such stories many times from friends, nothing really surprising to me then. but i was still cursing softly while whipping out a RM50 note and slipped into my passport and handed to the TP. "how can this happen to me, damn!"<br><br>the TP took over my passport and pretended to flip around and see. i noticed quite surprisingly, his hand was shivering. must be new bird, out to make an extra living for the new year season.<br><br>nevermind lar, take it as a new year gift from us lar, after all its CNY, what are neighbours for? i comforted myself.<br><br>"eh!" the TP barked, juz when we thought we could go.<br><br>"Hita tak terima Ringgit (we dont take ringgit anymore)!"<br><br>"WHAT THE ****!!!!...." could not believe my ears...was so tempted to snatch his revolver and shoot.....but the thought of being locked up in an ulu cell far far away quickly calmed me down.<br><br>took out a S$50 and exchanged with his ringgit, in disgust.<br><br>"Selamat Hari Tahun Cina (Happy chinese new year)!" the fella waved and wished us with  a smile as we drove off.<br><br>yeah, wish you a ****ing happy new year too!<br><br>this happened to us in KL few years ago, juz like to share my story to brighten up your seasonal holiday mood.<br><br><span style="color: red;">HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR to my dear Marchies!</span></div>
