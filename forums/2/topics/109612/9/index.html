Capi got it fixed at $128.  When I called, the guy quoted $138.  If we can gather a group, say, during the meetup on the 15th Jan, we can hopefully bargain it down to $118 or at least match Capi's price.  What do the rest say.  I personally think this device is better and more effective than the current crop of voltage stabilizers from overseas.  Our local inventor got the technical concept right.  Maybe KarmenRider can help organise this installation for the Marchies?</div></blockquote>i met our CTO by chance last night at toa payoh, he was holding a big stack of notes. its all about the z-stack! he's been studying about it and researching on any ill effect (if any) about the z-stack!<br><br>take my hats off to our CTO. so now, not only he is our chief transport officer, he's also our chief technical officer (promoted to CTOx2). so letz wait for his research outcome ok?<br><br>meanwhile i have written to z-stack to enquire abt bulk purchases, see whats in the offer.<br><br></div>
