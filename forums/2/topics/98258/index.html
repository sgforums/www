            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>IF YOU FIND THIS TOO LONG, READ PRO POINT 1) and 2).<br><br>Dear members of this well-established forum (am a newbie! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) I am a Singaporean in Germany, an avid fan and passionate user of car sharing schemes (one of the earliest established) here. In a year's time I will be enjoying the COE system under the tropical sun again.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I would hereby like to reopen the discussion of car sharing, as a mobility concept, in Singapore. It adds to the spectrum of transport methods available to the mortal Singaporean.<br><br>At present there are 3 car sharing schemes (if I am not outdated): NTUC Co-op, Cityspeed, HondaDiracc. According to input from my friends in Singapore, the chief pain of car sharing is the sparse geographical availability of the fleets in the heartland. Waiting in the hot sun for 5 min for feeder bus to the fleet, or cycling (again under the hot sun) there is a complete turn-off. I want my own aircon comfort when I step into the carpark downstairs. The success of the scheme depends on the enthusiasm of the populace. Where I study, there are cars around every block of houses, ensuring instant accessibility. Hence I am here to fish for supporters and learn from the opponents.<br>----------------------------------------------<br>The chief characteristics of carsharing, from my experience, are:<br><br>PROS<br><strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">1) Limiting number of cars on the roads<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></strong><br><br>10000 participants share 2000 vehicles. 1:5 ratio. Need more be said? YES! Remember that the COE scheme was implemented so that Singapore does not erm... drive like Bangkok. So does the car sharing scheme share the same ideal. Less cars, less pollution, more driving space. <strong>But in a Singaporean context, more people have access to it affordably.</strong> Empower the masses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">2) Accessibility to wide range of cars<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></strong><br><br>Ideally, there can be many types of vehicles within a pool. SUVs, stationwagons, <a href="http://www.thesmart.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Smart cars</a>, sedans. Now you can go Ikea shopping with your own van. Alternative would be to stick to your Corolla for 5 years at $600+ a month.<br><br><strong>3) Geographical accessibility</strong><br><br>The Juronger can access the fleet in Bedok after meeting his friends there. And (IDEALLY) return it in Jurong (ask HondaDiracc)<br><br><strong>4) Cheaper fixed and maintenance costs</strong><br><br>Insurance premium, monthly instalment, servicing charges shared.<br><br><strong>5) Cost control</strong><br><br>Because cars are charged hourly and per km, you can control how much you want to spend in a month. If you are feeling broke this month, just take MRT lor.<br><br><strong>6) No need to service</strong><br><br>Have to take leave just to check that brake light of yours? Not with carsharing. Servicing is done through the employees of the company.<br><br><strong>7) Mobility AND privacy</strong><br><br>Cabs sure can get you from A to B. But car sharing allows that in the privacy of your own "cab". Family outings can be done in privacy, no extra ears and mouths in the vehicle. My latest experience with cab drivers had him telling me he ordered his new 3.3L Nissan in September, even BEFORE I closed the door upon boarding. Beat that.<br><br><strong>8 ) Profitable</strong><br><br>Undeniably, this is another <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><strong>money-making concept </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> for the gahmen. But it is a win-win one isn't it?<br><br>CONS<br><strong>1) Time limit</strong><br><br>Because use of the vehicles should be booked for fixed periods, there is pressure on the roads to drive back to the designated lot on time. Watch out!<br><br><strong>2) Unavailability of vehicle</strong><br><br>Related to the above point. When the bugger returns the car too late, you can't get the car you want. This can be circumvented by allowing usage of a vehicle of similar(or higher) class, and charging the late bugger the extra (+ fine!)<br><br><strong>3) Cannot pimp your ride</strong><br><br>Get what I mean? If not <a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/pimpride.shtml" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.<br><br><strong>4) Cleanliness</strong><br><br>Well...it's not your own car, so you can leave your Yeo's can and BreadTalk crumbs on the rear seat? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  COMPLAIN via telephone hotline and see if the previous user dares to do it again. This requires alot of civic mindedness. Everyone is in the same boat. If not just hire some security guard to check on the vehicle condition upon return.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br>If you have followed my thoughts till now, CONGRATULATIONS! Maybe someone can criticise my utopia of having fleets in EVERY single HDB carpark, allowing access, or add to the plus points.<br><br>I hope a fruitful discussion blossoms out of my contribution.<br>---------------------------------------------------</div>

I am not a marketing agent for any of the 3 agencies. I am just trying to raise awareness about another transport concept. But I guess what you said is right. Why not take the leap and try for a while? You will get used to the routine. When I first got started here, the timing was my biggest problem, having to overcome the many traffic junctions. But after some time, it's like 2nd nature. And just like you, I use it only occasionally, driving to wholesale marts, or just ferrying friends out to town for a night out. It's cool.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  Not to mention they got some pretty nice vehicles here, albeit abit old. Peugeot 206CC's are the most fun.</div>

They get crammed into MRT and bus. But as a kind of side idea <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  (I did do quite alot of thought about it), for places like CBD, we could have a whole lot of parking lots there for the car sharers to park their cars (they stop paying when they park), and pick up when they return. It's commuting after all, and will happen like clockwork, just that along the way, can send the kids to school, pick up your beehoon from the hawker centre.<br><br>Imagine an exodus of vehicles from heartland to CBD every morning, and return every evening. While the vehicles are parked in the CBD, people can still use them (e.g. HondaDiracc concept)<br><br>But of course, this defeats the purpose. We want less cars on the roads, not more. Migrating people from the MRT system to the roads does not really help.</div>

So I suppose there will be an equilibrium, above which, the number of cars on the road outweigh the benefits. Carsharing does reduce the number of cars in the road as well. Or rather, it is a way to give the less well-off a chance on the roads (in privacy, I stress). Without which, they are banned to public transport for a long time.<br><br>I did edit my previous post. The commuting exodus thing will not work. But the weekend use of cars could still be attractive.<br><br>Am just trying to find an optimizing solution to my constant frustration of not having wheels.</div>

I don't need the car regularly, just want to practise my driving periodically (since I got my licence only three months ago) and to run errands from time to time.<br><br>I like the fact that I don't have to worry about maintenance and stuffs like that, after I return the car to the port each time, that's it, end of story. Also like the part about being able to take the car from Point A and return it to Point B, and without having to specify a return time too (CitySpeed and NTUC do not allow this).<br><br>The only thing about driving a HD car is the attention it yields, no thanks to the "weird" car-plate (diagonal blue-yellow). I've had pedestrians literally stopping in their tracks, in the middle of the pedestrian crossing, to "examine" the car-plate and give me puzzled looks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Otherwise, so far so good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Just used it yeaterdat actually... got the car from 7pm to 8am... but finished using it at 3am, parked the car and then just walked home...

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow....I am glad to hear about WhizzCar. Really heartlander sites (too bad mine not there). And they offer to bring more sites to the people. Sign up guys! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>From what I gather, there are people (like me heh heh) who use it as a form of driving practice. Not bad I guess. Though I lament that it is still too expensive (still so much prohibitively more than cab) and that probably has to do with the high acquisition costs of the vehicles.<br><br>Back to my utopia vision <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ...if only one day, <strong>LTA </strong>would support this effort to bring freedom to the people and not enslave them with a runaway COE system, perhaps car sharing operators can be given incentives? *kachink kachink for GLC idea* There are opponents to this who feel that their fellow countrymen without the income are just encouraged to choke up the roads, but my reply would be that:<br><br>1) There are only so many cars that can be on the roads at one time. i.e. If a Florida hurricane came and families had to flee north, those who cannot book....too bad. So less choking of roads than if everyone drove.<br><br>2) Less parking lot use.<br><br>3) Maximise use of vehicles. Land is scarce. So why keep vehicles parking in HDB carparks like vases when they can be maximising their purpose (to MOVE)<br><br>Also, if Singapore is even keen about being environmentally friendly (I have had many experiences with the contrary), then the whole fleet could be Honda IMAs or Toyota Prius. Last I checked with Borneo Motors a Prius costs a prohibitive 109K. Oh please...where are the tax incentives to acquire a green vehicle? I would rather pay that amount and chiong around on a 2.4l combustion engine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
