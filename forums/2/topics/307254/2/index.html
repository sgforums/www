              But i observe alot of CIVIC hybrid or ordinary CIVIC type r on the road.I understand that JDM CIVIC type r are "mostly you see on the roads are white with white rims, black and white spoiler, fujitsubo exhaust, brembo brakes." but does it comes in different colours like black or red or blue colour ? like Integra type r they have alot of colour,as well but i can differential btw an Integra type r and GSR Integra type r...

              <p>CTR is more expensive than a WRX 5dr version. But is cheaper than a 4 dr (sedan) STI tuned WRX.</p>
              <p>WRX has a notorious image as a ah beng car. But what is your definition of sports car? A CTR is more a track ready car than a WRX. That means that a stock CTR can do well on a track, whereas a stock wrx needs better performing aftermarker parts to make it more track-friendly. Its all personal preference.</p>
              <p>CTR is a NA whereas a WRX is Turbocharged.</p>

              <p>you seem well informed. As for me, i am just a layman.</p>
              <p>what i meant was, WRX is known for its world rally championship and its abilities. As for Honda, even it may also be doing something like that, the impresssion to layman is that its not really a world rally famous car right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its common on the roads but to me , a pure layman, my impression is that it is a common category kinda sporty car but not the real sports car. like when u see a WRX, u cannot say it is  not a sports car. whereas Honda seems like a family car with a bit of sporty look.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i wanted to find out why the price I see on newspaper seems comparable between the 2. specifically, why people would pay so much for honda when WRX is clearly the more real sports car? with no offence intended to Honda luvers. just being direct and honest.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the honest feedback. CTR and WRX are seen as 2 different types of "sports cars" Wrx is more of a rally car and CTR has always been more track focused.  So it depends of what kinda of look you want, although honestly the WRX has been labelled ah beng qia in singapore whereas the new CTR is seen as more grown up and not beng.</p>
              <p>Its all down to personal preferance. Some people think that CTR is sporty and others dont. Personally, i think the sedan WRX looks sportier than the hatchback one and the new CTR is sporty.</p>
              <p>Price is usually determined by performance in the sports car sector.</p>
              <p>The CTR has a different engine from the other civics on the road. and has a different ECU, Suspension, brakes, a whole redone chassis and different exhaust. Tyres are Potenza RE070 vs Turanzas on other civics. Interior is also different</p>
              <p>In layman terms: you are paying for performance items .</p>
              <p>So why does CTR cost as much as WRX? Because you probably are comparing the normal civic to a WRX w/o knowing the difference between a CTR and a normal civic. No offence =)</p>
              <p>I hope my feedback answers your qns.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, here are pics of a bodykitted CTR with an aftermarket exhaust, not a normal civic.</p>
