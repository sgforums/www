            <div class='col-md body'>Around 3 years ago, was in Malaysia , Johor , around Mersing? or somewhere was travelling around to look for good deals and bargains..<br><br>I was sitting around in my father's Toyota car , out of a sudden , hiding in the forest , a police car came out and chased my dad's car..<br><br>it was a very small road around there and it WAS impossible to go speeding ,<br>i personally was sitting beside my dad and when the police car came....<br><br><strong>He told us that our car was speeding..where-else..i was looking at the<br>speed-dometer and i swear !! Our speed was definitely less then the speed he said we was speeding at..really we were cruising slowly cause we were admiring the scenery</strong><br><br>I was frustrated and wanted to argue with the "cop"..After that , my dad says..<br>"NO, don't" , so i stopped..<br><br>My dad told me.."Pass me 50 singapore dollars.." since i brought some cash with me along, i passed it to him, and gradually followed the police man into a small wooden hut..<br><br>After that my dad came out..and drive on..smoothly like nothing happened..<br><br>I asked him what happened to my $$ .....he declined to reveal...<br><br>After that , i found out the truth...Am i the only one who experienced it here?</div>
