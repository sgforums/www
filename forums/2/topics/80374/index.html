(Tuscandi is that the spelling for their coupe now?)<br>Subaru WRX = 4 seaters<br>Toyota Celica = 2 seaters?<br><br>Value for money, hyundai.<br>Performance, WRX<br>Looks, hyundai<br><br>$1,400... $150 for parking monthly (inclusive of seasons) $400 for petrol (chiong need more petrol) $200 for road tax and insurance (average out), $100 for maintanence (average out).

            <div class='col-md body'>errr .... sorry to break your bubbles so you can come back to reality ...<br><br>Sillycar and Hyundai are 2 sitter car and eventually it is harder to sell later on ... and WRX is a performance car and most of my business partners or clients are in to chiong but they refuse to buy 2nd hand boxer engine cars because they PERCEIVE they leak black oil after 3 to 4 years ...<br><br>Looking back .. i used to drive a cooper and you know how hard is it to sell it?!!! Damn hard ...<br><br>i would advise you to get some chion-ster car with 4 doors and least the market bad perception so that you can sell the car in the future if you want to change .... if you are looking at those range that you have posted i would advise you to try a second hand Skyline 4dr or an second hand stock Evo ....<br><br>*No offence to those Celica , WRX and Tascuni driver <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for all the advice, but just need to point out something.<br><br>hyundai coupe (tuscani) is a 4 seater car, and i can be very confirmed about this cos i went to the showroom and c b4.<br><br>celica is also a 4-seater... at least, that's what i saw when i encountered 1 in a carpark. heard frm someone that the dashboard looks like the one you find in a lorry, but have to re-confirm again when i do test drive it. the backside a bit farnie, though...<br><br>my commitment of $1400 per mth, its only for the petrol+parking+installment only, insurance and road tax come already then say.<br>so does this means that my choices are wider now? or still the same?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, the knowledge of cars that i have is from the local magazines. i did heard of integra, etc etc but with only minimal knowledge since the cars that these mags publicize are those that are really common.<br><br>anyone know what magazine/website that offers much more info of these cool cars, and yet the context is tuned to asian/singapore? i've read a lot on such cars in US/UK mags, but i find it difficult to relate it whether i can afford it, etc.<br><br>one more thing, i'm paying $906/mth for my mazda 323, installment alone. don't ask why i'm paying so much, but i'm pretty comfortable with this plus paying in addition for parking, petrol, road tax, insurance, etc etc.<br><br>SO, assuming that i don't mind paying such amount for my installment, is there any car that is much better than the Celica that I'm intending to buy? i'm still considering fanciful/cheong cars, that's why the Celica (or hyundai coupe), etc.<br>But as i've mentioned earlier, i don't know much about such cars so i'll need help from you people.<br><br>anyone paying $900+ (and less than $1k) for installment alone and driving better cars? maybe i can use it as a gauge or something. thanks again, people!</div>
