I question the act of RECKLESSNESS; what brings about recklessness?<br><br>A sensible motorist will never take to recklessness while driving. Be they young, be they old, be they experienced or inexperienced, be they educated or be they illiterates, does not dictate the type or motorists they are.<br><br>Good Temperaments, Patience, Humility, these are virtues a lot of people in Singapore sadly lack.<br><br>I drive a Jaguar, I got honked at numerous times on the road even though I have the right of way. I just proceeded ignoring their impatience. I even got honked at while at petrol stations; after refiliing I got in and was putting on my seatbelt, taking note of my mileage meter, and the car behind started honking even though he can just reverse and go around me. I didn't retaliate by honking back.<br><br>It takes quite a lot not to react in anger.<br><br></div>
