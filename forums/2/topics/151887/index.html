            <div class='col-md body'>I also encounter similar incident on way back just now. Idiot SMRT taxi cut into my lane and cause me to jam brake hard. It got stuck in a straight&amp;right turning lane but want to go straight, so just cut into the left lane even though there are on-coming vehicles. So dangerous. If I bang him, I wrong. If I emergency stop vehicle behind me may bang me. Either way I suay.<br><br>So angry at that time I remember the taxi no. It's SHB ****Y.
