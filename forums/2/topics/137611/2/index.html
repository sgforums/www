            <div class='col-md body'>The Toyota Wish is indeed a beauty. Low FC, Big, Spacious and looks real good with bodykits, and i think its only going for 70k++...<br><br>You might want to consider that though is a good catch, the springs (suspensions) are said to be very soft. I have heard that in Malaysia, there are people who drove and cornered at a rather high speed, and the vehicle actually OVERTURNED!!<br><br>Then again,you are in Sg, so no problem.

What is there to argue ? You ownself say it clearly and loud for everyone here to see, that you are someone who drive and sat in both car before. That already the engine basic for comparison. We are here just to advice on the pro and con of each wish and give comparison of competition. Since you ownself agree on what I say about the engine performance, then case close.<br><br>Want to compare cheap then get the trajet in better !!  there be no end.<br><br>As for which is the popular car , who cares ! By then everyone also bring in their own favour car. End up like i say toyota crown most popular car why ? Taxi so many all over. !!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your analogy to the taxi thingy is wrong lah....my fren.<br>the question is not which is the more popular taxi in singapore..... if really so, then toyota crown wins lor, as you had rightly stated in your earlier post.<br><br>The question is , which of these MPVs is more popular among singaporeans? Toyota wish or stream?<br><br>Is it that hard to admit that Stream is not as popular as Wish among singaporean car buyers? i am not implying that stream is lousy compared to wish, right?<br><br>imho, i think more people bought wish because it appeals to them more esp in the looks department, better fuel economy, more affordable pricing, toyota branding and reliablilty. These are the people who place less emphasis on engine and car performance .... ultimately, the typical profile of a MPV car owner would be the family man with kids +/- grandparents to ferry around.<br><br>hopefully the forumer after reading these posts that you and me have generated can make a more informed decision as to which car is more suitable to his/ her own personal needs.<br><br>pls do not take this personal... a forum is also like a debate... one is entitled to have his  /her own opinions ... well the discussion seems to be getting interesting huh!<br><br>BTW, i dont even own these MPVs..... ha ha ha<br>have been quite free at work and surfing plenty of forums SHC, SSOG, TWC, WCS etc.... so i am here to share my knowledge.<br><br></div>

Driver driving from pioneer road to jurong raffles club area for lunch.. and we felt very stuffy at the back row cos the air con does not reach the back. max is only the middle row. Back row ok for those short legs ppl or kids.<br><br>Originally posted by cagelee131:<br>i sat in one of my relatives' wish in the third row.<br>His JDM wish has tinted windows which help to reduce the glare from the sun, and he switched the aircon flow to come from the top of the dashboard which is suppose to direct flow to the third row, and increase the fan speed to 3.<br>with all these things, i dont find it hot.<br><br></div></blockquote>Cagelee131 - bearbear18 say stuffy - not hot ! But the tinted glass do help a lot - it prevent other cars from seeing the poor suffocated folks in the 3rd row !! haha just kidding !! Must find something good to say about the tinted glass what, which is the major attraction of wish.<br><br>Stuffy = Lacking sufficient ventilation = suffocation. Think that is worst then hot.<br><br>Of course for short journey of less then 1/2hr you will not feel it, but imagine in the 3rd row for 1hr or more, can be kind of very uncomfortable. What Bearbear18 say it true, the air-cond does only rearch the middle row only. Also if you keep it full burst in trying to reach the 3rd row, 1st row passenger or 2nd row passenger will be freeze before the air even reach the 3rd row. That is a short coming of not having rear air-cond.<br></div>

In a series of latest  compact mpv models from Mazda5 to Honda Airwave, none hv such rear vents.

All the considerations that I have posted are all based on facts, not anyhow stated in order to gain superiority over the other party. As such i disagree with your statement " after all the talk cock"  as the points of discussion which i brought up and definitely valid and truthful, and as a matter of fact, honest as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>WIth regards to your suggestion on trajet, yes it is an affordable and value-for-money MPV, but again, there are more Wishes on singapore roads than Trajet. No offence to trajet owners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Anyway, i thought the discussion was between Wish and Stream, why bring in another "innocent" party and get them involved in this "tussle " ? hee hee  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
