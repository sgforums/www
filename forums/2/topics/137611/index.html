UV films are UV films.

You heard from the mechanics ? yes the inital stream does have does have some problem when it 1st came out. But it been kept upgraded over the years by now it is refined mpv.  So you cannot use old news to compare what already been long fixed.<br>But the news is stay away from the 1.7L stream, buy only the 2.0 L.<br><br>haha even a kid cycling know about more gear the better performance ! it is the same principle with bicycle, you are trying to tell people a 16 gear bicycle is better then a 21 bicycle ? try selling that to your kids !<br><br>Who would be so stupid to drive 5 gear uphill, even the car automatic system is definitely smarter then you then, cause it will reduce itself automatically and you will not spoil it even you want to. By the way , singapore road is mostly flat , thus very good for 5 gear.</div>

Already 3-4 years totally no problem with the automatic transmission at all, in fact they perform so well that when I wanted to buy wish, they ask me to try test drive the new stream 2.0 first.<br><br>After that indeed, you can tell a world of different, that why I am driving the new stream 2.0. well totally no problem with automatic transmission. What the point of 5 gear ? by 80km the 5 gear already kick in , so you say useful or not .</div>

Those are real darken glass windows, the glass is darkend glass, not film paste on. Frankly the window is darken enough, you don't want to darkend more, if not then buy a van if you don't want to look out of the window. haha.</div>

Judging by the number of wishes on the roads compared to streams..... Wish wins hands down.<br><br>WISH is more popular than stream 1.7 / 2.0 . Period.<br><br></div>
