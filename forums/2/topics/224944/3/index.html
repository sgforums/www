Either my car will move very very slowly or the engine will just stall and die  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Today I tried using first gear to go uphill, but the car still moves very slowly, and a couple of times it seems that it is going to die so I stepped on the accelarator to make it go up...but instead of moving faster, it slowed down even more and i noticed that a lot of fumes started to come out from the exhaust pipe behind the car. After I have moved my car safely up the slope and managed to find a place to park, there was not so much fumes anymore, but got some black oil dripped out from the pipe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> So dunno what's wrong with the car le...anyone can enlighten on how to move up a slope better?<br><br>Luckily tomorrow is the first free service by the car company...so can send in the car for a check up le...hopefully nothing wrong wif it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Have you got your car checked out yet?<br><br>I think it's quite normal for your car to be slow when going up a steep slope since Kancil is not a very powerful car.  I have a Toyota Echo, slightly more powerful than Kancil and yet it's still struggling to go up a very steep slope.  So just go slow and be gentle to your car otherwise you're most likely to wreck your engine.<br><br>Think you definitely need to get the mechanic to check for engine oil leak.  According to one of your posts saying that your engine oil was very low... I find it very odd that it happened to a new car.  You can do a simple check for oil leak by looking for visible sign of leakage (pool of oil?) on the parking spot where you park.  If there's an oil leak, you need to make sure you check the engine oil level daily (it can burn and ruin your engine if run out of oil) until it's fixed.<br><br>Anyway, good luck and drive safely!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
