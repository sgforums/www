              <p><strong>Ford china report very strong sell in 2009 but will end  Partnership with Mazda In China By 2012</strong></p>
              <p>Ford Motor  posted a 44 percent jump in its China vehicle sales last
              year and aims to outpace growth in the world’s largest auto market this
              year</p>
              <p>Ford, which broke ground for a $490 million new China plant in September, sold 440,619 vehicles in the country in 2009.</p>
              <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859" title="Ford Fiesta" src="http://autoten.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Ford-Fiesta.jpg" alt="Ford Fiesta" width="503" height="353"></p>
              <p>That compared with 306,306 units in 2008 and marked an acceleration
              in annual growth from 32 percent in the first nine months of 2009, the
              company said in a statement.</p>
              <p>“We think there will be something like 8 percent growth of the
              market this year,” Nigel Harris, head of Ford’s sales and marketing in
              China, told reporters. “Our ambition is to sell more than 8 percent.”</p>
              <p> Despite a 33% jump in December, Ford’s sales in the U.S. slipped 15% to 1.62 million units in 2009.</p>
              <p>China likely displaced the U.S. as the largest auto market last
              year, a first for the Asian country as domestic sales boomed last year
              while sales growth in the U.S. fell to record lows.</p>
              <p>Overall auto sales in the U.S. last year will likely total 10.4
              million vehicles, Ford said earlier, which would be the lowest level
              since 1982, when sales totaled 10.3 million, according to Autodata Corp.</p>
              <p>The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, which expects
              sales in China to have exceeded 13 million last year, is scheduled to
              issue data next week.</p>
              <p>Ford’s strong vehicle sales in China were driven by the popularity
              of the Focus compact car and the Fiesta subcompact car, it said. In
              addition, sales of its Transit light van rose 22% to 33,585 units.</p>
              <p>The company plans to introduce three new models to China and one
              updated model , Nigel Harris, general manager of Changan Ford Mazda,
              said in November<br> Ford’s performance lags that of its rival, General Motors Co., whose
              sales in China soared 67% last year to 1.83 million units. Toyota Motor
              Corp.’s<br> China sales rose 21% to 709,000 units in 2009.</p>
              <p><strong>Mazda, Ford To End Output Partnership In China By 2012</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>They will likely spin off the joint venture’s factory in Nanjing as
              a 50-50 joint venture between Mazda and Changan Automobile Group, while
              Ford and Changan will run the venture’s other factory in Chongqing, the
              business paper said.</p>
              <p>“It was sometimes difficult to coordinate production (in the
              three-way joint venture,)” Nikkei quoted a senior Mazda official as
              saying.</p>
              <p>Mazda Motor Corp.  will end its partnership with Ford Motor Co  in
              China by 2012 in order to allow itself to independently make decisions
              such as production increases, the Nikkei reported in its Sunday morning
              edition, without citing sources.</p>
              <p>The newspaper also said the Japanese car maker plans to continue partnership on production with Ford in the U.S. and Thailand.</p>
