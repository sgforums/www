            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Readers,<br><br>The purpose of this post is to gather as many people who got similar experience as me, be it your friends and relatives and hope to work something out.<br><br>Today, I read a news on <strong>NEWPAPER, 26 SEPT, PAGE11</strong> about someone who signed for a loan to buy a car from PI. The loan was refused but the PI insisted that he should buy the car and sue this person when he tried to cancel the purchase. This poor man later approached the PI wanting to buy the car, but this time, the PI insisted that this man pay off the legal fees and STILL must buy the car.<br><br>I have a similar experience. I paid $500 deposit to a 2nd-hand dealer. The loan was not approved and I was asked to pay $300 as kopi money and a new loan at a higher interest rate, will be approved. I rejected the dealer and wanted to cancel the deal. The agent then called me back a few days later saying that no kopi money needed but he would need to try the loan with another in-house agent. Ended up the original in-house agent approved the loan, at the same interest rate!<br><br>Seeing their dishonesty, I insisted on cancelling the deal and negotiated to have part of the deposit refunded back to me. This way, they will earn $200-$300 for doing nothing. However, the agent refused again. Damn those blood suckers.<br><br>I have actually bought this up to CASE but sadly they are unable to help me from the way it look. So I will bring this case to small claims tribunal to see if they can help me. CASE told me my chances with Small Claim is 50-50. I am also currently in the midst of reading and UNDERSTANDING the contract law to see how to get the contract void.<br><br>If you are interested to discuss and know more, or even have similar experiece, your advice will be greatly appreciated to help normal people like you and me. I have also posted a similar post at hardwarezone.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br></div>

And for my case, I was signing on behalf of my brother and I am trying to find out from the contract law does this action lead to a void / discharge of contract. And also, the receipt (not even contract) that I signed was not from the company that I dealt with.<br><br>I learned my lesson, but i want my money back!!<br></div>

I thought why should I. Its either approve or disapproved.<br><br>2nd, I was signing the paper but the name appearing on the receipt is my brother's name.

            <div class='col-md body'>I presumed that since the name is your brother's, the purchase is thus invalid.<br><br>But u cant use it to your advantage as........<br><br>u might be in trouble yourself as you can be charged as forging ur brother's signature. Purchase will be voided but ur deposit wont be back and u will be in trouble with the law.<br><br>So my opinion, dont use the 2nd point, because if the dealers want to be bastardised, they can say that they are led to believe and they did not know u are not ur brother, pushing all the forgery blames to u.<br><br>The 3rd rule is kind of stupid in my opinion, I would never have signed if I saw that.<br><br>my only advice and a really not helpful one : "lose money, evade disaster", money can be earned.<br><br>and just another query, since the original loan can be secured, and at the same interest rate agreed, why wont u see thru the deal? That might be the best solution.<br><br>He wasn't being quite honest, but neither was he totally dishonest there. and since the original loan can be approved at same interest rate, why not see thru the deal?</div>
