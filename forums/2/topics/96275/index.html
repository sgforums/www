            <div class='col-md body'>from:<br><br><a href="http://www.topgear.com/content/news/cars_coming_soon/32/" rel="nofollow">http://www.topgear.com/content/news/cars_coming_soon/32/</a><br><br>What is it?<br>The replacement for the ancient Xsara - yes that thing that you thought had gone out of production years ago, but which has actually been trickling out of the showrooms over the last few years. That car was first seen in 1997 and managed to average little more than 500 sales a month throughout 2003.<br><br>When's it due?<br>The C4 will make its debut at the Paris Motor Show in September 2004 before going on sale in November.<br><br>What are the engines and transmissions?<br>There'll be a choice of three petrol or two diesel engines; the latter coming in 1.4, 1.6 or 2.0-litre flavours and offering between 90bhp and 180bhp. Opt for a diesel and you'll have a choice of 1.6 or 2.0-litre turbocharged common-rail units, with between 92bhp and 138bhp on tap.<br><br>What about the design?<br>Unlike the very ordinary-looking Xsara, the C4 has eye-catching styling - especially in three-door form. Whereas the five-door car focuses on practicality, the three-door model is more sporty with a strange split window in the hatchback. Remember the three-door Mazda 323 of the early 1990s? Thought not - but you may have noticed a similar treatment on the current Toyota Prius. The C4 also follows the current trend for oversized headlamps and short overhangs, the latter being in a bid to improve ride quality and increase interior space.<br><br>How fast does it go?<br>With a drag coefficient of just 0.28, the C4 is very slippery - especially for a small hatch. That'll help with the performance, although nothing official has been said about how fast the C4 will be. Expect the 180bhp model to manage around 135mph and a 0-62mph sprint in 7.5 seconds or so; entry-level cars will have a top speed closer to 105mph with a 13-second 0-62mph time.<br><br>What does it cost?<br>No prices have yet been announced, but expect only a small price increase over the equivalent Xsara. That means the cheapest (1.4-litre) car will set you back around Â£:11,000 while the range-topping 180bhp car will be closer to Â£:17,000.<br><br>What's new?<br>Everything except the engines and transmissions, which have already been seen in other cars within the PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) Group.<br><br>Any special features?<br>The slippery shape should help to reduce noise levels, which will be cut down further thanks to the use of laminated side glass (which will also help improve security). This is the first time a car in this class has offered such an innovation, but more noticeable will be the neat fixed steering wheel boss. This remains static while the steering wheel turns around it, improving safety by offering a better base from which to launch an airbag in the event of a crash.<br><br>Other gadgetry that will be available includes a lane departure warning system, a speed limiter and a tyre pressure warning system - which we hope will be more reliable than most of the offerings seen elsewhere. To round off the new toys there's a dual-function directional xenon headlamp set up, which gives better lighting when the car is being cornered.<br><br>Who's going to buy it?<br>Fleets - or at least Citroen will be hoping so - and trendy young buyers who want something different from the usual small hatch. Sales will always lag behind the Focus, Astra and Golf, so anyone buying a C4 is guaranteed to have something less common.<br><br>The Top Gear verdict: favourite or failure?<br>The pricing is sure to be keen and the exterior styling heralds a return to the creative designs that Citroen used to be noted for. It's also unlikely that Citroen is going to pass up the opportunity to compete with its major rivals in terms of driveability - which all adds up to a car that should offer a strong all-round package. In other words, a favourite.<br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image01.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image02.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image03.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image04.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image05.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image06.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.topgear.com/content/fun_stuff/gallery/A7/XX/gallery/images/image07.jpg"><br><br>Well Done Citroen! I am looking forward to it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Personally, I prefers the 5-door hatch rather than the 3-Door one<br><br>What do you guys think?
