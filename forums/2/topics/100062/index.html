            <div class='col-md body'>TP are also human beings.  They also have their mood swings and temper.  So, it's bad luck that you met one who decided to "abuse" his position of authority.  A word of fairness, not all TPs are like that.  I think most are just sick of dealing with so any people every single day trying to use all sorts of excuses (sometimes really blatant lies) to wriggle themselves out of a fine.  So, they have to act stern from the start to do their job.<br>Remember there was once when my dad got stopped by this young TP (maybe too greenhorn).  He was very polite and kept addressing my dad as "sir" even though my dad was so worked up about being stopped.  In the end, I had jump in to placate my dad.  Well, he got a fine and demerit points.  But at least, the TP merely did his job and showed us the respect that all citizens in a democratic society are due.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
