I'd think that a 4WD would be better for the winter conditions coming up there....<br><br>But the 3 is a good car, yes.  One way to see how good it is...is by the demand for it.  In some place (if I remember correctly, some part of South Africa), the WRX used to be the most stolen car.  But when the Mazda 3 and 6 were released, the WRX took 3rd place.  No guesses on who were the 1st and 2nd. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Um...now, the WRX has gone back to first place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, gentlerock......how do you KNOW that I'm in Canada?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Yeah, I know.  Many of my friends have the SUVs, like the Honda, erm, what huh?  Is it CRV?  Actually, I also tested the Tucson and Sonata.  But hubby said jiak yu tan.  Some more gas prices have been escalating only recently coming down slowly.<br><br>If bad snowy days, I call in .....no, not call in sick....just take vacation.  Or maybe get snowed-in days if weather really bad.<br><br>They plough the roads really quick and good so ordinary cars okay.  I currently lease the Elantra and so far so good.  But I got kena slid and whoosh a few times liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">   I do like my Elantra but lease is up end of year so returning it.  The buy-back is crazy.  C$8k.  Siow.  Four year old Elantra where got worth C$8k??<br><br>Anyways, thanks for your comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know you're in Canada because you told me earlier this year when you just registered in this forum lah.  It was either in Chit-chat or Club 30...forgot where.  I've been away from this forum for a few months and just re-appeared.<br><br>Yeah, I know about Korean cars....I owned one before.  It gave so many problems after 4 years that I had to scrap it.  Yet there are some who will swear by it.....depends on luck lah.  Get one made on a bad work day....then good luck to the buyer.<br><br>Sorry, I gave you wrong info earlier....it wasn't South Africa.  It was Israel where the Mazda 3 and 6 took over the WRX.<br><br>Really, the Mazda 3 will feel the same as the Elantra, will do everything the Elantra will do....except that it'll do it in a more refined way.  The Mazda 3 sedan is known to be a bit underpowered....but so is the Elantra.  Consumption will not be fantastic, but I suspect should be better than the Elantra.  And the cabin ergonomics and features in the 3 will be much better too.<br><br>Other than that, the 3 probably has a factory-fitted immobiliser....but then again, it would make no difference for Canada because immobilisers are required by law in every car.<br><br></div>
