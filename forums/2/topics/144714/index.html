            <div class='col-md body'>Absorber provide the damping, Spring limits the distance.<br><br>Absorber works by provding resistance according to the speed the wheels are moving vertically. It works both ways.<br><br>Spring works to bring your wheels back its normal position, at the same time adding forces when it is compressed according to the amount it is compressed. Meaning more compression, more force. But spring only works its resistance in 1 direction, wheel going up and not coming down.<br><br>A good combination of both is needed to prevent over-damping (bouncy ride) and under-damping (you will feel every hump big or small). Strut bar might be a plus, but some feel that the stability of the lowering of spring makes the strut bar effect less.</div>
