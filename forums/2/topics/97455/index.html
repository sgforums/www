The lancer has been the bread to the Mitsubishi Company for a while now, despite what was reported, the situation doesn't necessary paint the picture for them. A look around the country can tell you why the pricing, styling, the reliability has assured ppl to stake 5 figures in the car. fyi, the car has been top selling, ranking among the top 5 ever since the new facelift is introduced.<br><br>The impreza as a discerning car? whatever is your thoughts manz? A sharp, shrewd car which is so sensitive to your needs? this is singapore again bro. And I can certainly tell you the differences btw the 2 cars, dope. so what is the purpose in cornering at gear 3, or ebraking at sharp turns, mesmerized by the awd, believing you are all that invincible. Young men nowadays are accident-prone because you this kind la. Your nonsenses with colt, evo, grandis has kept you from seeing the bigger picture, quoting you again; Â“THEY WILL BE THE SAVIOUR TO MITSUBISHI!Â” YOUNG MAN!!!! AI!<br><br>We are talking being practical: I have driven both cars so donÂ’t go telling me.<br><br>Pic: Buyer pays for a certain TS model, $80,000. car returns at 9-10km per litre. Driver gets to spin at Â‘breakneckÂ’ speeds, gets to TURN CORNERS AT GEAR 3 (i.e., since when other cars canÂ’t do it? It is the skills fren).<br><br>Pic 2: Buyer selects a certain lancer model, paying $67,000 to $70,000. Car returns 12-14km per litre. The car moves at the law-abiding speeds, just like the TS, but could not perform rally stunts, as it is more interested in preserving that very individual currently residing in it.<br><br>GROW UP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude i drive a lancer. i must say that the engine is pretty rough. Honda is not worth the money. Its smaller and the design sucks. I wouldnt go for the mazda 3 either. Mazda is just like apple computer now. Selling by design and packaging rather than quality. My dad used to drive a mazda that had super lots of problems so now we boycott mazda. I think your best bet for this price range is the vios. Smooth, cheap and good.

The lancer has been the bread to the Mitsubishi Company for a while now, despite what was reported, the situation doesn't necessary paint the picture for them. A look around the country can tell you why the pricing, styling, the reliability has assured ppl to stake 5 figures in the car. fyi, the car has been top selling, ranking among the top 5 ever since the new facelift is introduced.<br><br>The impreza as a discerning car? whatever is your thoughts manz? A sharp, shrewd car which is so sensitive to your needs? this is singapore again bro. And I can certainly tell you the differences btw the 2 cars, dope. so what is the purpose in cornering at gear 3, or ebraking at sharp turns, mesmerized by the awd, believing you are all that invincible. Young men nowadays are accident-prone because you this kind la. Your nonsenses with colt, evo, grandis has kept you from seeing the bigger picture, quoting you again; Â“THEY WILL BE THE SAVIOUR TO MITSUBISHI!Â” YOUNG MAN!!!! AI!<br><br>We are talking being practical: I have driven both cars so donÂ’t go telling me.<br><br>Pic: Buyer pays for a certain TS model, $80,000. car returns at 9-10km per litre. Driver gets to spin at Â‘breakneckÂ’ speeds, gets to TURN CORNERS AT GEAR 3 (i.e., since when other cars canÂ’t do it? It is the skills fren).<br><br>Pic 2: Buyer selects a certain lancer model, paying $67,000 to $70,000. Car returns 12-14km per litre. The car moves at the law-abiding speeds, just like the TS, but could not perform rally stunts, as it is more interested in preserving that very individual currently residing in it.<br><br>GROW UP<br><br>yeah.. u are very very right.. Lancer is obviously better than TS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Its not my concern anyway but everyone has their own comments and views on different objects. Maybe what we should do is to take other people views with open heart and learn abt it, not to condemn and criticise. Comments can go all the way round and roudn till the cow comes home but you'll never be able to reach a conclusion.<br><br>Personally don't own a lancer but a friend do. The verdict is as belows.<br>Fuel consumption- Auto, average 10km-11lm/l<br>Performance - Decent for a salon, but definitely not great<br>Durability- Be rest assured that its a proven car.<br><br>Conclusion:- At this market, its one of the value for money car in the market.</div>
