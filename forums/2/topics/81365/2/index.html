I was the one who suggested going continental... =)<br>Go test drive the Focus! You'll be surprised how good the handling is... I see people trading in their G9 Corollas for that! The safety, handling and comfort definitely outweighs the costs involved in the car!!!<br><br>The current Altis does not come with manual mode. Actually, if you're still on the idea of getting a 4-dr Jap brand, besides Jazz there's still Vios and City to consider! Just that i hate the Vios' dials in the middle... City comes with both i-DSi and VTEC too! If really wanna save money, go for a 1.3M Ignis or even a Wira...<br><br>eddie</div></blockquote>Of course the Ford Focus is great but if you want a proper looking focus you need that hatched back model .... its a reliable brand after all its FORD ...<br>But if you want to get this car you must weigh its F/C, its spare parts cost to change and if you need service, other then the agent where can you go to and how much is it per service.<br><br>The Corolla (G9) have Manual mode, Trust me.<br>The Corolla Altius also HAVE MANUAL mode, BUT you will have to PI it ...<br>So far Corolla have its reputation for it's lasting engine, and its F/C thats why you see more Corolla on the road. The price is right and the space and comfort is there. Plus the servicing is widely avaliable, thus making it cheaper to serivice and replace parts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The Suzuki Ignis is also a good choice for a small family car, it is cheaper and more affordable, but remember its only 1.3 and its a hatch, so pram could be a problem in the boots. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>The Nissian Sunny is also a good choice, it gives you comfort and a quite impressive handling feel, plus now they have fitted the car with CVTC (which is like V-TEC, VVTi , VVT, etc) and the E-throttle, which is responsive, it gives good low end torque, plus servicing is widely avaliable also  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But in the end dude, the choice is yours because YOU are paying for it, but remember to keep us updated.<br><br>P.S. my 2nd Sunny is going to arrive next tuesday!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

As for your minimising of loss when selling, Fit and Sunny would have the egde...

Fuel consumption is one factor but frankly, unless u are toking about 2litre cars, most of the 1.6 &amp; below are yielding 12-14km/l. Its juz more or less. If u have a cutting edge fuel saver like Jazz, most prob, u have to pay a high price for it. think about it.<br><br>Jazz - in excess of 72K.<br>Hyundai getz - 58K<br>(lets keep it at those 2), u are toking about 14K diff! I dun think u will use 14K more fuel in 20 years.... let alone 10.<br><br>As for resale, the market will juz get worse and worse. Last time, second hand march can get 5.5K dep, now, be thankful u can get 4.<br>3K. Larger cars like 2L cefiro use to go like 7++K dep.... now, its less than 7K. Nobody can predict the future.
