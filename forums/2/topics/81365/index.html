(i threw the clutch too fast on my dads car ... so its proven) so if you want something lasting and a nice interior you can consider corolla.<br><br>4.Try the Mitsubishi Lancer 1.6 ... heard now that the japanese side is loosing money on its production of cars so my cousin just accuired one from C&amp;C at 68,500 for the manual one ... it looks sporty and comes with full leather sits ...<br><br>Well i have express my views on the more "common" 1.6 sedans but if you need more info i would suggest you go get brochure from those show rooms *just my 2 cents worth*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey dude ...scrap the idea of the 2 door car, you are going to expect your child to arrive soon rite?<br><br>there if you are going to have a baby then your wife got to 'climb' behind to get to the back sit and it is abit packed esp after shopping. Trust me you need the space and thats why i sold my CooperS mention on the earlier thread ...i would suggest a Corolla or a Sunny for a family man ... a decent Sedan. if you want to go for value then go for Kia rio or the pincato if not get a second hand car ...<br><br>When buying a car you have to think of how many people is going to sit and how much space you can spare for a pram some big bag with water pampers and milk ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>take for example my cousin, he bought a Skyline coupe R34 ... then his wife was expecting at that time ... he happily zoom here and there with his car ... then his baby came and all hell arise .. he found that the car is too small for his small family and then there is a constrain of putting the push pram into the boot and he cannot take my Aunty and Uncle out when they want to go shopping ... in the end he had to change to a Sedan ...so please think harder i am sure you can work out a way for a better and more comfortable ride for your little family.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Just my 2 cents worth again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... I was the one who suggested going continental... =)<br>Go test drive the Focus! You'll be surprised how good the handling is... I see people trading in their G9 Corollas for that! The safety, handling and comfort definitely outweighs the costs involved in the car!!!<br><br>The current Altis does not come with manual mode. Actually, if you're still on the idea of getting a 4-dr Jap brand, besides Jazz there's still Vios and City to consider! Just that i hate the Vios' dials in the middle... City comes with both i-DSi and VTEC too! If really wanna save money, go for a 1.3M Ignis or even a Wira...<br><br>eddie</div>
