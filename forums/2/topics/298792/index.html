            <div class='col-md body'>I recently bought a 2nd hand Car from <strong>Benzwolrd</strong>. I though that by buying from a company that deals with luxury cars, their service will be different and with no gimmicks, I was proven wrong.<br><br>1) After weÂ’ve agreed on the price and paid the deposit. The salesman told us the next day that there is an <strong>additional $500 processing fee</strong>. Not very upfront and transparent with all costs, so now my cost of my car is plus another $500.<br><br>2) I was also told that my Road tax for my new car expires next month and the salesman will renew the Road Tax for me. Sounds normal. By a stroke of luck, before I passed him the money, my mother was at LTA for her car inspection and decided to renew it for me since she was there. To her surprise, LTA said our Road tax is still valid for 6 more months! <strong>I would have lost $1300!</strong> In the end I just paid $10 to reprint a new one.<br><br>3) The salesman offered me Loan company B although Company A(Hong Leong) was also offering the same rates. He told me that Benzwolrd would like to try business with Company B. DoesnÂ’t matter to me, as long as same interest rates. Company B took a long time with the loan approval, had some problems with the forms, so the <strong>GM of Benzwolrd </strong>had to contact us. She couldnÂ’t get me so she got my wife. She was <strong>so rude and disrespectful </strong>over the phone with my wife.<br><br>I guess no one likes to be told off, especially if we are the customers. I totally hate rude staff. Not to mention a General Manager, thatÂ’s even worse.<br><br>Well this is my experience to share with all of you. Be very careful when dealing with them.<br></div>
