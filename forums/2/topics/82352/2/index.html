VIOS is suitable for people looking for a cheap ride... in terms of looks it is unanimous that it beats cars in its league like Accent and City... further more its powered by award winning VVTi engine... for a budget car, it is considered quite a steal..<br><br>btw, who ever said that VIOS is cramped? or issit just an impression passing from mouth to mouth? so far my passengers quite happy..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>City's rear seat are called 'ultra seat'. They can be configured in long mode, tall mode, utility mode. Its boot already boast 500 litres,; fold down on long mode and you can easily increased it to 900 litres. You can load lots of stuff from Ikea with that kind of space.<br><br>Btw, I bought my Mugen bodykit already from Malaysia and I managed to load all into my City without a need for a lorry or van to carry them.
