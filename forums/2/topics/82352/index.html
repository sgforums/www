            <div class='col-md body'>Suggest you get the City instead. It's better value for money. The Vios is just too conservative and common. The interior plastic looks and feel cheap and the centre console is just so odd...it looks like a scale down model of the Altis..<br><br>If you are going down to Kah Motors, look for Alice Goh or Jean. I was served by Alice and lots of freebies thrown in (after some sweet talking lah...haha). But importantly, City is really a better car. There are quite a few car review on it in the local magazines and it is sad that the real potential of the City is not fully realised by the reviewer. Common complaints are it is sluggish in the 'D' auto mode and so foth. But really the iDSI is optimised for fuel efficiency and sufficient power for city driving.<br><br>If you want power, just switch to 'S' mode, activate the steermatic for manual override and you will have hell of a drive! Just keep to the speed limit though because at this stage, the City picks up speed very very fast...maybe the reviewer should ask Honda JP for advise on how to maximise usage of the CVT and steermatic and not pen their review according to their normal driving techniques.<br><br>Go for the highest spec iDSI CVT 1.5L with dual airbags, ABS. The price has drop to $66,000 (I bought mine at $69,500 in Feb 2004), so its even more value for money. Go for the black colour...its looks cool!!!</div>

If the SE can offer 66,000 with airbag+ABS .. I can place the order this week .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Private Me .<br>Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>City is working on a SOHC whereas Vios is on DOHC, would there be an effect on the FC? I considering a Vios too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although the City comes with the SOHC and the Vios DOHC, don't be fooled by it. The City is equipped with SOHC, 8 valves, twin spark iDSI techology with 88 kwh and max torque of 131 at 2700 rpm. CVT is also standard as it steermatic(F1 techology) aka Alfa Romeo setup.<br><br>FC for the City is 550 to 600 km on 42 litres for mixed urban/highway driving. For highway driving, it should easily hit 650 to 700km.<br><br>The City has good torque throughout the range and that matters. I heard from my colleague driving the Vios is that it felt sluggish at pickup.<br><br>My suggestion is you test drive both City and Vios. Honda is renowned for its engine techology and it certainly will not compromise its standard.</div>
