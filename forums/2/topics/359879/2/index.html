              <p>Personally I do not drive a continental car daily - but even I
              know that it is unfair, and highly possibly untrue, that BMW is the
              'best' car of the world, it is undoubtly a <strong>good
              car</strong>, but surely <strong>not the best there is</strong> -
              if not, why are there people paying big bucks to buy cars such as
              Lotus, Maserati, Porsche, etc when they can have a "bmw - the best
              car in the world"?  My original post to Rob was merely to
              refute that statement, that he should NOT have made such sweeping
              statements if he has not driven enough cars.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Ok my bad if my posts previously suggest Im on the same side as him when it comes to BMW as the best car in the world. If I really took the same side with him on this, then I dun even deserve to know cars because even girls will have a straight answer to that. However, it is a good car. Yes. But people immediately just jumped onto him in a herd mentality. </span></p>
              <p>It is also inevitable that people will compare BMW to Mercs to
              Audis, merely because they are marketed in the same league and have
              a similar price range. Let's be fair and not compare, say, a 320i
              to a F430 - simply because the F430 is priced many times a 320i.
              But if you were to compare a 320i to a A4 - which is priced around
              the same range - then <strong>if what Rob says is true</strong>,
              everyone who buys the A4 is an idiot because he/she wasted money on
              an Audi when they could have used it to buy the "best car of the
              world".</p>
              <p>Do you see why there are comparisons to Audis and Mercs now, and
              why so many people are dissing Rob for his ill-thought out
              comments?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Yes I agree. It has long been a strong comparison amongst this few makes and evident in many other car forums for sure. However, I do stand that Forums are made to be fun and if one just blatently does a head mentality then I think its quite uncalled for. And I do agree different people have different opinions so if they say Audi is the best in the world, by all means.</span></p>

Just because he doesn't join you all in EDMW or SgForums means he is oddball?</span></p>

And I do concur there are easily 10 other models fare better than it.I have no intention to sucking him up like some of the 'regulars' mentioned. I just want to congratulate him for if he really drives it and enjoying every moment of it. </span></p>
