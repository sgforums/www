              <p>BMW model car can drive? Best car by what measurements? Have you flown a jet before to make that comparison? The car has to find its own aim?  Hasn't knock you down yet. Bad aim I must say. Helms`heel? simi lai eh?</p>

              <p>How many of us are actually driving? I think its pretty funny for someone with 33 posts to make that kind of statement. Have you actually been around cars forum long enough? I daresay more than half, if not all, of the forumners with 4-digit post count drives.</p>
              <p>As for your argument, what you said makes absolutely no sense. Just because someone paid in full for their ride will make it sweeter than any other ride? You've got to be kidding me. I bet most of the forumners here can pay in cash for a red-plate chery qq, but I'm willing to bet one of my balls that they will be more than willing to, if given the chance, to drive a say ferrari, lamborghini, or aston martin that does not belong to them rather than the china car. And I'll bet my other ball that they'll find the exotics "sweeter".</p>
              <p>And btw, yeah sure rob can be driving a 335i or an M3 for all we care, similarly, he could be driving a COE 316i which will well lose to the Audi. I mean, we don't know, but neither do you, so please stop making a fool of yourself by sucking up to the supposed-bmw-owner.</p>
              <p>Who's the joke here?</p>

              <p>Exactly. One mountain still got one mountain higher. As technology improves, so will automotive engineering. What's fantastic now may not be so a few years down the road; similarly, what we deem inferior car makers today might go on to produce some of the best road cars in future.</p>

              <p>Hi Robert,</p>
              <p>Glad you think its a good drive. Perhaps driving something you
              have paid for makes it all the more sweeter than any other ride you
              had before.</p>
              <p>Other than vertmonyet, the rest are just giving you a diss about
              your ride. How many of them are actually driving? How many have
              driven a bm? How many have driven enough to comment other than
              reading through pages of reviews and not feeling for themselves?
              Seriously...</p>
              <p>And btw, Rob has not even stated what model he is driving? If
              its a 335i, what say you guys? Lose to A4 1.8T? Dun be a joke
              seriously.</p>

              <p>Please do not speak if you don't know anything. If you are saying most forumnites here do not drive, you are so wrong. I think you're the one without a license here. Are you still learning? I can sell you my p-plate for 5 bucks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Most of us here are just commenting that Rob is daydreaming and he should not post such useless threads. Of course we know BMWs are usually nice drives, but there are MUCH better ones out there. So if you agree with Rob and believe him, you are as useless as this thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>How many of us are actually driving? I think its pretty funny
              for someone with 33 posts to make that kind of statement. Have you
              actually been around cars forum long enough? I daresay more than
              half, if not all, of the forumners with 4-digit post count
              drives.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Let's be objective here. You want to judge a person by number of posts and the nick he is carrying online? I believe you don't but your above posts portray as such. Yes, all can be driving. But are you all driving audis and bmws to comment as such? I mean as a daily.</span></p>
              <p>As for your argument, what you said makes absolutely no sense.
              Just because someone paid in full for their ride will make it
              sweeter than any other ride? You've got to be kidding me. I bet
              most of the forumners here can pay in cash for a red-plate chery
              qq, but I'm willing to bet one of my balls that they will be more
              than willing to, if given the chance, to drive a say ferrari,
              lamborghini, or aston martin that does not belong to them rather
              than the china car. And I'll bet my other ball that they'll find
              the exotics "sweeter".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">No, I did not mention paid in full. I mention that paid by himself than say, parents buying it for him. Moreover, I did use the word "perhaps". Did you see any absolute statements made around in my postings? Of course it will be sweeter to drive an exotic, who doesn't? Man are made to be different and different people has different perception to life. He just want to share his joy and here we have people comparing BMWs to MERCs or to AUDIs.</span></p>
              <p>And btw, yeah sure rob can be driving a 335i or an M3 for all we
              care, similarly, he could be driving a COE 316i which will well
              lose to the Audi. I mean, we don't know, but neither do you, so
              please stop making a fool of yourself by sucking up to the
              supposed-bmw-owner.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Yes you all care. For if he drives COE 316i, you all will be all over him again. If its an M, the whole picture will be different. Sucking up? I need to? Maybe I need to.</span></p>
              <p>Who's the joke here?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">I am the joke of course. Cause I do not conform to the norms in here and having only a miserly 33 posts, I made such a heavy comment and go against the norm here.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Ive lost my P-plate long ago. For Ive passed for quite some time. Thanks for asking and the offer but auction sites have plates like this going for 3 bucks or so.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Yes, BMW is a nice drive, even when 320i has its DS mode on. And I do concur there are easily 10 other models fare better than it.I have no intention to sucking him up like some of the 'regulars' mentioned. I just want to congratulate him for if he really drives it and enjoying every moment of it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Your last statement is really a bad comparison. Just because I trust someone, I am as useless as this thread? Nice try.</span></p>

              <p>Personally I do not drive a continental car daily - but even I know that it is unfair, and highly possibly untrue, that BMW is the 'best' car of the world, it is undoubtly a <strong>good car</strong>, but surely <strong>not the best there is</strong> - if not, why are there people paying big bucks to buy cars such as Lotus, Maserati, Porsche, etc when they can have a "bmw - the best car in the world"?  My original post to Rob was merely to refute that statement, that he should NOT have made such sweeping statements if he has not driven enough cars.</p>
              <p>It is also inevitable that people will compare BMW to Mercs to Audis, merely because they are marketed in the same league and have a similar price range. Let's be fair and not compare, say, a 320i to a F430 - simply because the F430 is priced many times a 320i. But if you were to compare a 320i to a A4 - which is priced around the same range - then <strong>if what Rob says is true</strong>, everyone who buys the A4 is an idiot because he/she wasted money on an Audi when they could have used it to buy the "best car of the world".</p>
              <p>Do you see why there are comparisons to Audis and Mercs now, and why so many people are dissing Rob for his ill-thought out comments?</p>
