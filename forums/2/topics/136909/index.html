They will need time to consider what car to buy. As such, SE are there to help the customer and most importantly to do follow-up. They are there to provide infos and to make customer buy from them. More SE closed more than half of their deals through follow-up, money dun drop from the sky everyday.<br><br>As a customer, u shld make use of the sales executive. Ask them questions, make them do things for you before u decide to buy from them or not. If they are not willing to help, by all means, get another  SE.<br><br>If the customer never open his eyes and buy from a FU SE who is not willing to help, i think he deserve the bad service.<br><br></div>

Just check out the number of car SEs working for other brand dealers or parallel importers that don't even own a car.<br><br>Myth 2: Car SEs are overpaid!<br><br>Truth: Most car SEs only have a miserably low basic (&lt;$500) and depend on the finance/insurance/vehicle/used car/accessories commissions to earn a living. If every customer were to squeeze their SEs to return their commissions in the form of giving freebies, then what will the SEs earn? The actual ones making big bucks are the car distributors/dealers, not their SEs. Moreover, car SEs are wearing multiple hats: car salesman, insurance agent, used car dealer, bank officer etc.</div>
