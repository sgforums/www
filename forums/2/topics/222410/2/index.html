            <div class='col-md body'>I do understand the thread starter's feeling(to a certain extent). I'm a cyclist too, n sadly i do feel tt car drivers sometimes get impatient n are very rude to their fellow road users.<br><br>They do not seem to understand tt cyclist are SUPPOSED to be on the ROAD.. I was cycling(on the extreme left lane, even to the left of the double yellow line) along yck arnd the sengkang area recently, when this chevrolet optra started sounding his horn behind me. Guess wat? tt was because i was cycling "too slow".. My instantaneous speed then was about 30+km/h, and it's a relatively acceptable(if not fast) pace from a cyclist point of view(esp a novice).<br><br>Fortunately, these drivers are only a handful.<br><br>I do hope this situation can improve in the near future(I'm sure we all do), and appeal to all drivers to look out for cyclists and understand tt more often than not, cyclists cover long distances, and always try their best to keep up with traffic (i'm only talking about avid cyclists and does not necessarily include the foriegn workers happily cruising w/o any protective gear but their t-shirt n folded up long pants.)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
