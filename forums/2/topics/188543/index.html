Cos I don't suppose the thread starter will be looking at the Latio sedan.<br><br>And I do agree that convenience usually cost more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Likely to break down? Maybe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>My point is the Colt Plus gives you such stuffs at reasonable pricing and thus it is value for money. There will be many stuffs that can breakdown in a car. Even the power window can break down on Toyotas. Should we all get back to using hand-operated windows?<br><br>As for mr sunray's remarks that the features I mentioned are quite common on a normal jap car.<br><br>Let's see......<br><br>What is a normal Jap car?<br>1) Nissan Sunny<br>2) Toyota Corolla (Altis)<br>3) Honda Civic<br>4) Mitsubishi Lancer<br>5) Subaru Impreza<br><br>Auto Headlights<br>1) Nissan Sunny~~~~~~~Nil<br>2) Toyota Corolla (Altis)~~Nil (pre-altis facelifted G9 1.6 comes with it)<br>3) Honda Civic~~~~~~~~Nil<br>4) Mitsubishi Lancer~~~~Nil<br>5) Subaru Impreza~~~~~Nil<br><br>speed-variant intermittent wipers<br><span style="font-style: italic;">forgive my lousy English but I meant to say that when the driver switches on the intermittent wipers, there is no need to adjust the speed. The car will sense the speed of the intermittent wiper according to speed. Maybe mr sunray is talking about the ring on wiper control stalk which allows you to adjust the timing of the intermittent wipers. </span><br>1) Nissan Sunny~~~~~~Nil<br>2) Toyota Corolla (Altis)~~Nil<br>3) Honda Civic~~~~~~~~Nil<br>4) Mitsubishi Lancer~~~~Nil<br>5) Subaru Impreza~~~~~Nil<br><br>4 <strong>auto</strong> power window controls on driver side<br><span style="font-style: italic;">that means one touch auto operation for all 4 windows.

The models which I quoted are supposed to be the bread and butter car, hence I feel it is justified to quote the civic even though the 8th gen has a higher engine capacity. While S'poreans peg prices according to engine capacity, having a larger engine does not mean the car has superceded it's own identity of a normal car. The 8th Gen Civic is still the bread and butter car for Honda no matter what, hence I do not see the point about being fair or unfair. If it is a bread and butter car, it is a normal car. One example will be the newly launched Nissan Sylphy which is not the bread and butter car for Nissan even though it has a 1.5 litre version. For Nissan, the Sunny is still the main model that dealers hope to sell in volume.<br><br>The 8th gen civic comes in VTI, VTI-S &amp; Si, the last one being 2 litre. Is there a need to reiterate the point that it has a higher engine capacity after the above-mentioned? I beg to differ. Just for the record, Civics of the previous and current generation do have power fold feature for their wing mirrors. The current 8th gen even comes with hydrophilic mirrors. But they do not unfold by themselves upon reaching a certain stipulated speed. My previous point of discussion was the auto-unfold function of the Mitsubishi Colt which will kick in when the car reaches 30km/h.<br><br>It will be great to share knowledge in this forum but I sincerely hope people will refrain from making assumptions which will add to more confusion.<br><br>To quote my army instructor:<br><br><span class="large"><strong>You think, I thought, Who confirm????</strong></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've sat in the Nissan Latio before.. To be honest, it's not bad actually. The interior is nice looking, even though it looks small from outside, there's actually ample space inside. The interior feels well made, the transmission is smooth and not jerky, and handling overall feels rather solid. So i'm quite impressed with latio even though its "a nissan without four red circles on the back".</div>
