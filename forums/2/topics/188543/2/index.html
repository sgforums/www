            <div class='col-md body'>This is so interesting<br><br>I agree that you do get the quality that corresponds to the price that you pay and also that no car is perfect.<br><br>I really guess it is a matter of getting as much value as we can for the money, "Bang for your buck"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I remember when I started paying for my own cars, I was so bloody poor that I drove a 12 year old Starlet. But i found it really refreshing too, and till this day, I still remember that tiny little Toyota fondly. (bearing in mind that the previous car I had was a Galant  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )!<br><br>Back to the ORIGINAL point of discussion, Colt Plus or Latio, Colt Plus has more Bang for the Buck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyways, I went down to Proton yesterday to view the Savvy, after all the raving reviews in the various car magazines and I have to say that it is very little Bang for the 40grand that they want customers to fork out.<br><br>One thing stood out the most, when i first closed the door of the Savvy, a very familiar sound greeted my ears, that of a pick-up door closing......hmmmm, so 'my first lotus' is actually a pick-up in disguise...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My ride for colt plus have been 2 months and the ride seem very nice. All the feature  worth the price I pay , In term of hp per cc, this is the highest in the class except city vti .. but price abit higher and make in Thailand.  I get at 56plus with a 11k open cat. Good price I think.<br><br>The max torque for colt plus is at 4k rpm different than some of the sedan with max torque 2k plus. This make the car roaring but the car does not move forward. The bad noise reduction make it worst. The pickup abit slow .<br><br>But when u go over 2K and the car become lively  u can drag to the 4K before changing the gear . Most of the same class  car I tested  cannot beat it except for city VTI. I donÂ’t compare turbo car . This small car have a DOHC MIVAC engine give u a good hp to cc ratio except for VTI.<br><br>I like the new Civi , but look at the price where the feature is not as much . Lots of money u pay is spend on the brand name and the no need to say VTIÂ….I love ..<br><br>What i look for is the unique , feature and make in Japan . Which is the best price .. OK i pay about 4k more for a 30cm booth spare and I think I love it to put in my 2 10Â” kicker woofer. This make the exiting colt owner heat pain  Â… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .hehe also the price too<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prices are indeed enticing now, but frankly, if you buy a car at any point in time, it is a losing investment economically speaking.<br><br>My Colt was purchased when the model was launched, at a staggering 70K! (by today standards lah), thats why i keep insisting that buying one now makes perfect sense.<br><br>I'm numb with losing money on cars,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Lost a lot more when I traded in my Galant...bought it at 125K,...5 years lost close to 65k <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>hey, guess that's a typical motorists life in singapore.<br><br>btw, has the person who started the thread already bought a car??? so what was it?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hope not.<br><br>What i am going to say is purely subjective, I love MIVEC engines, say what you want about them being copies of VTEC engines (variable lift and all) and there is this hidden dislike that MIVEC drivers have with VTECs.<br><br>BUT, I have severe reservations with the 'beng' mobile in question. Civics that I have seen, (up to the EK series - the only truly beng ones), have a terrible habit, they break up into 2 upon impact.<br><br>hey maybe MIVECs are slower and less sporty but be a good safe beng and drive a MIVEC, not a VTEC... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The above comment is entirely subjective, lost a friend to a VTEC so very very bitter about it....

            <div class='col-md body'>Have been driving my CP for 8 months.... so far so good.. but just that the cabin noise is a bit high... coming from the luggage compartment from the back... boards knocking with each other... have improved the cabin noise with sound proofing......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However the greatest setback was the exhuast keep hitting the kerb when i reversed park cos its too low...... think they design it this way becos of the nice round back bumper... (just went back to the workshop to adjust after hiting a few times...)After all, it still a nice car for a small family...<br>For my personal experience, my FC is as follows after upgrading my rims to 195/50/R15... I suppose it sold be better with the original Rims<br><br>FC : 12.5 to 13km/l using Vpower or 98..... below 12 when using 95<br><br>For Latio... i tested it b4 i bought my CP.... for interior wise its more to the luxury side CP is more on the sporty type.... cabin noise is lower..... however i feel that the acceration was a bit draggy when i floorboard the accerator... a and thats the reason i choose CP in the end......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Depends on your needs, both got te pros and cons... i like the CP acceration and design but hate the exhuast design......... for Latio i like the spacious interior and the sunroof but the acceration puts me off.... maybe i used to my old SIR..... which of course both cars cannot compare......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
