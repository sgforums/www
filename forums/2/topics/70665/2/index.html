First you drive up to the first lot and leave yourself 1.5m between you and the car in Lot 1. den you start to reverse straight... when your shoulder reaches the mid point of the 2nd lot(lets say got merc in 2nd lot, den it's when you shoulders are in line with the logo), you do a full lock to you left. den slowly slowy reverse... and your car will fit nicely into Lot 4. of coz u gotta look at mirrors to check. coz sometimes car in lot 3 will park abit forward, by which you have to do your full lock abit later.<br><br>i would always suggest parking head first into the lot, coz i had an experience by which i reversed into the lot, just to find out that some idiot banged my engine the next morning. just be careful when you reverse out of the parking lot.<br><br>-ps- take as long as you want in parking... the idea is to do it SLOWLY. i'd rather other people horn at you than u hurry and buang into another car...</div></blockquote>This is quite accurate....i called it the 1 and the half lots method....coz a full lock to the desired direction is done at the 1 1/2 lot from the lot you want to park.</div>

This way when u reverse i think ur view at the two side mirros are wider.<br><br>At open air HDB lots, (old kind where there have grass growing in between lots) there are horizonatal or vertical grooves in which the grass grow out from. Position you car beside 2 grooves for a perfect centre parking position. Hope you understand my description.<br><br>Btw the right wiper squirter when viewed from driver's position indicates centre position on the road. The area immediately belowe your right side mirror is where your tires are on the road.</div>
