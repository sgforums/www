You are the only one in this thread that got it right.<br>Boost pressure builds up based on the opening of wastegate.  The solenoid controls air going through the actuator...controlling the amount of boost.<br>If the wastegate is open FULLY, there is still boost, but very little.<br>To reduce lag, a few ways to go round it.  One is to get a better actuator with higher pressure diaphram, so the wastegate opens slower and boost builts us faster.  Or you can use an electronic boost controller to control the amount of air going to the actuator to open the wastegate by reducing duty cycle.<br>If you have a programmable ECU, dial in more fuel at the lower RPMs to create more fuel burn, resulting in more exhaust gasses to flow the turbo.  Remember, turbo is exhaust driven.<br><br></div>
