To let the rest understand more, maybe I can help to explain a little.<br><br>Dump valve usage is to vent away excessive turbocharger boost pressure when the throttle is closed. The dump valve has basically two operating conditions; throttle open, and throttle closed. When the throttle is open, the boost pressure coming into the valve from below the diaphragm is equalled by the pressure onto the top of the diaphragm that comes via a small hose from the engine plenum inlet. As the pressures are equal, a spring holds the diaphragm onto its seat, and prevents the pressure venting away. When the throttle is closed, the pressure coming into the top of the valve is significantly reduced, (often to a vacuum), and the pressure below the diaphragm lifts it away from its seat, allowing the excess pressure to vent away. As the throttle is reopened, the pressures again equalise, the spring pushes the diaphragm onto its seat, and the boost pressure cannot vent away.<br><br>So Why Fit a Dump Valve?  It is for a number of reasons. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Without a dump valve, when the throttle was closed, the build up of boost pressure would be immense, very similar to closing a quickly flowing water tap.</strong></span></span> This excess of pressure, (which could be over five times the running boost pressure), would put the components of the system under a great strain. It would try to burst the intercooler and pipe work. More significantly, it would put a large strain on the turbocharger itself, firstly stalling the compressor shaft, then trying to force the compressor wheel out of the turbo, against its bearings.<br><br>The ECU when it runs closed loop will detect a leak either through the excessive vacuum or a leak.  And since it is running MAF (unless you tell me you run MAP), it will NOT IDLE.<br><br>Hope this helps andgood luck to your turbocharged car.</div>
