How many even bother to go down to Sepang to catch F1 or watch it on cable. Even kopitiam dun bother to show sometimes. Especially if F1 and EPL clash.<br><br>Soccer is so well received by the public thats why so much cash and support is given to the soccer scene... I must say trying to be a Pro racer in Sg is probably worse than trying to be a singer or actor in Sg...<br><br>Maybe if F1 is held in Sg, then things may turn for the better.

Go karts offer u the best chance of stepping into full time pro-racing, but its still a tough uphill challenge. I raced 3 seasons semi-pro in karts and other stuff, but in the end had to give it up due to financial constrains.<br><br>Dennis is possibly the closest Singapore has to a professional racer. Although when I last left for UK and he gave me a little pep talk, he was also some manager for Eurocars, think he was in charge of the Lotus cars or something.<br><br>Maybe in terms of number of events participated in, Ringo Chong can count as another, but to date apart from Dennis, I don't think Singapore has any racers who races for a living.

Did it for 3 years in sg, mostly club races, with some international events both in Sg and overseas. Right now I'm not racing at all. I'm doing my degree in motorsport engineering in UK.<br><br>To apply for a racing licence, one has to be part of a club or a recognised team. The easiest way of course, is to apply for a SMSA club membership as well, which then allows u to apply for a licence as a privateer.<br><br>As for what u believe, I'd say u'r generally on the right track. Just remember to temper your enthusiasm with reality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
