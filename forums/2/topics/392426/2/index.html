              <p>Agreed. Getting good results during driving test doesn't automatically qualify you as a good/safe driver.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, safe drivers may classified as "road-hoggers". Examples include stopping at least 1 car length before stop line, or stopping at least 2 cars-length behind another car, braking un-necessarily etc etc.</p>

              <p>It is like that. Even if you go to Malaysia or Thailand, Road Tax and insurance you cannot escape.</p>
              <p>Motor Insurance premium (paid yearly) is dependant on:</p>
              <p>- which company you go for</p>
              <p>- what they cover you</p>

              <p>haha.. Bro, you are mistaken about one point "Diesel is not as clean as normal petrol".</p>
              <p>In fact, the diesel technology has reached a stage that is even cleaner than the Ron98 petrol that we are using.</p>
              <p>Most of the cars registered in Europe are diesel models, because they meet the stringent Euro V emissions standard (Japan still Euro 4). Diesel cars are fuel efficient, clean and cheaper to maintain. They have an overall higher torque (example CRDI Sonata and petrol sonata). Higher torque means better acceleration, which is why you see taxis flying off as soon as the traffic light turns green.</p>
              <p>Just that our government still thinks differently, having the traditional mindset that petrol is cleaner.</p>
              <p>If the diesel tax is scrapped, I will be the first one to buy a volkswagen diesel car.</p>

              <p>Actually,</p>
              <p>from what i observe, RON 92 / 95 / 98 / VPOWER (Shell context) is all equally clean. The only different between 92, 95 and 98 is the octane number. This is achieved by additives, which have been blended into the fuel that we pump at petrol stations.</p>
              <p>Basically, VPOWER is also RON 98, just that they put in some special additives to make your car more powerful (tried before in malaysia, indeed a significant increase in power).</p>
              <p>For fuel efficiency, the usual recommended grade of petrol for most cars will be RON 95, unless you driving COE car (RON 92) or sports car (Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini), then you need VPOWER.</p>
              <p>Pumping 98 DOES NOT necessarily improve your fuel consumption. Just follow the car manual instructions and recommended fuel types and you will be good.</p>
