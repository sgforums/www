            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Jiayong. Your mum should not be on the right lane if she is not overtaking... you mentioned that the altezza could zoom off into the distance, i.e. no were no cars in front. More imptly, there were no cars on the left. Even tho your mum was travelling at the speed limit, this does not mean that she had the right to travel on the right lane.<br><br>To me, I am sorry, it seems like your mum was wrong.</div>

Remember that by right, right lanes are for over taking.<br><br>I dont know whats going on in our society whereby on expressways i have to over take pple on the left lanes. Why do drivers like to drive slow slow on right lane?</div></blockquote>Its so true... esp on Bukit timah, the speed limit there is 70km/h. Hence, you can go around 75 - 80km/h. Tons of people love to hog to overtaking lane(extreme right lane) on a 3 lane road or expressways and travel at their own pace sometimes 65 on bukit timah and just barely 80 on Expressways...<br><br>Only in Singapore, you have to overtake using the left lanes... sometimes if I have time, I would drive in front of the road hogger and drive at my own 'slow' pace... most times the person would realise it and stay on the left lane.<br><br>Which is why, in the states, currently if someone was to tailgate a road hogger from behind, the police will fine the road hogger! Singapore should enforce this law as well.<br><br>Also, the extreme right lane should only be used for overtaking, if there are no cars on the left lanes then the driver should be driving on the left lane. Otherwise, the driver should be fined for driving on the overtaking lane when there is noone to overtake. In most countries, most of the drivers in those countries know of this hidden rule and always give way to drivers.<br><br>Singapore drivers need to learn to give way more often, do you know why there is many yellow boxes on the roads? That is because without this yellow box, drivers will never give way to cars wanting to come out onto the road! Ever realize that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
