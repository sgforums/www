              <p>How many of you agree with me ?</p>
              <p>Ok i know we all are L platers once in a life time. Unless of course u intend to take bus for the rest of your life. But today i just almost got into an accident with a L plate driver! I was about to turn right and have done the normal checking of left and right. And plus in front of me is a yellow box . I saw this L plate driver about to cross me and i was about to turn right already . Then suddenly HIS CAR DIED. Heng my reaction fast i jam break. And of course i horned as long as i could .</p>
              <p>Is not that i hate all L plate drivers but some of them are just road hazards. Maybe the goverment should let all L plate learners take a test before they can really come out on the road to drive and practise. Why cant they just spend more time in the driving center circuit before coming out to the normal road.</p>
              <p>And worst of all i staying near one of such driving centers. They can really be a nuisance when you are rushing for time.</p>

              <p>even qualified drivers...when they are driving a new car,someone else's car or have started driving after passing their Class 3 some time ago...might and most probably will...have engine dying on them.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion...U are simply impatient.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>I still remember there were once they changed the car model and I am not used to the clutch pedal, I stalled my car every few minutes for the entire lesson and my instructor was sighing all the way each time I stalled my car. I can see he is fustrated but yet, helpless cause he did all he could to teach me. That moment was hilarous though I did not laugh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Stalling of engine normally only happen in the circuit  though cause I'm not very good with half-clutch technique. However, I feel that I improved alot recently. On the road, I'm usually fine.</p>
              <p>I'm still L-plate driver though, upcoming december is my test date. I wonder can I pass with my sucky driving skill. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p> Btw for the topic, if L-plate driver are not allowed on the road, what's make you think they (or we) can drive on it after we pass our test? Seriously, I rather me having problem with an instructor at my side to guide me on the road than without one.</p>

              <p><br>Well, to be truthful, i've seen the aftermath of these kinda drivers.  Never was in one such car so near to such drivers.</p>
              <p>Most drivers I know have better or similar training I got.</p>
              <p>This one just totally caught me off guard.  I would twack his head with the back of my hand, but I am not sure he wont swerved and me get wrapped around a lampost or a tree.</p>

              <p><br>If the test instructor has any sense, he will nicely write about the driver that nearly hit him and his trainee at some road.</p>
              <p>And that the driver has no manners and such that he horned the tester and the trainnee in a obvious L plate car.</p>
              <p>If it was any of my old pals doing the EPU duties, the driver is more likely to be pulled aside and stand by for a long lecture.</p>

              <p>Say whatever you will, but I can say that you don't have the temperament to be a good driver with this messed-up attitude of yours.</p>
              <p>So long as you keep this sort of attitude.... you will NEVER be a good driver.</p>
