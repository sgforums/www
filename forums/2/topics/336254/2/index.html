              <p>Private student will drive on the road instead of in the driving center.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the statistic of road accident are contributed mainly by licensed drivers, not L plate. So maybe ban all licensed drivers on road?</p>

              <p><br>I strongly suspect its a matter of moving off from first gear and the clutch released too soon.</p>
              <p>But the description of the instructor being on the side of the TS's hitting, from errr......left means that the car positions are somewhat that the turning right party is in the wrong.</p>

              <p>I trust this still is a right thread to post this.</p>
              <p>I really dislike drivers who yaya papaya.</p>
              <p>Here's one recent example:</p>
              <p>I was on a date with this unknown chap.  he picked me up from the office in his Toyota Camry.  As we are speeding to somewhere else, example Changi Village for a meal.  I say speeding is because I know we are going fast, but not at all near limit and a half.</p>
              <p>I closed my eyes and didnt borther, but he decided he needed to do conversation and it starts with: "I hope you are not frightened, I am a racer so I drive very fast."</p>
              <p>I was lazing, not worried and then asked: "have you did training for the racing at Sepang or did drift at least?"</p>
              <p>His reply: "Well no, I trained myself on the road."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats when I sat back up straight from the seat and my left hand went to grab the side door holder thingy.</p>
              <p>Technically, I 've been a  passenger in cars travelling at 160km/hr on Singapore Roads  and has gotten used to speed and those fellas that actually knows what they are doing.</p>
              <p>But a self trained racer driver on Singapore Road??!!!  I at least did a defensive driving course and successfully executed some moves in the time span that I was driving.</p>
              <p>This fella, have no training, but owns a lovely car, he is on the road and is a racer?!</p>

              some new drivers like the owner of this thread tend to be impatient...i know from experience...i bet most of us when we first got our license and started to drive to work or for work tend to be impatient at times....
              my advice...be considerate...be patient...if u know that road has a lot of L plate drivers and it slows u down then take another route...
              we as drivers have to be alert of our surroundings...it doesnt mean once u got ur FRESH license u can yayapapaya and think the road will always be at ur advantage.....
              im sorry but this is just my 2 cents worth...

              <p>Aiyo, got to be patient mah, agree L platers are inexperience and that's why they need all the space to learn and improve to be more confident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We were all L platers before and must have stepped on the toes of other drivers one time or another when we were learners. Things happen when you are a learner which will even amaze the driver themselves coz at times they might be at a lost as to wat they have to do as they do not have the experience yet to know the consequence of their action. I once did a U turn and keep my arms in the locked position which almost made me end up in the center divider afetr the move and had it not been for the driving instructor, I think I would not have obtained my DL and driving for the last 18 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simply keep a distance and be a pro-active driver, anticipate the unexpected and you would be fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Drive safe coz your luv ones are waiting for your return...... cheers. </p>

              <p>Never had problems with L platers, with their self imposed speed limit of 50km, how much of a hazard can they possibly be?</p>

              <p>How many of you agree with me ?</p>
              <p>Ok i know we all are L platers once in a life time. Unless of course u intend to take bus for the rest of your life. But today i just almost got into an accident with a L plate driver! I was about to turn right and have done the normal checking of left and right. And plus in front of me is a yellow box . I saw this L plate driver about to cross me and i was about to turn right already . Then suddenly HIS CAR DIED. Heng my reaction fast i jam break. And of course i horned as long as i could .</p>
              <p>Is not that i hate all L plate drivers but some of them are just road hazards. Maybe the goverment should let all L plate learners take a test before they can really come out on the road to drive and practise. Why cant they just spend more time in the driving center circuit before coming out to the normal road.</p>
              <p>And worst of all i staying near one of such driving centers. They can really be a nuisance when you are rushing for time.</p>

              <p>I trust this still is a right thread to post this.</p>
              <p>I really dislike drivers who yaya papaya.</p>
              <p>Here's one recent example:</p>
              <p>I was on a date with this unknown chap.  he picked me up from the office in his Toyota Camry.  As we are speeding to somewhere else, example Changi Village for a meal.  I say speeding is because I know we are going fast, but not at all near limit and a half.</p>
              <p>I closed my eyes and didnt borther, but he decided he needed to do conversation and it starts with: "I hope you are not frightened, I am a racer so I drive very fast."</p>
              <p>I was lazing, not worried and then asked: "have you did training for the racing at Sepang or did drift at least?"</p>
              <p>His reply: "Well no, I trained myself on the road."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats when I sat back up straight from the seat and my left hand went to grab the side door holder thingy.</p>
              <p>Technically, I 've been a  passenger in cars travelling at 160km/hr on Singapore Roads  and has gotten used to speed and those fellas that actually knows what they are doing.</p>
              <p>But a self trained racer driver on Singapore Road??!!!  I at least did a defensive driving course and successfully executed some moves in the time span that I was driving.</p>
              <p>This fella, have no training, but owns a lovely car, he is on the road and is a racer?!</p>

              <p><br>You mean you don't know there's a lot of such self-proclaimed racers? Especially like to proclaim in front of women. No idea what's in their mind.</p>
