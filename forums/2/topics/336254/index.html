              <p>How many of you agree with me ?</p>
              <p>Ok i know we all are L platers once in a life time. Unless of course u intend to take bus for the rest of your life. But today i just almost got into an accident with a L plate driver! I was about to turn right and have done the normal checking of left and right. And plus in front of me is a yellow box . I saw this L plate driver about to cross me and i was about to turn right already . Then suddenly HIS CAR DIED. Heng my reaction fast i jam break. And of course i horned as long as i could .</p>
              <p>Is not that i hate all L plate drivers but some of them are just road hazards. Maybe the goverment should let all L plate learners take a test before they can really come out on the road to drive and practise. Why cant they just spend more time in the driving center circuit before coming out to the normal road.</p>
              <p>And worst of all i staying near one of such driving centers. They can really be a nuisance when you are rushing for time.</p>

              <p>I like to give way to L-platers, I feel they deserve a chance to learn. If they want to change lane, I will slow down for them if the traffic conditions allow, or just change into the next lane so as to let them perform their lane change less stressfully.Â </p>
              <p>TS, you horn at him got use? You horn or don't horn, not like you can change anything right? If he already stall, don't you think by horning him, the L plater will be MORE stressed and take more time to restart engine and move off rather than you just wait awhile?</p>

              <p>Same thing happen to me. One L plate car suddenly died while on the 70km bukit batok highway road. The car directly behind him e brake.....I was like wtf.

              <p>i think the problem is maybe TS drive too close to the L plate car. anyway, when people see L plate drivers, they will anticipate and go slow. only heroes like to cut past them and not give them chance. i think they all deserve to be given a chance. i always try to let L plate drivers pass when i see them, maybe TS should too.</p>
              <p>anyway from the way TS phrase, the L plate car seems like it was coming from the opposite direction. if that's the case, TS shld wait for L plate car to complete drive past him first. no?</p>

              <p>How many of you agree with me ?</p>
              <p>Ok i know we all are L platers once in a life time. Unless of course u intend to take bus for the rest of your life. But today i just almost got into an accident with a L plate driver! I was about to turn right and have done the normal checking of left and right. And plus in front of me is a yellow box . I saw this L plate driver about to cross me and i was about to turn right already . Then suddenly HIS CAR DIED. Heng my reaction fast i jam break. And of course i horned as long as i could .</p>
              <p>Is not that i hate all L plate drivers but some of them are just road hazards. Maybe the goverment should let all L plate learners take a test before they can really come out on the road to drive and practise. Why cant they just spend more time in the driving center circuit before coming out to the normal road.</p>
              <p>And worst of all i staying near one of such driving centers. They can really be a nuisance when you are rushing for time.</p>

              <p>Same thing happen to me. One L plate car suddenly died while on
              the 70km bukit batok highway road. The car directly behind him e
              brake.....I was like wtf. Also ebrake....There was one car behind
              me. Also ebrake like siao. Luckily all three of us areÂ alert
              drivers or else, there will be a chain accident.</p>

              <p>Lots of stuff from my car fall off when i ebrake. Even The

              <p>I think he change gear to reverse gear thats why his car died. Or maybe he jam break for no reason.</p>
              <p>And while i was jam breaking my car, the instructor face was like super scared. He even moved to the driver side a bit LOL . Cause if i really langa ( choi touch wood) i`ll hit his side first .</p>

              <p>Your in front is a yellow box, you are turning right.Â  The car is crossing you from left?</p>
              <p>Please explain again the positions of the vehicles.Â  because I die die dont understand how you can jam brake at a turning area.</p>
              <p>Or unless you are drifting?</p>
              <p>1 year odd driving licence is good enough??Â  Thats a very youngish idea of someone who never experienced pain; even if its no fault of his/her.</p>
