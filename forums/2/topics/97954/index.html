These engines are not mass produces and things are done to the inner parts of the engine which are not visible by factories at Yamaha.<br>High power Vtec engine are certainly specially done, the above information are derived from AutoZine article.<br><br>8 yrs ago 20valve 1.6 toyota engine 4A-GE 20v are creating some 170hp....  This is the most powerful and well know 1.6 engine THEN at Japan and was cap in a Levin, Trueno and later on  AE111 Corollas.</div>
