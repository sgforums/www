He was 61.Brock died when his car crashed into a tree about 25 miles north of Perth during the Targa West rally, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Brock dominated Australian auto racing for three decades before retiring from the touring car circuit in 1997. He made a couple of brief comebacks and at one stage owned a racing team. -- Associated Press<br><br>Brock Â– stunned Aussie motorsport reacts<br>09 September 2006<br><br>The motorsport fraternity has reacted as one to the tragic death of the undisputed King of the Mountain.<br><br>When it came to the legendary race driver they call Peter Perfect, rivalries were forgotten, Ford and Holden's battle for supremacy became just another race Â– it was simple, awe-struck respect and admiration.<br><br>With nine Bathurst wins behind him, he holds a record that will not ever be beaten by a mere mortal.<br><br>He also won the Sandown Endurance race nine times and was the first driver to win the sport's Triple Crown: Bathurst, Sandown and the Australian touring car title in the same year.<br><br>And this is why so many of Peter Brock's peers have come out to pay their respects Â– when he drove, it was something exceptional, whether you were a fan, or trying to beat him to turn one.<br><br>"I am devastated. Peter was more than just a teammate to me; he was a mentor and a friend. He taught me an enormous amount about racing and about life. It's a terrible loss. I can't believe it." Craig Lowndes<br><br>"It's an absolute tragedy. Peter was a tremendous competitor on the track, tough but always fair, and a decent bloke off it. I don't think it's really hit me yet. I can't believe we've lost two Aussie icons in one week. Both Peter and Steve Irwin were both friends of mine." Dick Johnson<br><br>"I remember the very first touring car race I had and I lined up alongside him on the grid. When I looked across and saw that I was on the grid next to Peter Brock, I knew I had made it.I was fortunate to race with and against him and learnt an immense amount from his approach to motorsport. Peter always made time for his fans and understood how important it was to spend time with them and what they meant to our industry. At his best, Brock was the ultimate racing driver. A classic example was Bathurst in 1979 when he won by six laps and broke the lap record on the last lap." Mark Skaife<br><br>"I just can't believe it. He gave me so much help in all aspects when I was young and impressionable. All he ever wanted to do was to help. At Bathurst in 1997 I was the right wheel changer on his Commodore for what was going to be his last Bathurst. I was more nervous changing that wheel than I've ever been in a race car. He had a huge impact on my life and was an incredible mentor." Rick Kelly<br><br>"Peter really made car racing what it is today. He was professional years ahead of anyone else and his record in the championship and Bathurst clearly shows that. He was an icon. Peter was one of the toughest racers on the track. However, away from the track he was a great bloke. He was always generous in his support for other drivers. For me he was always a great helping hand and it's those attributes that I will remember the most." Glenn Seton<br><br>"I am deeply shocked. I enjoyed a great relationship with Peter Brock and there isn't a racing driver here who is not aware of the major impact and contribution that he has made to our sport. His record behind the wheel and his constant interaction with the fans has helped to grow this sport enormously. His loss is unbelievable." Jason Bright<br><br>"Peter Brock was a childhood hero of mine, as I am sure he was for many young and aspiring racing drivers. It is sad to lose anyone Â– let alone a legend in the sport like he was. His loss will be deeply felt by everyone involved in motor racing." Mark Winterbottom<br><br>AdvertisementAdvertisement"Peter was a fantastic legend of motor sport. He was one of the most inspiring drivers ever seen in this country." Ron Walker chairman Australian GP<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Richard was a life cut short, Colin, despite at one time having the most wins, only took one c'ship. Probably they weren't in the strongest cars at the right time for much of their careers.</div>
