Once I was driving a sunny SS at 120kmh on the highway, the kelisa overtake me in seconds on my right..........gone in a couple of sec.....wonder what is under that bonnet.<br><br>Any way, i had met nasty drivers in m'sia as well....those ah beng one lah...generally they are better driver compared to spore. Just need to look at the cause way when having heavy jam you will know.<br><br>Some of them also can tail gate along the NS highway at a speed of &gt;120kph......and i mean real close tail gate......<br><br>we do that here, the next moment you might see some funny flashes from your back and the next thing you know, you are in candy camera.....</div>
