If they say can't claim 100%, it is mainly due to an over-priced quotations claim.<br>Let say the actual repair cost is about 8k, when the workshop file for a claim, they will always add in more so in the end they may be claiming for 10k.<br><br>But no matter wat, the workshop still wins, they reap the most benefit. Dun bring to car agent, they will not give you free upgrades, if you want, go outside shop, if you are not sure, PM me and I can let you know some contacts. hehe..<br><br></div>

It depends on how good the repo with the surveyor is. Coz in the end is the surveyor who will submit the report.<br><br>Just need to know that if bring to workshop outside, you can get 1k worth of goodies.<br><br>Judging from how you describe the damage, most probably is that front bumper and boot kenna. These 2 does not affect the car drive. As long as never hit the bearing hub, drive shaft, engine, suspension, etc it should be ok.<br>But 1 thing for sure, you will see 2 colour coating on your car body, unless the paint shop does a very good work. But I dun think so. Ask the workshop help you respray the whole car exterior as a bonous. But no free goodies anymore... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

But what if the last car only bang the 4th car, and the rest in front he is not at fault.<br><br>The last car jammed brakes and bang only into the 4th car. If this is the car, will there be a case to fight in court ? The damage of the last car is very minimum. which can prove that the small damage cannot cause the chain accident.<br><br>Anyone pls advice.<br><br>Thks<br>Jack</div>
