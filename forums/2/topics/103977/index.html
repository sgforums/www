            <div class='col-md body'>Are there any people out there with reliable sources?<br><br>From what I gather from keeping up with the news. I think COE prices has already reached its lowest point ever. So, logically speaking, we can expect it to start rising anytime from now.<br><br>The car population has also increased due to the buying frenzy recently but my intuition tells me that COE prices would still hover at around 20k-22k (below 16000 cc category) till the end of Chinese New Year after which COE proces will sky-rocket back up to prevent too many people from buying any more.<br><br>Therefore, my guess is that this period - Nov 2004-Jan 2005 - would be the best time to get a brand new car.<br><br>Any opinion on this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the living standard in singapore is getting higher each day.... with the GST at 5% now. everthing is more exp than ever. Everything is just going up except our petite salary.... owning a car in singapore is only for those richer ppl (my opinion).... its just too exp to maintain a car...<br><br>Imagine apart frm the installments, car park, u stil hav to set aside some money every year for car maintenance, car tyres, ERP, rising car park fees, etc....<br>That explains for the increasing number of ppl scraping their cars, its just going to lock their finances... even taking cabs is cheaper...<br><br>So i tink the COE price is going to stay put for some time until the economy really picks up... things will change after.</div>
