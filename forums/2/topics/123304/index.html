            <div class='col-md body'>Just last week, there was an article on the newspaper that says Taxi drivers are involved in the bulk of the accident on Singapore road (despite only making up 4% of the vehicle on the road?).<br><br>Last night at around 10pm, driving to Woodlands on BKE.<br><br>Typical night after a long day at work... the information board above reading "ACCIDENT ON LANE 3". I told myself, "just another accident". Saw the police car and lights, drove pass... and...<br><br>a motorbike down on the road... 10 metres in front was a taxi... just in front of a taxi was a dead body. Two policemen were holding up a white plastic sheet, trying to shield the sight from the public eyes.<br><br>I ride too, so it's very disturbing... This man/woman was probably riding home after a long day's work but he/she is now dead.<br><br>Sorry for behaving this way, it has been a while since I last saw a dead motorbike rider out in the open. For all I know, he could be a friend of ours.<br><br>I am not judging the taxi driver, he probably didn't see it coming. I myself drive tired at times and I came close to touching bikers too. We must remember, one touch on them, their skin will be on the road; how serious, depends...<br><br>I urge all readers to give bikers some respect, if not take into the consideration that, if given a choice, they want to drive too (like myself).<br><br>Disturbed<br>Vincent<br><br></div>

Most bikers complained about cars not giving way. But when you ask them where they are riding, it is usually in between lanes. I didn't get a bike license, so I don't know what they actually teach there. Do they teach riding in between lanes and cars?<br><br>When I argued that that is not supposed to be the way to ride, then my friend say that is the result people get bike, to sway in and out of Jams.<br><br>I only learn recently that you want to go fast, you better be prepared to stop in time, the hard way. But this way will usually be the last thing the bikers learn. E-brake at 50km/h would already flip the bikes, imagine what it is like at 100km/h.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a fren who have a bike can car licence. Hr drives a lau pok car and quite a good bike. I think I agree with him.<br><br>What he says is that because he has driven both, he knows how each party feels. I think Bikers should never do the following 2 things:<br><br>1) stay so close to the car in front (esp at nite). At nite its most dangerous as if you stay so close that the car cannot see ur headlight in the mirror, u are going to die if he just tap the brake and u cant blame him cos he cant see u.<br><br>2) Stop riding in between 2 lanes. This should be done only when overtaking. Otherwise stay in middle of one lane just like a car would do.  Riding in the middle of the lane causes uncertainty for the cars because they do not know whether to proceed as they scare will kena u. It may also cause them to sway and waver in their own lanes. It causes stress to the drivers.<br><br>One thing is certain. Everyone wants to live and be on the road safely. Sometimes u cannot blame anyone if bikers die. On the road, it is no longer who is wrong or right. To put it across, who have more to lose? I knock u down, i get to live. But u die. It is not being Kuai Lan or what but this is a reality. If bikers realise this fact, then they should ride safely and patiently and not make their families worry for them.</div>

It is safe to travel slightly faster than cars. But not speeding or tail gating please.<br><br>When I am driving, I am the kitten of the road.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wbucket:</div><div class="quote_body">True! Most bikers complained about cars not giving way. But when you ask them where they are riding, it is usually in between lanes. I didn't get a bike license, so I don't know what they actually teach there. Do they teach riding in between lanes and cars?<br><br>When I argued that that is not supposed to be the way to ride, then my friend say that is the result people get bike, to sway in and out of Jams.<br><br>I only learn recently that you want to go fast, you better be prepared to stop in time, the hard way. But this way will usually be the last thing the bikers learn. E-brake at 50km/h would already flip the bikes, imagine what it is like at 100km/h.</div></blockquote>I ride in the middle of the lane and cars still try to squeeze me out.  Worse still was this car that actually knocked my rear wheel.<br><br>Anyway answering your queries, in school they teach the narrow plank which is basically balancing your bike while moving at a slow speed.  Look at this another way it is to teach us to maneuver in a traffic jam or red light but not when the traffic is moving.<br><br>A bike can't flip over at 50km/h, if that was to happen the rider wasn't e-braking properly.  And I always say, people who e-brake are not good riders on the road.  Why must you e-brake in the first place?</div>
