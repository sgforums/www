Must have a bit of cash at hand just in case something come up. Picanto is a decent car, if you are not power-hungry. Nice FC for the budget minded (manual 15-17km/L). But of course, all those talks about korean car being lousy is because of their quality issue. You have to be really unlucky to get those lousy ones. Generally all should run fine and serve its purpose. But don't get the auto one, very weak. Consider Getz if you plan to get budget auto car. Or if you don't mind the small-ness of kelisa, why not? Kelisa is known to be strong with its manual and auto version.</div>

Of cos cannot conpare to those big cars but noise intrusion is low. The car do feel rather laggy during run in period but after that the car's pickup and acceleration increased. You have to really drive the car top know the feeling. Picanto is made for the young so it's made to look cute, so not having a classy look like swift or even sporty like Vios. But come to think of it's the best in picanto is the FC, so for those who place FC as top priority would consider picanto a good buy.<br><br>Those are juz my personal views. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

FC ranges from 15.2(latest) to 17.2 (first).<br><br>First tanks drive very conservatively, so FC quite good for a brand new car. 4 year never drive, so scare scare.<br><br>Now I am at the last part of running in, so rev until 5000rpm and more, just did a 90km/L at 3rd gear. So FC so lousy. Also I am taking right lane most of the time now.<br><br>After run-in, I will try a no-aircon, no more than 3000rpm record and see if with my lousy driving skill can I hit 20km/L.<br><br>Full tanks pump about 30L, about 500km mileage. Why you guys always use the tank as a guide? The fuel used is so inaccurate. I always calculate the mileage divided by fuel pumped method.</div>

ABS......never drive for so long, got or not also cannot feel, just don't drive too fast to avoid the need to e-brake can already. No airbag, same thing, don't drive too fast lah. Slow collision doesn't requires a airbag to save your life, fast one, I think air bag also doesn't help.<br><br>After 3 years breakdown, I think that piece of info very hard to verify, since Picanto only out for 1-2years. Anyway, since you are also interested in Kelisa, we are having a little meeting at Kallang Mac carpark on the 17th this month, Thursday. Do come and have a look. <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/Kelisa/start" rel="nofollow">Singapore Kelisa Club</a>. For Picanto, i think is <a href="http://www.sgkiaclub.com" rel="nofollow">Sg kia club</a>.</div>

New here, only 3000km old. My kelisa is blue, but in the future plans to spray it orange. Picanto comes with a lot of colours, have fun choosing. Do get the manual version though, cause picanto auto very weak.<br><br>It is easier to switch from manual to auto, than auto to manual.</div>
