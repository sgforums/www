He came right in and put us all down. If he had came in and explained nicely why pilots can't afford it, I would have listened. But when he/she comes right in and flame, I can't help but flame him/her back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally believe being a pilot alone cant make you afford a supercar, at least to a wise person. unless you are willing to throw all you got for a car that drives you 10 years, rather than spending it on others. and you are also indirectly givin' an idea to your company saying they are OVERPAYING you.<br><br>but it would totally be another different story if the person knows how to manage and had external investment. but again, it can happen to anyone to meet these opportunities &amp; lucks to be successful. not only pilot.</div>
