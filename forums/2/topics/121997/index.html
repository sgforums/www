            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all replies and the comments.. Owning a car is already so expensive in singapore.. the last thing you want is to get cheated by cunning and shrewd car mechanics.. I am a victim before, hence I hope this book will minimize you of being a victim..

Of course selling the book through internet will contradict my example above. If the book can earn its way into the bookstores, then I think it may worth a try.</div>
