So no Getz in Singapore unless miraculously fitted with an Evo engine can beat a Rex! Whoever said that earlier is a cuckoo (Scroll up to see this wierdo) The fella who started this thread is also a crazy as@ dimwitt. If u drive a Vtec or Type R then u can upsell the name of Honda lah... not with a Jazz.. to us many real racers, its not the make, its the model and the driver, and ur Jazz is just as bad as the Getz, so next time u see him wearing a glove, u take out ur helmet and wear also lah so both of u can race and max out at 120km/h while we real racers smoke u at 220km/h.... How? Sound like a plan?...<br><br>U make me laugh till my right tit turned purple...</div></blockquote>Dont come here and boast that you are a real racer..Boast all you want.Nobody will believe you.<br><br>Wow..Ur tit turned purple.Must be a freak.Yuck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>I was the one who said that Getz could be modified to run.  And I said it because I saw before lah.<br><br>On the NSH, at Melaka, I saw 2 Rexes and 1 Getz come out from the rest area.  Probably friends, after a highway stop coffee break.  They were maybe around 10-15 cars' length ahead of me when they came onto the NSH.  Thats when the 3 of them sprinted - and from afar, I could see that 3 of them were still together.  Then they disappeared and I don't know what happened after that.<br><br>I don't know if they were Singaporean or Malaysian cars.  Obviously, I also don't know what kind of engine or modifications they had, etc.  I can't even remember what colours the cars were.<br><br>Actually, with enough money and the guts to take risks, any car can be modified to go fast mah.  Its just how much guts the driver has and how long the car will last.<br><br>I have no money and no guts, and most of all I treasure my life and my family's lives, so I don't modify anything and drive at my own pace lor.  I've never raced and I don't intend to start either.  I've never thought that racing (or the ability to talk about it extensively, or the ability to talk down to those who talk about it) made a man more macho or attractive either.  So long as they don't bang into me can already.<br><br>Even Bas Sekolah also overtook me at Cameron Highlands, around the bend somemore!  Maybe he drop in two Evo engines lah....one for the front wheels, one for the back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>(I'd better make this clear:  the part about having two Evo engines in the Bas Sekolah was a joke).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup its been done, i myself have seen a B18C inside a getz so a the rumoured B20B I've heard so much about shouldn't be an impossibility, transmission also lifted from a civic, chassis can be seam welded in JB at a very cheap cost extra space from shifting the battery to the rear. the 1.6M Getz had in essence alot of space to begin, not as cluttered as the 1.3/1.4<br></div>
