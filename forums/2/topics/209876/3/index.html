He installed a turbo with a front-mount intercooler, changed his fuel pump, exhaust, changed rims, upgraded to 4-pot front brakes, etc etc, did the whole works.....but a few weeks later, his auto gear went.  So he replaced it with a stronger auto gear and that went too, after a few months.  Then he converted to manual and his engine block went.  Then he replaced his engine with a bigger capacity (with numbers chiselled in, etc) and the story went on.....till he finally gave up and scrapped his car before it was even 5 years old.  I believe he decided to scrap also because he couldn't find a stock 1.6TS setup for LTA inspections.  hahahaha.....stupid guy, didn't plan properly.<br><br>He doesn't go racing, but some people are just addicted to mods (kind of a hobby).  Finally, he admitted to me......after spending between $20k-$30k, it would've been smarter to just buy a WRX, and make it look like a TS instead (mod downwards instead of upwards).<br><br>There are advantages of knowing such people - before he left Singapore two weeks ago for a 2-year overseas posting, he sold me his replica rims at quite a cheap price. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
