            <div class='col-md body'>Is it wise to take a full loan for a second hand car? how much will the interest be? Looking at buying a s14, any idea where can i get a good deal?<br><br>current pay packet tells me that i can afford prolly 600 a mth on installments. Plus miscellaneous shld come close to 1k. Is this the average you think?<br><br>Hearsay, second loans close to 5% - 7%, I saw some financial loans at 2.5% for 10 years, but not sure the sale center allows you to get your own car loan.<br><br>Just missed out on a 2001 Skyline, (not sure which model) at 49K. Wld that be a good deal?<br><br>I want a car.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a new car. Small car, low maintainences, good FC. I have problem capping it at S$500 per month. I think you should at least allocate S$700 for mis++ for this car. Taking full loan for second-hand car was never adviseable unless you are rich, can afford to change car every 2-3 years. Search <a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com" rel="nofollow">Sg car mart</a> for a estimate of the car you want to get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Second hand car loans are usually slightly above those of brand new cars.  At the moment, the interest for used cars is around 2.65-3.00% per annum.<br><br>Be careful with the per annum interest rates though....if you calculated the total interest, you'd be surprised how much it actually comes to.  For example, if you took a loan for $50k over 7 years, the total interest paid is actually over S$10k!  Thats a lot of good money down the drain.<br><br>Depending on your situation, its not always advisable (in fact, usually unadvisable) to take a loan for too long a term.  If anything happens to the car (and it sometimes WILL), you can't get rid of it.  Lots of people have been caught by this before.<br><br>Take for example that you buy a car for $50k, and take a 6 year loan for $50k:<br><br>- At 3% flat interest, total amount payable in 6 years is $59k!<br>- Each month for 6 years, you'll have to pay $820 in instalment.<br>- After 2 years, you would have paid around $20k.<br>- This leaves S$(59-20) = S$39k left, owed to the bank.<br><br>Now, assuming that you need to sell it after 2 years of ownership, for whatever reason, you will have to immediately pay the bank S$39k.  But after two years, you may only be able to sell/scrap the car for S$25-30k.  This means that you have to top up with your own money to S$39 to pay the bank.<br><br>This is all personal preference, but for me, I try to dump in as much downpayment as I can afford and settle my fully loan in 3 years, if possible.  This will allow me to be more financially free....I don't wanna become a "yes, sir" slave at work, fearing to lose my job, fear my boss, colleagues, customers, etc.  In other words, a loan is actually a weakness created for oneself.  Living in Singapore, we can't get away from loans.....but at least we can reduce them and manage them in a less risky manner.<br><br>Note also that there are many hidden costs in buying used cars.  LTA fees for change of ownership can come up to over $1000 (depending on the value of the car).  Repairs/maintenance just after taking over a used car can also easily come up to a few hundred bucks, if not much more (depending on the condition and how fussy you are).   Then there is road tax, parking, ERP, petrol, etc etc).<br><br>Also, if you get a sports car like Skyline, insurance will be a killer (could be as much as $1500-2000 per year).  Remember also that sports cars (and branded cars) will also usually need super high maintenance (fuel, repairs/maintenance, tyres, brakes, accessories, other mods, etc).<br><br>For my humble current vehicle, the cost of ownership PER MONTH currently (insurance, fuel, repairs/maintenance, road tax, depreciation, ERP, parking, traffic fines <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , etc) is almost $2000!<br><br>Basically, if you're not driving now and used to taking public transport..... er....then better not to buy a car if you don't need one.  Cos once you start driving, you're stuck (like me) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Its all still finally up to you though.  Being a car lover myself, I know how tempting it can be.  Here's wishing you luck...hoping you'll make the best choice for your own lifestyle.<br><br></div>
