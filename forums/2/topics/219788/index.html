            <div class='col-md body'>hope to get some feedback on if this is normal. am quite baffled.<br><br>was entering the expressway at 80-90 and was on the left-most lane. didn't notice that (apparently deep) puddles of water have formed up at the side due to the rain.<br><br>was really caught out when the front end suddenly swayed to the left. apparently the left wheels had gone deep into the puddle. does aquaplaning occur so easily?<br><br>yes perhaps the tyres being yokohama aspec db are more on the comfort &gt; performance side, but am still quite shocked by the ease of the loss of grip. ride is a 2003 camry, which should be quite a heavy body. furthermore was ferrying 4 people.<br><br>i have also experienced on wet roads when the front driven wheels spin off traction from stop-go (esp when the wheels are turned at an angle). at most higher than average, far from the extent of flooring acceleration.</div>
