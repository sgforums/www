              <p>For me, simple reason.</p>
              <p>1. Our public transport system fails. I don't want to be packed like sardines in a rectangular-6-segment box.</p>
              <p>2. I prefer to face traffic jams in comfort, rather than sweaty human jams.</p>

              <p>Yr income also play apart. Don't tell me those 2k per month salary guy can still get a 100k loan in 10 years. loan company are no idiot. Car are depriciate stuff and not like house, confiscated it and sell it at higher or original price.</p>

              <p>I would rather drive and stay in the comfort of the car and music than to squeeze with others in train or bus. Not to mention that the waiting time and the crowd is rather... unbearable.</p>

              <p><br>Somtimes, driving can be no fun. Ass driver cut yr way. Stupid traffic jam.</p>
              <p>I onced meet a friend in City hall at 7pm. He was late for 30 mins even he left the company earlier.</p>
              <p>Parking is another major problem. People already start digging in their lunch and you are still there trying to find a parking lot.</p>

              <p>cos' it is unpractical when you have to spend 1hr each waiting for a bloody bus to work and back from work.</p>
              <p>the mrt is squeezy, but at least it is punctual. for people who have to rely to buses, it is much more convenient to drive to work. for example in bukit panjang/upper bukit timah area, some smrt services like 171, 67 takes at least 30 mins to arrive during peak hour.</p>
              <p>car ownership will decrease, but thats mostly those who are super rich. e.g. families with more than 1 cars. these are the people most likely to sell off their extra cars.</p>
              <p>for the average family, families with double income would most likely suck thumb and stay on with a family car.</p>
              <p>as a result, there will be no visible improvement in the condition of the road, since each family who has a car, will still have a car, despite the higher cost.</p>

              Yr income also play apart. Don't tell me those 2k per month
              salary guy can still get a 100k loan in 10 years. loan company are
              no idiot. Car are depriciate stuff and not like house,
              confiscated it and sell it at higher or original price.</div>

              <p>Many those barely make it guy will be squeeze out of this car
              ownership. Definitely, car ownership will drop.</p>

              <p>I surely agree that there will be people squeezed out of the market with higher car prices.</p>
              <p>But my point is that the high COE prices mean that demand is still higher than supply. So we will still have a growth of 1.5%.</p>
              <p>The installment for a $100K loan over 10 years today should be about $1K a month. Loan companies may well approve such loans for someone earning $2K a month since they won't expect him to be earning this for the rest of 10 years... </p>

              <p><br>Its funny yr explanation are so flaw. You expect him to have a job for next 10 years with such high uncertainty nowadays? Maybe  occupation as teacher or sign on SAF.</p>
              <p>As I say, they are no idiot. Hauling back those car will not do them good since car are no great asset. 2k per month 100k loan for 10 years.. Ya maybe yr father loan company but not others.</p>
