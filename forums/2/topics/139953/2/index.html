If only all drivers have your mentality, there would be less fatalities on our roads. People should learn from pisces8 this driving mentality. If someone tailgate you don't pursposely road hog. If someone road hog, don't purposely tailgate him. If someone wants to race with you, don't race with him. Call the police immediately. Such aggressive actions are deplorable and endanger other road users. When such drivers are encountered on the road, do not take the law into your own hands as it may escalate into violence. Call the police immediately and they will be eradicated from our roads.<br><br></div>

If the speed limit is 90 km/h, nobody should be going faster than that anyhow. I won't call it roadhogging if someone is already driving close to the speed limit. Speed limits are there for a purpose.<br><br>Once I was on a road with a 40 km/h limit cos' it has many turns and steep slopes. I was going just below the limit but there was this fella tailgating me. I purposely slowed down further, knowing the idiot will overtake me even though we were at a bend and going up an incline. He did overtake me and crashed head-on with a car coming the other way. The fella broke his leg and had neck injury. I told the court later that the driver deserved it and the judge agreed.</div>

Your UK driving instructor teaches a correct tactic on the premises that you keep to the left lane and leave the right most lane for overtaking.<br><br>If it is a single lane with double white lines separating the up and down lane, you should have maintain the speed limit till you pass that stretch to another section of the road with more than one lane, then keep to the left lane allowing others to overtake on your right (if you insist in driving at your legal speed).<br></div>
