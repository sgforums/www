            <div class='col-md body'>To buy a car just with a 1.3k income is really mad. Unless ur dad is paying it for you. If not, u should never never buy an EVO just based on ur current income. IMHO, with 1.3k income, MRT would be the best Transport.<br><br>You must understand that after u buy a car, the value of the car decreases every year. Not like a house, price might increase or decrease. Buying a car cannot be seen as an investment!<br><br>Cars r a luxury. Especially performance models which cost much more.<br><br>But again... if u have a rich dad who intends to get it for you.. then..... U better work harder and prepare to suffer in the future when u are on ur own. 1.3k income with an EVO9... Slave of cars (from other forumites)... very true...<br><br>All the best man...</div>
