            <div class='col-md body'>$150,000 car with a $40,000 deposit. That's a $110,000 loan. After 5 years, you probably would have paid roughly $115,000 back. Not to mention the fuel, servicing, road tax, change of tyres, parts, mods, parking, fines, spray paint, touch-ups etc.<br><br>That's a total of $200,000 down the drain. How much you would have saved (or deficit) by the end of 5 years is another question.<br><br>$200,000 can be used to buy a more economical car and the rest, invested. Only when income permits, then afford the Evo.</div>
