            <div class='col-md body'>hello ppl! So have you guys seen races (illegally of course) on highways or on normal streets? Say it out... we can say our 'live' experience also... for fun peace joy and laughter and for the sake of a new topic! hahahah!!!<br><br>as for my case... recently last week, I saw a race on the highway between a Hyundai Accent (modded) and a Silvia S13. I didnt know who wins but for sure they are driving around 160km/h approx. coz im driving around 100km/h that time... they just come in from the left lane (hyundai) and the right most lane (nissan) and zoom past me like a rocket....at SLE<br><br>well i dont know if the other drivers buay song or wat... the one which i had a good time with is tagging a nice volkswagen cabby Tdi in my fren's WRX... playing along with the bugger till he pointed middle finger at me i dont know why...... then the car that im driving show him what is blowoff...and zoom!!! at mandai road. I love my frens car but too bad that night i returned it to him. I had fun driving it. My fren say the cabby cannot chase although its turbocharge its heavy...i didnt know much abt the vehicle lah... is it heavy?? or its just a 60km/h sticker?</div>

So have you guys seen races (illegally of course) on highways or on normal streets? Say it out... we can say our 'live' experience also... for fun peace joy and laughter and for the sake of a new topic! hahahah!!!<br><br>as for my case... recently last week, I saw a race on the highway between a Hyundai Accent (modded) and a Silvia S13. I didnt know who wins but for sure they are driving around 160km/h approx. coz im driving around 100km/h that time... they just come in from the left lane (hyundai) and the right most lane (nissan) and zoom past me like a rocket....at SLE<br><br>well i dont know if the other drivers buay song or wat... the one which i had a good time with is tagging a nice volkswagen cabby Tdi in my fren's WRX... playing along with the bugger till he pointed middle finger at me i dont know why...... then the car that im driving show him what is blowoff...and zoom!!! at mandai road. I love my frens car but too bad that night i returned it to him. I had fun driving it. My fren say the cabby cannot chase although its turbocharge its heavy...i didnt know much abt the vehicle lah... is it heavy?? or its just a 60km/h sticker?</div></blockquote>saw a GTI swift and a 3 door civic race along orchard b4. tats was about 2am when the civic lost control and overturned right b4 my eyes. anyway the GTI got away and the driver came out with a cut on his head. and the best part is he was more concerned for his car then his gf still trapped inside. he was actually calling out for his car. 'my car, my car' wat a farking loser. i had to help carry his gf out while he just sit there watch his farking car. this was by the way few years back. his gf was unconsious. dunno wat happened to her after tat.</div>
