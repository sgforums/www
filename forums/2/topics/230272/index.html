I was lucky. You should call and ask them if the promotion is still on-going. The workmanship is perfect. Nothing to complain about.

            <div class='col-md body'>03 camry, but it's my dad's ride not mine. i call it my ride only if i earn it myself haha.<br><br>ya i guess they're experienced to know that there's some degree of scratch-proof for the window glass. i believe this is fine as long as they keep the knives off the paintwork lol.<br><br>anyway we decided to do the 25% visible light transmission all round, except the windscreen at 70%. LTA compliance is 70% front / 25% rear. my old man complained it's not as nice to be 2-tone lol.<br><br>maybe for the next inspection, go back and spend $80 to redo the 'failed' front door windows, or hopefully govt lax up regulations by then lol.</div>
