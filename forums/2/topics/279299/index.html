Mercedes-Benz decided to answer that in the affirmative, showing off numerous diesel-electric hybrids at the 2007 Frankfurt auto show. Because diesel engines and electric motors duplicate their most efficient performance bands, high torque at low RPMs, Mercedes-Benz found a small hybrid system was all that was needed on its Bluetec diesel electrics, rather than the more robust two-mode system coming out on its ML450 and S400.<br><br>In 2010, Mercedes-Benz will launch the E300 and the S300, both cars using a Bluetec 2.2-liter four-cylinder diesel engine complemented by a 20-horsepower electric motor. Both cars will also get a seven-speed automatic transmission. The S300 will go from 0 to 62 mph in 8.4 seconds and get 44 mpg. After 2010, Mercedes-Benz has the C300 and the S400 up its sleeve. The C300 will use the same hybrid powertrain as the E300 and S300, but due to its lighter weight, it will go to 62 mph in 7.2 seconds and get 51 mpg. The S400 will use Mercedes-Benz's 3.2-liter turbocharged V-6 diesel and, with its hybrid system, hit 62 mph in 7.3 seconds while getting 41 mpg.<br><br><strong>Jaguar XF keeps concept tech</strong><br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070912/jaguarxf01_270x193.jpg"> <img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070912/jaguarxf02_270x193.jpg"><br><br>We were surprised that Jaguar got its production XF ready in time for the 2007 Frankfurt auto show, as the c-XF concept was just unveiled at last season's auto shows. Concept to production usually takes a couple of years, and you lose most of the cooler features from the concept. But not in the case of the Jaguar XF. Even though its exterior received plenty of criticism on the Internet for being too bland once photos were released, the production XF looks just like its concept predecessor. The XF is the first sedan in Jaguar's new design language, a style initially used in the new and widely acclaimed XK coupe.<br><br>The XF will be available March, 2008, with four engine choices. It can be had with a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6, a 3-liter V-6, a 4.2-liter V-8, and a supercharged 4.2-liter V-8. The diesel probably won't be available in the U.S. The production car keeps many of the interior touches seen in the concept, such as a start button that pulses red when you get in the car. It also has the dial-type transmission mode selector for its six speed automatic. Yes, Jaguar is doing away with the J-gate in favor of a rotary system. The dial is a space saver, however, and it's all you really need with a modern automatic transmission. You can manually select gears with steering-wheel-mounted paddles.<br><br>The dashboard electronics use the same cool interface as the Jaguar XK. The LCD touch screen has well-designed buttons in a row along the left. Touch one, and the buttons slide out of the way to reveal whichever function you've chosen. Jaguar brings iPod integration, a USB drive port, and a simple auxiliary audio input into the XF's array of audio sources. The top-end stereo system available for the XF is a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium surround-sound system with 440 watts of power.<br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070912/jaguarxf03_270x192.jpg"><br><br><strong>The Reventon strikes back</strong> - <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-9777389-48.html?tag=head" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-9777389-48.html?tag=head</a><br>Lambo Reventon already covered in existing thread.<br><br><strong>Mercedes-Benz F700 research vehicle</strong> - <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-9777044-48.html?tag=head" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-9777044-48.html?tag=head</a><br>Mercedes-Benz F700 already covered in existing thread.<br><br><strong>German hybrids</strong><br><br>At the 2007 Frankfurt auto show, German automakers had hybrid cars and concepts on display.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GM goes electric in Frankfurt</strong><br><br>We're not convinced about the wisdom of this one. GM is using this week's Frankfurt auto show to reiterate its commitment to alternative fuel cars with the unveiling of the Opel Flextreme, a concept plug-in car that builds on the buzz of the E-Flex drive train from the Chevy Volt. The car itself relies on a series hybrid drive train, which combines a lithium-ion powered-electric motor with a biodiesel combustion engine that is used solely for running the electric motor when the battery's charge runs out.<br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/IMG_2269_270x202.JPG"> <img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/IMG_2265_270x202.JPG"><br><br>However, as blue-sky as the vehicle's power train may be (lithium-ion batteries have a long way to go before they're ready for production vehicles), that is not the main cause of our concern. What troubles us is the fact that the GM has integrated two Segways into the back of the Flextreme--presumably to highlight its electric-mobility message. Now, we're no marketing mavens, but we suspect that a company trying to promote a fledgling technology would try to avoid association with a device that ended up falling--commercially and physically--flat on its face.<br><br><strong>The very flexible Opel Flextreme</strong><br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/flextreme01_270x193.jpg"><br><br>GM goes flex-crazy with the Flextreme concept, throwing around its new favorite marketing term like a flexy flexible flyer. This Opel-branded concept runs on GM's new E-Flex powertrain. It has FlexDoors for the passengers and a FlexLoad rear gate. But the only thing anyone will pay attention to are the two nonflex Segways stowed in the rear.<br><br><strong>Mercedes-Benz onslaught</strong><br><br>As we reported earlier, Mercedes-Benz promised 19 cars in 15 minutes at the 2007 Frankfurt auto show, and damn if they didn't deliver. The German automakers press conference resulted in a fleet of cars out on the show floor. As one might expect, Frankfurt is a huge auto show for Mercedes-Benz--the company gets a whole concert hall in the fair grounds to show off its cars. It filled the lower level of the hall with everything from the new F700 research vehicle to the Smart Micro-Hybrid. There were also quite a few variations on the hybrid theme, from regular gas-electric hybrids, such as the ML450 SUV, to diesel-electric hybrids, such as the C300 wagon.<br><br>We will follow up with more detailed information on these models in our continuing coverage from the 2007 Frankfurt auto show.<br><br><strong>Up with Volkswagen</strong><br><br>Volkswagen dropped a bomb at the 2007 Frankfurt auto show in the form of an unexpected little concept called Up. Actually, it's more of a grenade, as the Up is a city car--small but able to hold four people. What makes the Up interesting is that the engine is in the rear, a configuration Volkswagen used with the original beetle. And from its press materials, Volkswagen suggests that the Up could be as iconic. That remains to be seen. Although we like the clean look of the Up, it doesn't stray far from the Golf's design.<br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/VWUP01_270x202.jpg"> <img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/VWUP02_270x202.jpg"><br><br>It uses some interesting innovations to take advantage of the space inside. First, all of the seats except the driver's seat are removable, to make lots of cargo space. But, since the seats are thin, they can be stacked in the car without taking up all the extra space. The padding on the seats is inflatable, so they are supposed to adjust to whoever is sitting in them. Because the engine is in the rear, there's some storage space under the hood.<br><br>The tech interface in the Up is particularly interesting. The driver gets an 8-inch LCD in the instrument cluster, which shows vital car information. A 7-inch LCD sits on the center stack and has controls for music, navigation, telephones, and other car functions. The center LCD has a proximity sensor and will show available functions when you put your hand near it. For accessing different functions, it has what Volkswagen calls the main menu carousel, a set of icons that slide across the screen until you see the function you want and tap it.</div>

Even stranger, it's a Civic Hybrid, not a car you see on the NASCAR circuit. This Civic Hybrid, the accompanying placard informed us, has been entered in the 2007 Nurburgring 24-hour race. That got our attention.<br><br>Honda considers its finish of 108th out of 220 teams starting a "sensational result." We will give them that. Twenty-four hours of laps around the Nurburgring, one of the world's most grueling courses, is going to be tough on any car. That the Civic's hybrid powertrain could handle this race is testament to some excellent build-quality. The Civic Hybrid completed laps of the 25.4 kilometer course in as little as 12 minutes, averaging 16.8mpg over the race, which isn't a bad number for this type of driving. Honda considers the Civic Hybrid's performance proof positive that the hybrid technology is race-ready.<br><br><strong>The Mammoth Fiat 500</strong><br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/Fiat500_01_270x202.jpg"><br><br>Last July we wrote about the new Fiat 500, a modern take on a classic small car. Walking around the 2007 Frankfurt auto show, we saw it live for the first time, and didn't expect it to be so big. The Fiat 500 towers over the Fiat floor area, and could easily squash a Hummer. We're pretty sure European roads haven't gotten substantially wider, so we don't know what Fiat's engineers were thinking.<br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/Fiat500_02_270x202.jpg"><br><br>Oh wait, our mistake--the actual Fiat 500 was sitting nearby. The giant Fiat 500 is just a bit of booth dressing, although its pretty impressive. Fiat built a track through the big car, and has actual Fiat 500s pulled along on a slot through the left front wheel well, then out the other side. The real Fiat 500s on display look as good as the press photos.<br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070911/Fiat500_03_270x202.jpg"><br><br>We especially like the clean interior design. The white dashboard and smooth buttons make it look like an iPod. The navigation unit sits on its own pedestal, and can be removed. Dual-zone climate control is an impressive touch in an economy car. As we fiddled with the controls, we saw that the car also has Bluetooth hands-free cell phone integration, with information about the connection shown on the LED radio display.</div>

At BMW's ConnectedDrive exhibit at the 2007 Frankfurt auto show, the company showed off the first ever implementation of Google local search in a car. You can enter any search term in your BMW's navigation system, and it will find any Google matches for local businesses either within the vicinity of your car or another location you choose. It amounts to having a points-of-interest database searchable by keyword that always gets updated.<br><br>Or, if you're not the hands-on type, you can just use an entry in the navigation system to call BMW's telematics service, and ask the friendly operator to find what you need. If you were to ask for a hotel, the operator can tell you which ones are close by and have vacancies.<br><br>But there's a catch (isn't there always?). Google search is only available in a few European countries. If you're lucky enough to own a BMW and live in Germany, you can also find addresses at Google.de and push a button on the Web site to send them right to your car. We're not just teasing you with things you can't have--a BMW representative assured us that the company will work on bringing the service to the U.S.<br><br><strong>Nissan Mixim Concept</strong><br><br><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20070831/Nissan_mixim_5_270x172.JPG"><br><br>It's showtime again in the auto world--that time of the year when manufacturers trot out their latest fleets of new models and wacky concepts. In preparation for the forthcoming Frankfurt auto show, Nissan this week unveiled details of its Mixim electric concept car. According to Nissan, the Mixim (which is unlikely to make it to production) is aimed at young, Web-savvy, digital-age drivers with a penchant for gaming.

In fact, once it was shown -- presumably, once -- it wasn't seen again. Not much of a loss, really, because you won't be likely to see one either: Bugatti's only making five of them. That's even more exclusive than the edtion-of-twenty Lamborghini Reventon.<br><br>The Pur Sang is a standard-issue Bugatti stripped of all of its paint. That means raw aluminum and carbon fiber face the 200+ MPH elements in their naked states. We don't know how it looks in person, but in pics we'd have to say it's the prettiest Bugatti we've seen. Without the two-tone paint job, the car doesn't remind us of a giant Stacy Adams shoe. It's also a couple hundred pounds lighter, not that you were looking to shave weight or tenths off the car.<br><br>And heaven only knows how Bugatti will decide who gets the five examples. But of course, if you really wanted one you can always stop by Earl Scheib and have your Bugatti stripped. Since it only costs $99 to put paint on a car, it's probably not much more to take it off. Just an idea. In the mean time, be sure to check out the hi-res gallery of pics.</div>

Its small footprint (74 inches wide and 157 inches long) combined with a midship drivetrain will surely prove worthy when the going gets twisty. And with a DSG-controlled, VW-sourced 3.6-liter V6 sitting behind the driver, it's pure engineering perfection. Inside, the Paragon-styled interior gets a host of high-class touches, particularly the combination tach/speedo setup and minimalist switchgear.<br><br>If we had the talent, motivation and funding to design our own ideal ride, the Artega GT would be it. Thankfully, it's been slated for production and beginning next spring drivers in Europe can pony up the Â€70,000 cost of entry for one of the most inspiring bespoke coupes to come to market in a decade.<br><br>Full Story: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/12/frankfurt-2007-production-perfection-artega-gt/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/12/frankfurt-2007-production-perfection-artega-gt/</a></div>

Perhaps if we only write glowing praise about Bentley from here on out they'll let us drive the new Continental GT Speed, the most powerful Bentley ever made. The twin-turbo W12 mill from standard Continental GT breathes better thanks to a redesigned and more upright grille, and its ECU has also been hacked resulting in a nice round 600bhp, a 48bhp bump. 20-inch wheels wrapped in ultra low-profile rubber, a new steering wheel not shared with VW, and optional carbon ceramic brakes round out the hardware upgrades. All told, 60 MPH should arrive in 4.2 seconds and the Continental GT Speed's 202 MPH top speed officially makes it the fastest Bentley ever made, as well.<br><br>The Bentley Continental GT Speed is one of the most photogenic cars at this year's Frankfurt Motor Show, so check out all the live high-res pics in our gallery below, and click <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/01/bentley-unveils-most-powerful-model-ever-the-continental-gt-spe/" rel="nofollow">here</a> to read the official press release from our original post.</div>

The controversy stems from some bad blood brewing between Shuanghuan and the mainstream manufacturers whose designs it blatantly, unashamedly copies. On display in Frankfurt are the Shuanghuan UFO and CEO SUVs. UFO is a Toyota RAV4 clone, and CEO is a 95% copy of the BMW X5. (We say 95% because Shuanghuan apparently elected to copycat Mercedes-Benz for the CEO's front end design.)<br><br><img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2007/09/china-automobile_ceo_lo.jpg"><br><br>In the end, China Automobile Deutschland got to stay at the show, but Shuanghuan still faces potential trouble ahead, as BMW is considering legal action against the company.<br><br>(Source: Headline Auto)</div>

Our memory arrives at the old four-wheel-drive hatchbacks sold in the U.S. that can still be seen puttering around our roadways on occasion. Subaru unveiled a proper four-door Justy hatchback at the Frankfurt Motor Show this week that will go on sale immediately following the show. Available in either "sporty" 1.0S or the more practical 1.0E trim, the new Justy's 1.0L three-cylinder engine producing an uninspiring 68 HP. Unlike most Subaru's, this one's available in front-wheel drive, and a 5-speed manual is the only transmission choice. The only difference we could see between the black 1.0S and silver 1.0E on display were the alloy wheels on the sporty version. The new Justy comes to Subaru thanks to a partnership with Daihatsu who's supplying the car for European consumption.<br><br>Check out the official press release from Subaru after the jump and our live shots in the gallery below.<br><br>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/subaru-justy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/photos/subaru-justy/</a></div>

But it is pretty, and although we'll never see it Stateside, it still may warrant a few clicks of your mouse to view the gallery below. We're particularly fond of the handles that integrate into the chrome accents of the doors and the 70s-chic seats.

It's to be expected, given the regulatory noises coming from Euro government officials. VW-owned Czech automaker ÂŠkoda has gotten into the act this year, offering up a "GreenLine" version of its new Fabia compact.

As such, the Fabia GreenLine and Fabia Combi GreenLine (shown above) are powered by a 1.4L TDI with a diesel particulate filter that delivers 79 horsepower and emits less than 110 g/km of CO2. Another GreenLine car that will go on sale in biofuel-friendly Sweden later this year is the Octavia Combi Greenline, which is driven by a 100-horse 1.6L E85-compatible engine.

Why, it's the Polo GTI Cabrio from Karmann of course. Actually that punchline is more often "a sunburned zebra," but this fits too. The one-off white Polo wears black rims and trim, accented with a red top and highlights at both ends. Probably most famous for a much older VW special edition, Karmann is actually "a full-service-vehicle-supplier." They have managed to come up with a very nice sporty runabout this time, as well. We're not really sure whether or not it will reach production, and it's probably safe to say it wouldn't look exactly like this one if it did.

Fiat plans to use Abarth as an in-house tuning and racing concern, and this car demonstrates the kind of tuning they have in mind.<br><br>There are two Grande Punto Abarths: the base model comes to the party with "just" 150 HP, but the SS takes it up to 180 HP. The Abarth SS models also get a nice body kit that looks like it came from a Transformers spare parts bin. The interior is clean and basic, but not spartan, and well-laid out.

Honda says it plans on building something that will look a lot like this estate by the middle of next year and we hope they aren't lying. This is one of the swoopiest wagons we've seen in a while. Particularly at the rear, it has some beautiful lines that are elegant and sporty, and downright sexy. It makes us think of an Alfa Romeo, which is a good thing. This concept changes very little of the new Accord as we know it, stretching the track and width a bit to help with cargo space and handling. It will feature the 2.0- and 2.4-liter gas engines, as well as Honda's 2.2-liter diesel, as options when it goes into production, which means it will be a full all-Euro 5-compliant vehicle across the board. Honda says we'll see the final version at Geneva and we can't wait. Hopefully a U.S. version will be in the plans as well.<br><br>[Source: Honda]<br><br>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/honda-accord-tourer-concept/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/photos/honda-accord-tourer-concept/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Frankfurt 2007: It ain't the Endo it's the Toyota iQ</strong><br>Source: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-it-aint-the-endo-its-the-toyota-iq/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-it-aint-the-endo-its-the-toyota-iq/</a><br><br><img src="http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.autoblog.com/media/2007/09/toyota_iq_live_450_01_op.jpg"><br><br>"Flame surfacing comes to the smart." That was our first thought when we laid eyes upon Toyota's newest concept, the iQ. The 2980mm 3+1 practically shares every dimension with its big brother the Yaris, except length, and comes equipped with all sorts of innovative packaging. Normally a two-seater, a third seat can also be flipped up for a small adult or child in the back (hence, 3+1).<br><br>Unlike the VW up!, the iQ will have its engine mounted up front, powering the front wheels, although what specific powertrains are available is an open question. If we had to put money on it, we'd guess something below the one-and-a-half liter range in both gas and diesel, when it supposedly goes on sale in Europe in 2009.<br><br>All the details are in the press release after the jump, and, as always, a gallery awaits you underneath.<br><br>Gallery: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/photos/toyota-iq/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/photos/toyota-iq/</a><br>Original Article, Press Release, Etc.: <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-it-aint-the-endo-its-the-toyota-iq/" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/11/frankfurt-2007-it-aint-the-endo-its-the-toyota-iq/</a></div>
