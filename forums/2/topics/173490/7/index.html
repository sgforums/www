He and 250 engineers spent two years stuffing a fuel cell into a 1966 GMC Handivan - which turned it into "The Electrovan". It was so full of stuff there was hardly any room for the front seats. It had two large tanks (for liquid oxygen and for liquid hydrogen) as well as nearly 200 metres of pipes. The electrolytes alone weighed over 200 kg, and produced brilliant fireworks whenever they leaked. On one occasion, the liquid hydrogen tank blew up and tossed pieces of metal 400 metres away. Whenever all the parts of the Electrovan did stay together, all the extra stuff doubled the weight of the car. All in all, the Electrovan wasn't very practical as a car, but it was the first step.<br><br>1st car manufacturer to produce a fuel cell car, of course, can be none other than DaimlerChrysler. Yet another victory!<br><br>The Daimler-Chrysler Car Company came up with their first fuel cell car, the NECAR I (or New Electric CAR I) in 1994. Its fuel cell system weighed 800 kilograms. By 1996 the technology had advanced so much that the fuel cell system for NECAR II fitted comfortably under the back seat of a Mercedes V-Class van. In 1997, the NECAR 3 was the first fuel cell car that actually made its hydrogen on the road by reforming methanol. Also in 1997, NEBUS was released - a bus powered with a fuel cell drive system. In 1998, Daimler-Chrysler released the Jeep Commander that was fitted with a fuel cell powered by a reformer - here the reformer broke down petrol to generate hydrogen for the fuel cell. In 1999, NECAR 4 was released, the first genuine 5-seater fuel cell electric car. It got its hydrogen from a liquid hydrogen tank. The latest one, the NECAR 5, like the Jeep Commander, has a methanol reformer.<br><br>by now, just looking at how much automotive technology owes to this company, I think we all agree the Mercedes McLaren SLR deserves to win  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
