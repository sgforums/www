            <div class='col-md body'>I've been finding info on how to get into these races... Cross-referencing to the topic on Night Racing in SG.... Why people would rather get into illgeal racing.... <strong>Firstly</strong>, the top pros are there (F1, japan Gran Touring championship [JGTC], WRC, etc.) get in sure free frag one, got the competition lah but then if all SG racers go there sure alot of ppl one... so very hard to get in... <strong>Secondly </strong>, your teams, equiment, car and etc... very ex leh.. can mod SKyline, Supra, WRX, Evo liao.. not well to do family how? and also Singapore Sports Council Don't even want to hep one racer (forget whats his name liao..) in SG that almost get into one of the Formula something race one... <strong>Thirdly</strong> Sometimes the race dun suit you then also cannot freestyle mah so wat to do have to race illgeal loh...Then all these already very big problem already the easy way out illegeal racing...  SOmemore got police chase you even more fun, but then when got police knocking at your door then not fun liao le lah.. Racers all very young learn how to drive liao, i (86 baby lah) heard frm my friends that they change the law to 21 then can drive... Ppl 21 (other countries) already practicing their skills already i then starting to learn how to drive... kaozzz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its pretty hard to make it big in racing in SG because there is almost no legal racing scene except SMSA carpark rallies which are more of amateur racing events. You could try taking up karting for a start.<br><br>If you really want to try making it big, you'll have to try your luck overseas. SG has no race track anyway. And if you don't have talent, just buy your way through.<br><br>If you drive a Porsche, Ferrari or Masarati, you can get into their amateur leagues like the Porsche 911 challenge cup (Can't recall the exact name for the championship) where you'll have to buy a race prepared 911 GT3 to compete.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi speeddemon, Hi all..newbie here<br>to get into JGTC,WRC,BTCC u need to be in factory teams.of coz u can go as independent but then u wud need lotsa money &amp; bckup like the factory teams.and still dun win!<br>The drivers for example in WRC,F1are not employed by the teams but rather drive for them on contract &amp; need to pay a placement fee.take for example, Colin Mcrae will need to pay million to drive for his 2 yr contract with subaru or FOrd as he is with now.then the complicated proc where his manager negotiate terms.<br>so its like hollywood. where actors are not employed by studio but must "place" themselves, get the audition,get the role,then thye hav manager to negotiate.for example, Alex yoong got to fork out 8millions USD jus to drive for Minardi for 2 yrs contract and see what happens now.<br>Dennis lian is drivng F2000 but LOtus sponsoring him for team lotus Elise.<br>But if u happen to be racing for JGTC, pls say hello to the "ENDLESS ZEAL" RQ for me.!!lol....esp Akane! cheers</div>
