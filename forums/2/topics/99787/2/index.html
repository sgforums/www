            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you guys are talking about the city, the city which is one generation before the i-dsi engine is pretty good on acceleration. The one I am talking about is about 3 years old model VTEC LEV which look a little like a civic. I am driving one right now and for a auto car, I could actually squeeze out 14km/l (on a conservative calculation). As for acceleration-wise, its much better then the new city (i tried my friend's). And last of all it also fulfil the last criteria - it is a sedan..<br>just my 2cents worth ..........<br><br>"Driving fast saves your time, Driving safe saves your life"</div>

I got my license driving the old city.. the LEV version... and it's looked so much better... esp since my instructor add a few things, like fog lamps, and side guards... plus... when I was learning, mid way through, he brought the car to Malaysia and had it tweaked... the next time I drove it... Acceleration was so much greater.... hehe... fun to drive...<br><br>The new City looks like it got crammed into a limited length... damn ugly... EVEN with larger wheels...</div>
