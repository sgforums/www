It's natural. We guys are built that way. But I just hope your neighbour isn't in terrible debt just to finance the car.<br><br>Well, there are 2 ways about it. You can just sit by like 99% of the pple and just be jealous, come SGforums n post this (sorry if i sound harsh) and just suck thumb...<br><br>OR...<br><br>You can choose to be like less than 1% of the pple and really start wondering how you are living your life now, how's the state of your career? Are you in dead end job? If you have a business, is it deadened business with meagre earnings every month? U really should start asking yourself all these questions. With every situation you are in, there is somewhere somehow you can improve.<br><br>The least you could do is start with yourself - Be financially prudent. How do you spend your money? How much do you save and how much do you invest? That's just one area.<br><br>Next you should look at how you can improve your career standing? If you are an employee, do you have the relevant skills to be promoted and be deemed desirable? It's not just a bout a degree. Go to the library. Read more books on career management. If it's about a busienss uare running, I'm sure there are available resources to improve urself.<br><br>The key fundamental point is this. You can achieve your dreams if you know what to do and ACTUALLY DO IT. It's as simple as that. You can achieve your financial dreams if you are willing to work hard n make some sacrifices.<br><br>Why not start with better financial planning and investing in increasing your own knowledge? That's just a start.<br><br>Starting... has already put you in the 10% of the pple. All the best =)</div>

Why I envy these ppl is their resistance towards temptation. Owning such car doesn't tell you he is loaded cos it's on loan term. You might not know the actual owner of this car, can be company car or lease. I know of ppl like to change car every few months and those are high end cars, some are bankruptcy also. As long you can pay the down payment you can drive one but not fully own one. Unless you are telling me he is driving one with a marque of a man, that is call loaded and successful.</div>
