            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">I have to disagree a bit. Lift off oversteer usually happens at high speeds. Taking the FIA ETCC cars as an example, the Alfa 155 touring cars are FWD. They've often invited some drivers from other series such as F1 drivers to come drive a single race as a special invite. Many drivers especially those from F1, often spin the cars because they make the mistake of lifting off thru corners. In a RWD car like a F1 car, lifting off is often used to control the nose of the car as it slides wide, or to tame the rear if it steps out. In a FWD touring car, at very high speeds, sometimes they make the mistake of using the same technique, resulting in a high speed spin due to lift off oversteer. Drivers who've made this mistake includes Giancarlo Fisichella. As u see, lift off oversteer CAN and does happen at high speeds in FWD cars. In fact, it is much harder to get lift off oversteer in FWD cars at medium to low speeds. Thats why they're not used in the D1 drift series. D1 drift series, actually drift at low to medium speeds, not high speeds as the human eye is tricked into believeing. I'd judge most of those drifts to be done at speeds between 50 to 80km/h which are fairly low speeds, when compared to actual racing speeds. We have to remember what we deem a "high speed drift" in the world of drifting is, in absolute terms, actually fairly low speed. That is why D1 drifters don't use FWD cars.</div></blockquote>maybe i shd reiterate myself, i did mention that it was nearly impossible, but not entirely impossible to make an FF car oversteer. in fact, at sufficiently low speeds, an FF car is capable of oversteer with a bit of help from the handbrakes. my point is simply that such oversteer would be much harder to induce in an FF car in comparison to cars that are driven otherwise and they are therefore not preferred in D1. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
