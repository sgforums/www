            <div class='col-md body'>oversteer is, to put it simply, too much steering by a car.<br><br>OH-FF has left a lot out of his explanation. There are a few kinds of oversteer, all of which are produced when the rear wheels lose grip. As to why they lose grip, the one he has described, is what's called lift-off oversteer. There are several other forms of oversteer, but most which can be classed into the category of "wheelspin" oversteer, where the rear-driven wheels are spinning at a different rate to the rate of linear travel, thus causing a breakage in traction and causing the rear to slide. The other kind of oversteer are caused by a breakage in traction between the rear wheels and the ground due to the rear wheels being locked. We can call this sort of oversteer "wheel lock" oversteer. These 2 forms of oversteers can occur without any need to use weight transfer to initiate them, but generally oversteering, or "drifting" often uses a combination of all 3, weight transfer, wheel spin and wheel lock, to initiate and then control a drift.</div>

Lift off oversteer usually happens at high speeds. Taking the FIA ETCC cars as an example, the Alfa 155 touring cars are FWD. They've often invited some drivers from other series such as F1 drivers to come drive a single race as a special invite. Many drivers especially those from F1, often spin the cars because they make the mistake of lifting off thru corners. In a RWD car like a F1 car, lifting off is often used to control the nose of the car as it slides wide, or to tame the rear if it steps out. In a FWD touring car, at very high speeds, sometimes they make the mistake of using the same technique, resulting in a high speed spin due to lift off oversteer. Drivers who've made this mistake includes Giancarlo Fisichella. As u see, lift off oversteer CAN and does happen at high speeds in FWD cars. In fact, it is much harder to get lift off oversteer in FWD cars at medium to low speeds. Thats why they're not used in the D1 drift series. D1 drift series, actually drift at low to medium speeds, not high speeds as the human eye is tricked into believeing. I'd judge most of those drifts to be done at speeds between 50 to 80km/h which are fairly low speeds, when compared to actual racing speeds. We have to remember what we deem a "high speed drift" in the world of drifting is, in absolute terms, actually fairly low speed. That is why D1 drifters don't use FWD cars.</div>

Just want to know what to expect when I cut a corner with my little car.</div></blockquote>in lift off oversteer, it is induced when u lift off the throttle at very high speeds in a FWD car. It can be countered when u step on the acceleator again to use the power-understeer typical of a FWD car to neutralise it. Following it up with left foot braking would be a very good way to regain control if it happens to be under a loss of control circumstances. Avoid lifting off your right foot again and slamming it down on the brakes as it would induce lift off overtseer again, and then excaberating the situation when the all 4 wheels lock up.<br><br>For wheel lock oversteer, that is caused by pulling up sharply on the handbrake, and releasing it, to cause a momentary loss of traction with the rear wheels. A longer pull would allow a driver to clear a sharp corner if he has entered it too fast. note that, this method, is usually not the fastest way of clearing hairpins. Its more for loose surfaces commonly found in rallies, and on a packed surface, such a method of turning corners usually results in an untidy exit, which requires additional time to "tidy" up b4 u can get on the gas again. But if u ever find yourself over cooking a corner, it might just be enuf to enable u to avoid having an accident, if u've practiced it enuf. Its also useful for showmanship drifting n driving, aka showboating.</div>
