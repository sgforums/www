            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with you that it is up to each individual to be more responsible and civic-minded when on our roads. But sometimes S'poreans typically must be 'convinced' by law to be able to get the message through their thick skulls. It might work but what does that say about our culture and our mindset?<br><br>Some drivers do give way, signal and do not do dangerous stunts on our roads but generally I feel that most S'poreans road users are always rushing to wherever without taking into consideration the effects of their actions.

But have u realised that most "overtakers" on the right-most lanes never really change back to the middle lane after "overtaking"? So if your mentality is that you want to overtake every other car on the other lanes, you have the right to remain on the right-most lane for the whole journey lor?<br><br><strong>Example</strong><br><img src="http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g122/bad_lewis/overtaking.jpg"><br><br>- Speed limit for this 3-lane road is 90km/h.<br>- All the other cars in the left and middle lane are travelling within the speed limit.<br>- Car A is going beyond the speed limit and he thinks he should remain in the rightmost lane because he feels that he can overtake every other car in the other 2 lanes.<br>- Car B is behind Car A and he thinks that 100km/h is too slow and that Car A is road hogging. So he horns and high beams and then overtake via the middle lane and then show his middle finger to Car A.<br><br>So who is right? IMO, if the speed limit is followed by everyone, then there wont be such an argument already. If there is a TP with speed camera on the overhead bridge, he won't give a fark whether you are on the leftmost or rightmost lane. As long as you go beyond the speed limit, he'll snap a pic of your car. Simple as that.<br></div>

Education will have limited impact as I find most drivers to be selfish and inconsiderate, e.g. earlier today I saw a pick-up blatantly turning right on East Coast Road to Joo Chiat Road when there are 'No Right Turn' signs clearly displayed, in the process causing a jam for those cars behind him while he waited to turn.  It's moments like this that I wished there were traffic police or cameras around to catch the offender in the act...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As they always say, 5-O is never there when you need them. Subconsciously we all have the tendency to move into the overtaking lane and stay there because we think we are overtaking more than just one car but I figured that this<strong> "KEEP LEFT UNLESS OVERTAKING"</strong> only applies in non-congested highways, like say the N-S highway in Malaysia. Where drivers overtake on the right only and keep left immediately afterwards. In SG however, due to congestion + kiasuism results in funny driving habits. I mean seriously..., if u are in the first lane..., going say 95km/h and u see a car behind u approaching fast..., what do u do?<br><br>1. Try to lane change <strong>SAFELY</strong> to the 2nd lane &amp; give way?<br>2. Jam Brake?<br>3. Slow Down?<br>4. Accelerate because the distance btw ur vehicle &amp; the one ahead can fit a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOEING A380</strong></span>??<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(.......Hmm, maybe the guy approaching is trying to tell me something. I wonder what? OH! I'm hogging hor? Paisey!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> )</span><br><br>See, the rationalization is quite clear &amp; concise, rules are there for a reason. Most times they apply flawlessly, in other instances WE as drivers/citizens have to act accordingly by means of initiative and plain simple <strong>COMMON SENSE</strong>. If we fail to do so, the gahmen will act accordingly &amp; we b*tch about strict laws... Don't get me wrong, I am a patriot but what does that say about us <strong>SINK-A-POREANS</strong>?? Have to be told then will obey? Sad right? Change begins with an individual no matter how pointless it seems. So look to urself b4 getting frustrated..., we ourselves may be causing the morning PIE/CTE/ECP/AYE traffic jam....<br><br>By the way the correct answer is either 1 or 4..., <span style="font-style: italic;">"LIFE IS A COMPROMISE"</span></div>
