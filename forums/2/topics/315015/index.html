              <p>I am very sure and certain that the roads of Singapore have never felt a Carver One on its tarmac asphalt.<br> <br> the Closest Singapore has gotten to such a machine is a Piaggio MP3,
              which concept is nice, but overall, its... a sore to the eyes.<br> <br> i would like to post a poll, to see how many people would actually
              purchase a Carver One, and what kind of target consumer would be
              targeted as high potential buyers of such a product.<br> <br> the website of the Carver One is here <br> <a href="http://www.carver-worldwide.com/Home/Index.asp?nc=1">http://www.carver-worldwide.com/Home/Index.asp?nc=1</a><br> <br> do take your time to view its specs, etc.<br> <br> for those too lazy to do so, it is essentially a: <br> 650cc engine vehicle<br> 3 wheeled<br> Vehicle control is like a car<br> driving experience is like a motorcycle.<br> main body of vehicle tilts like a bike when turning.<br> turning angle is dependent on speed / amount of centrifugal force, not how much you turn the steering wheel.<br> <br> this vehicle is dimensions are as followed:<br> Length 3.40 m<br> Height 1.40 m<br> Width (tilt angle ≤ 25°) 1.30 m<br> Width (max. tilt angle) 1.60 m<br> Wheel base 2.70 m<br> Fuel tank capacity 34 L<br> Unladen mass 643 kg (1,418 lb)<br> <br> <br> given its dimensions, it is clearly a thin vehicle, and hence, would
              provide drivers with the experience of bike riding - squeezing with
              traffic, and tilting towards the ground. quite like a fighter jet. (or
              so Jeramy Clarkson claims on Top Gear)<br> <br> I seriously believe that if this vehicle is widely used across
              Singapore, (i'm talking about a large percentage) our congestion rate
              would be curbed greatly. which would indicate several things.<br> <br> LTA would not need to use congestions as an excuse to build more ERP
              gantries to tax us fellow road users, AND! you gain more millage per
              liter of petrol, approximately 16km/L. (or so claimed the website).<br> <br> however, the drawback is that it only sits 2, and there is no boot space.<br> i feel that this would target the bachelors, or as a rich-man's toy car.<br> and too, for those who are currently driving a daihatsu copen, a small,
              2 seater, with little boot space, with yet, with such an immense thirst
              for fuel, which would potentially cost about the same price as a Carver
              One.<br> <br> I would really like to have this vehicle introduced into Singapore
              soil, and is my ultimate goal. Preexisting dealers who are interested
              in the idea, please do include me into your team. I am not keen on
              earning anything financially out of this, but would simply like to see
              it through, from liaising with Carver itself, to getting the approval
              by LTA, till it is sold on the streets. Nothing more.<br> <br> - Aaron Choy</p>
