            <div class='col-md body'>If you are driving on the extreme right lane, then you shld be giving way to an overtaking car. Even though, the left lanes may be wide open.<br><br>To continue on the right lane and blocking the vehicle behind you is considered to be road-hogging, even though if you are at or above the speed limits.<br><br>To overtake on the left is illegal and is liable to be booked for dangerous driving.<br><br>The right lane shld only be used for overtaking and for turning right only. Sadly, most Singaporeans are totally ignorant of this simple and civic rule.<br><br>Imagine if you are rushing off to an emergency, such as sending someone to the hospital, and you have a car infront of u happily cruising along at 90 km/h on the CTE. I definitely would want to get past and wouldn't mind getting a speeding fine and I think an appeal may even be accepted by the TP, if I am sending someone who is in need of urgent medical assistance to the hospital.<br><br>In your case, that Rex may not be in any real sense of urgency at all. But you will never know and can never be sure. Think it is just being civic to give way, tatz all. At least, I would feel that if i was in his shoes, i wouldn't want to be blocked as well.

At least leave a lane on the right for people to overtake you for whatsoever reason. If people need to overtake you on your left, then you are probably hogging the road already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

When i finally got a chance to cut in, the Merc which was behind me cut to the other lane and ruin my chance of getting in to the lane, and the exit was very near. What i did was go fairly close to him as he was driving an Old S class so quite bulky, so i signalled and squeeze him to the side, i dun mind scretching his car man, frankly speaking i am prepared to bang him off the road leow  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  so the driver got no choice but to slow down for me to cut in.<br><br>By that time the traffic build up leow, so i decide to irritate him, i on my hazard lights and pretend to answer the phone and check some document and cause him to stuck behind me for quite sometime  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  lucky there is no more car behind him .... hahaha when he want to filter out no one wants to give him way ... beri good! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
