            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>I guess if you want to go for a 2nd hand car, that is the risk you have to bear. In my opinion, no car dealers or salesman is 100% truthful when it comes to selling you things. This is just human nature. I won't be 100% truthful also if I happen to be a salesman. Facts of life bro.<br><br>And yes, car dealers will hide accident records and stuff from you.<br><br>For myself, I was conned into believing that<br><br>a) My 2nd car is 100% stock (when I later learnt that the car was turbo-charged by the previous owner and immense mods had been done to the engine)<br><br>b) The rims are good rims cos they are 17" (when I later learnt that the rims are actually cheapo scrapyard rims).<br><br>c) The car's previous owner is 'blur blur' one so he couldn't have done much drastic things to the car (when I later learnt that the owner is a rich person who is damn experienced in mods, and car modding is his hobby).<br><br>d) The bodykit is original (when I later learnt that it is replica).<br><br>e) ... and amongst many other things....<br><br>So bro, you got to judge it for yourself. Bring with you another friend(s) so that there are more opinions.<br><br>Cheerios!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My experiences with 2nd hand car dealers have been frustrating - whether its buying or selling a car.  More often than not, they are ah bengs who are tactless.<br><br>There was once after I test-drove a car, I couldn't decide if it was worth the price.  So I told him the truth, and that won't make a decision yet.  He just pointed to the Singapore Pools shop nearby and said "go there and buy Toto....when you hit, then come back to see me again".<br><br>There was another time when I wanted to buy a certain car.  On that day, there were a few advertisments in the paper's classified ads for this type of car.  Maybe I was stupid for being too honest....when I visited the first dealer, I told him the truth "I'm interested in this model, but as you know there are a few of these on sale today and I want to try at least a few before making my final decision".  His reply was "oh, all the ads in the papers today are ours - and all are for this same car, so no need to call others already.  You want, you can just buy".  Talk cock!<br><br>There were even twice where I made an appointment to view the car.  When I reached there and asked to view the car, they pointed to the car and said "there is the car, you go and view it lor".  Then they continued to go about their own business, ignoring me and leaving  me standing there like a fool.<br><br>There was once when after I viewed the car, he told me "actually, another person has already offered to buy this car....so if you want to give a higher offer, I can let you have it".  I refused....and after a few weeks, I saw the same car still being advertised in the papers (classified ads).  They lied.<br><br>Their general attitude is "don't ask too many questions, just buy or fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ck off....and we don't have to be polite, fair or honest with you".  And most have zero knowledge about the vehicles they are selling too.<br><br>I've played with cars before and have had many other frustrating experiences with them.  Thats why for my present car, I bought it brand new, directly from the agent....and I intend to keep it for its lifespan of 10 years.  Nowadays, some brand new cars are actually quite affordable.<br><br>Out of the more than 50 used car dealers I've met, there were only a few nice and honest ones.  Its a waste that I didn't keep in touch with them (after all, I don't sell cars every week <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).  However, I think its best to ask your friend/relative/family to recommend instead of asking publicly, like in this forum ('cos you'll never know what you'll get - eg. you may even get a 2nd car dealer posing to be a friend....and he will only show his true colours later).<br><br>When you do find a good one, keep in touch with thim because they are very rare....and they are the ones who deserve our business.  Good Luck!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Irage,<br><br>Generally speaking you would get a better deal (in more ways than one) fron the owner. This is because you are theoretically cutting out the middleman, ie the parasitic second hand car dealer (henceforth referred as simply 'scum'). You also don't feel threatened and always wondering what is true and what is false. Unfortunately the second hand car market is now cornered by the "scum" and their touts. You only have to advertise your car and many of these scum or 'scum-wannabes' will wake you up at 6.30 am just to spoil your day. There was even a case where the same scum bribed  an employee of our English daily (ST) so he could have the advertisements earlier than other scums sothat he could than badger the sellerearly in the mornig to sell his car to him. This worked well until the govt reduced the ARF taxes and the economy took a dive (from '98 -2005). Many Singapore scums lost a lot of money as they could not sell their cars. This situation is no different today, perhaps only worse. Walk into any scum-shop and witness for yourself the declining number of stocks, how eagerly some of the younger , more energetic scums jump to greet you or how slowly the older scums eyeball you for a potential sucker. The greatest fear these scums now have are of an increasing interest rate as their carrying costs will multiply. So far the govt has been kind to them. But take heart, this is only a prelude.<br><br>My reason for writing is not to take my ire out on these people but to tell you that the savings  from buying a second-hand car are now much less than before, say 8-10 years ago. Because of the continued reduction in COE and ARF taxes it would now be better to buy a new car. Many examples can be given where the yearly costs of a similar car would be less for a new car than for an old one. I suggest you do this exercise yourself to be convinced of it. Note. the yearly COE amortisation costs for a 3 year old car vs a newcar is about half! Ie. a savings of about $1300 -$1500, and this is only for 1 item. Nowadays most new cars come with a 3 or even 5 year warranty.<br><br>Good hunting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Even the media (ST) got hold of the story, which is how I know about it.  Since he signed the contract willingly and knowingly, there was nothing the authorities could do about it.<br><br></div>
