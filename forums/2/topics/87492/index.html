            <div class='col-md body'>Well WRX nowsaday as compared to 5 yrs back are definitely more affordable.<br><br>I've been eyeing one as well but can't afford it. Its not easy owning one lar, esp a family man. Its definitely not painless as all are $$$ involves. Every cents count.<br><br>Even if the monthly installment is taken care of, the killer part will be the car insurance that comes once a year. If the car is under the name of a driver under 30 yrs old, the premium could easily be in the region of 5k!<br><br>S$5,000 can be the depreciation for some car for a yr, so why waste it on a piece of paper. Can't bear and afford to anyway, heh......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Actually, a WRX costs about as much as a Toyota Camry. The main killer is the fuel consumption and insurance.<br><br>Fuel consumption (stock) is not that bad if you are not lead footed and insurance.....once you are over 30 with about 50% NCD.....comes in at about $2000....Road tax is as for any normal 2.0 litre car.<br><br>If u do not do outrageous mods, the stock car should be pretty reliable with regular oil changes and maintenance. Modern=day TC cars are very much improved and reliable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...  I think we can't really talk about "afford".  You'll be scared sh*tless if you really worked out costs.  I read somewhere, and some financial analysts friends of mine confirmed it, in Singapore you have to earn a min of $6k a month after CPF to even be able to afford a car.<br><br>If you earn less than that and still want a car, you better do some serious cutting back in other areas if you want to retire in the future.  Inflation and costs of living here will make your life hell once that steady income stops and you don't have your nest egg put aside.<br><br>So...  well...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Recently see more and more WRX in the road.  Their engine roar in very low tone, sounds very powerful.  You don't even turn your head, will know a WRX is comming.  Can imagine drive inside must be very Suang.<br><br>If I am ten years younger, and without a family, I may consider evenly pay out most of the salary.  If you don't drive such a car in your early 20s, will you drive it in your 30/40s with you wife and kids squeezed in the small rear seat?<br><br>Why worry so much on the HDB and wedding?  HDB is taken cared by CPF and the wedding... most important is the girl want to marry with you.  Sometime ppl save cents in the every meal, but throw tens of thousand dollers in wedding or house decoration.  Who can say they are wrong.  Of course they have the right to distribute the money they earn.  Same as cars, if you like to have a decent car, you probably need of sacrifice some other part of life.  As long as it's your own choice, so be it.<br><br>To be frank, I prefer to see WRX, RX-8, M3, 911s on road much more than corolla and sunnys.  Who not?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
