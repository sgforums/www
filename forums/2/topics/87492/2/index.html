I think you worry too much.  We are talking about the kids just start to work and in their early 20s.  I thought normal people should start to prepare for their retirement when they are in late 30s or even 40s.  Sacrifice the current life to live in the hope in 30 years later.  Sounds not very logical, right?  Our world change too fast, I hard to imagine what the world looks like after 30 years.<br><br>In a realistic case, just get a uncle more than 60 years old and ask him when most his saving come from, in his 20s or 30s or 40s later.  I think the answer should be the last one.  Social wealth is always accumulated in increasing speed.  Saving from early years is nothing from the view of now unless you are so smart at investment.<br><br>For the young generation, they don't really care too much about the money as long as they don't make them bankrupt eventually.  Youth is wealth.  They have plenty of time to change their future.  If today can buy a WRX, let's just do it.  Next year, if cannot afford it any more, sell it.  No body will be killed.  What's a big deal?</div>
