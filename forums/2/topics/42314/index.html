The petrol consumtion is still under observation, heh...........<br><br>Me still not very sure abt the spec of the new honda civic 1.6. But seriously, it look the same as the 1.5.

Honda have VTi and Vtis under Civic's unbrella. 1.6 and 1.7l repectively. dunno the fuel consumption. Honda city is on 1.5L.suppose to save fuel based on dual spark plug per chamber. say that city can do 14-15km/l. sound like a big 'beh deh' from them. anyway city is a thai car, resale value will be horrific. sold my city 2.5 years ago.. the one w/o vtec. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  lose abt.$30K that year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Any way, wat car are you driving now? just avg the cost and let me now asap, k?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Comconn,<br><br>Well actually I have the spec of the new 1.6l Honda Civic Vti as well. But what i find it not quite acceptable is that on paper, the Honda 1.5l Vti is faster than the 1.6l Vti !!! The 1.5l version produces 112 horsepower while the new 1.6l 110bhp. And the pickup is slightly faster for the 1.5l too. So, don't think its quite worthwhile to get the new 1.6l, cos of higher road tax and fuel consumtion I believe.<br><br>If you can afford it still, go for the 1.7l lor, heh......... at least it produces 130bhp. Hope SiR will be reborn again in a few yrs time, then might be able to get one, heh.............  Hope can afford by that time.<br><br>The new Honda City is using iDsi engine, not Vtec, so its suppose to save petrol, but less power. Anyway, the 14km/l on paper is never correct, due to the road condition in Sg.<br><br>How long u owed the City? 3 yrs plus and lose 30k??? Actually my Nissan March also lost quite a big sum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I'm currently driving a 2001 Honda Civic ES Vti 1.5l (A). That's why I'm very sad when the 1.6l came out. Though my 1.5l will depreciate quite a bit. But judging from the car's performance, think situation is not so bad afterall.<br><br>Just took over the car not long, from my brother cos he bought a new car. Errrrmmmmm still not too sure abt the fuel efficiency though. WIll be on a business trip to M'sia tomorrow, driving my car in, a good time to see its fuel effieciency. Will only be back on Thursday, and will post to let u know what's the consumtion like.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Tested the fuel consumtion of the Honda Civic Vti ES (A).<br><br>Consist of both running on normal road and highway. The petrol fuel consumtion is abt 10.5km/l ........... surprisingly abt the same as my previous Nissan March (A).<br><br>Conclusion: Acceptable fuel consumtion.<br><br>Agree, rather sianz that all Civic nowsaday are SOHC. If the SIR is to be launched again, might consider trading in the car for one. But then, now that the new 1.3 Hybrid and 1.6 Civic just came onto the market, I don't see the next generation of Civic to be launched until maybe 2005.<br><br>Even then, might be SOHC Civic still.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a Merc C180 older model like 1994 to 2000 drinks less fuel than your KIA. It looks and feels very heavy, but is only 1350kg. I have one and it is very low in fuel consumption being only 1799cc and even though its auto, it goes far on 1 ltr of fuel. Running on regular unleaded even though supposed to use premium. May have a problem up Sheares bridge from Beach Road entrance though unless you have 1 or no passengers. Was designed basically for flat roads. Otherwise, C200, C220. C280 ??? will get you going faster at a bigger fuel cost.</div>
