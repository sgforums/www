I would agree with you if you corner the same corner with different cars but at the fastest speed before spinning out as a comparsion.</div>

However, heard that mitsubishi CVT got problem ley.....  dunno true or not...<br><br>Sigh.. Lancer to me have nice interior and is the cheapest. SOHC nevermind la... since Auto, Japanese car and use to move me from point A to point B. Are you driving manual or auto. Was thinking if CVT got problem.. then get manual... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

The former has a 'thin' and hollow sound and it is very light.  Some may prefer 'thin' slamming sound.<br><br>talking about Honda City, note that the spacious 500litres booth actually takes that gas tank space away...i personally feel it is unsafe as the gas tank is now spreaded across the lower area of the car...one can imagine what is likely to happen when a fire breaks out from an accident or if there is undercarriage fire...<br><br>oh...it costed $66K basic + $2K for the package (15" OZ sports rim, Reverse Sensor, Leatherseats, etc...)<br><br>roadtax about $4++ (coz it is 1.6 litres)<br><br>Mine is Auto / CVT...<br><br>if u squat down and peek from the rear, u will see the rear suspension that resembles Honda Civic double wishbone &lt;- correct me if i describe incorrectly.....quite nice and cool lor.....<br><br>so folks, join me leh...coz i am joining Mitsu club soon<br><br>i have no regret</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ... I have driving every now and then my brother Lancer 1.6 Elegance since Nov 2003.<br><br>Quite like the car, the handling and ride is good. Stable at high speed too and found that the price is a bargain for a Japan made car.<br><br>The only complain I had is the noisy engine and the slow accel but I think it is ok coz can put in Ds mode and accel. Cant compare to VVTI or VTEC I think but overall ride comfort is good even for the driver. BTW ... as far as I know, Mitsubishi dont make quiet cars ... lolz.<br><br>CVT .... I think it is good as u wouldnt feel the changing of gear at all - whether as a driver or passenger. Comparing to Corolla, Sunny and Vios plus older Mitsubishi cars, u can feel it for auto. So far so good for CVT in my brother car which is more than 6 month liao!<br><br>1.6 litres Jap car ... I think Lancer look the best. ha ha ... but I still dont have the budget to buy that ... looking at Getz.</div>
