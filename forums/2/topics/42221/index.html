I think you're referring to SUVs?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I don't have problems parking mine, I get about 10km/liter for mine, I go off roading once every couple of months and need a big wash down, not just do a few laps on a soccer field. SUVs have disadvantages like not being able to corner as well as regular sedans you know.. If Singapore is really swarming with cops and we supposedly can't be wild opposed to tame... how come I still see people buying sports cars? Aren't BMW amd Alfas considered performance cars? In my opinion about parking...I don't think the cars are big...it's the parking lots that are small. Rav4s and CR-Vs are considered compact SUVs...</div>
