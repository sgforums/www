            <div class='col-md body'>OHOR BARU: Special gantries and electronic payment equipment have been installed at both the Causeway and Second Link to collect the RM20 levy on Singaporean vehicles entering Malaysia beginning next month.<br><br>A senior Immigration officer in Putrajaya told the New Straits Times that the gantries and stored-value card readers using the same principle as the Touch Â’n Go cards have been installed to make it easier for Singaporean motorists.<br><br>Checks by the NST at both entry points yesterday revealed trial runs for the equipment had been conducted over the past few days.<br><br>Customs and Immigration officers at both entry points have also begun verbally notifying Singaporean motorists of the move.<br><br>"We have installed the equipment but the exact date the levy will come into force has not been decided yet. The Transport Ministry will announce it soon," said the senior Immigration officer.<br><br>However, a Singaporean motorist who contacted the NST office here said Customs officers at the Second Link had told her the levy would be charged beginning Thursday.<br><br>"I was taken aback because there has been no announcement. This is going to affect regular travellers to Malaysia, like myself," she said.<br><br>Singapore currently imposes a S$20 (about RM46) entry permit fee on Malaysian cars and S$4 (RM9) fee on motorcycles entering the republic from 2am to 5pm on weekdays. No fees are levied on weekends and public holidays.<br><br>The levy proposal was first mooted by the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry last April to defray fuel subsidies lost to foreign vehicles.<br><br>The proposal has seen some reservations from various quarters, especially retailers, who believe that Singaporeans may be put off from coming to Malaysia.<br><br>State executive councillor Freddy Long, who heads the tourism portfolio, said he feared the levy would affect the tourism industry in Johor.<br><br>Singaporeans spend an average of RM5 million a day on food, shopping and entertainment in Johor. Most hoteliers, retailers and restaurant operators are heavily dependent on their patronage.<br><br>In Singapore, Tourism Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor said the levy was inconsequential compared to the fuel subsidies and other benefits Singaporeans enjoyed in Malaysia.<br><br>He said the levy would not deter Singaporeans from entering the country.</div>

We got good roads, beautiful sights", he told reporters at a media briefing yesterday in conjunction with the Asean Tourism Forum (ATF) 2007.<br><br>The levy, which is meant to defray the fuel subsidies that have kept Malaysian pump prices among the lowest in the region, was to have come into effect on Sept 1 last year but Malaysian ministers have been sending mixed signals on whether to impose it or not.<br><br>At the briefing yesterday, Tengku Adnan also fielded questions on the crime situation in Malaysia and the impact of the recent Johor floods.<br><br>Singaporean visitors accounted for some 7.9 million of the total 14.4 million tourists to Malaysia from January to October last year. Tengku Adnan said he does not expect a fall in the number of Singaporeans even if the levy on foreign cars was imposed.<br><br>He said that Singaporeans would continue to go to Malaysia where they could buy groceries from the markets and supermarkets at heavily subsidised prices by the Malaysian government for its own people.<br><br>On the other hand, he said that Malaysians coming to Singapore have to pay a much higher car levy of "S$20 x 2.3."<br><br>"But we don't grumble and you got less roads than us," he added.<br><br>He explained that no decison had been reached on the levy as it is still pending the Attorney-General's approval, and they have yet to resolve who would collect it - whether it is the immigration, toll operators or customs.<br><br>Turning to the spate of crimes committed against Singaporeans in Johor and other parts of Malaysia, Tengku Adnan said that given the 20 million trips made by Singaporeans into Malaysia yearly, the crime rate of 0.005 per cent was not high and has in fact been falling in the country.<br><br>"I'm not saying it's good," he said, stressing that Malaysia would take action to further cut the crime rate to attract more tourists.<br><br>For example, he said police bases were being beefed up, more tourist information centres would be set up, and more security equipment and devices, including surveillance cameras would be installed.<br><br>A Lianhe Zaobao report today, quoting Johor police, said that out of the 29,079 crime incidents reported in 2006, 386 involved Singaporean victims, who were either robbed, had their cars stolen or whose homes in Johor were broken into.<br><br>Giving an update on the flood situation, he said that all areas in Johor are now accessible, except for some roads in Batu Pahat which are still being blocked by landslides.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>RE: <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/bt/bto_20070130_222819.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.asiaone.com/bt/bto_20070130_222819.html</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally from The Business Times:<br><br>Speaking in Singapore at the launch of Visit Malaysia Year 2007, Mr Tengku Adnan said that the recent floods in Malaysia should not deter tourists, as the roads going up to popular destinations such as Genting and Kuala Lumpur were not affected.<br><br>He said hotels in Johor had been occupied 'to their brim' during the recent flooding.<br></div><div class="quote_body">He said that despite the proposal for a RM20 levy on cars visiting Malaysia, the target of 10 million Singaporean tourists in 2007 was 'achievable, according to Singapore travel trends'.</div></blockquote></div>

With the announcement of the South Johor Economic region, which encompass the districts of Johor Baru, Pasir Gudang and Kulai as well as Jeram Batu, Sungai Karang and Serkat, we will see contiguous to Singapore a new hub," says Malaysia's Minister for International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz.<br><br>The special zone is expected to cover a 2,217 square kilometre area, and Malaysia is widely expected to announce a raft of incentives to get foreign firms to come on board.<br><br>And businesses in Singapore have been urged to explore the new opportunities it offers.<br><br>"We are looking forward to the details of the South Johor Economic Region plans being released. When that is released, of course, we'll study it in detail and like what Minister Rafidah said, Malaysia wants to publicise it and Singapore companies will see how we can fit the plans of the two countries working together," says Singapore's Minister of Trade and Industry Lim Hng Kiang.<br><br>"This is natural because of the proximity, the lower land cost and lower wage cost. Johor's economy complements very well with Singapore's economy," he added.<br><br>Minister Rafidah says the much-awaited details of the special zone could be announced this Friday.<br><br>"I think in the budget it might come out. Wait for (another) three days," says the Malaysian trade minister.<br><br><strong>She also adds that plans to introduce a RM20 levy on foreign cars entering Johor, with effect from September 1, has been scrapped.</strong><br><br>"Johor says 'tak ada', otherwise there will be an announcement," said Minister Rafidah.<br><br>Singapore investments in Malaysia totalled RM2.9 billion last year - up by more than 50% - with more than half going to Johor state.<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>
