            <div class='col-md body'>I'm glad LTA is taking serious view with regards to motorists who install those glaring white or blue headlights. Personally I don't see any difference apart from the color temperature of light from headlamps, and they are very annoying because the glare makes it dangerous for others on the road.<br><br>So thos of you who have these sort of bulbs fitted, be prepared to pay another $1000 for LTA FINE!<br><br>From the New Paper<br>===============================================<br>YOU see them often on the roads.<br><br>Mr Flashy Yuppy Driver with those super-white, super-bright headlamps.<br><br>He probably paid $100 for them.<br><br>Well here's a flash - those lights may be illegal.<br><br>From January to November last year, 169 motorists were caught for various headlamp offences.<br><br>In 2004, the figure was 217, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).<br><br>These include illegal modifications to the headlamp assembly or the bulb to show coloured lights, using faulty headlamps and masking or obscuring headlamps, said LTA.<br><br>The LTA said they do not have a breakdown of the statistics by offence type.<br><br>For these headlamp offences, take heed - there's a maximum penalty of $1,000 or a jail term of up to three months for the first offence.<br><br>Repeat offenders are liable to a maximum penalty of $2,000 or a jail term of up to six months.<br></div>

IMHO, i feel that after market HID installations should be allowed on certain conditions.<br><br>Firstly, proper levelling must be done by maybe authorised companies<br><br>Secondly, the government should put a limit to the brightness of the HIDs. Eg: 6000k or 8000k.<br><br>Considering the fact that installation of aftermarket HID lamps will be another form of decent trade, so why should the government ban such aftermarket installations if the rules and regulations are properly defined and enforced?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
