So u're basically making people get SUVs, and then u WONDER why more and more people are buying SUVs and then u decide to attack SUVs for no good reasons really. Its silly. They make SUVs sound deadlier than they are, but nobody says anything when another trailer or lorry or bus crushes someone to death. How many fatal SUV accidents have u seen in the papers?

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think its the brightness of these HID lights that blinds drivers but rather the angle at which the light is aimed at. Those that are manually or illegally fitted might not have been levelled correctly and thus do not shine down to the road but straight ahead thus blinding other drivers. Factory fitted HID lights like those that come stock/optioned on new cars usually dont blind people?<br><br>That's what I think anyway cause got blinded by a normal lamp vehicle stop with her front wheels ON THE TOP of the hump. stupid driver. she stopped her car angled up (since front on hump) but the lights' angled down = straight ahead after u angle the car up which is freaking blinding. so yeah its the angle not the brightness</div>
