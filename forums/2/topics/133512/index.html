            <div class='col-md body'>At least for Q1 they achieved record sales, juz hope that the lucky streak continues. A major prob if wif their air-con compressors. Wif all my previous nissan drives, it seems that as the a/c unit is installed locally, it tends to break down quite often. My sunny's ride was very quiet in the cabin until the a/c unit broke down and having it replaced the a/c vents emitted a sound every time i turn the a/c/ on, like a vacuum suction.<br><br>When the a/c unit is under warrenty it's ok, at least no cost incurred . But when the warrenty expires, it actually cost 200 - 300 to get a new one if I'm not wrong and that's from workshops outside. Just imagine the cost if you were to send the vehicle back to tan chong.<br><br>Frankly speaking, in their stable only the Infinity if a good ride along wif the brougham vip, that is of course you could afford the one major grip...... &gt; they burn petrol like water. The confort level and ride is comparable to Lexus anytime. And for those wif loads of $$$, the ultimate ride would be th President.<br><br></div>

I can out sprint most car from the traffic light.  The car layout provides one of the best visibility all round with hardly any blindspot and parking it is a breeze esp with reverse sensor. Sliding door and openable rear boot window are blessing.<br><br>However the cabin noise and fuel consumption (8.5-9) needs to work on.</div>
