I udnerstand ur matrix is new so usually new cars need some running in before everythign is like"loosen" out. high consumption is not uncommon because of new tires,the type of tires , new cylindrs, traffic conditions,temp,etc. Even the style of driving plays a big part. Fuel consumption calculation is actually a complicated process if  one wants to delve into it. Havign said that, it is known that certain " korean" makes do "Drink" more than others. jus monitor closely and see how.<br>IMHO, the diff between a ron95/ 98 is no big diff. I stopped V power/CX platinum &amp; find using 95 sufficient now.<br>happy &amp; safe driving all!</div>

Suede is a lot less thick.<br>I guess it's more like a smooth but thick fabric.<br>And really, the milk vomit comes off more easily.<br>My "washable" cover for the child seat is harder to clean (need to soap, scrub, and air dry).<br><br>I've seen several of my friends with leather seats in their Preseas.

            <div class='col-md body'>V-Power is not a marketing Gimmick. It is RON 98 Octane fuel with additives to ehance its ability to be burned in a car's engine. Thus increasing its reactivity. Something like a catalyst. Since It burns hotter and cleaner, you actually get sightly more mileage(around 5-10km) per tank(70L). Petrol is expensive because Fuel companies are aware of their oligopoly. Meaning that consumers have no choice or say in the petrol prices. Adding to their advantage is the 3/4 tank rule that the government has imposed. therefore they are aware that sinagaporean drivers will and must fill up only in singapore. The result is a fuel price that is more than double or even triple anywhere else in the world.<br><br>Personally i use V-power. It cost $7 more per tank of fuel. The real difference is felt when the car hits 3500rpm. This is the peak torque for most cars where the bhp is at its best. so when you pump V-power and is travelling at 80kmh...try grounding your accerlerator, you will FEEL THE DIFFERENCE.</div>
