              <p>Sales in Singapore from Ferrari and Lambo are pretty competitive...with Ferrari inching 2 units more over its rival Lambo... from Jan 2008 to Oct 2008.</p>
              <p>But all these while..sales of Ferrari has always been better than Lambo...</p>

              <p>Lambo's sales is surely increasing steadily over the years and it's not surprising that it might overtake Ferrari within a matter of months.</p>

One factor for this I think is because there are very very few pre-Gallardo lambo's still here (Diablo's, Countach etc.) so most Lambo's are post 2003/2004. On the other hand, there is still a relatively healthy collection of Ferrari's from the 90's here and many 360's, which were first introduced in 1999</p></div>

              <p>Yea...frankly speaking... I am not sure myself.... It's pretty subjective and it all depends on the likes and tastes of those buyers. But since the sales of Lambo are increasing, I guess there will still be a sizeable number of Lambo owners on the roads in time to come...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yep it is definitely very subjective, I would presume that most Ferrari and Lambo buyers here would have driven the other marque before making their final decision, so the actual drive factor is very important. One thing Ferrari does have in it's advantage is it's rich racing heritage and image. As for how they sound, thats also very subjective, haha. Wouldn't really say the Gallardo sounds better than the F430, they're different to me but I love the sound of both just the same</p></div>

              <p>I agree with Elysium that the main reason most prospective buyers choose Ferrari over Lambo is because the former has a longer and richer history, thus its has a larger and more widespread reputation in the world. Another reason could be because Ferrari is like a household name whereby everyone, including non-car enthusiasts, know what it is. This could be due to it being in F1 for so long. Thus, driving a Ferrari would signify a status symbol that everyone can associate the owner with.</p>
              <p>That being said, I myself am not really a keen Ferrari fan. The only models I like are the F430 and Enzo, whereas I absolutely love the LP560 and Murcielago. So Lambo for me me anyday.</p>

              <p>I think Hong Seh must own at least one of the 2 F40's there at the exhibition. I've read that there may be a few more privately owned here, not much chance at all of seeing them if they are here.</p>
              <p>What I do find interesting is I was reading the history of HS and it said that they imported 20 F40's here when they were first released.

              properly back them, or were they just for collection? Or maybe
              en-route to somewhere else like Brunei?</p>

              <p>at first i thought 20 was a large number, but i read from wiki, about 1000+ F40s were produced, so 20 seems a fair amount. But my guess is that majority of the 20 were sold to customers in other countries...</p>

              </span></p><p>like anything else, car choice comes down to personal preference. some people may like the history and image that Ferrari provides, whilst other might like the youth and exuberance of a Lambo. some drivers switch between the 2 marques (or own both) whilst others may remain faithful to one or the other. who's to say why?; if you asked each driver they would probably give you a difference answer. ultimately I'd say buy what makes you happy; I did and I definitely am.</p>
