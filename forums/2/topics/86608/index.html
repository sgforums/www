            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Many thanks your comment. Would you mind sharing more......any complain you have for your car so far (on anything) ?? Will the noise of 323 be unbearable ?? Is the air-con cold enough ?? Any accessories to make the car look more "chio" ??</span><br><br>anyway, this was what u asked from the other side...<br><br>okay, pple driving the mazda323, sorry abt the following comments abt our car... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>1. the most prominent problem is really the noise level. especially when u're driving on expressway at 100kph, the sound can be loud. think it's because of the inadequate sound proofing from the side windows. heard from others who sat in my car that in <strong>other</strong> cars, the sound is really less noticeable.<br>heard that if you change the tyres, it might be better, but really no point since even if it's true, it'll just minimize a little bit.<br><br>But to me, this is not a prob since i like to hear the engine revv and i usually just play a bit of (soft) music to hide the noise.<br><br>But then, people who sat my car before usually have no trouble falling asleep in my car, as the noise actually acts as a sleep-inducer. i'm serious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>And when it rains heavily, wah lau, have to off the music cos you'll need to really concentration from your ears to help you drive, since the noise made by the heavy rain can be really loud. again, i guess it's because of the sound-proofing.<br><br>2. every morning when you start to drive the car, it'll need time to warm up before it gets used to its auto gear changing. example, from gear 1 to 2, you'll need to rev up the rpm before it changes its gear. maybe it's the same for all cars, but if you don't consider this as a problem then it's pretty ok. but sometimes, can be a bit irritating.<br><br>3. the interior of the 323 looks, simple. too simple. if possible, get a black 323 and the interior should look nicer.  again, i'm talking abt a 323 without any accessories. try to get a 323 with leather seats if you're planning to get one.<br><br>4. air conditioning... no complain from me, since i always sit infront (driver mah), but i've sat in my sis's hyundai matriz before, and i would say if both cars were to set the fan speed and temperature to lowest, 323 will be  better. others car, i'm not sure, but people at the back sure need to have some time b4 they can feel the air con for all cars...<br><br>5. and as i've said in the other forum, 323+bodykits, erm, not really a good match. the most decent one i've seen is a black 323 with spoiler. other than that, never really seen a nice one.<br><br>you can change the wheels to a bigger one with sports-version for the rim, might look better. change the handle to the mazda6 type.<br><br>i saw once on the road this 323 changed it's original casing for its lamps from the original red to transparent, erm, no comments for this but you might want to consider.<br><br>I'm not a creative person, but IMHO, difficult to make a 323 look nice lar. but a black 323 should be nice by itself.<br><br></div>

Only the Protege models are fuel-guzzlers (I only get 10-11km/l), the older models can get 12-14km/l...  Front is sporty-looking (My chrome bar in front of the bonnet is no longer chrometo make it more sporty), especially for the sports model, but the back is plain... Noise level i agree its a bit on the high-side (my dad's CRV is so much quieter), but then again my tyres have got pretty good grip... The rain factor that rumie highlighted has never been a problem to me... pick-up is pretty fast for the 1st 2 gears... As for the interior, I think its not bad, mine comes with silver finishing, white dials and a sporty 3-spokes steering-wheel</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lol. why? why? i'm driving a 323. maybe i'm a super ignorant fool but those things you mention bad about the 323 really dusent bother me at all. lol except maybe the noise at 100km/h and above. but i guess that's just bad aerodynamics desgin from mazda. i drive a manual so i dun face the auto gear changing problems. safety wise.... i smashed my left boot into a van the other day.... only the side of my boot kena dented, nothing a few knocks myself from the inside and a big stick couldn't help, and oh yeah the van's right headlights smashed to smitherines. also got a big dent in it. and performance wise i think it's ok ba. very low torque might explain why it feels lathargic when moving off. handling not much of a problem to me. air con quite cold. fuel consumption ok what.... i get 13-14km/l... maybe because i drive manual plus i really dun floor my accelerator. about the body kits and such.... dun bother adding any coz it's really ugly. the 323 has a very high butt. much higher than normal cars as i dunno y the suspension is jacked up so high. i got the sports model and i'm pretty happy with it if you look at the car from the front, not when you look at it from anywhere else. lol. hope this helps about the 323.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
