I've got problem with the SE also when I bought my R2... the SE simply bo chup.. he never bother to update me on the delivery and I've to called him every time to chase him for the delivery.. There was once I've called him from 2pm till 9pm to asked him to collect payment from me... and u know what.. he only return my call around 10pm.. Told him off by saying.. hey.. i need to beg u to collect payment is it?? He told me he's driving... i've replied.. wow.. drive from 2pm till 9pm plus hor.. Was so angry with him... My bf also tried calling him few times, and he dun even bother to return his calls.  I've tried calling my SE team leader that I wanna change my SE but he told me I can't...<br><br>Probably u wanna complain to their manager instead..<br><br>Anyway I've already got my car.. but on the day to meet the SE to collect my car.. I gave him a black face and asked my bf to liaise with him instead.<br></div>
