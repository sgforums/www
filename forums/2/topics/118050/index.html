            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that travelling on a slipway to KJE at a speed of 50km/h with all the prime movers and tipper trucks all swarming over you is more likely to cause an accident than having the SWD removed.IT's just accidents caused by different factors after all.The faster we get the stressed out drivers out of the microwave vehicles, the less chance they have to stay on the road and get charged.Lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I cannot understand... the stress is definitely there.<br>I also drove the Army Defender before... well, besides the usual driving safety concerns, accelerating up and maintaining the speed is a chore. Man, I hate the SWD. Waste of human intellect, being reign by the 4 numbers and the beeps on that indicator device!<br><br>Not that one wants to speed, but the engine is solid good. Go look at the defender specs? Also, who wants an underpowered vehicle to go on mud and the undulating, steep and unpredictable roads in the wild and training ground?<br><br>Anyway, just ask DSTA to design and install SPEED LIMITER to the engine of Army rides. So many vehicles sure got discount on components. Can also sell overseas... which the market is few.<br><br>But think again, with something like that, we sure can enter the auto market and work to make Singapore strong in the ASEAN auto industry too.</div>
