            <div class='col-md body'>AYE is usually taken by the lorries, trucks and mostly trailers due to nearer to the port areas.<br><br>My observation: if the E'way is use by alot these class 4, 5 vehicles along the Lane 3, 4 (or the extreme left lane), you will see more of the Class 3 lorries,vans, pickups hogging onto 2nd lane. And That is when the slow traffic begins.<br><br>No offence to ppl driving Class 3 lorries, vans but not all van, lorries drivers are autmatic one, they just hog on the 2nd lane at 60 to 70kmh.</div>

Of course not for the purpose of jumping Q, but just to filter lane for a turn later on.<br><br>Yesterday when I tried doing that, already 3 wheels into the lane, then heard a soft horn, a yellow cab rush by just to jam brake again right in front of me. That was in a Jam, I already started filtering and 2 cars passed by slowly before I got to where I was before the taxi zoom by me. Impatiences is what accident is all about.</div>

Of course not for the purpose of jumping Q, but just to filter lane for a turn later on.<br><br>Yesterday when I tried doing that, already 3 wheels into the lane, then heard a soft horn, a yellow cab rush by just to jam brake again right in front of me. That was in a Jam, I already started filtering and 2 cars passed by slowly before I got to where I was before the taxi zoom by me. Impatiences is what accident is all about.[/b]</blockquote>thats the point i am saying lor.<br>the problem with impatient drivers... wats the point of switching lanes when<br>there is a jam? This not applies to pple zig zag in lane 2,1 but also to goods vehicles in lane 3 and 2 as well.<br><br>u want good example of jokers.... next time observe those idiots on PIE in 1st lane hogging all the way den suddenly turn out to lornie exit. forcing lane 2,3 cars to slow down.<br><br>or another example in ECP, those idiots who take lane 1 going towards rocher road and cut all the way to suntec exit just after the ERP gantry in the morning.<br><br>goods vehicles on lane 2 don't give way to people coming from lane 3 and the merging lanes.. ur blood sure boil one.</div>

TPs should stop closing one eye to road hoggers.<br><br>I saw a documentary in the US, a traffic watch helicopter flying overhead recorded long stretches of open road infront of road hogging vehicles along several points of a heavily congested highway.   They did an experiment pulling these drivers to the side (cops on bikes did that after getting feedback from the copters) and traffic speeds went up by a significant margin.  Traffic started to flow smoothly.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div></blockquote>To be fair, most heavy vehicles along AYE are rather law-abiding in tat they stuck to their lane.  In fact, the strange thing I see is tis tend to be the smoothest lane of the 3.<br><br>Most times the pile-ups started on the lane 1 (fastest lane), then it'll spill over to lane 2 as impatient cars changed fm lane 1 to 2.  And mind u, there were no accidents wat-so-ever fm the start.  So I tend to deduce tat tis cld be the case of poor driving habits (hoggers, etc...).   If tat's the case, then I'm afraid it's a long road ahead with the "re-education".<br></div>
