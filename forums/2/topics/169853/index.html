            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone...need some opinions on whether i should take up a manual or auto transmission..went down to the showroom and found out that the price difference was $2k between the 2...As im getting a toyota vios mainly due to the good fc and the price is within my budget...would like to find out on what difference can it make in FC when compare to both auto and manual...the sales person recommend that i get auto since there will not be any major differences between the 2...i wonder how true is that....hope to hear from you all.. thanx alot!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a manual can make or break, it depends on your driving habits. if you can resist the temptation to rev too high too often, and instead drive conservatively, it should have better FC than auto. and of course, manual can let you bring out the full potential of the powerplant form time to time. and it seems in vios' specs, the manual's 0-100 is significantly better than the auto's. but then again, there's always the consideration of convenience and easy city driving with the auto.<br><br>so eventually, it's your preference <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi..sorry for the late reply...the current price offering for a manual is 49000++<br>btw im 25...will be sharing the car with my bro...i choose vios because its the most value for money low budget car ard..as we will be keeping the car for long term so we think its better to get a toyota..even if its made in thailand..but it has been proven to be a good car from many owner's feedbacks. Test driven the car, other than the higher noise level and lighter body of the car...everything seems perfect...the interior is so so i must admit<br><br>i also test driven the new rio and verna...both are ok..in fact quieter than vios, but the fuel consumption i heard is not very good</div>
