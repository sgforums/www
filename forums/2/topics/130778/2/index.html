That bus stop wasn't within the "out of bounds" area. In the end it was pure fortune that nobody was at the bus stop. By the way, if anyone was wondering why his EVO5 went into the bus stop, it's because he had a rear brake failure. I was told this by the man himself.<br><br>anyways even if the crowd would not be harmed, in any event all safety precautions should be made to prevent cars from going airborn. indeed in a carpark rally, the dangers of rolling is pretty high due to the curbs all around and the high possiblity of a sideways impact. from my own racing experience, i can safely say it is never plesant to fly. at best, u end up shaken. at worse, spinal injuries.</div>

You can always take the precautionary measures but always expect the unexpected. Got to give it to the guys, they really give it their all even though it was pouring. You've got to give them credit for it. As always drive hard, drive save. At the end of the day, it's not the one standing on the podium that wins but the one that makes it home.</div>
