            <div class='col-md body'>Before u collect ur car, it has to pass thru the pre-delivery inspection (PDI) dept.'s inspection. After dat they will hand over to ur SE who will check the car again before calling u for collection. They wouldn't wanna kena complains from customers too. Dat is y sometimes when they can't deliver ur car on time, it is becoz the car didn't pass @ their stage. (some SEs r more meticulous?)<br><br>If u'r not satisfied when u check ur car, they will rectify it asap. They can't change a new car 4 u coz ur car has been registered under ur name. Once registered, ur log card will state the car's chassis &amp; engine no., color etc + all ur particulars. So, even if u change ur mind about the color of ur car, they won't do it for u.<br><br>Note: if there's any flaws/dents/probs dat u'r not comfortable with during inspection, u don't have to accept it. Coz if u return the next day with ur new car &amp; tell them about the problem which u 'overlooked' the day b4 (they'll presume dat it was ur own carelessness), u probably need to pay for the repairs.</div>
