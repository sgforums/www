(tester's briefing + waiting to watch the video + watching the video + queueing to apply for license (which takes up a great deal of time i can say..wait until pek chek.))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wanted to skip my whole day's lesson, but my supervisor from the Student Internship Programme (SIP) didn't allow.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Cause i'm doing in-house internship. Dunno if you guys heard of that before but yeah, it sucks.<br><br>She saw my TP receipt say test is 1355-1440. So she said she wanted me back by 330pm. I guess i won't get a chance to get my license that day. Maybe will check out the queue then see how. Heheh!<br><br>You know what? The most unluckiest thing happened to me! I lost my PDL just last Thursday! And my TP is so near! Now i gotta waste another 30 bucks to get another PDL on Monday!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Sigh.. i better pass. So wasted my 30 bucks.<br>Just the other day i had a lesson in the circuit, i have problem on the slope. Kinda panicked somewhat. You know when you start off from the slope (item 12,13 i think) you gotta step accelerator until 2000-2500rpm then start to release clutch then after you get you clutch on biting point you'll feel your car edging forward. Lastly release handbrake right?<br><br>I accelerated until 6000rpm (could hear the engine rev) yet my car just rolled backwards. My instructor said he can tell that i'm nervous. Never had a problem like this before! Got another lesson today, probably will test my starting-off-slope techniques again outside on the main roads. Hope i'll have enough confident for wednesday. Thankfully it's not an Immediate Fail if i don't roll more that 1 metre , right?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me myself is also from tp and i passed for not even 2 mths. actually my test time was 8am in the morning and was probably the 1st candidate that the tester was gonna test me. I did everything smoothly and gotten less than 10pts. So i think I brightened up his day abit?<br><br>anyway, just dont make any silly mistakes like Speed too slow for road conditions or insufficient acceleration. Abit of here and there( imagine 2 pts each) can cost u dearly. u cannot afford to lose too many pts.<br><br>Just make sure u realise your mistakes now and dont repeat them again. If still in doubt, dont hesitate to practice as many times as possible during warm up.<br><br>But lastly, everything still boils down to the tester's mood.<br></div>
