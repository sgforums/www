            <div class='col-md body'>Ok yesterday I was at Orchard Road, the HMV road junction if you knew what I mean. After crossing the road and heading for Cineleisure, I heard the police siren ... seconds later, a traffic police sped to the junction, stopped his bike beside the road and ran to the centre of the junction. Seconds later, 1 or 2 more bikes sped past the junction. Should have seen the faces of the drivers, they were like totally in shock! Then, the traffic police stopped cars from cutting across the horizontal main road i.e. the stretch from Borders -&gt; Paragon -&gt; Heeren -&gt; Emerald didn't require stopping at all.<br><br>Then, it finally dawned upon me wat the heck was happening ... seconds later a white car zoomed past, an another, an another ... and they had number plates with '1', '3', '4', and '18' ! NO ALPABHETS, only NUMBERS! The traffic police were actually there to 'kai lu' so that the VIPs would not be stuck in Orchard Road ...<br><br>Kaoz ... imagine driving around with a car with number plate '1' ... coolz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At least it's stopped for VIPs...<br><br>The other time (ard upper bt timah), sirens of the police were heard. Traffic police stopping at the junction signalling vehicles to stop. We waited and saw a lot of police cars and motors and expecting to see VIPs also.<br><br>Then.....we saw those big, long vehicles (containers) with the words <strong>"Important Goods from China"</strong>.<br><br>Faint.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you are driving a VIP vehicle or a car with diplamatic plates on official business, the police have to ensure that your car does not stop.  This is to prevent terrorist acts on your person.<br><br>I happened to be in these convoys before.  It's quite fun because you get to break the traffic law, have your car photo taken at speed cameras and red-light cameras etc and it's approved.<br><br>But sometimes, people stare so much at you that you do feel a little awkward too.  The convoy that you saw was probably heading towards the Istana with either the president on board or the PM on board.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It happened to me before at the intersection of Beach Road from Ben Sheares Bridge. I took a cab from Beach road and the interesection was blocked, and i see a huge convoy of vehicles all mercs and like what Darkforce say, no alphabets, and they bore the "luminous" colours in the windscreen.<br><br>Hmm... must be some VIP that came from the airport.<br><br>Worse off, the traffic was stop and my metre went up $1.50 (waiting time).</div>
