And that the type of meters available don't really meet what i fully want at the moment... Hopefully the range will increase soon...<br><br>Well, i think CM really will void electronics warantee if you install, those jokers are sneaky, base on experience and what i've heard.<br><br>Though having said that, Can't really blame them if an outside installer causes damages due to carelessness. Guess no one wants to get into subjective arguments like what type of damage void which electronics area warantee; so they have a blanket policy...<br><br>So far I'm hittin 19k km, while electronics is ok (no reason not to be unless really big fault), but I'm not so confident on the quality of their mechanicals and workmanship....<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

But you can approach Cartonic to get it in. As for installation, it's a drop-in, direct replacement  for the stock paper filter, so you don't need to look for someone to install. Can DIY, just follow instructions in the user manual...<br><br>I should get it in a week or two, as the supplier's good.
