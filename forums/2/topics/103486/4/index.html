Plus i am usually late for work  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> so when the car is more run in, I'm become a bit more boh chap haha Anyways, 2 schools of thoughts in this : 1) Minimise rev until engine warmed up; 2) drive slowly so that engine warms up quicker and minimise time operating in the non-optimum temp  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, also feel that burn away gas doing nothing &gt;2 minutes a day also quite sayang<br><br>about the compressor, there are gas products that you can pump into the aircon system that manufacturers claim will minimise the difference in power when the compressor kicks it. I am considering on trying that...<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div></blockquote>Hey buddy... thanks for your feedback.

A friend of mine told me he could clock 420km with a full tank. I thought that was kinda near impossible for me. The most I could do was between 360 to 380.
