VVT engine is the not so intelligent of the vvt-i. Besides the turbo fitted into the car makes it fast. The car is ticked to get a fast pickup so so the gear ratios in the first few gears should be quite high. So thats why your cars have quite a noisy ride at 120km/h. Anyway still a great car to show off speed in singapore. But at least if u revv your engine hard enough and change the gears fast enough, u shld hear those kinda piuuuuuu should from your intake and exhaust of the engine. Pls correct me if i'm wrong in any part. Cuz i only sec1.... lol... But dun all those ah peh drive this car tell me hor.... they sure dun know anything one..... so only comment if u know and u are sure... dun comment things u dunno.</div></blockquote>A SIS is not TC!!! A close ratio gearbox ensures that you do not feel power lack or jam (too much and the car roar loud and yet slow) in between when different gear is engaged...<br><br>So if the engine is not fast, what else?
