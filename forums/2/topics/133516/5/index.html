Anyway back to the matter at hand.<br><br>1) I believe we are talking about the M3 and not the 3-Series yeah?<br><br>2) I have never seen an M3 order tracked from South Africa. Even my upcoming M3 being built as we speak is in EU and will be on a ship from there over here.<br><br>3) Showrooms/Dealers order the cars as they can get dealer price (MSRP - BMW Price) thus a higher profit margin than if the customers order the car themselves. However MOST M3 owners would like to individualise their cars and thus the "private" order.<br><br>4) Refer to points 1 &amp; 2.<br><br>Cheers!</div></blockquote>hi, congrats on getting the last un-"bangal"ed BMW<br>think u better 2x- check with ur SE where ur car is made.<br><br>did u order from PML ? or PI ?<br><br>What color did u order ? any individual options ?<br>If its some special individual option and the SA plant cannot accomodate it, it will be made in germany then.<br><br>There are actually different level of "individual" .<br>those that ask u to top up for a special paintjob or leather which are selected from a catalog is just the basic.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly speaking, apart from the 7 and 5-series hoo-ha, what's wrong really about Bangle's design? It is very daring though, I'd say. But look at the 6-series, the new E90 3-series and have you seen the E90 M3? It is a killer! And personally, I've grown to like all his designs. They give me a deeper impression compared to some of the older models, although the E39 5-series's design is timeless. I think we ought to give this guy a chance, after all, his work saves or destroys BMW. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Google under bmw's new german plant. Its a sight to behold. The production line is touted to be so flexible that it can produce any of the bmw series. Meanwhile, S.A. continues to produce 3 series since E36. Also, the US plant now produces Z4, X3 and X5.<br><br>My Choice of cars (in order) :<br>1) Made in Germany BMW M3<br>2) Made in Japan Mitsubishi Evo9<br>3) Made in South Africa BMW M3<br><br>We should expect  high standards out of our cars.<br>Money-wise : After houses, cars are the 2nd largest purchase u'll ever make in your lifetime (for most pple).<br>Safety-wise : safety is not just about the ABS and airbags.

I too know SA produces 3 series since E36, so?? It produced 3 series shows it is not automated?? Lower factories' standard?? Try a better one to make believe.
