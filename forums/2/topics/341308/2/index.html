              <p>sorry to butt in on the exchange. actually i tink the security at the vivo carpark needs to be much more alert. my friend's car got scratched when he parked it there earlier this yr. he certainly didn't ask his wife to chope a parking lot. and he didn't even know if it's cos he unwittingly offended someone while parking his car. :/</p>
              <p>it's true tt the singaporeans who do inconsiderate things (like the blue suzuki guy) are an ugly lot, but even worse are those who take things into their own hands to punish the pple who supposedly offended them.  </p>
