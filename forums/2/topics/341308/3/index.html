              <p>This is subjective, new to us though. If you can take tissue to

              <p>Have u seen people in private housing areas using dustbins and

              <p>Legally if they are gona fight the case, the woman will lose. The reasons below would be sufficient to win the case..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Parking lots are for cars, by standing there doesn't necessary means the lot is reserved. There is no black/White to prove her resrvation of the lot. Instead, by standing there the woman is obstructing the traffic. She would be liable for act of inconsiderate behaviour, public nuisance and causing public inconvenience..</p>
              <p>2) There is no legal systems for resevration of parking lots. Moreover, the carpark belongs to the building management, They are the ones who can 'chope' lots...not any tom dick or harry...First comes First served...and this oni means vehicles...not humans...</p>
              <p>3) Lastly, the man who pointed middle finger at the victim could be charged. Under Chapter 258 Part IV Section 28 of Public Order (Preservation) Act, <em>Any person who in any place in a proclaimed area uses any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guilty paeople out there..think twice before u starting pointing middle fingers at others and take situation in your own hands.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I won't know how to react when it happens to me. Should I move off or should I stand my ground? If I reverse my car halfway, of course the guy can't park and so can't me, so it may boils down to patience.</p>
              <p>Of course, even if you park, you won't have peace of mind cause you constantly worried about the state of your car.  If we back down, does it means we are "bullied" out of it?</p>
              <p>I just quite annoyed that the guy said he is not singaporean, so why he doing the singaporean thingy of coping lots?</p>
