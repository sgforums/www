              <p><strong><span id="lblStTitle">Female carpark bully: If I can 'chope' seat with tissue, I can 'chope' parking lot<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <div>STOMPer <strong>Sadpanda</strong> wanted to reverse into an available lot at VivoCity's carpark, but was stunned to find a woman standing in the middle of it. <br> <br> He signalled to tell her he was reversing, but was shocked to be told that the lot was reserved for her husband. <br> <br> John tells STOMP: <br> <br> “Yesterday (Dec 14), I arrived at the VivoCity’s carpark just before
              7pm and found a nice lot near the lift lobby. I wanted to reverse in
              but there was this woman standing in the lot. <br> <br> “She appeared to be texting someone on her phone so I signalled my
              intention to reverse into the lot and even lowered my window to let her
              know I was coming in. <br> <br> “She told me to park elsewhere as she was 'chope-ing' the lot for her husband who was on his way.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Dumbfounded, I told her, "You can't do that". <br> <br> “First come first serve. She told me off and said she can. <br> <br> "Her justification to me was that, "If I can chope seat in a foodcourt with a tissue packet, I can chope a parking lot."<br> <br> “Moments later, her husband finally arrived in his blue Suzuki swift. <br> <br> "As I was in a half-parked position since his wife was standing in the
              lot, he stopped in the middle of the driveway, came out of the car,
              took stock of the situation and waved me along, asking me to find
              another lot since his wife came first. <br> <br> “I said "No way! How can anyone do this? And get away with it?" To
              which he even dared to say, "Surely you have seen people do this
              before?" <br> <br> “I told him that they were being unreasonable. He denied being so and
              said instead that I was the one being unreasonable. He accused ME of
              being “kiasu” and should instead go look for another lot. We argued for
              a few minutes, passers-by came and went and eventually cars started to
              pile up behind and were honking.<br> <br> “Cursing my own damn luck to meet this couple, I swallowed my pride and
              moved off so as not to obstruct traffic. I did find a lot after I moved
              off and gladly parked in it. <br> <br> “As I walked to the lobby, I caught sight of the couple and went
              towards them, demanding an apology. They shoo-ed me off and warned me
              of harassing them, even threatening to call the police. I told them
              they epitomised the true blue ugly Singaporean to which he answered,
              "Sorry to disappoint you but I'm not Singaporean". <br> <br> "Obviously a crowd of curious shoppers took notice. He showed me the middle finger and shouted vulgarities at me. <br> <br> “How can people get away with such thing? Have we lost total decency and decorum?” <br> <br> Do you think it is all right for people to reserve lots this way? Tell us.<br><br>SGC4804Y, blue suzuki swift!<br><br><em>anyone guilty of doing the above stunt? i think this couple is bullsh1t! scratch the car if anyone of us find it somewhere okay!! </em><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></div>

              <p>i think the driver shouldnt have moved off. stay half parked and
              call security to complain of the nuisance. I'm sure obstructing a
              parking lot can be counted as public nuisance.</p>

              <p>I agree with this....encountered same thing a few years back at Raffles City carpark...my dad was the driver....2 guys with malaysian accent....1 guy " booking" a lot..but my dad took the live and let live approach....I tell U I wouldnt lor...got time I will play all the way...get security to come in...if kenna threaten...call the police straight.</p>
              <p>And to be honest....that's not even the most riduclulous thing I have ever met in my years of driving.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>To drive on sg road..apart from driving skill....should be patience liao.Ppl in general are quite lacking in this.</p>
