              <p>Seriously, I won't know how to react when it happens to me.
              Should I move off or should I stand my ground? If I reverse my car

              <p>Of course, even if you park, you won't have peace of mind cause
              you constantly worried about the state of your car.  If we
              back down, does it means we are "bullied" out of it?</p>

              <p>Legally if they are gona fight the case, the woman will lose. The reasons below would be sufficient to win the case..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Parking lots are for cars, by standing there doesn't necessary means the lot is reserved. There is no black/White to prove her resrvation of the lot. Instead, by standing there the woman is obstructing the traffic. She would be liable for act of inconsiderate behaviour, public nuisance and causing public inconvenience..</p>
              <p>2) There is no legal systems for resevration of parking lots. Moreover, the carpark belongs to the building management, They are the ones who can 'chope' lots...not any tom dick or harry...First comes First served...and this oni means vehicles...not humans...</p>
              <p>3) Lastly, the man who pointed middle finger at the victim could be charged. Under Chapter 258 Part IV Section 28 of Public Order (Preservation) Act, <em>Any person who in any place in a proclaimed area uses any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guilty paeople out there..think twice before u starting pointing middle fingers at others and take situation in your own hands.</p>

              infront of me waiting for a lot. he was eyeing the one on his
              right, who is also exiting.<br> <br> he cudnt reverse as there was another car behind, also waiting for
              a lot.<br> <br> he moved forward.. before i could move out, another car was also
              eyeing the lot that was infront of me.<br> <br> now all 4 cars are stuck. 2 want to exit, 2 want lots.<br> <br> i reversed back into my lot, like indicating "you all decide what
              to do 1st. i'll go out when clear" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br> <br> the first car that was eyeing the other lot had to lan lan suck
              thumb and drive off to clear the congestion. he too exited the
              carpark. dono go where.</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt;<strong>Sadpanda</strong> wanted to reverse into an available lot at VivoCity's carpark, but was &gt;&gt;stunned to find a woman standing in the middle of it. <br><br>&gt;&gt;He signalled to tell her he was reversing, but was shocked to be told that the lot &gt;&gt;was reserved for her husband.</p>
