            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone read the papers recently?<br><br>A 22 years old car salesgirl, Xue Li, died in a fatal car accident 3 days ago while accompanying a 20+ years old customer to test drive a Mazda MX-5.<br><br>The customer came during her knock off time, but not wanting to tell the customer come another day, she decided to accompany him to test drive the car. Such a pity, her generous goodwilled intention ended up she losing her life.<br><br>i'm so frustrated, and you know what? that irresponsible good-for-nothing driver is alive and didn't even suffer any injuries!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
