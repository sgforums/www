So if 5 days in workshop, he dun have to work, and still got money.<br><br>He got put triangle sign?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Was the taxi stationary because of traffic jam in front or taxi was breakdown?<br>If it was due to traffic jam, he was stationary, then your vehicle hit onto his, you were at fault already. He sure want to claim from you, because you failed to keep a proper outlook and maintain safe distance to the front.  My views....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my encounter with a taxi happened a few months ago... near a traffic junction. I was behind this cab and he wanted to make a right turn,  he braked and he stopped pretty suddenly, with the rear just sticking out of the right filter lane. I was quite close behind and i  braked but couldn't swerve in time, my right front impacted against his rear left bumper. No damage to his bumper, but that bumper cracked my signal lamp cover and made a fist-sized dent just behind it. Yeah in this case it was more of my fault cos i was following a little to close (and in a rush), the cab driver saw that nothing obvious happened to his bumper and said it was alright. Guess i was kinda lucky.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i look at his bumper for quite long but i cant find any damages at all that why i dun wanna give him any money. anyway since i never take photo but he never take photo as well, what evidence does he got or can make use against me? he just took my plate no. and that all. is there chances that i can deny? anyway if he already made report then there is no chance to settle outside already right?<br><br>thanks for all the replies!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did he take down ur ic?<br><br>If he didn't, then chances are high that u can deny.<br><br>But............<br><br>U know for his taxi, he need to put $1000 deposit himself, and the $1000 deposit can be confiscated by the company if he injures the car, so i don't blame the uncle for being a little over the mark even when u claimed that there's no dent.<br><br>U have to understand, if his deposit get confiscated after evaluation by his company which from i heard is vvv guai lan, they confiscate at smallest case possible, how many days he have to drive to earn back?<br><br>And besides the main point is, u did rammed into him, so i wouldnt siam if i'm u. Just accept the responsibility.<br><br>Facing the music takes courage, but people will admire you more. Publicly asking how to deny charges sounds like pure cowardice.

You did not stop in time and hit the taxi.<br><br>You if you slightly  touch - how come there is scratches ? Face the fact - you are not a car expert, also can be internal damages to the car !<br><br>Don't be a fool and try to deny it ! You will get yourself into one hell of trouble.<br>The taxi driver will sure to send his taxi to the IDAC which will take photo of the external and internal damages .... you can say what you want and even with photos  .... but it is of no value as IDAC photo of the internal and external will be taken and used as damage accessment.<br><br>You try to deny ? hello he got your licence plate down, you scratch his car - you think there is no trace of your car paint on his bumper ...... you do stupid things like that = hit and run = want to go to jail ?<br><br>Frankly the damage is done, you cannot judge from appearance what the damage is, just call it your fault and unluckly day and just let the insurance pay it .<br><br>if you try anything, you would end up in court ....... look at the case ....recently for a small amount of money... by the time it went court, it will jack up all the lawyer fee... as you hit him from behind - you are a fault - think there is enough evidence to point you there, so ...... in the end after dragging on .... you may instead of just the damage - the cost of both side lawyers ... you still have to pay !!! .. if it worth it ? A few hundred to a thousand  ..... grow to ten thousands of dollars ? In the end, frankly you still hit his ass, put yourself in the position of a netural judge - what the ending will be like ? The judge is there to judge who is at fault,  you are at fault !! he will still base on IDAC recommendation on damages !!!<br><br></div>
