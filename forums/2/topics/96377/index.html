            <div class='col-md body'>send the BMW to VICOM or AAS and ask them to do a check for you. They have such service. They are the experts in detecting any minor damges.<br><br>The fee is about S$120 and they can detect any accident repair b4, engine condiction ok etc.<br><br>If the seller refused to have it vertified by VICOM or AAS, then obviously there are things to hide.<br><br>As for 2nd hand dealer, I if the car is VICOM certified, check the dates of the certification. If the date is more than 2 months, get them to send to VICOM or AAS again.<br><br>Do be warned that nowadays, there are many 2nd hand car dealers renting out the cars that are supposed to be sold. You can easily find them in ST classifieds ads.<br><br>So be careful.<br><br>1 more thing, if you can afford BMW, you can must also be prepared for the high service / maintenance costs and fuel consumption. These cost are MUCH MUCH higher than japanese cars.<br><br>Hope this will help you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
