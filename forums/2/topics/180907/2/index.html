So u need to monitor the prices of your favourite model and strike when the prices is low.<br><br>At the current 12k MAR COE, Sunny (A) is 52800 (after discount).<br>I got my auto at 49000 in the last 12K COE. So new buyers are actually paying $3800 more than my car price at the same COE.  The same goes for Toyota and Honda etc. <strong>The increase in car prices is never the same as the increase in COE's price.</strong><br><br>Having <strong>paid more</strong>, new buyers will have a <strong>better chance </strong>to secure a COE that is higher than the COE when they booked. Technically, you should get your car faster. Take note that the estimated time to get your car include the period after securing a COE...which is from 10 days to 30 days (depending on dealers).<br><br>But it is true that salesman only secure sales. The COE bidding is left to the main dealer Tan Chong (as with other brands). If you want some trill, log on the COE online bidding website on Wednesday afternoon.</div>

I was like you quite worried throughout the COE biddings but yesterday got mine on the 3rd bidding out of 6. Including myself, none of my frendz failed to secure COE. I would say your worries are quite minimum.<br><br>Let me share with you my analysis.<br><br>- Booked my Sunny end Feb'06. Selling price based on end Feb'06 COE was $10,284.<br><br>- COE was secured at $11,901 early Apr'06 on the 3rd bid out of 6. The 6th bid will be around mid May'06 if con't to fail from start.<br><br>- Meaning to say, TC top up $1617 in order to secure the COE. There'll definitely be some margin in the selling price to buffer for COE increase during the 6 biddings if it really happened.<br><br>- My Sunny is expected to reached SG end Apr'06, and ready either 1st or 2nd week of May'06. TC would not be able to register &amp; prep the car with freebies which varies from customer to customer without securing COE.<br><br>- With the speculation of COE climbing, TC may not want to take chance to bid low when shipment date is near. What if the COE surge sky high on the next bid which went out of the buffer?<br><br>- Guess that the assumed buffer is around $2000 for my case, or rather TC willing to top up around $2000.<br><br>When is your Sunny booked?<br>When is the expected shipment date?<br>When is the expected date for collection?<br><br>Maybe I can help to analyze for you if I'm correct on mine.</div>
