            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. Know its useless but just letting off some frustration.<br><br>Was having dinner with my mum yesterday at Hougang area. When I come back to fetch the car, which is about 45min later, found a big patch of paint (more than 10cm in width) at the front right bumper kena scrapped off! And the driver actually just went away! Arrghhh...... what is this man! That inconsiderate bugger! Heart really pain to see my car turns from white to black on that patch! Can't believe that someone who parks the car so lousily still have their license around. Now not too sure if I wanna go to touch up the patch, which I'm sure will cost at least 60 bucks or more.<br><br>Why am i so angry, cos this is actually the 3rd case around me for the past two months. Just last month, my friend brand new Toyota Vios (2 days old only) park legally at the parking lot at macpherson area (parellel parking). And when he came back from dinner, he found a 20cm scrapped mark on his back bumper. His happiness of owning a new car straight away turns into unhappiness. Spend quite a sum to spray it back to original.<br><br>And just 10 days ago, a colleague of my got his car banged into as well. He also park legally in a parellel parking lot outside the office. He's on half day leave and when he is about to left for home, found that the driver side of his car got banged and dented in badly, with badly scratched mark as well, all over the door and part of the side front! Worst case of the three. On the spot, we found a front light light of that of the Suzuki Swift, which we believe belong to that car who banged into his Sunny. Imagine the impact. And like the two previous case, the driver just ran off! TIll today he has not repaired the car yet as it will cost him much more money than any of us.<br><br>What is S'pore becoming to man!!!! Why can the person be a man (hopefully they are) and admit their mistake. I know its kinda evil to think this way, but one day, I hope this will happen to them also, so they will feel our pain! Sigh..... hope all of you drivers out there have better luck.</div>
