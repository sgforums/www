              <p>What's wrong with buying a 2nd hand car? If you don't have the budget but need the transport, there's absolutely nothing wrong in buying a 2nd hand car where the 1st owner would have kindly absorbed much of the dep for the first few years, not to mention many highly considerable cars which might have currently EOL-ed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Less than 30k?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the COE Cars, ie more than 10 years old/renewed COE, the COE CAT A, which would generally comprise of Nissan Sunny, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mitsubishi Lancer, and the occasional MX5s with classic flip up headlights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>COE CAT B, generally mostly 200E/E200, 318.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for PARF Cars, ie less than 10 years old, generally hard to find sub 30k 2nd hand cars, unless it's OPC cars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question is.... what type of car are you looking for? Because sub 30k is actually very general, it's equivalent to saying "I have 300k, recommend a sports car" kind of situation, so please do let us know what type of car you have in mind / your requirements.</p>

              <p>For first time car owners, the option of a 2nd hand car has my vote. </p>
              <p>For seasoned car owners, it's best to buy it 1st hand. </p>
              <p>With a budget of 30K, I'm not for sure what options are available unless you're talking about an OPC?</p>
              <p>Determine your budget, find out what models you're after, shop around popular belts, test drive the models and find out more information from a reliable agent.</p>
              <p>Things to look out for before you ink the deal, take a look at the certificate of approval from LTA. Find out the last service date of the car, check the shelf life of tyres, car battery, condition of interior are important too. </p>

              <p>You wish to take loan for COE cars? Do take note that when loaning for second hand cars, the interest rate is usually higher than when you buy a first hand car, hence even if the list price is about 30odd k, your monthly installment can still be around the 500-600 range, plus with older cars, maintanence and parts will take up a considerable portion of your budget as wear and tear is bound to happen. Just go to SHC and ask the EG/K owners there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For that matter, I'd feel that buying a first / second hand PARF korean / malaysian car might be better. Cars such as the Kia Cerato have been proven to be more or less worth it to buy for owners with slightly smaller budget at the expense of say, FC, as compared to Jap Cat As, while malaysian cars such as the Proton Wira is based on the previous generations of Mitsubishi Lancer (using the same 4G13 engine if I recall correctly), so parts will be avaliable and repairs/replacement costs and labour costs across the border is definately much more affordable.</p>

              <p>No, not neccesarily you have to take a loan. You have the choice to pay in full, ie cash, and you also have the choice to take up a loan (Do take note, for COE cars, most of the time the loan will be provided by their so-called in-house "finance", and their rates will not be.. low.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if you do choose to pay by cash, do take note that the price that you see listed on sgcarmart is not the only amount that you have to pay. When you go and see the car and test drive, etc, and decide, there will suddenly be a lot of additional fees, such as Transfer fee, and they will find means and ways to make you pay more (such as the ever cork "administrative fees") and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also do take note that for COE cars, it is better to get from reputable second hand car dealers then just choosing one at Ubi or Thomson/West Coast and just drive away, some of the more reputable ones offer 6-month warranty at their workshop (You will NOT believe how many of those COE cars, you drive out one week and things will inevitably suddenly start to spoil here and spoil there). Do budget for unexpected repairs and maintanence, and do not 100% believe when they say 'just serviced' 'no repairs needed' 'good running condition' etc. I've seen a lot of cars praised to the high heavens by the dealers but less than 1 month, things start to spoil. Highly advisable if you get someone mechanically-savvy to go and look see with you. The cars won't be in perfect condition, but things such as chasis/rusting/essentials must be in acceptable condition.</p>

              <p>Depends on what constitutes good fuel consumption to you.</p>
              <p>13-14km is considered gd fc for some. i'm doing 8-9km and forking out between $200- $250 max from point A to point B a month. best to consult sunny owners. maybe others who know a lot more about car engines and fc can comment.</p>
