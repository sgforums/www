            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The most common road crash is a nose-to-tail impact caused mainly by a lack of understanding of how to brake properly. We have all seen or heard it and anyone who has been driving for any length of time has probably experienced it first hand - the sickening screech of tyre on road followed by a very solid thump. It's most agonising to be in the stationary car at the front of the queue watching Mr Inattentive about to inflict the front of his car on you....<br><br>Being confronted with an emergency situation has one immediate affect - it rapidly raises your heart rate about threefold and fear takes control of your car. Understanding what is about to happen when you jump on the brake pedal is the only way of being able to calmly operate in this situation. A locked wheel will not stop you as fast as a wheel that is rotating with a braking affect. In fact, the best braking happens when the braking effort is being applied to the point just before lock-up.<br><br>You only have to watch a racing car on a track to see this first-hand - a lock-up mistake usually results in the car leaving the track or at best running wide in a corner and losing positions to other competitors. The other huge disadvantage of a locked front wheel is that it renders the vehicle out of control. No steering can take place if the wheel is not turning.<br><br>The most efficient method of stopping in an emergency is threshold braking, also sometimes called cadence braking.<br><br>Threshold braking involves technique and feel. Squeeze the pedal firmly so you get the feel of hanging in the seat belts as the weight of the car transfers forwards. This puts more weight over your front wheels - which is good, because it's the front wheels that do most of the braking. Now that you have a higher grip level to play with, all that is remaining is to keep an even and firm pressure on the pedal over the remainder of the stopping distance.<br><br>Knowing how hard you can press the brake pedal before the wheels lock up can only be found out through experience. But you need to understand this - if during an emergency stop you hear the ominous sound of tyre squeal and start to smell smoke, un-squeeze the pedal by a small amount to stop the lock-up and regain control! This is where some finesse is required. Come off the brakes too much, and your (so far) well controlled stop will suddenly speed up and extend the stopping distance that you initially required...<br><br>The most important advantage of threshold braking is that it leaves you in control and with the ability to steer around an obstacle. If you let fear take control, the brakes will be jabbed hard not giving time for any weight transfer and so locking the wheels. The result is an extended stopping distance without the ability of the driver to steer. It's for this reason that ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) was invented.<br><br></div>
