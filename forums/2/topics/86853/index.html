            <div class='col-md body'>i bought my car after a year since i passed my test. abt 2 weeks before i collected my car, i did comtemplated of going for some sinilar refresher course like the one you mentioned. basically, they teach you how to manoevour in mscp, busy roads like orchard road, etc.<br><br>i didn't go for it eventually, figure that it's a waste of money. of cos, my car was an auto car so i don't need and refresher course when it comes to basic car handling.<br><br>i have this blind spot mirror attached to the my side mirrors that helped me immensely when it comes to sharp turning at mscp and during parking. and after that for the next 1.5years, i never had any serious damages to my car.<br><br>yes, i did bang my bumpers onto some pillars when parking, but those incidents were purely stupidity from my side.<br><br>really, unless those refresher course uses your new car for the trial, i find it unnecessary. i mean, different car got different ways to guage when driving mah~<br><br>and for those "inconsiderate ah-bengs" drivers... in my opnion the instructors might be able to give you advice, but seriously, to how many DIFFERENT ah-bengs drivers can these advices be used on? too many of them lar, you'll need to write a thick book to complie all of them lor.</div>

Let people know u new hand... U warm up urself abit lor... Around ur neighbourhood... Choose timin whereby not so many cars than drive... Till u confi liao, slowly slowly, step by step than go out to more busy road lor...<br><br>Actually u learnin n u pass out already not much of a diff mah... Also the same, is drivin... Only diff is mayb no one to guide u thru ur mistakes... Jus drive carefully, fully used all tat u have been taught, be a safe driver lor...<br><br>Jus ignore them lor...<br><br>MOst impt is tat u r not in the fault... U drive ur car, they drive their car... My dad always tell me to keep in ur lane, tat's all lor... don go eat into other people lane... People always tend to bully u when u slow or do somethin wrong, they horn at u...<br><br>Actually i feel tat it makes it worst lor... Makes u more dunno how to react... Can u belive it, i still tremble sometimes lor... When i drivin... Haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Really lah.... Jus don worry...<br><br>Don tailgate... Keep a safe followin distance... So in case suddenly people stop or wat, u got time to react lor... Always check blindspot... Not very impt u may feel, but u nev know lor... Better safe than sorry...<br><br>Make sure safe then u change lane... Not confi, don hiong hiong go into the lane... Whenever u do somethin... U mus be very sure wat u r doin lor... Eg, u dunno u can squeeze past tat narrow road or wat, inbtw some car or buses, then u don tak the risk lor...<br><br>I wish u all the best!<br><br>Sometimes when we made a mistakes, esp when u new... jus lift up ur hand, say sorry lor... or if the person gives way to u specially...
