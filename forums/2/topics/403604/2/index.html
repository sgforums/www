              <p>If the above is really of suspicion, I really think you should persist with the police on the case, on a basis of a (potential) criminal offence for intently endangering the lives of others for the purpose of faking claims (something along this line). If the police takes it lightly (which they might have assumed it's just a normal injury-free accident, so nothing to follow up (or too lazy)), try writing to the Straits Times forum. But have it wirtten objectively, and do not accuse anyone being guilty. Phrase it in a way it is of concerns that there is no recourse for further investigation of something clearly of concerns and potentialy risking the lives of others..</p>
              <p>1) Good if you have the taxi driver's paritculars as your witness</p>
              <p>2) Good if there are other people in the forum that have witnessed the same stunt.</p>
              <p>3) If investigation pursues, the police should be able to</p>
              <p>---determine if the bike was really on fire that day. If it was really on fire, there should be evidence of burnt part somewhere. If the person claims that the bike has already been repaired, he will have to produce evidence that the bike was already repaired for fire and so on.</p>
              <p>-- determine if there has been numerous claims filed by the same person (and repaired under the same workshop with exorbitant amount). All this will be a case for suspicion. And if the person is indeed been doing this for sometime, investigations will reveal that there is a certain pattern of claims. And previous motorists where the bikers have claimed against should be able to provide further details.</p>
              <p>However, it is also likely that after all the trouble, the police may still say there is no case for investigation (as everything has been assumed), but by having it air openly, the police will be on their toes and alert of future similar cases..</p>
              <p>Of course, the above is assuming that the motobike rider is highly-likely guilty.</p>
