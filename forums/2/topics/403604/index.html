            <div class='col-md body'><p>hello everyone.<br><br>today at 0550hrs CTE(SLE) direction aft PIE slip rd entry, before Braddell Rd exit, i was involved in an RTA.<br><br>a motorcyclist left his BLACK motorcycle unattended on lane 4 on the 5-lane CTE. no hazard light(it's a 2A bike). rider was on shoulder, i realised.<br><br>i swerved upon seeing the bike, unfortunately spun, hit the concrete barrier on shoulder twice before coming to a stop on lane 4. i also hit his friend's bike which was parked beside the concrete barrier 10 metres ahead, also no hazard light. damages to my car and friend's bike. no damages to black motorcycle. his friend was also on road shoulder with him, doing zilch.<br><br>friend insisted that the black motorcycle was "on fire". there was NO fire. got aggressive. told him, "nvm wait for police." two bengkias on CBR400.<br><br>i was having a slow drive to send my gf to her hougang home on lane 4 at 80km/h. a friend w/ his gf was behind my car on a motorcycle enroute to woodlands. he saw me spun and could brake in time &amp; avoid.<br><br>a taxi came some 8mins l8r and looked for driver of car, that would be me. he told me that he was infront of me by some 70metres. he too swerved to avoid the bike &amp; saw me spinning out on his rear view mirror. felt it was negligent on part of the rider. willing to be my witness and gave particulars to me and police.<br><br>now my car is parked outside the workshop. i think it's closed today. just have to play the waiting game. oh and the best part...<br><br>i drove my damaged car slowly to the workshop. the "supposedly on fire" bike was working perfectly fine as the rider rode it and left the accident scene.<br><br>what is with the motorcyclist and his motorcycle?<br><br>i am glad everyone's fine. my gf's fine, though shocked. but it goes to show that you can be one careful driver, even not speeding and keeping to left of expway but all it takes is just one negligent motorist to send my insurance skyhigh. quite pissed actually.</p></div>

              <p>Just make sure you provide all details and pictures when you make your claim. So if those guys try to claim through their insurance, your insurance company will put in extra effort to ignore their ridiculous claims.</p>
              <p>Good thing you did not hit the black bike, because that is what they wanted, kind of screwed up their plans a little.</p>
