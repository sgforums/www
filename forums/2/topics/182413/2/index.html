            <div class='col-md body'>But seriously i don't get it. usually when a car is currently using highbeam, a blue indicator on the instrument panel will appear in every single car. Some are even aware of that and yet, heck care. "hig or low, what's the diff!" I'll "F" any idiot who says that. as for others, are they that oblivious to what's is on the instrument panel? Other than paying attention to the fuel gauge, odometer and maybe the speedo once in a while, do you even look at the panel in front of you when something lights up? Or worse i even seen ppl driving in the the dead of the night, with the lights not even on at all. Don't tell me they adjust their radio, air con or any other control by touch ah? maybe for SG cars they should change the blue highbeam light to red so, well for obvious reasons, make one think that there is something wrong and yes, you are travelling with your high beam on and blinding other road users.<br><br>I can relate to those who came across such drivers who drive with their high beam on... whether it is accidental or not cos i myself encountered many times before. It does really get on my nerves, but i'd usually slow down and let him overtake me... and then i'll flash that bugger  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
