What about original E9 and Ralliart. Both have tiltable HID lamps<br>Just that Its no as bright as the Beemers or odyssey.<br><br>Anyway,  yes, its true that taller cars beams may look brighter if you r driving a saloon car. For eg. RX300 behind me who is in a lancer. Lucky window got tinted abit, at least block off the 100% effect of it. Maybe if LTA set the rules of tilting down on the beams would help. I heard that there are some type of tinted sticker which you put on the glass would help to reduce the glare.<br><br>Another eg. would be a van or lorry behind you. Although they not using HID or zeonT but it is still very glaring. I have buses the most. So high and bright can shine through my whole car. KnN</div>
