Don't let a moment of laziness affect your whole driving experiences by getting an auto car!</div></blockquote>Totally agree with you. No matter how scary or terrifying the thought of having to drive with a clutch, it is still the safest method. Think about it you got 3 braking options, footbrake, handbrake and engine brake. 1st gear to 2nd gear will help you slow down drastically, and the car baing able to stall is another safety feature in the threadstarter's kind of situation. But we as SG-eans after finding the joy and ease of auto cars will favour it over manual for a long time. Cept for me. Hehe.</div>
