              <p>Are they a good guide of your driving skills?</p>
              <p>I think not, I have a friend who scored 6 points for his TP, whereas I scored 30 in my first try and 8 in my 2nd and also another friend who scored 18 in his first try.</p>
              <p>My 18 pointer friend and I have rather steady driving, albeit I have the tendency to drive fast when I'm not with my family members.</p>
              <p>This week I rode my 6 pointer friend's car for the first time, damn it was nerve-wrecking every single second. Never mind that he likes to lean close to his side of the lane marking, he's not as experienced as me in terms of driving without 'L' plate although he got his license 3 months before me.</p>
              <p>He tried to mimick my way of driving and almost got into accidents many times, some includes driving only 2 inch away from the next car and turning into a filter lane, he almost mounted the kerb, and while looking out for oncoming traffic, he failed to stop fully and half his car body was already onto the main road causing at least 2 cars to brake and the first car to perform evasive action.</p>
              <p>Another one that takes the cake, coming out of TPE(Tampines) he turned right into a 3 lane road, the road was totally empty, at the first lane, he didn't turn neither did he in the 2nd. Only at the last lane, when his car body was half way in, he did a full lock. When he straighten his car, he almost mounted kerb again and he cited reason that "Angle was too tight to turn properly".</p>
              <p>Other faults include, poor estimation, poor anticipation and not being alert.</p>
              <p>We drove the same car for the first time - Fiat Bravo T-Jet. Although the car is has a high pick-up, I can handle it fairly well while he cited his poor driving due to not being able to adapt to the car, maybe because I drove a Euro-R before.</p>
              <p>I think TP should extend the test time to fully test a driver's capabilities before passing them, I don't even know why I failed the first time round when both times I drove in the same manner.</p>
              <p>Or at least make the test a 2 or 3 phase test like for example, the first time round, he passes, a week later there will be another evaluation on his improvements and such.</p>
              <p>Because the way I see my friend drive, it's very dangerous, even for a habitual speeder like me, I know when to slow down and act accordingly.</p>

              <p>What you trying to say? That you drive very good? Drive fast don't mean = drive skillfully. You haven't met what real SKILLFUL means, just because you know how to step the accelerator a bit harder than the rest don't mean that you are good, it just means that no one else bothers to 'play' with you.</p>
              <p>If you think you drive fast, go up North where your neighbours will literally show you what is fast. Euro R so what? Their modified proton wiras, satria neos will easily tear you like toilet paper.</p>

              <p>Yea I feel the same too, some rules he follows blindly while others he breaks without reason.</p>
              <p>Like for example, he stopped a junction before there was a jam and his body was halfway into the pedestrian crossing but not into the yellow box. It was red light, he saw space in front then he drove and ran the red light.</p>
              <p>He said nvm, not his fault cause his body already half past the stop line.</p>
              <p>I told him if it was me, I rather get stared by pedestrians than risking losing my license.</p>
              <p>Seeing his driving, he told me his instructor say he very skilful while I always get scolded by my instructor for everything. -_-</p>

              <p>I didn't expect him to drive superbly but at least carefully, most of the times things he should learnt in his lessons, i had too had a 2.5 months break between my first tp and second and I didn't lose too much during this break.</p>
              <p>Usually for parking, I can only do for smaller cars like altis, for others like that Bravo and Alphard, either I need a lookout or someone to park instead.</p>

              <p>There is no such thing as exact spot in real life one. Its not like in TP you see the pole in the top right corner when you look back at your rear windscreen or something like that. There will be no poles to guide you. Everytime you park, depending on the carpark conditions, your "spot" is different one. The correct way to park in real life is to use your mirrors, especially your wing mirrors, like what Sexychin has said.</p>
              <p>I think you are still stuck in your L-plate days of following a certain SOP when driving on the road. As far as parking is concerned, I feel you should unlearn what you were taught during your TP days and base what you do on your own intelligent judgment.</p>

              <p>I think so too because of the amount of money I had to spend in order to get this license and also the fact that I had to do it a 2nd time to get it.</p>
              <p>And also because we're friends and we're bound to mock each other and he was right, I did have to take a second time and hence I was considered the lesser driver and I always considered that both are better than me.</p>
