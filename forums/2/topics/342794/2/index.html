              <p>Not surprised that it is expensive, but I'll never buy an arcade game. A waste of money. As for versus mode, I'm not so sure though. Everytime when I play it (Suntec), there isn't anyone playing, only me.</p>

              <p>I have a phobia of a passenger beside me first time I ever drive any car.</p>
              <p>Cos passenger can see how nervous I am, or can point out mistakes easily or simply, what happened with my friend.</p>
              <p>She had licence, but didnt dare to drive for a long time.  So I rode all the way to Jurong, park my bike and get into her sister's car with her.</p>
              <p>After a while, I move to the backseat cos that sister came along.</p>
              <p>Then suay suay at Choa Chu Kang Farmway, she was taking a turn too fast and I was just telling her to lift her foot off the accelerator and maybe down a gear.  before the last part of my sentence came out.</p>
              <p>The sister panicked and went and grabbed her left hand at the steering wheel.</p>
              <p>Of course we careened all the left side of the road, nearly hit a lampost, then served to the right side of the road and into a kampung road ditch.</p>
              <p>I was sitting at the centre of the backseat, no seatbelt and saw the lampost coming straight for me.</p>
              <p>Thankfully the ditch was not too bad.  We got out of the car, take a breather, check the undercarriage and I found some concrete edges of the ditch and directed my friend to turn the steering wheel and reverse away. </p>
              <p>Thankfully, some of the wheels still have traction on the road while one of the front tyre found traction at the slope of that concrete dtich.  We finally moved off without incident.  Stopped at that Ivy place to walk walk around and I took over the wheel for the parking.</p>
              <p>Whew.....</p>

              <p>Errm...how come I am in the picture?</p>
              <p>And driving games are useless. I have a racing driving game in my psp, everytime I play it, my left foot will want to start stomping and my right foot always lift off from the floor, went half down wanting to do the accerlarator &amp; brake thingy while my left was figuring out how to allow for smooth change gears.</p>
              <p>Though I am a her, I also have my fair share of stupid female drivers from my motorcycle.</p>
              <p>Men are just skunks with their attitude, but females are just bimbos.</p>
              <p>And I agree its stressful, especially when you have to bring a old model long axis Jaguar down from a tight old building multi storey carpark.  ie, the shenton way old office buildings.</p>

              <p>If no injuries,  get down from the vehicles, take pics of the roads, the direction, the lamposts showing its number and move your vehicles to the side of the road. If another party is involved, can exchange phone numbers at the side of the road and decide how you guys wants to settle it.  By insurance or direct payment or sent to your workshop.</p>
              <p>If there is oil spills on the road, contact the police and the fire department for them to bring a hose over and hose down the road.</p>
              <p>If there is injuries, please check on the injuries and safety of your passengers first and call the police.  If still able, take pics and only move the vehicles after the police investigators allows it.</p>
              <p>If critically injured, your only allowed worry should be going to the hospital.  If you are able and helpful, still do not move any vehicles blocking the way till Police says its okay.  Do not allow Tow Trucks person to convince you to tow your car or others cars away.  Let the POs decide on the damages and the towing or moving vehicles off the roads. </p>

              <p>So true! It was funny though, especially when it came from a female.</p>

              <p>There was once where I was exiting from an underground car-park. I took an illegal shortcut which involve one very tight corner. There are walls on both side and there were LOTS of scratch marks on it. Especially on the outer wall. When I first drove out, I was lucky not to hit it because my cousin was there to inform me. If she wasn't there, I don't know what will happen..</p>

              <p>I have a phobia of a passenger beside me first time I ever drive any car.</p>
              <p>Cos passenger can see how nervous I am, or can point out mistakes easily or simply, what happened with my friend.</p>
              <p>She had licence, but didnt dare to drive for a long time.  So I rode all the way to Jurong, park my bike and get into her sister's car with her.</p>
              <p>After a while, I move to the backseat cos that sister came along.</p>
              <p>Then suay suay at Choa Chu Kang Farmway, she was taking a turn too fast and I was just telling her to lift her foot off the accelerator and maybe down a gear.  before the last part of my sentence came out.</p>
              <p>The sister panicked and went and grabbed her left hand at the steering wheel.</p>
              <p>Of course we careened all the left side of the road, nearly hit a lampost, then served to the right side of the road and into a kampung road ditch.</p>
              <p>I was sitting at the centre of the backseat, no seatbelt and saw the lampost coming straight for me.</p>
              <p>Thankfully the ditch was not too bad.  We got out of the car, take a breather, check the undercarriage and I found some concrete edges of the ditch and directed my friend to turn the steering wheel and reverse away. </p>
              <p>Thankfully, some of the wheels still have traction on the road while one of the front tyre found traction at the slope of that concrete dtich.  We finally moved off without incident.  Stopped at that Ivy place to walk walk around and I took over the wheel for the parking.</p>
              <p>Whew.....</p>
              <p> --------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Scary incident :(</p>

              <p>Errm...how come I am in the picture?</p>
              <p>And driving games are useless. I have a racing driving game in my psp, everytime I play it, my left foot will want to start stomping and my right foot always lift off from the floor, went half down wanting to do the accerlarator &amp; brake thingy while my left was figuring out how to allow for smooth change gears.</p>
              <p>Though I am a her, I also have my fair share of stupid female drivers from my motorcycle.</p>
              <p><strong>Men are just skunks with their attitude, but females are just bimbos.</strong></p>
              <p>And I agree its stressful, especially when you have to bring a old model long axis Jaguar down from a tight old building multi storey carpark.  ie, the shenton way old office buildings.</p>
