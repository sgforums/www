              </p><p>Honda unveiled new small car prototype,arrive shoowroom next year</p>
              <p>Taking a decisive step to move towards the huge chunk of Indian middle-class segment or what is called the ‘B Plus' segment in auto parlance, Japanese auto major Honda Motor Co unveiled the prototype of Honda Brio, the new small-sized vehicle from its stable, at the Thailand International Motor Expo on Tuesday. The car is essentially being developed for Indian and Thailand markets. </p>
              <p>The prototype (Thai version) was unveiled by the President and CEO of Honda Motor, Takanobu Ito, in the presence of the President and CEO of Asian Honda Motor Company Fumikho Ike and President and CEO of Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI) Takashi Nagai. </p>
              <p>Honda BRIO Prototype is being developed with Honda’s advanced technologies, while further advancing Honda’s “man maximum, machine minimum” concept*1. Being developed as a  commuter which is easy-to-use even in urban areas, the Honda BRIO prototype adopts an easy-to-handle compact body (length 3,610mm x width 1,680mm x height 1,475 mm) while ensuring enough cabin space achieved by highly efficient packaging. With this vehicle, Honda thoroughly pursued the creation of an advanced exterior form, which is compact while asserting a strong presence.</p>
              <p>For the mass-production model, which will be an entry-level car, for which demand is increasing in newly emerging nations, Honda will develop unique versions for Thailand and India to reflect different customer needs in those markets. Moreover, with this vehicle, Honda will leverage the resources Honda has cultivated through its motorcycle business and utilize local sourcing of parts and materials such as sheet steel.</p>
              <p>For the Thai model that is scheduled to be introduced in March 2011, the fuel economy of more than 5liters/100km*2 will be targeted so that the vehicle will qualify as an eco-car by the Thai government, and a starting price of approximately 400,000 baht will be targeted as well. For the Indian model that is scheduled to be introduced within 2011, local customer needs for a small car will be reflected and local content will be increased to create a model that achieves a good balance between vehicle performance and price.</p>
              <p>“Honda would like to expand the joy of mobility to more customers in Thailand, India and other Asian countries through the introduction of a new small vehicle with compact and highly efficient packaging by utilizing our own experiences cultivated by motorcycle business here in Asia,” said Takanobu Ito, President and CEO of Honda Motor.</p>
              <p>Although both production sites will use a common chassis, Brios made in Thailand will emphasize fuel economy to get tax preferences under a government eco-car plan, the paper said.the to take on competitors like i20, Polo, Swift among others.</p>
              <p>By procuring more than 90 percent of materials and parts for the Thai location from Southeast Asia, the automaker will hold down the starting price to around 400,000 baht, or 1.1 million yen ($13,080), in Thailand, the paper said.</p>
              <p>In India, a local procurement ratio of 80 percent will make possible a starting price of 500,000 rupees, or 900,000 yen ($10,700), the nikkei repored.</p>
