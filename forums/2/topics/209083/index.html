            <div class='col-md body'>Once in a while, I just check around for car prices just for the heck of it.  I thought Hyundais were popular mainly due to their attractive prices.

If the Getz 1.4 could be more expensive than a Jap 1.6, and the Getz is still selling well, then I would consider the Getz as somewhat a success.<br><br>(ie. I've compared Getz 1.4 to some Jap 1.6...and Getz was more expensive).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casshern:</div><div class="quote_body">neither can demand indicate quality.<br></div></blockquote>I agree that price and demand are not necessarily indications of quality.  But I never mentioned or implied that the Getz was selling well due to its quality.<br><br>This is why I'm amazed at the success of the Getz, and at how Hyundai managed to create enough demand to sell the Getz successfully, even at higher prices than some popular Jap brands.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casshern:</div><div class="quote_body">if something is cheap, most singaporeans will just rush in to buy. and relatively the Getz is a cheap car for its capability and its target niche market<br></div></blockquote>Right - and this is the reason why I'm amazed that people still choose the Getz (more expensive) over the Lancer, Vios, etc (which are cheaper).<br><br>Actually, many people around the world also have the tendency to rush to buy cheap things lah.  Pricing attractiveness is a very powerful weapon in marketing.<br><br>To clarify again, as mentioned in my first paragraph, this was a comparison between the Getz and some well-established Jap marques which I've listed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK OK....to illustrate my point simply, lets just take a simple comparison of two cars:  The Getz and the Vios.<br><br>Getz:  More expensive than Vios, reputed to drink more fuel, Korean brand (deemed by market to be technically inferior to Japs, rightly or wrongly).<br><br>Vios:  Cheaper then Getz, supposedly economical to run, comes from the best-selling Japanese brand.<br><br>Based on the above, I would expect people to lean more towards the Vios.  Yet, from everyday situations on the roads (I don't have the exact sales figures) the number of Getz on the roads probably can rival that of the Vios.  Hyundai really did a real good job in creating demand for the Getz.<br><br>Maybe I should send my boss to Hyundai for some marketing training <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  (He's always asking me to sell at lower prices to get more volume - and I keep telling him to be patient and build up demand for our products first).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese car is usually too common on the road. Japanese car usually has a lighter car body weight in its class. So maybe some buyers consider Korea car because the car is heavier in its class. These buyers have a mentality to think that heavier car is more safe and stable. Fuel consumption between Jap and Korea car are reasonable to these buyers.  Korea cars usually have a more roomy interior space compare to Japanese car of the same class.  These maybe some of the reasons to generate more sales to Korea car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I think the price he quoted is a 1.6 Getz not a 1.4! Comparing all car cost, Toyota is still the best.<br><br>Kia and Hyundai are petrol drinker. Not all Jap car are reliable and high resale value. Lazy abit just see what car had the most on the road then buy loh, nowaday many buyers know how to calculate liao. If you want to be odd one out, then prepare to pay more eg Mazda 3 and Sunny- common compliant FC very high. QQ- not safe! Lancer can consisder but CVT is a problem.<br><br>Just one question! Anyone calculate the profit dealer made for a car they sell?<br>They can be alot difference, ranging from 8k to 30k.</div>
