            <div class='col-md body'>Was on Bus 18 last night, sat upstairs front seat as usual, looking at cars...<br><br>It was close to midnight and not many cars left on the streets. My bus stopped at a traffic light junction, just before the Telecoms building. Suddenly heard a loud engine and turned to my right, the little highway coming from Changi General Hospital. A black Civic with white rims was going at least 80 down the 1st lane from the right and executed a fxxking drift to the outermost lane (thank god no incoming car) and zoomed away. I was like stunned up there, was as if straight from Initial D. Really dangerous, but nice to watch <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Any of you seen/done street drifting?

Any racing driver can drift, but not every drifter knows how to race.</div>

Its very simple to drift an FF car. all u have to do, is............. lift off. or give the handbrake a short sharp pull. drifting only makes sense when u are doing a rally on a loose surface, eg, gravel or snow. or occasionally for the sharpest of hairpins, and even then, u do not drift with your tail out, but just apply the minimal slip angle needed. all out, sideways, tail out drifting, is SLOW.</div>

This AWD car impress me a lot in cornering and stability in high speed.  The sales person encourage me to speed up in a 3 lane way.  I was running at 120+.  But I am not familer with the road condition there.  Very soon, reached to the end of the road and there is a big turn to another smaller road.   I have already lower down speed a bit at about 80km, but obviously I underestimate the curvature of the corner.  Afraid of totally lossing control of the car, I dare not hard press brake.  Don't know how the ABS performans in such a corner.  I slowly press down the brake, and try to control the steering wheel to keep the car in the lane. However, it start to drift, more than half of the body drifted to   opposite lane, especially the rear side.  At that moment, there is CIVIC come in the opposite lane.  It jam braked.  We missed with a car body distance.  Sweat from every pore.  If it is not AWD, there could be collision test between Subaru and Civic.</div>
