Leg shaking super nervous never step accelerator hard enough so failed to accelerate sufficiently 2 times. The TP straight away mark the points man. I was like... OMFG I haven't even move off yet. So straight away the mood was like super sad. But he ask me continue. Then in CDC, because after turning into the circuit, can turn right to do parallel. So after doing parallel(thank god it went smoothly), immediately turn left again to do slope. Then as I was turning left to the slope, which was right beside, I scared strike kerb, so I do a wider turn. Then he mark me. I come down from slope I make a wide turn also, cause I scared touch kerb. Another 4 pts down.<br><br>Thankfully, the road I never minus point. Basically, when I went out to the road, the instructor threw back the clipboard 2-3mins into my test(on the road), and said that I'm safe and he will pass me provided I don't screw up. Then I stalled as I was going back to the school, at a junction and I went like WTF! plus, use wrong gear to move off.

Leg shaking super nervous never step accelerator hard enough so failed to accelerate sufficiently 2 times. The TP straight away mark the points man. I was like... OMFG I haven't even move off yet. So straight away the mood was like super sad. But he ask me continue. Then in CDC, because after turning into the circuit, can turn right to do parallel. So after doing parallel(thank god it went smoothly), immediately turn left again to do slope. Then as I was turning left to the slope, which was right beside, I scared strike kerb, so I do a wider turn. Then he mark me. I come down from slope I make a wide turn also, cause I scared touch kerb. Another 4 pts down.<br><br>Thankfully, the road I never minus point. Basically, when I went out to the road, the instructor threw back the clipboard 2-3mins into my test(on the road), and said that I'm safe and he will pass me provided I don't screw up. Then I stalled as I was going back to the school, at a junction and I went like WTF! plus, use wrong gear to move off. But he didnt take that into consideration <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So, guess I was lucky.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>wa you stalled at a junction... very heng he closed one eye... My fren hor, he saw a cyclist very far, but cycling very fast. So he just go past the zebra crossing. The cyclist timed it just nice after my fren went past, he zoomed past the zebra crossing.<br><br>Then the examiner failed him, say dangerous driving, and cuz never give way to pedestrian.<br><br>Another friend failed in circuit because  right in front of him was a first time driver, then the person's car stalled in the middle of the junction. Examiner asked my friend to overtake, my friend nodded head. But he didn't overtake because he thought theory say cannot overtake at the junction. So he got immediate failure for blocking the junction....</div>
