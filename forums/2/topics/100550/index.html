            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to hear about that Waterlily. But really if anyone is driving on that road when its relatively clear will look pretty silly going at 60. But what to do. The posted limit is 60. I feel that road is quite safe to do 90 as its a major road  directly leading to an expressway. I am sure many others feel the same way.</div>

You gotta get a bungalow and stay???? :O Its kinda silly to change a 2 litre car to a 1 litre car becoz of the two summon tickets!!!<br><br>Once bitten twice shy... be more aware while travelling on that particular road! waterlily... you may really wanna think about appealing.. .I think, it helps... my dad tried before too.... and the officer actually waived away the summon.<br><br></div>
