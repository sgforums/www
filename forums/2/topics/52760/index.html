            <div class='col-md body'>Gran toursimo is my choice... project gotham is nowhere near.. sorry 2 say... y? in GT, u can mod yr cars in any way u want it to adn there's a big selection of cars 2 choose from.... realsitic in a way that the car behaves differently according to the drivetrain and in case u did not know.... the cars there can say handles exactly like that in the game compared to real life.. 4 example.. the TVR speed 12 in GT is fast.. and i MEAN FAST.... but it handles badly as there's too much wheelspin and a sudden-snap oversteer when u least expect it... Even car reviewers like Top-Gear said that it was one of the hardest cars 2 drive.........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never tried Project Gotham b4, but I've got a hands-on demo at challenger a few years back. The Graphics r super, can almost beat GT3. But the tracks lack variation, and the controls compared to GT3, is very forgiving and there not as much cars to select. I've never tried playing with A.I. in Project Gotham b4 as I still dunno how to use it.<br><br>But if u really wan to buy GT3... y not wait for a few more months for GT4, it features some more longer, more challenging, more realisic tracks. U should also check out the rally tracks, they no longer use the "circuit" concept for rally tracks, instead they use the "point A to point B" concept, tat means no more going in circles.<br><br>The spectutors in the background with also b more realisic. As for the A.I., not much is reported. Letz hope itz not a stupid as the present(GT3), althought they r very fast on the tracks. But I can't say anything yet, therez still alot of time to develop them. And it seems tat GT4 is still using the same engine as GT3, but it is still very visually appealing.<br><br>And to b released with GT4, Logitech will also b releasing a 900 degrees lock-to-lock steering wheel!! Woohoo!!! Letz hope they will have interchangeable gear knob like the Logitech MoMo Steering Wheel.<br><br>P.S. Itz also reported tat GT4 will have the most featured cars in the GT series. Cars including from GT1 to GT3. Tatz almost 400++ cars!! Woohoo!!! Can really make me steam until I explode siah!! ha ha!!! Correct me if I'm wrong.</div>

Then more challenging... heh heh!!!<br><br>Speaking of A.I., GT4 should feature more variation of A.I. e.g. desperado drivers, aggressive drivers, pro drivers, takumi style drivers, newbies drivers, show off drivers, moderate drivers...etc.<br>Or our famous SAF MT Line "fat driver"... ha ha ha!!!<br><br>And who cares whether itz illegal or not on the road... winner takes all my friend!!! ha ha!!!<br><br>"It doesn't matter whether if u lose by a foot or by an inch... winning's winning" -Dominic(The Fast &amp; Furious)</div>

Alot of game dun have nos in them. Up to now, only Midnight Club 2, Burnout and drag racing.(stupidest game ever) They didnt really impress.

            <div class='col-md body'>I still think the most realistic games are found on PC. I used to play Grand Prix 1-3 on PC and had the whole steering wheel and pedals setup. It was super realistic - too much gas and you spin off. Plus the game had lots of followers who helped to ensure that your circuits and cars are updated from the last formula 1 grand prix. I must say that it is an excellent game. Stopped playing as it was too time consuming - have to work for a living unfortunately and save to buy the Evo VIII.... yeah!!!</div>
