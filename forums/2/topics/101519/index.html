            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks, after many months of testing and experiment. I have finally completed the WmaG. It is basically a set of powerful car magnets that will make a immediate difference to your ride and it will be transferable from car to car.<br>If you folks are interested in knowing more about it, i will be more than willing to conduct a free trial on you ride. I have tried on 3x Tucson 2L (which i am driving) and Trajet 2L which have given me v positive feedback in terms of power, engine response and quietness of the engine.<br>You can contact me at 94506435 Wei<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, maybe i should clarify it. I agreed magnets has been around for ages for many purposes which include for car usage.<br><br>I have never said that i discovered it as it will be an extremely tackless statement or pre-sumptious to make. as all drivers in Singapore are all aware of the various magnet products that are flooding in our market.<br><br>However, i myself as a consumer has bought products that failed to function to their expected performance. What i have done over the past few months are many phases of testing and working around with many different kind of mags to achieve a balanced and optimum performance magnets which is functional and reliable.<br><br>In addition, many mags won't last in a high temperature environment and it is only right that a proper product needs to be fully tested before selling it. That is why i even allow a trial with the mags and get the comments from the driver 1st before selling it. Such testing and experiment takes plenty of time, money and effort to conduct. So thats why i said that i have completed and finished the project for the magnets and never once, said that i am the 1st inventor for using magnets in cars.<br><br>I will appreciate if you could understand where i am coming from as statement that you have made is uncalled for and offensive.<br><br>cheers<br><br>ww<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kyne:</div><div class="quote_body">Should be on inlet fuel line.<br><br>Using magnets have been around for decades and you speak like you discovered it...</div></blockquote></div>
