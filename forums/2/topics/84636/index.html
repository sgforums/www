            <div class='col-md body'>ok alfa...government no longer allowed people from registering as a private instructor....actually from the start you should have started from private friend-intro instructor (if that instructor had good passing record).....SSDC or those centre-centric type of training is lousy because they have rotating young instructors...some behave like ah beng...no standard....some behave like VITB or ITE  people...(no offence ok).........some very hao lian.....some very sarcastic.......for the above reasons, you tend to have older and experienced drivers as private instructors since government no longer issues instructor licence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what u should do in case u swap to private instructor is to pester him to book test date for you as soon as you feel you are confident enough to take the test but i think there is a minimum hours u need to clock before he can book for you.....some private instructor act blur and continue to train you (so he does not need to take in a new learner having to go through the beginning learning process all over again)....while you as a seasoned learner, he can sit back and rest (less stressful as compare to really newbie).... it is a WIN-WIN situation coz he also earns money from you at the same time a more peace of mind over newbie.......<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Can just ask other instructors to take over?<br><br>Very jialat lar..<br>my friend introduce one.<br>After learning first lesson, told me to learn from another private instructor first...then until 1+ month before the test date, then go back to him. 2 different cars! 2 different driving centre instructors, that's why I only drive twice in SSDC circuit, then take test..<br>Before this, training only in Ubi circuit. Immediate failure coz wrong course.<br><br>Like that nvm..<br>After fail liao, ask him to book next date, never follow up for me..<br>Call him after didn't hear from him, say he didn't bring his book...ask me to call him back..<br>Another day call him, say he is teaching, will revert back to me..<br><br>Then, to my surprise, my TP last time in June, next test date is end of September!!??!! SSDC test date wait for so long one meh??<br><br>Anyone got any advise plz??</div></blockquote>If u want to change to another instructor, u must take back yr doc ie PDL &amp; test date receipt. But at the meantime before u take back fm him it is best to source for another pte instructor if u know yr test date cos not all pte instructors can take u if yr test date &amp; timing of test  coincide with their existing students.<br><br>My former instructor was quite good as some of the school instructor sometime recommend students to him. Most of his student passed within 3 attempt while some quick one passed at 1st attempt except my wife, her legs was trembling so badly that she could hardly ctrl the clutch. Luckily she passed on her 4th attempt. But he only teaches at Ubi Comfort. Unless u are interested to switch to Ubi which is very heavily traffic &amp; the centre had the lowest passing rate as compare to other centre.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alfa, just tell your private instructor you wanna change instructor. Nothing wrong with that coz you're paying. All those lousy instructors are still out there bcoz you guys just keep quite all the time (kia si singaporean). If you are thinking he might be able to affect your next test result if you don't learn from him, which is impossible.<br><br>As for AMK or UBI which centre easier to pass, it all depend on your driving skills. IF YOUR DRIVING IS POOR DON'T BLAME THE CENTRE OR THE TRAFFIC. Just go for more lesson. Driving a different car doesn't really affect a good driver. Bcoz they usually adapt to a new car in 1-2 lessons.<br><br>FYI, students from schools have priority for test dates. Why do you think they are paying more for?<br><br>Just my own opinion... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
