              <p>Hi, I'm planning to buy a car for a first time. Most likely a Off Peak Car as i usually dun use the car when i work.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the cost like? ( Road Tax, COE, etc. )</p>

              <p>Ok... from the website you provide, the car is about 8 months old. By right, to own a car, you need to provide an <strong>income statement</strong> to prove that you have the financial means to pay for the instalments. If you are not working, you cannot buy under your name.....then it would be better to ask your parents to buy for you. However, some 2nd-hand dealers do not need that income proof, so check with the dealer for more info.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points to consider assuming you are buying it:</span></p>
              <p><em>Instalments:</em> Assuming you take full loan of 9 years, since the car is almost 1 year old, at a market interest rate of 2.68%, your monthly instalments will work out to be around $340. Interest rate varies so check out with the dealer.</p>
              <p><em>Road Tax:</em> $50 per year. (stated)</p>
              <p><em>Parking: </em>At least $65 a month.</p>
              <p><em>Petrol</em>: Average $150 a month</p>
              <p><em>Insurance</em>: Younger teens will have a higher premium than middle-aged adults. But because the car is off-peak, you wouldn't drive much on the road so the premium is lesser. Should average around $2000 a year for your age group.</p>
              <p><em>COE:</em> $13,500 (stated) At any time you wish to sell off your car, part of the COE can be used as COE rebate to offset the price of your second car.</p>
              <p><em>OMV</em>: Open-market value: $10,500 (stated). At any time you wish to sell off your car, part of the OMV can be used as PARF rebate to offset the price of your second car.<em></em></p>
              <p><em>Miscellaneous: </em>ERP charges, whatever Fines, Maintenance/Repair etc.</p>
              <p><em>Restrictions</em>: Only 7pm-7am on weekdays, 3pm onwards on Sat, whole day on Sun/P.Hols. Other than that, add $20 per day for coupon.</p>
              <p>Therefore, add everything in and your monthly expenses just for the car should be at least $700 depending on how much you use it.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps! :)</p>

OMV is assessed by the Singapore Customs, based on the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation.

              <p class="Arial-11">The COE is otherwise known as the Certificate of entitlement. It is an amount that you pay the Land Transport Authority (LTA) for registering your car in Singapore for local use.</p>
              <p class="Arial-11">The COE system is essentially a vehicle quota system by the Singapore government to regulate the number of vehicles on the roads. Under this system, the LTA determines the number of new vehicles allowed for registration while the market determines the price of owning a vehicle.</p>
              <p class="Arial-11">If the vehicle is de-registered before its COE expires, the registered owner may be granted a rebate on the Quota Premium (QP) which he has paid. The rebate is pro-rated to the number of months and days remaining on the vehicle's COE.</p>
              <p class="Arial-11">However, the COE rebate is non-refundable in cash.</p>
              <p class="Arial-11">You can use the COE rebate to offset the various upfront vehicle taxes and fees when you register a new car. Any excess amount that is not used will be forfeited. You can also use a COE rebate purchased under your name to offset the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) when you renew your existing vehicle's COE. Another alternative would be to sell it to car dealers who would use it to register for new cars on their customers’ behalf.</p>

              <p>4. The dealer may charge you some transfer fees and stuff. It's better to know what you are paying for. Some might also set a deposit/booking fee for the car. But usually, for 2nd hand car, because the car is already there and its price already include everything, there shldn't be any booking fee or whatever other than deposit. Transfer fees are common. Other misc fees might include handling fee, commission for the dealers etc.</p>
              <p>It's best to ask them and look thru the terms &amp; conditions very thoroughly before signing on the dotted line.</p>

              Singapore.</p>
              <p>If the vehicle is de-registered within 10 years from
              its first registration date, the registered owner is entitled to a
              percentage rebate of its OMV value from the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA).</p>
              <p>A point to note is that the OMV rebate is
              non-refundable in cash.</p>
              <p>You can use the OMV rebate to offset the various
              upfront vehicle taxes and fees when you register a new car. Any
              excess amount that is not used will be forfeited. Another
              alternative would be to sell it to car dealers who would use it to
              register for new cars on their customers’ behalf.</p>
              <p>2. The listed COE value is that of original value of
              the COE when first registered.</p>
              <p>The COE is otherwise known as the Certificate of
              entitlement. It is an amount that you pay the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA) for registering your car in Singapore for local
              use.</p>
              <p>The COE system is essentially a vehicle quota system by
              the Singapore government to regulate the number of vehicles on the
              roads. Under this system, the LTA determines the number of new
              vehicles allowed for registration while the market determines the
              price of owning a vehicle.</p>
              <p>If the vehicle is de-registered before its COE expires,
              the registered owner may be granted a rebate on the Quota Premium
              (QP) which he has paid. The rebate is pro-rated to the number of
              months and days remaining on the vehicle's COE.</p>
              <p>However, the COE rebate is non-refundable in cash.</p>
              <p>You can use the COE rebate to offset the various
              upfront vehicle taxes and fees when you register a new car. Any
              excess amount that is not used will be forfeited. You can also use
              a COE rebate purchased under your name to offset the Prevailing
              Quota Premium (PQP) when you renew your existing vehicle's COE.
              Another alternative would be to sell it to car dealers who would
              use it to register for new cars on their customers’ behalf.</p>

              <p>3. In your COE log card, there's PARF rebate
              eligibility, which means how much you can get after using the
              car for 10 years.  </p>
              <p>Hope this helps! :)</p>

              <p>Btw dun mind me asking, how long did you save for your vehicle??</p>
              <p>Paying $400 a month for everything else.. My bet is a car less than 1.8cc??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeah i know about installments.. But i'm not getting a car that is out of my reach. Haha.. It's just a red plate car which is 1.6cc?? I dun think it's a lot??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know a few of those BMW, Porches, Ferrari bah bah bah owners.</p>
              <p>Most of them dun use them salary to pay off the car debt.</p>
              <p>They use their dividends from their investments - property,stocks whatsoever to pay off that debt.</p>

              <p>Since you mean a red-plate car, you would not see any diff. If it's a normal 1.6cc car, then the difference will substantiate to a wide amounts. 1 month's expenses can exceed $1K.</p>
