Like I previously stated, finish you NS first. If you are lucky, you get to be a vehicle technician and can really learn alot about cars. Jobs waiting for you when you are out, be it car technician or sale excutive for cars. For now, save up abit.<br><br>Anyway, I know of car washer, car technician in the kelisa forum. They are doing fine, so you will get your chance. Patiences, anyway, in the army, also not much chance to drive your car.<br><br>And don't mind Jonathon, nothing is coming out of all that shouting.

Like I previously stated, finish you NS first. If you are lucky, you get to be a vehicle technician and can really learn alot about cars. Jobs waiting for you when you are out, be it car technician or sale excutive for cars. For now, save up abit.<br><br>Anyway, I know of car washer, car technician in the kelisa forum. They are doing fine, so you will get your chance. Patiences, anyway, in the army, also not much chance to drive your car.<br><br>And don't mind Jonathon, nothing is coming out of all that shouting. Cool down and you will find something worth learning.</div></blockquote>yes wbucket i did consider ur advise and i am still thinking bout it now thats y i got this 2nd idea thing wat.so jonathon can u see???this a very good example of wat good advise is...maybe u should get a lesson from wbucket on how to give good advise when i am being ask properly...btw thanks wbucket for ur very good piece of advise</div>
