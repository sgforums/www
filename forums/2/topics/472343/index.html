Starting with the permissible limit of 35 mg in your breath a fine of $500 is added to $1000 for every additional 5 mg, so if you have X mg of alcohol, your fine would be $1000 + $500 * [(X-35)/5]. The same applies for license disqualification period - 1/2 year is added for every 5 mg of breath. <br>So the question is what if you exhaust the maximum fine amount of $5000 owing to a high alcohol level ? Answer is simple - you go to PRISON. Yes even first time offenders can go to PRISON. <br>And do not bother about the fine if you are involved in an accident, you are going to PRISON for sure. <br><br>I would also recommend that you inform your employer as they would come to know about it at some point in future . The action taken by your employer would most probably depend upon your industry and your past behaviour during your stint with the firm. If you are working for the govt, there are good chance of you getting fired. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long term implications of a DUI</span> <br><br>- DUI will have severe implications on your <a id="_GPLITA_4" style="color: #3199c4; text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by safesaver" href="http://forum.singaporeexpats.com/ftopic96411.html#">travel</a> abroad esp to the North Americas ( USA and Canada ) for study/work/tourism<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CANADA</span> - As a general rule, Canada does not admit anyone with a DUI, whether it is a 2 year old DUI or a 20 year old DUI. So if you have a DUI, you can safely assume that the path to Canada is closed for good. George W Bush required a special waiver to <a id="_GPLITA_3" style="color: #3199c4; text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by safesaver" href="http://forum.singaporeexpats.com/ftopic96411.html#">enter</a> Canada as he had a DUI dating to back to 1976 in Maine. I read that Canada is trying to relax the rules a little bit if your DUI is very old but I dont see anything changing drastically. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">USA</span> - As for the US, a single DUI is NOT grounds to deny entry and visa applicants with such records are investigated further. You may read these links for further information.

There is a very good chance that you will get rejected. Of late I have been hearing that US is getting more strict with applicants having DUI on their record. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UK/Australia</span> - I hear that they are less strict when it comes to DUIs, but no data to corroborate this. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Dont drink and drive" is a old adage which every Tom, Dick and Harry knows. But what most of us dont know is that we need to wait for 1 day before driving if we consume drinks.</span> <br>In Singapore you could be charged for drink driving even if you are below the limit. If there is an accident and even if you are the innocent party and the cops find out that there are traces of alcohol in your blood, you will be charged for drink driving and prosecuted in court. <br><br>I am trying to spread this message on drink driving so that people dont screw up big time and spoil their career.<br><br>If someone can review this and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Sticky</span> it, it will be of great help and save many from screwing up big time.<br><br>The sad irony is that most people do not bother to investigate the repercussions of a DUI until they have committed one themselves. If the Traffic Police or some govt body publicizes this kind of unofficial info , the number of DUI cases would definitely come down. I tried this with TP, but in vain.</span></p></div>
