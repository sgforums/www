I always thought the market charges 6%.<br><span style="color: blue;">WRONG. Mine is 3% cos I bought a new car from the dealer, and they took in the balance of my parf at 3% discount. If you only sell the parf paper, the discount varies from 3 to 7%<br></span><br><br>If my loan is 40k, and the voucher is 50k, dealer will charge 3% of 50k OR 10k (50k voucher minus 40k loan)?<br><span style="color: blue;">I m confused by yr question. Maybe i give an example ;<br><br>Car price 90k<br>your parf paper 50k<br>suppose your car only can use 40k parf, then dealer will take 3% off (50-40)k = $300.<br>So efectively your 50k parf paper is only worth 49,700.<br><br>Therefore, you still need to pay the dealer 90k-50k+300 = 40300.<br>You can either pay cash or take loan or a combination.<br><br>The 3% discount on parf paper has nothing to do with your loan.<br><br>If you want cash back, you can take a higher loan (i.e.50k) and the bank will give you  9.7K (50k-40300) cash.<br><br></span><br><br></div>

What you get back is only the unused COE.<br><br>If COE is 20k, you lugi 2.0k per yr.<br>If COE 12k, you lugi 1.2k per yr.<br><br>So what do you think ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the tip fondue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ....  But I 've heard ppl saying like if you get into accident &amp; need to scrap early, the high paper value will help..&amp; also some other positive benefits (can't remember what already).  Dunno how that works exactly also....I've always thought that the lower the COE price, the lower your depreciation &amp; hence better value-for-money also.<br>So that means those cars which renewed at high COE ie. $30k...cannot justify the higher price they charge? That means there's no benefit to the new owner whatsoever? Thanks a lot.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Don't know whats the current rate now. Could varies with different dealer.<br><br>ii. The bank will not take your parf. They only take cash. What you do with your parf is not their concern. IF you use parf to offset your loan, it'll prob be thru a middle man (e.g. 2nd hand car dealer), and you would lose the % in the process. In this case, maybe 5% of 40k+.</div>
