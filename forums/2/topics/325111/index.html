              <h1 class="clr">CNG—car drivers may have to pay additional tax from 2010</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : A lack of refuelling stations is not the only concern
              worrying drivers who are considering switching to Compressed Natural
              Gas (CNG). Drivers of CNG vehicles may have to pay an additional tax
              from 2010.</p>
              <p>Sales Manager Isaac Tan drives 35,000 kilometres a year — much of it for his job.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, he bought a new car and planned to convert it for CNG use, to save fuel costs and the environment.</p>
              <p>But
              he changed his mind at the last minute, because of costs — even though
              buyers of hybrid and CNG vehicles benefit from the Green Vehicle
              Rebate. This gives the buyer a 40 per cent discount on the car’s Open
              Market Value until 31 December 2009.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan said, "I was
              surfing... the LTA website, ONE.MOTORING, and I realised there is this
              Special Tax involved on CNG. Right now, the government has waived it
              until 31 December 2009, but beyond that it’s unclear."</p>
              <p>Recovering fuel duty and discouraging the use of polluting vehicles are reasons for the Special Tax.</p>
              <p>Currently
              drivers of petrol vehicles pay duty of 41 cents per litre of
              intermediate grade petrol every time they top up their tanks.</p>
              <p>So
              the owner of a 1,500cc petrol car who drives the average 21,000
              kilometres a year spends about S$3,550 on petrol, of which about S$660
              is petrol duty.</p>
              <p>But duty is not charged on diesel or CNG at the filling station.</p>
              <p>And
              diesel engines create more pollution. For example, the latest EURO IV
              diesel engines create five times more of the pollutant called PM2.5
              than a petrol—driven car.</p>
              <p>Special tax for EURO IV diesel vehicles
              is pegged at S$1.25 per engine cc. So the owner of a 1,600cc diesel
              vehicle pays S$2,000 a year in Special Tax.</p>
              <p>The owner of a
              1,600cc diesel vehicle who drives the average 21,000 kilometres a year
              would spend about S$1,900 a year on diesel.</p>
              <p>But CNG vehicles produce cleaner emissions than petrol vehicles, so are exempt from Special Tax until 31 December 2009.</p>
              <p>The
              Land Transport Authority (LTA) has not yet decided whether to extend
              the exemption. But it said if Special Tax is imposed on CNG cars, it
              will not necessarily be the same as that on Diesel IV vehicles.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Tan said: "The way the government is setting the policies — or not
              setting the policies, rather — is not helping the public. And in fact,
              if they really want to encourage the public to go to greener vehicles,
              then they should set the policies right in the first place."</p>
              <p>LTA
              said it will announce its decision on the Special Tax for CNG cars in
              due course. So for now, drivers considering a CNG vehicle will have to
              live with the uncertainty of higher taxes in future or wait until a
              decision is made. — CNA/ms</p>

              <p>Sometimes I don't know if this CNG thing is hype or not. Honestly if one is that concerned about fuel saving, then downgrade or change your driving habit. Or get a hybrid. Or if one is that very concerned about rising fuel prices, then take public transport. No one is forced to drive, its a choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for CNG, sometimes I really wonder is it really worth it at the  moment. Sure the OMV 40% cut is good, but for cars with very much lower OMVs, the installation costs is even more than the rebate. And with only 2 stations in Jurong and Mandai, does it seriously even make sense if you live in the east? Sure unless you work/live near those areas, then it will make some economical sense but I dont believe that EVERYONE who signs up for CNG even actually uses the CNG tank. Even so, it does not make any economical sense at all, if you live/work anywhere else other than Jurong and Mandai, to use PETROL to travel to the CNG refuelling stations to top up your CNG tank.</p>

              <p>seriously do some calculations..</p>
              <p>For me, considered not heavy user on cars.</p>
              <p>Let's say i will save using CNG 50/week</p>
              <p>1month 200bucks</p>
              <p>1year 2400</p>
              <p>Installing the tank require 4k+ (erm, not new car)</p>
              <p>I need 2years + to "claim" back what I paid for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for people like me, I dont like it because</p>
              <p>&gt;It take up my boot's space quite alot...</p>
              <p>&gt;1lit of CNG = 1lit of Petrol (same dist?) I dont trust CNG can run the same..</p>
              <p>&gt;Need to purposely go to the station to top up(even i am jurong, i am lazy)</p>
              <p>&gt;Prices of CNG may increase, and i may need longer then 2years to "claim back"</p>
              <p>&gt;Taxes of CNG will increase (in year 2010... yet to be confirmed)</p>

              <p>CNG now about 1.73, while ron-95 after discount is about 2.02.  save 50/week = 2 years break even? I think you'll take much longer to break even, especially as you mention you're not high mileage as well...</p>

              <p>I dunno so much about politik, i also dunno why i pay so much tax.</p>
              <p>All i know is if i pay so much every year to feed a bunch of elites to make me work harder but get poorer, i must be a fool.</p>
              <p>There are so many high ranking and high pay officials burning out vitamin M daily and they are supposed to be the elites to solve such problems... and if we pay them the elite price they got to perform like one.... gimme the efficiency and effectiveness in problem solving... that's what's elites are about.</p>
