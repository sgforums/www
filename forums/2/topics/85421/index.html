You would have a higher chance of getting distracted by babes walking on the road... Somemore, the closer you are to him, the louder the exhaust... SO, why did you get so close to him? To hear it even more clearly?<br><br>And you are the farker here.  The exhaust was never the issue for the accident you caused due to your stupidity... Its just an excuse for lousy driving on your part...<br><br>You rear ended him, didn't pay him, and still send the pictures to LTA.  I hope you rot in hell pal...</div>
