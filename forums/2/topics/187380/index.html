            <div class='col-md body'>Juz one point...<br><br>I got somewat the same kinda advice on conti and jap cars when I was trying to buy my 1st renault.. As it turns out, the renault has better FC than other similar CC jap cars!  Maintainance high?  Perhaps u like to consider standard servicing intervial for most conti cars are 20,000km vs jap 5000km (factory standard). Meaning a jap car need as much as 4 times more servicing when compaired to conti cars.  (Of coz, most ppl use synthetic oils on their jap cars and try to stretch to 10,000 b4 sending for servicing.)<br><br>It is true conti cars has a little more problem than a jap car.. coz conti cars has more gadgets when compaired to jap cars (and more advance too!)  The general rule is.. more gadgets.. more point of failure.  So u buy a toyota.. there is nothing to breakdown.. coz there are nothing in the car!! 3 speed + overdrive autogearbox? Never heard of such low tech stuff in conti cars since 1990s!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Safety? I survived without a scratch in a pretty serious accident (26K repair bill in 1995).  I think i should not be walking if i was in a similar jap car.<br><br>Since my 1st Renault, there has been no turning back.. I juz got my 5th conti car.. and I still love them..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>FYI, my car has a 5 cyn 20V engine.. ESP, EDB, ASR, ABS, Keyless entry, GPS, Build-in dual band GSM phone, car can talk to u, 5 speed semi-auto, dual mode steering, electronic dual zone climate control, 6 airbags including 2 dual stage airbags, side and curtain airbags, auto headlights, auto wipers and many more..<br><br>Try find a jap car at sub S$90K with all these..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i test drove both astra n megane...<br><br>my findings:<br><br>megane plus &gt; gadgets quite a few, air bags alot, ncap rating better than astra, looks bigger on the outside and if u like a tail/backside, this is the car for u. sports looking with their 17" rims. key ignite (some say its a minus cos if key dun start engine then what happens next?)<br><br>minus &gt; drive like a korean make. its not as stable as astra. price and FC??<br><br>astra plus &gt; its a driver's dream machine in the c0ckpit. nice interior, compact and handles pretty well with their semi-manual/auto drive train (in fact the SE tells me its like a manual car clutchless &gt; alfa? hmm), gd pickup as well.<br><br>minus &gt; rear lamps not as nice. overall look so so compared to megane though its a hatchback. FC n price??<br><br>test drive Ford Focus as well...its exceptionally gd on the road. been to their show launch...awesome. very different from the old focus. better interior and all. pls take the ghia (top of the range model) if u can afford it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. Yes, have to agree I'm rather light footed and the upgrade is done by the agent. I paid 70k in Nov last year. I'm a heavy user &amp; has travelled 14000km already. I'm really glad I bought a Conti car &amp; glad that its an Astra. Loves the handling.</div>
