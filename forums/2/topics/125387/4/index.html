            <div class='col-md body'>well, it's all a matter of perspective right?<br>some pple earn $10k but didnt even own a car bcos to them, the satisfaction of owning a car doesnt compensate for the loss in other things, like achieving their financial objective (eg. millionaire by age 30) or they think it's juz plain stupid to buy something that depreciates $10-20k every year.<br><br>so, when we buy cars, we are obviously assigning values to the various options -- no car, may suffer inconvenience... got car, waste money, but are you happier?<br><br>my perspective: my convenience is certainly worth more than S$1-1.5k per month, so i dun mind buying a car... better to enjoy life now, then much later when i am old and unfit...<br><br>but when i am considering whether to buy a BMW, then maybe the extra S$1k is not worth it...<br><br></div>
