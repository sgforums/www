            <div class='col-md body'>actually lorry drivers are more careful when it comes to parking. they probably cannot afford to pay for the damages to a normal car if they scratch it while parking(unless they hit &amp; run).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Also ... how you know they no $$$ buy car ??? </blockquote>haha, yah. my dad drives a lorry and an Altis. He always tells me not to park next to a lorry when i take the car out, esp on the left side of the lorry. I always wondered why till 2 dents came out on the right front side of the car, apparently caused by lorries... 1 after i drove the car the other after he took it out.<br><br>Well the lorry driver can be careful when he opens the doors but the passenger might not care at all... i think that's what happens...sometimes my frens are guilty of this when we go out together.. they might just slam the doors against the cars next to them...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually ,I do pity some lorry drivers.Imagine on the left lane driving at 60km/h,Suddenly in front a car drives slower than him,When he try to overtake on the right side,The car suddenly speed up as it think that " Damm lorry must not overtake my car".So when he steer back to the left lane,The car speed slow down again,Well in my views,Not only lorry drivers are to be blamed some other road users too,Especially the ones with attitudes problems.Personally i do have an arrogant friend who drives a Lexus and always saying that he is very annoyed when Motorcycles,Trucks or even public buses overtakes him especially on the left lane.Got one time a Kawasaki ZX-12R(Bike) zoom past him and as usual he did not happy and start to chase that rider,But funny thing is even though the speedometer is already indicate more than 150km/h,The rider are fading from our eyesight.Then when he can't catch up,His reasons is that he is not in the mood and he never step on the accelerator hard enough,Could you imagine that?<br>(Happen at JB Highway)<br><br>So from my opinion and experience,I think it is not wise to hate lorry drivers.<br>2B,3 &amp; 4 Licence holder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i think they have somethings against new cars.. if they happen to see that a new car is parked beside them.. they'll purposely park closely to ur car and open their door.. i will try always not to park beside one.. coz i am afraid of them too.. anyway i would like to shoutout to those lorry drivers.. even if there is not enuff space in the parking lot.. woul u kindly try to open ur door a little so that it would scratch against the other cars..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well.... not all lorry drivers r that bad lah. also, this kind of tit for tat doesn't help anyone. its much easier for u to park elsewhere. At most, if u want to make a point, make a sign that says "PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT DAMAGE MY CAR"<br><br>then when ppl see the sign they will be more careful loh...<br>lorry drivers aren't bad people u know... u don't have to do stupid things like letting air out of their tires n throwing superglue on their windscreens.... it only gives car drivers a bad name u know...<br><br>anyway consider this: whatever u can so conveniently buy in shops, are all thanks to lorries. without them, i promise you your life would be much more troublesome.</div>
