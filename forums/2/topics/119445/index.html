Honda is made in Japen. Honda's got slight higher resale price.<br><br>I owned both honda and toyota before. Honda, the engine is much more responsive than toyota, especially those with Vtec engine. The vtec is activated by fuel pressure. When your's  RPM climb high enough, the vtec valve will open, then the engine gain extra torque, so car accelerate better.<br>Toyota's vvti engine is not the same, it's valve speed constantly changes to achieve better combustion effiency. So the vvti will save you more fuel.<br><br>For Latio's petrol consumption of 14 km/Litre, I think what written on the technical specification is not always true. Your driving habit matter the most, in regard to the petrol comsumption. To know Latio's petrol consumption good or bad, better get plenty of feedback from people who owned it. So that generally, you would know whether the petrol comsumption good or bad. Please note: For the case of Nissan's sunny, the petrol consumption written on the technical specification is not really accurate.

Cheers!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Sorry for that, whole family owned Honda's car!  This is the 3rd Civic I owned, from EK4, EG6 then ES8.  Right now, waiting for the new Civic 2006, seem like the outlook have totally changed of image.  As for the specifications, it is a 2.0 I-Vtec DOHC engine, price for the car must be expensive too. Got to save up $500 every month then should be able to upgrade by then.  Anyone interested, have a look on the website on the Chicago Auto Show 2005.</div>
