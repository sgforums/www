            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone out there,<br><br>Do you face any bad encounter when driving into malaysia? If you do, please relate your encounter here so that all of us knows what to do when we face one.<br><br>I just encounter one recently when my friend drove us into JB. Half way through, we got flag down by their police officer for speeding but we were very sure we are not. He demanded that we pay him the fine but we argue that we were not speeding at all. He told us in order not to make things difficult, why dont we pay him Sin $20 to settle everything. At last, we settle for Sin $10 cos we do not want to waste anymore time on this issue.<br><br>I am getting my new car at the end of the month soon and I am really worried about driving into Malaysia cos I always hears people saying how they got rob in board daylight and the worst thing is that even their police is doing it.<br><br>Please share and advice on all the encounters you guys faced so that we are better prepare when things really do happen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thousand and one possibilities. What can we do to prevent all this from happening?<br><br>Absolutely nothing.<br><br>We're in their country, and they've got their own way of doing things. Can't say what's right or wrong.<br><br>Everytime i kenna an open palm, and i think i'm in the wrong (speeding, no parking coupon, park at roadside etc) i'll hand over some ringgit. Case closed. So far so good. *touch wood*<br><br>If you really wanna go north and you are genuinely afraid of the crimes and ...er....ang pao $, I suggest you stay in SG. What's the point of going there to save a few $, when you're constantly watching over your shoulder and think that everyone walking past you is gonna mug you?<br><br>You already know for a fact of the risks involved. Everyone's heard of more than 1 horror story up north. Nothing's gonna change for now. Weigh your options and see whether you can take that risk.<br><br>If you can, go by all means.<br>If you can't, then stay in Sg.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that they are two kinds of police on the highway, one is genuine and the other is part time.  The genuine one is assigned on to the highway to do his job.  The part time one is civil servant who put on the same police outfit when he is off duty and need some money.<br><br>On the road they look exactly the same to you and me.  Their operation is exactly the same except that the part time ones do not issue genuine traffic tickets.  Hence sometimes you do not wish to settle and yet will not get the traffic ticket (as promised).  One of the tell tale sign is the vehicle they use.  The off duty one uses civilian vehicle and usually of black color.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think being pulled over by the police, whether off-duty ones or the "real" ones, is a luxury already. I've had more than a few friends who have been robbed in Malaysia. My own relatives in Malaysia have had their experiences as well. One of my friend's parents were over in JB when this guy pulled out a gun at them, in an open space carpark, in broad daylight, and demanded that they hand over their E240. So, one E240 less in Singapore.<br><br>For those of you here who ride bikes and go into JB often, you should know about the mad man at the overhead bridge just before entering customs. The place where many people stop by to buy their cigarettes. You just need to give him a fierce stare before he even approaches you. He likes to target the "softer" looking people..<br>Cheers and good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometime ago as I was driving back from JB via 2nd link. After clearing the malaysian side custom and driving onwards. In front of me were a few other SG plate cars and as usual we all drove straight on. And guess what happen... suddenly a few of the ppl in plain clothes dashed out to stop our group of cars. I can see after this.. those cars behind us were diverted through another lane. When I ask what is the problem..they demand all the drivers to surrender their passports because we have crashed through their "roadblock"  ! On looking at the "roadblocks" they actually placed those plyons which are wide enough for the the cars to pass through without any uniform ppl or whatsoever standing there. I no choice have to give my passport to them and I also tried to negotiate with the plain cloth guy. Luckily the other driver of a Merc was very angry and keep raising his voice that it is a setup etc and demand to see the office in charge to clarify etc....making a big scene... and now all the plain clothes start t wagger liao...  and the guy holding on to my passport start to look around to see what he should do liao... then I ask him politely to let me have back my passport i will put the kopi money for him....but inside my mind I know their game is over.. once he pass me back my passport i went back to my car and drove off haha....<br></div>
