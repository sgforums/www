            <div class='col-md body'>U should really be asking your questions in the RX-8 forum or IS200 forum. The RX8 is known to be a guzzler. 55 litres for 490 is definitely impossible. 300+ is the norm.<br><br>While the looks is good, I cant say much about the speed as I found it reasonably slow unless u purchase the Shinken version at GR. Still, bang for the buck in terms of modification is almost non existent as its relatively slow. The new Lexus 250 is a different class compared to the RX8. U have to ask yourself as to what u need.<br><br>This forum only discusses M3.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> M3 reigns supreme and guy with foundation is an in thing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by s0ftdr|nk:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys, thinking of getting a second hand or first hand rx8.
