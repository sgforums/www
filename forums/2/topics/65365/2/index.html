My Daihatsu Charade which has 3-cylinders vibrates when travelling at 110 km/h - its max. speed.<br>The concept is simple, the more cylinders an engine has, the more powerful it would be.<br>But of course if we are looking for budget cars (1000cc or less), we can't expect to be getting really powerful engines, can we?</div>

Ya true, they just wouldn't bundle anything free when i pestered them. In the end, need to consider. the car itself other than the slight vibration, everything else is good and fun! I may just commit in 2 months time, anyway delivery is fast, less than 2 weeks!
