U sure ur Sunny hitting 6-7 km/l?? its too high le.. Tink u shld send back to TCMS for a check and ask them to tune ur engine. Unless ur car is an old one(3-4 yrs), i dun tink u shld have such problems. OH, u can also change to the Denso Iridium spark plugs(Long Life) and also try using the Mobil 1 engine oil.. There're 2 types, one gold and the other silver bottle. Check ur owner's manual to see which type suits ur car.... That's all i can help.. Ciaoz, God Bless!</div>
