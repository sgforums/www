I know, 95% chances are he or she, will not turn on hazard lights when a lot was found.<br><br>I also noted, some cars will overtake the one in front if the car keeps too much of a distance from the car in front.

They behave like being first or in front of you as well as overtaking you will win them a trophy.<br><br>Turn or switch lanes without signalling, decal and decorate their cheap japanese toyota cars and drive like Schummacher, they block your way you honk at them and they stare at you like you scolded their mother, and when you are reversing into a lot they must squeeze pass you centimeters away from your bumper, tailgate you when obviously there is slow traffic in front, park off-center of lots making you squeeze or make it impossible for you to park in the next vacant lot, the list is almost endless.<br><br>I seriously feel a lot of motorists here have mental problems - they're probably so stressed out in the lifestyle they keep that they don't know how they are behaving behind the wheel.<br><br></div>
