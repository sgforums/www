Isn't it an endorsement for WRX from the cops?

They've always had fast cars for the expressways. The Beemers and the Volvos have always been used for patrols on the expressways and have cost a lot more that the WRXs to acquire and run. Why the sudden pish-poshing now?? Btw, the TP doesn't use NS people to drive these fast patrol cars.</div>
