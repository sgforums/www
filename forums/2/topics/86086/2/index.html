Really enlighten me a lot.  I think I understand what you mean.  I think it's fair if we pay less downpayment, as a results we have to pay more installment.    But the thing really hurts us is the panelty we have to pay when we want to clear the loan earlier (like sell the car).  So, the shorter the loan period, the better, if the installment is bearable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, the best to spend per month on a car is zero, i.e., don't get a car.<br><br>However, if you die die must buy a car, you could:<br><br>1) Pay as much downpayment as possible. D/p of 25-30% should  ensure you don't have nightmare every night throughtout the tenure of your loan.<br><br>2) Opt <strong>out</strong> of the 10-year loan. Opting for 10-year loan is like digging your grave with a changkul.<br><br>Those opting for 10-year loan normally pay very little d/p. This is akin to digging the grave with an excavator. You had better hope you don't lose your job or suffer any financial crisis during the tenure of the loan. This is because you are in a negative-equity situation. When things get bad, you have to sell your car - and you have to top-up a neat sum in order to sell it. Your car value will be lower than the outstanding loan amount!<br><br>Paying installments is only one of the difficulties of owning a car. You have to think abt the cost of parking, fuel, servicing (which is rather expensive if you opt to go to the agents), and the occasional "greeting cards" from the authorities.</div>

Thanks for the explenation!<br><br>As you mentioned, can save 10K from COE.  convert to monthly installment is about $150 (7 year loan).  Road tax saving is $900.  monthly saving is $75.  Plus the saving for patrol, ~$100.  Hence, overall saving comparing with normal car is $325 per month.  Almost 1/3 of the overal cost!</div>
