SOunds little, yes. But it WILL matter a lot when you start worrying about the monthly petrol, road tax and insurance...<br><br>So as you can see, the more the downpayment initially, the lesser you'll have to pay per month.<br><br>So it'll be better if you take on a 10yrs loan right? since the repayment period will be extended to 3 more years...<br><br>WRONG!!!!!!!<br><br>because, unless you can tahan driving your car for very long, you'll have the urge to change your car.<br><br>but, if you do change your car sooner then a certain period, you'll have to fork out extra money because you're still servicing your interest from the loan.<br><br>from what i heard, for 7years loan, you should not sell your car until the end of the 3rd year or you'll have to fork out the extra money.<br><br>for 10years loan, i heard its at the 5th year.<br><br>that's why someone here mentioned that he must tahan till he's able to sell his car without making any loss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno what's the optimum downpayment. think there's no such thingy. talk to the car agent and he'll be able to calculate for you till a value you'll be comfy with. don't be shy about asking more.<br><br>i've seen on other thread in this forum that this person bought a Honda City (cost @ $75000 or something), downpayment is about $9k over 7 years, and his monthly is about $740.</div>
