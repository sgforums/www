            <div class='col-md body'>subaru's service the best one... b4 i bought my '03 civic, i went to subaru showroom to see car. the salesman came up to me the moment i stepped in and we talked like old friends. we then went for a test drive in the impreza. if the road noise was not so much and the car was more powerful, i would have bought that for its cheap price... after i collected my civic, i decided to drop by again for fun. even though the salesman knew i bought civic liao, his service still very good and recommend me to test drive the legacy 2.0i... if they increase the power and decrease road noise, next time i sure buy subaru <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it hard to link the word "service" with BM SE's.<br><br>BM SE's are legendary lots. Who else can sell cars so well w/o providing the MINIMUM expected service?<br><br>There was an article in Straits Times some time back on BM and the SEs providing good service to the buyers. Thank goodness I was not having my breakfast, else I'd need someone to perform a Heimlich on me.<br><br>My turn to relate my experience.<br>I visited BM's showroom at Ubi last December. Not a single SE approached me. I had to hunt for the price list myself. I practically served myself and viewed the Altis throughly. I opened/shut the doors, bonnet, boot so many times, and yet no one approached me, let alone offering me a test-drive.<br><br>I felt strange because Altis was newly launched then, and I thought BM would work harder to promote the Thai-assembled car. I was so wrong.<br><br>I visited so many new-car showrooms to shop for my new car, and it was the first time no one served me. Sorry, serve is the wrong word to use. I just wanted someone to talk to me and if possible, to beg them to let me test that car. Yeah, on that day, I became another figure in the statistics of the people given the legendary BM SE treatment.<br><br>I walked over to Nissan showroom, test drove the Sunny, and promptly booked my N16. Have to thank BM SEs 'cos they made it easier for me to eliminate Toyota from my list.<br><br>Kah Motor's SEs were exceptionally good too. Too bad the City is too ugly, the Jazz too small, and the Civics too expensive.</div>
