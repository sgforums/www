            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have been to Toyota showroom a few times and also try to test drive a few times.  The SE seems pretty okay.  I guess we should not "one bamboo stick sink the whole shipload of people".<br><br>I am sure they also know that Toyota is a well known brand and they would also like to spend their time wisely and invest them in potential customer that has a higher chance of booking the car.   That is only human nature and we should also put ourselves in their shoes.  However, I do agree that they should not discriminate or screen customer based on appearance or worst still, give sarcastic remarks.<br><br>If you are sincerely interested in their product, you could always go to the SE that will give u the best service and don't let your commission go to those that don't deserve it.</div>

You talk pwerful English, she also can talk the same, you talk like ah beng, she also can talk like ah lian...haha...thats the best part of it...<br><br>now the price have drop to $66k, with the introduction of the VTEC version but iDSI still best value for money.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we should complain to BM boss about their SEs or even write in to Japan Toyota HQ. We do not deserve to be served or be getting such attitude. We are paying 'blood sweat' money and yet this is what we get.<br><br>I also heard from my colleague who just recently bought a Vios. There was something wrong with the boot release and he called his SE. That guy don't even care to entertain him and tell him he's busy and just hang up. My poor friend has to go down to the workshop and wander around for help. So much for BM great after sales pitch. Yes Toyota is No.1 in engineering, No.1 in reliability, No.i in after sales value but their personal factor really hits the bottom.</div>
