However as I have stated; this is my dad's car. so I do not have the authority and finance to install such elaborate security systems on his vehicle. But if I do want to install such systems.. I guess the flamethrower would be my first option.<br><br>Here's a link to the news about the flamethrower system.<br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9812/11/flame.thrower.car/</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Laserlordz: These incidents happened either in school or at a hotel's carpark. You cant expect me to install a video camera wherever i park the car, right? However thanks for the suggestions and sorry for not noting where these incidents had occured<br><br>gohkatkat: I believe that I have already confronted them before. But they are people that do not listen to reason. Then decided to do something really immature like throwing tissue all over my dad's car. As I have warned SEI if it was him; I already have WD-40 for his breaks, limejuice for his windscreen and paint job, plus a five and seven Iron golf clubs just in case the limejuice didn't work for his M3. Thankfully he has finally stopped, so I only have the others to deal with now. Which I am not sure how to deal with without breaking the law. Thanks again for your ideas even if they were proven to be unethical for me to do.[/u]</div>

As the suspects and I have had some conflicts before this happened, and they aren't man enough to confront me face to face. So they are doing this only to make their pointless lives a bit more exciting and only to wait for what is in for them in the future when it's my turn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

As i also believe that one of the suspect is also a member of sgforums, however i do not want to name him because this would ruin his reputation if he has one at all.

You cant expect me to install a video camera wherever i park the car, right? However thanks for the suggestions and sorry for not noting where these incidents had occured<br><br>gohkatkat: I believe that I have already confronted them before. But they are people that do not listen to reason. Then decided to do something really immature like throwing tissue all over my dad's car. As I have warned SEI if it was him; I already have WD-40 for his breaks, limejuice for his windscreen and paint job, plus a five and seven Iron golf clubs just in case the limejuice didn't work for his M3. Thankfully he has finally stopped, so I only have the others to deal with now. Which I am not sure how to deal with without breaking the law. Thanks again for your ideas even if they were proven to be unethical for me to do.[/u]</div></blockquote>How old r u btw?

I am not able to report this to the police because the car wasn't harmed in anyway.
