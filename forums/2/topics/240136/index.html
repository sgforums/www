Valet parking is for ppl who dun wanna waste time finding a parking space, dun wanna waste the effort to look at their rear view mirrors when parking, dun wanna sqeeze in bewteen cars,  dun wanna waste the time walking from the car park through some stairs lifts and corridors and at the same time remember where they parked their car. if they worry that the valet parker is dishonest or will dirty anything.... then of course valet parking is not for them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm regarding the WHY part..<br><br>as far as i remember.. i onli valet park at the hotels.. (except goodwood park for obvious reasons)<br><br>and even when i valet park there, i park it by myself and then give them the keys after that.. so u're just paying for the lot..<br><br>except for the meritus mandarin one they got move my car back to fit more cars after i already park it..<br><br>and if its a valet parking anywhere other than a hotel i won't let them anywhere near.<br><br>and so, NO, i don't valet park at suntec, NUH, holland village, etc.</div>
