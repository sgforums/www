              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I currently have a Nissan Cefiro 230JM (2 years old) and i need some advise regarding engine startup.</p>
              <p>is it okay to start up the car before the airbag light in the dashboard goes off? cause i dunno what wrong startup maybe can cause  pre tensioner system to haywire. heard from my friend.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nixMHDjkuTY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nixMHDjkuTY</a></p>
              <p>as u can see from the vid the speedo rises up from 0- 2k rpm when i start. is that normal? cause i never experience that before.. it usually goes up to 1k rpm and stays there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>Modern cars have inbuild some auto warm up - which will see that it will go 2k rpm - to get the oil and other things flowing and warm up .... once that is done, it will goes down to 1k .</p>

              <p>Some cars nowadays have auto warm up feature just like what storywolf said. I have seen some continental cars (like the S40) holding the rev at about 2,000-2,500rpm for about 30-50 seconds depending on the temperature. Even my father's picanto holds it at about 1,200-1,400rpm for about 3-4minutes at startup when engine is cold. I would say it's normal.</p>
              <p>Added: But of course, best to check with Tan Chong the next time you bring it for servicing.</p>

              <p>Usually even if you start the engine in the middle of its self diagnosis, it shouldn't be a problem.</p>

              <p>There is absolutely no problem in starting your engine when all those lights are on. But make sure those 'problem indicators' such as engine oil pressure and ABS signs go off AFTER starting your engine. It will usually go off within 5 secs after starting your engine. <br><br>It's also very normal for the engine to go to 2k rpm during start up. Looking at your video, nothing seems wrong about your engine, so relax!</p>
              <p>Just to add on, you don't have to wait for the lights to go off before starting your engine. In your video, it seems you are very cautious and waited for a 5 secs before starting your engine. In case of an emergency, you wouldn't want to wait that long to get your engine started. But if you insist on '5 star treatment' for your engine then I leave it up to you, it's your car and you have to make the final decision.</p>

              <p>Sry.. ps but another qn.. D1+D2+D3 stands for?  My Cefiro
              is not CVT.. bt auto.</p>
              <p>I heard they are for mountainous driving but have never tried
              them yet..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seems that it has more throttle response..</p>
              </div>

              <p>D1, D2, D3 are all just different shift programmes to suit different needs. Be it more acceleration, slope, etc.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You can immediately start your engine (as in straight away turn to "start") instead of putting the key at "On" position till the lights go off. In short, just turn your car key like you would when you are opening your house door with your house key. Short and sweet, don't need worry about so many things.<br><br>'5 Star treatment' is meant to say that you treat your engine with extreme care, such as waiting for all the lights to go off. This is usually done by people who are very afraid that anything will go wrong with their car.<br><br>D3 is also known as "sport mode". If your car is a 4 speed gearbox, it keeps your your gearbox at Gear 3 for extended period of time (usually until you reach the redline before changing up to 4). It is useful for overtaking, especially on expressways. D2 and D1 are not really applicable in S'pore as there is very little 'moutain roads'. D2 could be used when going up moutain slope such as Genting or going down steep slope to maintain engine braking. D1 is usually used when people drive cars with traillers attached to them. In short, there is no use for D1 in Singapore at all. If you are confused, then I suggest that you keep your gear lever at D. Good enough on S'pore roads.<br><br>Hope this clarifies your doubts. :)</p></div>

              <p><br>Nope, just drive as per normal. Put one thing to take note of. Most cars have this saftey feature to prevent you from shifting to D2 or D1 accidentally. Meaning, you have to press your gear stick button to engage D2 or D1. Most cars do not need you to press the gear stick button for D3. In D3, you will feel that your car is more 'powerful and responsive'. So don't be surpirsed if the car suddenly accelrates faster. Just drive normaly and you should be fine.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As stated in my 2nd previous post, D3 limits your gear at Gear 3 if you are using a 4 speed auto gearbox. For example, you are crusing in the middle lane on an expressway in Gear 4, then you find this person in front driving too slowly and decide to overtake. You could either:<br><br>1) Just leave your Gear in D position and just step on the accelerator harder, the autobox will sense that you want more power and automatically shifts down into Gear 3.<br><br>2) If you are not confident that you will overtake fast enough, you could put it into D3, this is when the gearbox will 'force' the gearbox to change into Gear 3. The electronics onboard will tune the accelerator pressure VERY slightly so that you will have faster response time. The difference in response is not very noticable, espically in non performance car like your Cefiro.<br><br><br>In conclusion, D3 is used to force the gearbox to change into Gear 3 if you are using a 4 speed auto gearbox. It also improves accelerator response very slightly. So, D3 is usually used for overtaking in difficult circumstances. It is sort of changing a manual gear box from gear 4 to gear 3. Works the same way. But if you are really not confident, I suggest just don't medle with the gearbox, just step on the accelerator harder if you want to overtake. But, there is no harm trying! :)</p></div>
