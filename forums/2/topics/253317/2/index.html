            <div class='col-md body'>Well I am not sure if the brand value has appreciated to the levels of Nissan or Toyota. IMO, I would still go for a Nissan/Toyota 1.6 instead of the Impreza. The WRXs are different thing altogether and if increase in sales in WRXs are a thing to commend a good job done, drop the price of any "sought after cars" you will also see a similar effect. What I am saying that the WRX is more affordable now than 2 years back so the sales has increased and we see more of them on the road, simple as that. Equate that with a good job done, debatable.</div>

However, that is not to say he is dumb either &gt;&gt; I think one of his best moves recently was bringing in an automatic WRX.<br><br>This is Singapore; most of us that can afford to drive are working professionals clocking in hours at the office. Many of us do think about driving sports or exotic cars but none of us actually moves up on that because of issues of practicality (luxury for the money) &gt;&gt; e.g. 4 doors - A MUST; leather seats - A MUST etc etc. &gt;&gt; After a long day at work, we're tired ... who has the mood to drive a manual! My licence is for a manual but I've never ever ever driven a manual beyond my driving exam.<br><br>Non-drivers (that is people who do not work daily and drive daily, and for the past 3 years at least) please do not contribute your worthless 2 cents.<br></div></blockquote>In Singapore, driving an automatic vehical is actually more practical. I do agree that bringing in a automatic WRX is a good move but have you thought of why you buy a WRX in the first place? it is the joy of driving and the experience of the reponsive engine and gears change. A automatic WRX would be like removing that joy. I had wanted to buy a Legacy GT but the auto gear box was what put me off.<br></div>
