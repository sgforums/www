The car is damn good feeling. The braking is awesome and sharp cornering at 80km/h without releasing the accelerator is very shiok. The car comes Electronic Stablility Programme (ESP). <span style="color: red;"><strong>Highly recommended to visit Regent Motors today and tomorrow.</strong></span><br>It's really value for money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Regent Motors for the test drive and circuit drive by the instructor at the launch today. The launch was very well planned and everything went smoothly. After viewing the video and a cameo appearance of the car, I went up to the top level to have a closer look at the car. I'll have to say that the new Ford Focus took my breath away with its impressive performance on a slalom course using its trademark - sharp and responsive handling during the circuit drive at a closed road in Ubi.<br><br>Well-built quality, nimble handling, great braking system, to name a few. By the way, it was awarded a 5-star safety rating by Euro NCAP, the highest overall score in its class (besides the Renault Megane). The Ghia model is the most well-equipped with its Digital Air-Con, electric sunroof, 16" Alloys, chilled glovebox, front and rear armrest, leather clad steering wheel, among a few other amenities. The most disappointing thing is that the Ghia model does not have Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) and rear disc brakes.<br><br>Overall, I would say that it is really a GREAT car to consider besides the Opel Astra and Renault Megane if you're looking for a continental car in that class. The only thing that I'm very sure of is that no other car its class can match its handling. On a negative note, I think the styling is not as bold as its predecessor, the steering wheel is nice to hold and feel but not nicer looking than the previous model (subjective to me) and although a new engine, output remains at 100 horsepower. Though not as powerful as other Japanese counterparts, the car feels powerful and willing to rev.<br><br>Here are the prices for the new Ford:<br><br>Focus 4 door (Automatic) is <strong>$76,900</strong><br>Focus 5 door (Manual) is <strong>$76,900</strong><br>Focus 5 door (Automatic) is <strong>$77,900</strong><br>Focus 5 door Ghia model (Automatic) is <strong>$79,900</strong><br><br>All automatic transmissions are offered with Durashift.<br><br>For those who have been eyeing the new Focus for a while, I highly recommend that you go for the launch which ends tomorrow. You won't regret it. Bet you'll just be as impressed as me too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>These information here (other than the prices  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) are based on my honest and personal opinion. I just wish to share my wonderful experience with the new Ford Focus with fellow forummers here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>P/S: For those of you who might be thinking something else, I do not work for Regent Motors, neither do any of my relatives and friends do. I just want to share something which I think might be useful to other people. That simple.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
