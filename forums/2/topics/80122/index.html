            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday morning in front of the entrance to the old Capitol Theathers i saw this toyota was trying to turn in but he stop cause there are people on the zebra crossing. Behind came a taxi and honk the hell out of him them he step on the gas and made a stare when he went past. What a jerk the taxi driver is being. Its a shame that these are the people who represent Singapore to the tourists. No wonder they are rated as the top ten most hated people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
