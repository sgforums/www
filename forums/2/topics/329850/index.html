              <p><strong>By Sarban Singh</strong></p>
              <p>SEREMBAN, MALAYSIA: A Singaporean couple on their way to a hill
              resort for a holiday had a harrowing experience - not only were they
              involved in an accident but they were robbed as well.</p>
              <p>The couple were travelling in a Ferrari on Friday when it collided
              with another vehicle at the 274th kilometre of the North-South
              Expressway, slightly damaging its front.</p>
              <p>
              
              Within seconds of the accident, two men wearing baseball caps arrived in a Mercedes Benz and began shouting at the couple.</p>
              <p>A witness said one of them was holding a piece of wood and hit the
              Ferrari with it before assaulting the driver who was already injured in
              the accident.</p>
              <p>He said they fled after taking several items from the Ferrari.</p>
              <p>The woman was not harmed as she ran off on seeing the two men approaching their car.</p>
              <p>"Within a short while, a few more Ferraris arrived and took the couple away," he said.</p>
              <p>State police chief SAC I Datuk Osman Salleh confirmed the incident but added details were still sketchy.</p>
              <p>Preliminary investigation revealed that the two men had impersonated Customs enforcement officers, he said.</p>
              <p>It is learnt the couple had yet to lodge a police report as of yesterday evening.<img src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/news/09Sep08/others/20080907.103748_20080907_ferrari1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="175"></p>

Black F430 spider, good chance it's one that lived quite near to me, hope it isn't the one because that was an amazing car. At least the owner and his passenger got out safely, this could have ended much worse...</p></div>

              <p>Could be some tales spinned by some rich guy to claim insurance from the insurance company ?</p>
              <p>These rich guys have nothing to do but to test their machine at the north south highway.</p>

              <p>I was present for all of the weekend events; I was the first person from the Ferrari Club to arrive at the accident scene "after a short while", and my wife was in one of the cars that the gangsters attempted to carjack (whilst she was still in the vehicle). Most people involved are still deeply scarred by it, and many will probably never return to Malaysia. Fact is we were very lucky that noone was seriously injured or killed; we were very lucky that the gangsters didn't know how to drive an exotic. Maybe next time (if there will be a next time) we won't be so lucky. Hardly something I'd be laughing about.</p>

              <p>The thread title also a bit wrong... the car got wrecked BEFORE the thugs came up to rob him. the owner was trying to outrun the merc until they hit rain, lose control and went off the road. In a way yes, that ferrari was unlucky... that's because he was alone and stationary at that point of time. When the ferrari got wrecked and stuck dead on the road, the merc thugs got their chance to rob the fella. omg guys you should read the newspaper report from the ST and newpaper again... they alrady gave a comprehensive detail about this incident.</p>
              <p>The common tactic robbers in malaysia use on the roads is to bump the cars off the road, make them stop and then rob them. Anyone heard of  robberies while the cars are on the move? No right... The merc was trying to isolate the last car in the convoy so that they can pull a hit on that victim, but failed because some of the cars in front had stopped too to accompany the last car. And the merc failed 3 times in doing so. The paper also reported that the robbed victim was not part of the convoy and was travelling alone, but was on the way to meet them... perfect opportunity for the merc to try bump him off the road. Had it not been for the rain... he could've escaped by outrunning.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think it's very stupid for people to be laughing about the incident and the Merc 'catching' him as well - yes Ferrari's are faster, but then again this was on a public highway with other cars around, and in very slippery conditions because of the rain, so its very understandable what happened. The driver would have also been panicking, with every right to be if he thought he was being chased by armed gangsters. The owner just got very unlucky... can imagine it to be a very traumatising experience...</p></div>

              <p>Apparently, for all members who take part in Clubs Getaway, please be more careful as the malaysian monkeys(locals) are getting more mischevious. Perhaps equipping the car with a small fireaxe would do and i dont think Singapore Customs would have any issue with that either.</p>
