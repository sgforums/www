              <p>Let me rephrase your question. Do u ever go JB? A good analogy is, there been quite a stir in the malaysian newspaper about people getting raped there..so would u still go to JB? The chances are still remote for you and ur gf(if applicable) and even less if you stick to safer place. The same thing applies to the Ferrari getaway</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why would ppl still go to malaysia? cos our roads here dun allow them to stretch the legs of their cars. Many of you ppl here say "if wanna play, go malaysia highway to play lah" , so yah loh. Ok then where else can you have the opportunity to go faster? There is no other choice than up north. Also, safety in numbers work. You read stories about ppl getting robbed and all sorts... and the victim vehicle is ALWAYS alone. Heard of convoys being targetted? yeah this recent one... but what was that merc trying to do? picking off only one. What do you think it'll take to rob an entire convoy? Probably the only place where you can see a convoy being wiped out is in Iraq.</p></div>

              No don't rephrase. <p>most pple would have reduced the trips or not gone because of the high incidence. If you still went, then you are taking the risk. think it won't happen to you is just trying to comfort yourself. even if the chance is 1 out of 100, going ten times means there is a 1 out of ten chance of it happening to you. Don't know about you, but it sounds high to me. </p><p> secondly, even if you feel it's exagerated and it's not THAT dangerous there. You still don't go around attracting attention and fluanting wealth thinking that you won't get targetted.</p>

              <p>Most, if not all of these guys have had to work very hard to get to where they are. I just think the mere fact that they are in the club and participating in a 'club' drive up (i know the one that crashed wasn't in the convoy, but he was meeting them up there) shows that these guys are motoring enthusiasts and love driving their cars, and not simply just people just showing off and flaunting their wealth</p>

              <p><br>You can call it childish.....you can ignore such comments.</p>
              <p>You can also say its not about flaunting. I believe you.</p>
              <p>But the fact still remains that a car like this is eye-catching, you want to deny that?</p>
              <p>It's like slinging a Louis Vulton (correct spelling boh?) on your shoulder and not expecting to get robbed by a guy on motorbike. You're not wrong, you may not be flaunting, but it still happens!</p>
              <p>Why are you saying that such comments are childish if you refuse to see the truth that what you are driving is eye-catching?</p>

              <p>on a contrary, i think they are smart. they may not know where is the `on' button to start the engine. anyway, the car is damaged already.</p>
              <p>taking the stuff inside the car probably nett them a couple of months of high living at least.</p>
              <p>this is not a toyota, where you can `blend in'. the prancing horse sticks out like a sore thumb up north.</p>
