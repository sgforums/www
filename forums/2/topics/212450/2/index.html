I think there is a general misconception or mis-expectation about kei cars. many tend to review it from a sub-compact car (abt 1000cc) perspective, which is unfair.  i personally love kei cars for their nimbleness and agility in town/city driving albeit it won't be as smooth-as-silk-like ride as most better non-kei cars, given its lighter weight. i truly enjoy these kei cars qualities for what they are and it always puts a smile on my face when i'm behind the wheels. i used to own a viki as well.  my other car is a honda stream which rides and handles like a dream but like i said, you gotta enjoy kei cars for what it is.  having said that, my opinion of the R1?  drives like a go-kart, which is an experience by itself! put your mind in the right frame if this is what you are looking to own and see how it feels when you drive it.  if it feels good, get it.  it it doesn't, don't. no middle ground for kei cars, especially when you have to pay a premium for it in singapore. but all said and done, you definately can make it up ngee ann city carpark!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
