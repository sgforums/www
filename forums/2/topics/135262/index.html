IMO, it does not matter what vehicles you are on, it is the driver that make the different.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I have experience of a lot of car drivers come to close to me just because they wanted to have a good look at my bikes. Their steer toward to where their eyes is looking(at my bike) and I have to maneuver away and wave good bye.(act cool.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I have also some experience that the bikes(Kanna 400CC Honda) wanted so much to race with my SL500. They are like following me for couple of traffic lights junctions until I zoom out into theÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…car park into Hyatt.
