              <p>Once sat inside a Skoda Superb 2.5V6 turbodiesel taxi.The cabbies claimed that Skoda taxis can outrun a Subaru WRX2.0 Turbocharge petrol,Wonder how true it is.Maybe on SG roads but i dun think so on Highways in Malaysia.Since Turbodiesel/CNG taxis like Sonatas,Magentis,Merc hit sg roads i seen many boastful and arrogant cabbies now.Dunno why leh.Once inside a Kia Magentis Taxi the cabby tailgate and horning at the poor Picanto in front until thefront driver was so fed up that call the cabby to stop.Dun understand why the sudden arrogant on driving turbodiesel Taxis?</p>
              <p>PS:I;m not biased towards Cabbies as i've also possess Taxi Vocational License and my Uncle is a cabby too.</p>

              <p>I had a same experience as you once. I was traveling in a Sonata along the expressway near Hougang around midnight. The uncle tailgated 2 cars while traveling at 80 ~ 100 km/h! One was a Lancer while the other was a BMW 3 series. I was kind of pissed when the uncle forced them to switch lane and speed up. I was like, "WTH? Can't you just switch lane yourself when the expressway is SO empty." </p>
              <p>I'm taking my practical lessons soon, and I know how dangerous it is. Not only putting me at risk, but the 2 cars with passengers in it as well.</p>

              <p>The power of Skoda Superb V6s has been discussed ad nauseum, maybe not here but in other forums. Fyi the Superb has about 340Nm of torque. The new WRX 5D 2.5litre has 320Nm of torque (The Vios has 141Nm).

              <p>Most taxi drivers are arrogant, impatient and dangerous drivers... They can just suddenly swerve out or change lane without warning. There was even once when a driver following behind me giving me the hands up just because I was driving at the speed limit. I point out most as there're still some good taxi drivers around...</p>
              <p>Normally some taxi drivers have alot of stories to tell, just nod nod and agree with them or else in this case, if you disagree and he tries to prove his point, it will be endangering everyone around him...  They have drivin the manual Crown and Cedric for years, the turbo and supercharger seems to be a novelty to them.</p>

              <p>In a century sprint, a split second can means the difference of
                  nearly 1 car length... A skoda lose slightly to a vios from
                  standstill, probably.</p>
              <p>Don't bother talking about topspeed in local context... who
                  would want to risk their life and others to get over 200km/h just
                  to show a skoda can win a vios?</p>

              <p>According to www.carfolio.com, 0-100 is achieved in 9.2 seconds and kerb weight is 1645kg. According to carwale.com kerb weight is 1604kg and 0-100 not specified. So where you get your figures from may I ask? I admit though, the only thing i stated wrong was the torque. The skoda superb v6 tdi tip produces 350Nm of torque at just 1250rpm. You don't believe can go the respective 2 websites (I can find more, but just not bothered to) and find out. So how is it that the vios win a skoda?</p>

              <p>ok la.. i got my specs wrong also.. never read clearly..</p>
              <p>I got it from http://www.cardekho.com/details/Skoda_Superb_Comfort_2.5_V6_TDI</p>
              <p>which states 10.3s, I saw 9.2s as well on some site, but it's for the new 2.0 tdi but since ts mentioned 2.5 v6 tdi i used that site.</p>
              <p>350Nm is peak torque, and by dying down i simply meant declines.. sorry for wrong choice of word. 350 is peak already.. it can only go down right?</p>
              <p>I can't find the performance graph for 2.5 v6 tdi, but here's one for 1.9 tdi which shows a high torque achieved at low rpm, declines slightly then gradually. 1250-3000 rpm is a tad narrow band to ride for a sprint isn't it? correct me if i'm wrong as I've never driven a TD car before. I only have experience in petrol turbo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After all these, a vios is still a close fight. I'm just using a car of similar performance in a century sprint to illustrate that it won't win a wrx, nor lose slightly.</p>

              <p>Pardon my many mistakes.. 9.2 is for manual? Ah then I'm very sorry lol.. Didn;t know that a superb manual can actually shift faster than a tiptronic, but then again maybe it has to do with the gear ratios as well?</p>
              <p>As for the whatcar link, let me kindly link it here.. though if its really for the manual version for 9.2s, then I would have pwned myself.. and yes i apologise for misintepreting, 350Nm is the peak torque achievable.. though with a simple chip up or increase in boost pressure, can be easily increased, but if you go the tuning route, then there will never be an end because vios can similarly be tuned and i'm sure the NA class at sepang / PG offers no lack of high performing vios-es.</p>
