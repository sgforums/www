            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>I'm currently driving an 02 civic. I'm seriously thinking about putting in a turbo charger, and boring out the cylinders. If there is a way I'd also consider changing to DOHC. I'm good at mechanical work and plan to do the change myself. Used to work on bikes a lot, but new to cars.<br><br>Question is, is there an online store I can go to see what kind of things I can buy and do? Things like reliable engine kits, perhaps aftermarket camshafts? Also is there a good technical forum online for modifying civics, for DIYers?<br><br>Another option I'm thinking of is selling the civic and getting an Evo. Does anyone here know how much the road tax and insurance costs for an evo, lets say evo 8 or 7? Thanks for all the help you can give.<br><br>PS: One car I like a lot is the Nissan 3000GT, but I can't find much info on it, anyone knows the specs, and how much one will cost?<br></div>

If you want to DIY your car and bore the camshaft yourself, you will need at least a few days without a ride ..... DIY cars are real fun cause when i am in US ... my buddy there does cars himself ... you can do endless things DIYin yourself ... you will have to go to various website and jot down those parts you think you want to buy.<br><br>2. You can also get Car mag to 'steal' abit of idea from there .... there is a book i read from IMM's book store on the 4th flr ... i can't really remember what is the book store name but i came across this bok about this ang moh converting his civic '93 to a SiR engine and placing his own intercooler and his turbo w/t blow off.<br><br>3.Those insures your soon-to-be-yours Evo 7/8 is gonna cost you around 8 - 9 K if ya below 21 .... and about 7.5k if ya above ... but really if you drive a rally car there will be no kick compared to mod-ing your own car ..... but you will have to risk getting caught for those modifications  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just my 2 cents ....</div>
