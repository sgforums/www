I believe you have personally used it on your ride and you are speaking from experience, as most forummers here i believe offer genuine opinions and practical tips. You're very helpful indeed. Also, didn't realise till now that patterns and designs on a piece of cloth are actual considerations before purchase for some car owners. I'm glad I learned something today.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by VW King:</div><div class="quote_body">Aiyah....the Turtle Wax Chamois is good. $15 is a steal.

Duh.....<br></div></blockquote>Got a friend who doesn't think twice about blowing over $300 for a shirt, while another friend wouldn't pay a cent more than $30. What gives? Pricey or not is relative, and its all about perceived value isn't it?<br><br>Didn't state anywhere that I wouldn't pay that amount for the TW Chamois. In fact, read closer and you might actually see the line that says, "....if it gets the job done in half the time, it might be worth it." See that?<br><br></div>
