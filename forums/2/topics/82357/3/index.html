Oh let me worship you, master of equations.<br><br><blockquote>u mentioned that all are fallible, that includes u too mr. </blockquote>Of course. The difference is I don't go around telling people to never argue with me about anything.<br><br><blockquote>don't state the obvious. i mentioned before in my earlier post that there MUST be a load to work against, otherwise there can be no measure of horsepower. at either 20%, 50% or WOT, there is still a specific horsepower rating pegged to the rpm. ur additonal pre-requisite to the whole measurement does not take away the crux of ur faulty statement that there is no horsepower rating at any given rpm. </blockquote>You were not specific and now you say "don't state the obvious" when you were asking about the standard hp specs listing RPM.  Fact is there can be no horsepower rating without a given load.  You will not be able to quote me on there being "no horsepower rating at any given rpm" because that is not something I've ever said.  What I did say was that there is no horsepower rating at any given RPM <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span> specified load.   You can say it is obvious, but then why did you end up asking obvious questions about standard manafacturer power specs?  You are a funny person, amazingly good at twisting words.<br><br><blockquote> wrong. in my previous post, i was dealing specifically with the fact that rpm and horsepower are dependant on the gearing and the efficiency of the engine respectively and not upon one another. the point on piston stress was merely my answer to brisance that it is difficult to justify the amount of stress a piston undergoes without considering the factors such as the size and material strength of the pistons vs the amount of horsepower produced by any engine.</blockquote>Point is that is still the entirely wrong thing to be worrying about , especially in a smaller, higher-stressed engine that is trying to keep up with a bigger one.   Looking in the entirely wrong area.  You started to go off the wrong way when dansplace mentioned "pumping".  It is pretty clear he meant pumping as in revving, but you took it to mean pressure against the piston which is silly because MEP is far less dependent on displacement than it is on power and RPM.  In any case a small NA engine cannot be made to increase MEP and increase power by much to the point of damaging pistons.  It has to rev and it is the inertial loads accompanying the rev that will hurt it, not anything else.<br><br>Dr Physics, you just keep pushing your point - a point that has been wrong from the very start.<br><br><blockquote>so which one are u? an automotive engineer or a materials engineer?</blockquote>I am a disciplinarian of rogue big headed physics graduates.<br><br><blockquote>i never disagreed to this. u never stated any source to verify this statement of urs but i'll give u the benefit of the doubt. but so what if they are far more culpable? u still digress so much in ur whole arguement which u perveived i started, i'm beginning to think i'm talking to a child with either a short attention span or a puberscent teenager who's too smart for his own good. </blockquote>Usually people start to "think up" all sorts of things when they realize they are wrong but are too proud to admit it.  I'm predicting that your great thoughts are about to get even more wild.<br><br><blockquote>first of all, i never told anyone not to argue with me because i hold a physics major. take the time to read my first post and u'll realize that i said dun argue with me on "EQUATIONS". </blockquote>You are still fallible on equations.

If you tried that in real life with me, I would sue you.<br><br><blockquote>i've seen dogs eating their own poo, but denying what u said urself tops the list of the most disgusting things a human being is capable of. ur additional load pre-requisite does not change the fact that this statement is faulty and in contravention of what i have stated, that there is a specific horsepower rating per rpm. </blockquote>Here is a question.  If, like you say, there is specific horsepower rating per RPM just like that, then what is the horsepower when you accelerate off a stop light at part throttle [exact % unkown] and as the needle sweeps past 2500rpm? Say your car is a 4.0 V8 making 400hp at 6500rpm redline.  You should know your horsepower at 2500rpm correct?  Assume manafacturer's published WOT dyno plot shows linear power curve peaking at 6500rpm, starting from 0 rpm, 0 hp - straight line all the way up.<br><br>By your definition of "there IS a specific horsepower rating per RPM.<br>" , you should know the answer.<br><br><blockquote>i have my own agenda for posting the things i said and it is u who started off wrongly by rocketing off the planet in another direction which is not in tangent with mine and now, i have to be concerned with what u think is important? which is worse? telling ppl not to argue with u (on equations i quote) or forcing ur opinions down other ppl's throats? </blockquote>Sorry but these things are not matters of opinion.  We are not disussing philosophy, but physics.  You may understand the equations, but you do not understand the dynamics of the situations in which they are applied.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>and who are u to interpret what dansplace meant by "pumping" and all the other terms other ppl have said? the first point of contact in the combusting wavefront are the pistons and that makes it logical to infer the "pumping" of the pistons.</blockquote>So you think Dansplace meant how hard a piston is being pumped to mean increasing the pressure on the piston?  Do you think he thought he could increase the pressure on the pistons per stroke in a smaller NA engine without the aid of FI or power adders?  Or do you think he meant being revved faster and harder?  Either he is some sort of genius, or he is a normal person like any one of us. If someone like Roger Parkes or Rob White had said the same thing, only then would I have imagined it to potentially mean increasing pressure by some new method.   I have met with and talked to dansplace in real life before.  So based on all the above, and his level of understanding of engines, I believe he meant revving, and not increasing cylinder pressure. This is similar to how I and others I am friends with [Champ Car, NHRA, IHRA, NMCA, Indy Car, F3000, endurance road race, endurance circle track, NASCAR, Trans-Am, engine builders and engineers], would take Dan's words.<br><br><blockquote> the fact that u had the cheek to call my interpretation "silly" makes u ingenious and infallible? </blockquote>Yeah they're silly, but I don't tell you to never argue with me about it. I just call it silly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>take a hike somewhere else.</blockquote>Ok, soon.<br><br><blockquote> i have far larger pool of intelligent ppl with a better grasp of the word "humility" to entertain. </blockquote>Good for you. So maybe you shouldn't stick around to entertain me.<br><br><blockquote>impressive. i am shakin in my boots....... so u think u are doing a good job then? </blockquote>Don't you even get it?  Since you and I are involved, neither of us can judge it because we are biased <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>u fail to convince me in ur arguments </blockquote>Don't you even get it? I'm here to convince some [excluding you] and protect others from your cocky, but dead wrong words.  Discussions over the internet very rarely end up in either side changing their viewpoint.<br><br><blockquote>not even man enough to admit the fact that u misquoted and misinterpreted of my previous posts</blockquote>Quote your own words, and my direct misquote.  Do not paraphrase, do not change anything.  Show me where I misquoted you if you can.  I have already shown you above where you have misquoted me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Now let's see you.<br><br><blockquote>then fall me on the one brisance quoted and i refuted instead of beating around the bush like a wuss. </blockquote>You being right on one equation does not make you infallible on all equations as you have claimed.  Don't you get it?<br><br><blockquote>my most admirable halfling, there u go again going through painstaking means of adding ur own pre-requisites of "whilst the rods are shortened" juz to take a pot shot at me. </blockquote>You squirm very hard.  [DIRECT quote: but that would mean that u have to reduce the piston height (and therefore its overall size) as well. otherwise, the piston crown will hit the valves and head components at TDC.]  See the words "HAVE TO" that you used?  Well you don't HAVE TO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Like I said, you can shorten the rods.  Fact is where substantial enough displacement gains have to be made, the rods have to be shortened.  You can only tighten up the ring package, thin out the rings and lands, a very small amount,<br><br>So you see, you can either make piston changes to accomadate extra stroke, or you can shorten the rods.  Both work, but piston changes things to a much smaller degree.  You do not HAVE TO reduce piston height.  Hell, you can run fat gaskets, or even weld the block.  There are so many options besides changing pistons height.  You just didn't know.<br><br><blockquote>whilst what u say is true for certain stroker kits,</blockquote>For MOST, not certain.  MOST stroker kits.  I can find you more stroker kits that come with short rods than you can find that come without rods and changed pistons (not for the purposes of changing compression but for clearance).<br><br><blockquote> there are others who do not use a shorter conrod per say as this would affect the rod ratio and other characteristics of the engine thereafter. </blockquote>Hahah, you probably have been reading all those internet pages about rod ratio, or maybe some of the old timer books eh?  But please take note of the year the books were written, who is writing it, and or the engines they are basing the information off.  Fact is with modern production materials and tolerances, rod ratio is something that designers design around and end up with, rather than design towards - within very wide limits of 1.4-2.0. [There are endurance race engines running 1.5 RSs - imagine that]  A while ago, friend of mine asked the president of Ilmor (another friend) to list the top 10 things in that he looks out for when designing a race engine.  Rod ratio wasn't even on the list.  Displacement was though.  So there.<br><br><blockquote>we talked specifically on "stroking up" (ie, making the stroke of the engine crank longer only) to increase the displacement, that would necessarily require the piston height to be shortened. dun add ur own unsolicited pre-requisites please. </blockquote>Nope. Your logic is very poor.  There are at least 5 things you can do after stroking up to prevent interference.  One of them is changing the pistons, 4 of them are other options, 3 of which are listed above.  So no one HAS TO change pistons.  No one necessarily requires the piston height to be shortened.  Don't add your own unsolicited exclusions.<br><br>Just showed a couple of peers your postings and they laughed quite F-ing hard.  They said your english is pretty good though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> They like your flowery language.  Before this I had problems making them understand how bad this attitude which is so dominant in Singapore is - the place they know I come from.  Well thanks for the example, now they know.   I've come across lots of people like you before, but none quite as bad as you.</div>
