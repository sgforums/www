Due to my low budget, I'm initially thinking of Picanto cos of its $240 monthly instalment. But this morning, heard on radio that Mazda 2's monthly instalment is $300. What do you pple suggest?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi skywalker,<br><br>The U turn I would say its not the best performance for its size (comparing it to a bigger size car that I have driven - Toyota wish) but it is adequate for normal U-turn, not talking about illegal ones! Can't remember how many turn on steering I have to make.<br><br>The steering feels very light,don't really like this. Though during cornering, I can feel the car corners well. Can't compare to a focus, but its responsive enough.<br><br>The engine noise can be on the high side. On the gear tranmission, tt has a hold button which holds the gear (so it cant automatically shift gear up) for overtaking purpose. I haved rev the engine to 6000rpm and you can feel that it can still be pushed further. This is definitely a plus point for drivers who doesnt have a heavy foot, a plus point for drivers who love to rev with auto cars!<br><br>Apart from that, the luggage compartment, on the rear seat, you could get the seats up to free more space, lifting the rear seat up and it levels with the boot .Some cars, you cant do that. Makes me feel that the designers have considered the aspect of luggage space in designing MZ2.<br><br>There are much more but I will have to write in on the next post. Back to work.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u happen to monitor MZ2 price over the past few months, u will find that the dealer has not adjusted their price when COE changes. This is like putting up something to sell and thinking they are the best.<br><br>Every month they put up some gimmicks to attract buyer eg. $300 monthly but there is actually no difference in the selling price. Remember to add $12 to the advertised price eg. 69,988 -&gt; 70K.<br><br>My advice is NOT to get MZ2 now. If u really want similar cars, go get other Japanese car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i test drove the MZ2 when i was doing shortlisting for my car.... eventually it got to the final round when I have to decide and I went for toyota altis instead..... reasons being for about the same amt, i can get a bigger saloon car...<br><br>just my 2ct of advice... if budget is a big constraint, go for the kia picanto..... the advert for MZ2 is just a gimmick and u may end up having to pay for very much more then u expected to....<br><br>best is to go to the showroom, test drive the car and ask the SE to work out the total sum for u... then the picture may b clearer for u..... n u can make a decision....<br><br>for kia picanto, saw in other threads that the car not much power unless manual transmission.... but since u just need a transportation tool for work, shd b ok.... at least easier on ur pocket......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Picanto is $50k whilst the MZ2 is $70k... if price is the issue, I think the Picanto is your answer - its probably the most affordable car in Singapore.  I've seen the exterior and interior of the Picanto though, and well... let's just say it reflects the low price you'll pay.<br><br>As for MZ2, I think most people will fork out that extra $10k to get the much nicer MZ3.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Mazda 2 were also one of my choice, have checked out the lastest promotion of $300, and realised that it's only for the first 14 months, 15th month will be around $760 and $850++ for the rest of the months!!!  Which is consider very high unless you are very sure you will be rich by that time.<br><br>Have also checked the picanto and found the boot is too small.<br><br>Beside that, I have also checked out some other models:<br><br>Mazda 3 -<br>Excellent body! But the engine imported here is only 1.6 with Auto which has made the car very underpower and fuel comsumption is high!<br><br>Toyota Vios -<br>Very soft body, can easily feel the body metal is warping when you gently push with your fingers.  We bought a Sonata for my mother in law in brunei, same problem and the engine compartment is really cheap.<br><br>Proton Gen2 -<br>Very nice design and powerful engine, also very good in the handling as well.  Just before wanted to book it, I read some news that a Gen2 just caught in fire after 4 days of ownership.  And also found some very negative feedback about the materials used in the interior. like the door handle, handbrake and cheap plastic all over the place.<br>http://www.suaramalaysia.com/archives/2004/08/gen2_on_fire_1.html<br><br>Peugeot 206-<br>One of my dream car!  Top quality all over and Superior sales service!  The SE explains every single point of the car and is very professional.  But my wife doesn't like the small interior space. Sighh!!!<br><br>Kia Cerato-<br>Looking nice, but our company's Korean made Mercedes Van has given us so much trouble which has made me not interested in Korean made vehicle anymore.<br><br>Toyota IST-<br>Very nice design and good value in 2nd hand market, but priced at $76,000 which I don't think I can afford it.<br><br>My final choice is - Daihatsu YRV<br>Same engine used in Toyota Echo, looks equally nice as Mazda 2, lower fuel comsumption at 19km/L, and the most affordable car fully made in Japan.<br><br>This is after few months of research for almost all of the cars below $80K.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi speedy,<br><br>Agree! Was thinking of getting either Vios or Proton Gen2 which has style and spacious boot, but it's finally out of my list due to the soft body (vios),  poor plastic interior and the bad history background (Gen2).<br><br>Mazda 2 was actually the best for me because of the cabin space, handling and design. But too bad can't afford it! Better save the extra 9K and road tax (1.3 instead of 1.5) for my coming baby so booked an YRV instead. Which the cabin space is quite similar, and personally prefer the flexibility of the back seat of YRV, don't have to fold the whole back seat to get a totally flat boot extension. :-)<br><br>I owned a Daihatsu Charade before so have a bit more confident with the durability of parts than Aveo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>suon oon<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi speedy, Daihatsu Charade is my childhood favourite...however, the broad interior is lacking in the new YRV   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  .<br><br>Like u, those cars u mentioned are shortlisted by me too. Mazda 2 is too exp and I rather go for Vios/Aveo.<br></div>
