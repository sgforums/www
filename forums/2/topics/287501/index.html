The tax amounted to more than S$7 million.<br><br>LTA said the Registrar was entitled to favour a policy of accepting the customs valuation of a car, as long as there were exceptional cases. And the Court of Appeal ruled that the Registrar had not deferred her powers to the policy in assessing the amount of tax.<br><br>In response, the lawyers for Komoco Motors said the ruling defers the High Court judgesÂ’ decision because it is based on several key principles of law and fact.<br><br>Lawyers for Komoco Motors said they have yet to hear from their client on what their next move will be.<br><br>It will depend on what is in the written judgement of the appeal judges and when LTA sends a letter to request for payment.
