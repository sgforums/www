They may not be able to parallel park, but at least they have better road manners. You don't see so many drivers hogging lane 1 at speed limit, they give way at x-junctions without  the need for traffic light, and all cars come to a complete stop at the stop sign to make sure the road ahead is clear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, singaporeans are just as good or bad as drivers from other countries. Why so many people think only singaore will get road fustrations? Which country does not have road fustrations? You see other countries cities, jam everyday and horn all the way even if the jam is not caused by the car infront. Look at malaysia, so many road bullies. Just that their bullies used weapons and ours don't. Our skills bad? Other countries also got accidents what. Do you people have any statistics to prove the singaporeans are aworse than others?<br>Come on, see from another point of view now. People always say singaporeans kiasu. Ohter country also got people who have bad habits what. Prob with singaporeans is taht they are too inferior complex so keep thinbking our people here bad there bad... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

If you are in the overtaking lane, a faster car is coming up behind you, you can pull left safely to yield the overtaking lane to the faster car... then do so.  That is defensive driving.   To stay there wth that f**k-everyone-else attitude is also agressive.<br><br>Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are the only person on the road and you have the right to control traffic.<br><br>..and by "us" just who are you refering to?

It is not designed or meant for vehicle traveling at speed limit. If there is a car trying to overtake you from behind, you should either speed up or let him go. This same principle apply to everywhere in the world.<br><br></div>

I repeat, OVERTAKING. IT is not a express cruising lane for lazy driver who dont like to change lane.<br><br>So even if you are traveling at 110km/h and if there is a faster car behind you, you should let him pass and that is your duty if you want to drive in lane 1. PERIOD!!<br><br>Let not talk about speeding here cause it is usually not the speed that cause accident but rather bad driving habit such as following too close, poor judgement or switching lane without signal etc. Of course if you are trying to drive at 100km.h on a 50km.h small road, then I would say that you are asking for trouble.<br><br></div>
