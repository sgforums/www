May i refer you to the thread titled "Best place to speed in Singapore" under the car forums, by Mr "SEI" and you will find out that there certainly exists those morons thrill seekers who speed and tailgate just for fun. Do go into this topic and read about how these young chaps brag and boost about their top speed and their car performance. Please, for goodness sake, do be a bit more skeptical about speeding vehicles on lane 1. Life and death circumstances??? My foot! Don't be naive. How often do you think life and death scenarios occur on sg roads.<br><br>To me, it's more likely that the idiot driver overslept and needs to get to his workplace on time for fear of being late, and this selfish chap is blaming the general public for causing his delay and expecting them to indulge in his convenience???? C'mon, we are all aware that young chaps these days love to speed just for the thrill and on every friday and saturday evenings, you see most cars zooming beyond 90 along lane 1 of the expressways towards town area and u really think they are rushing to the hospitals.?? Stop deceiving yourself, surely you know they are rushing to meet their friends in dinners, movies, pubs, discos. So you are telling us we ought to indulge in their convenience by giving way to them????<br><br>Even if we are compelled by life and death situation, a smart person will know he won't get anything out of speeding and tailgating. He should anticipate there will always be slower moving vehicles impeding his progress and causing his delay. Out of sheer frustration, to this poor desperate guy in a hurry, those vehicles in front of him will only be nuisance to him. I hope you guys realize that's the cruelty of life and "road hogging" is inevitable.<br><br>Apart from expressways, i'm sure u guys know on normal roads, there are traffic lights every 500m. What's the point of driving as fast as possible and forcing the front vehicle to give way when after you make an exit from the expressway, u still have to stop when approaching a red light. Will you be cursing the traffic light as "selfsh road hogger"? Are you wishing that the red traffic light will spare a thought on your "life and death" predicament and give way to you by turning green immediately??<br></div>
