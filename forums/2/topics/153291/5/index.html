May i refer you to the thread titled "Best place to speed in Singapore" under the car forums, by Mr "SEI" and you will find out that there certainly exists those morons thrill seekers who speed and tailgate just for fun. Do go into this topic and read about how these young chaps brag and boost about their top speed and their car performance. Please, for goodness sake, do be a bit more skeptical about speeding vehicles on lane 1. Life and death circumstances??? My foot! Don't be naive. How often do you think life and death scenarios occur on sg roads.<br><br>To me, it's more likely that the idiot driver overslept and needs to get to his workplace on time for fear of being late, and this selfish chap is blaming the general public for causing his delay and expecting them to indulge in his convenience???? C'mon, we are all aware that young chaps these days love to speed just for the thrill and on every friday and saturday evenings, you see most cars zooming beyond 90 along lane 1 of the expressways towards town area and u really think they are rushing to the hospitals.?? Stop deceiving yourself, surely you know they are rushing to meet their friends in dinners, movies, pubs, discos. So you are telling us we ought to indulge in their convenience by giving way to them????<br><br>Even if we are compelled by life and death situation, a smart person will know he won't get anything out of speeding and tailgating. He should anticipate there will always be slower moving vehicles impeding his progress and causing his delay. Out of sheer frustration, to this poor desperate guy in a hurry, those vehicles in front of him will only be nuisance to him. I hope you guys realize that's the cruelty of life and "road hogging" is inevitable.<br><br>Apart from expressways, i'm sure u guys know on normal roads, there are traffic lights every 500m. What's the point of driving as fast as possible and forcing the front vehicle to give way when after you make an exit from the expressway, u still have to stop when approaching a red light. Will you be cursing the traffic light as "selfsh road hogger"? Are you wishing that the red traffic light will spare a thought on your "life and death" predicament and give way to you by turning green immediately??<br></div></blockquote>As we all see ED just refuse to give way to anybody and thinks he pwans the road,ya lah u the best driver in sg all of us should hail to the all mighty ED<br>wait till u trip and fall broke an limp then on the way to A&amp;E some smart ass start to hog the 1st lane @ 90km/hr,oh i'm a better driver then some guy on sg forum i drive at 80km/hr on the 1st lane i am a even better driver.<br><br>if my mother or who ever close to me is in a life and death predicament i will cheong every red light cam or no cam horn+high beam+tailgate every Motherfaker who happen to be in my way.but no Edgar_Davids will not he is the best driver he will drive in the speed set by TP.<br>FYI the TP who stop a speeding car will ask you why are u going so fast?<br>and if it's true that u in such a predicament he might even convoy you to the nearest hospital.<br><br>The way u reply was so gin na pi,pls join ah_boi and play wif his evo</div>

The point suggested by edgar is very strong. A driver did no wrong when he is travelling at speed limit on lane 1, hogging other speedsters. Of course, here, we dun say got ambulance or people going hospital cos someone dying or what. How many speedsters on lane one are rushing to hospitals everyday, can you tell me?<br>If there is an ambulance, I'm sure edgar will have given way for the ambulance. For others who are really rushing to hospital or what, they could always give a polite signal to ask for give way. I tralvel on lane 2 normally at 90-100km/h. I do not see why there is a need for people to drive at 120-140km/h on lane 1. Speeding do not cause accidents directly. True! But speeding reduce reaction time. of course, not speeding will not prevent accidents from happening. But it can at least reduce the number of accidents. </div></blockquote>irregardless. u apparently have not read much of wat nonsense tomas has posted previously. who are <strong>you</strong> to say that he would give way when the situation calls for it? have u no inkling dat u are dealing with a nutcase with a superiority complex who displays utter disregard for the convenience of other road users by perpetuating his own brand of "street justice" by hogging the right lane and for that, you show him ur support? i salute u intelligence.<br><br>and fyi "einstein", if u have not figured by now, tomas and edgar <strong>ARE</strong> the same person.</div>
