KNN why didnt you jump down from your flat when LTA raise the speed limit of expressway road from 80 to 90km.h? And why are you driving at 90 instead of 80? So LTA ask you to eat shit you will eat lah...KNN Singapore puppet!!<br><br>It is people like you that is slowing down the traffic on the expressway and causing road user to pay more tax to LTA to build wider road, so that selfish arsehole like you can have a lane all to yourself.
