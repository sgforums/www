But when the ecu switches to open-loop mode (which I believe is dependent on throttle position), then the ecu will simply read of its fueling maps and compensation might not be present.<br><br><strong> and also what is the difference when someone uses a piggy back ECU to change the mappings of the A/F ratio and someone who installs an fuel pressure regulartor?</strong>[/quote]<br><br>I dun use piggyback but I had a AFR in my car before I installed my open-pod. I had some lack of fuelling pressure which worsened with the open pod - i.e. not enough fuel pressure and with more air being sucked in.... not smart... kekeke . Only after I installed an aftermkt higher-flow fuel pump - everything was dandy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>juz to add on to dansplace reply.<br><br>your ecu does give compensation in closed loop under part throttle. this is to make your car idle better/ maximize fuel efficiency/ better throttle response under normal driving conditions. however, when your ecu runs in open loop (under full throttle), it will basically read off a fixed mapping programmed by the manufacturer, which does not give any fuel compensation.<br><br>only way to stop the ecu from reading off this fixed mapping is to get a "piggyback" to "override" the signals the ecu is receiving/sending or to get another ecu which is tuned for your current set up.<br><br>in most situations, car ecu's from the factory tend to be programmed slightly richer under full throttle to safe guard the engine from running lean (one main cause of engine blowing), so having a better flowing filter sort of evens out the balance. a filter element should do little in any case to change the A/F drastically, unless u FI the engine or modify the internals heavily. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
