            <div class='col-md body'>As I said, it's something we can learn from, never to leave the door unlocked in those areas, try not to ask for directions in those secluded areas, always be wary of foreigners esp those contruction workers in those areas (if they turn out to be illegals). Whether he was dumb to stop and ask or not is inconsequential, as the deed has already happened and I am just relating to you all so that you guys can be more aware to prevent a future reoccurance. Who knows, it could have happened to anyone, anywhere, with this whole rise of foreign workers in our society. Anyway they suspect illegals, and is now a CID case. So guess better not comment anymore on it. Those who are suspecting its authenticity, just check with any friend from Jurong Police Division.</div>

It is a true account of events, and not a fabrication.<br><br>Was around 1am last nite when he was heading home from an event. Made a wrong turn out KJE into the LCK area. He's quite bad with directions so he drove further and further in his 3 wk old Mazda 3. Eventually he found himself in an industrial area where he chanced upon a grp of foreign workers squatting in the middle of the road. He decided to ask for directions, and wound down his window. One of the guys gave him directions out of the area, but before he knew it, this guy stuck his hand thru the window in a grasp and held him by the neck. Two other workers stood up, discussed something in a foreign lang (thai or myanmese, according to him) and entered the car from the front and back of the passenger side. He said they reeked of alcohol. They dragged him to the back seat where they started hammering him. One of them got into the driver's seat and started driving off. They hammered him with a rock that was at least 15cm across until his head was filled with blood. The driver lost control of the car and crashed it into a lamp post. At this point i think they panicked and decided to abandon car. They lit a rag and threw it into the car to let it burn. At this point my friend was abt to give up, he acted unconscious so that they would leave him in the car.The 3 men then ran off, leaving my friend to burn in the back of the car. After a while, he picked up enough strength to open the door, and run from the car until he saw a security guard at a post, where the police were called in. It was a good thing he wasn't choked by the flame.<br><br>Result: He is now in hospital, conscious, 5 fractured fingers, one was hanging by the skin, broken at the joint, a long gash across the top of his head, strangle marks on his neck, bruises on face, and huge bite marks on his shoulders (yes, they bit him). Car was burnt to frame, you might probably read this in the papers tmrw. Shocking that something like this could happen in Singapore.<br><br>Car had no autolocking feature as it doesn't come standard on Mazda cars. </div></blockquote>here is something guys, don ever wander into LCK area! That place is full of labourers and dangerous ppl. That was some time whwere i was cycling with a fren, then 2 black dudes follow us behind but thankfully we ride it fast and they somehow disappear. You fren is really unluckly, there is some coast guard at the far end of the road..</div>
