That is why I say, the story is too fishy as the place of the so call accident happen is so damn far from KJE.<br><br>If you turn out wrongly, like you say past by civil defense camp - which he did not ask for help, then he can drive all the way down, which is 10-15 drive, cementry and stuff, even pass by the tankies main camp which again he did not ask for help. ........ which is way too strange to try to wonder another 10-20mins down a unknown road ?<br><br>"They dragged him to the back seat where they started hammering him. One of them got into the driver's seat and started driving off. They hammered him with a rock that was at least 15cm across until his head was filled with blood. The driver lost control of the car and crashed it into a lamp post. At this point i think they panicked and decided to abandon car. They lit a rag and threw it into the car to let it burn."<br><br>There is other questionable - they dragged him to the back seat, think about it, it is not easy to do it, the drive with seat belt on ..... how they drag a man to the back seat , that must be a big big big car for them to do it  !!!! Don't you find it easier to push him out ? then pull a person to the back , a normal car do not have that type of space, think about how difficult that move is !!!<br><br>Next big question, they lit a rag and threw it into the car ? Question where they get the rag ? also even you got a lighter, without fuel you try lighting a cloth? Even if you have lighted cloth, if you throw it into a car, you think it will catch fire ? Come on we all know PBC or leather or plastic do not catch fire so easily. Mighty as well say, suddenly one of them pull out a wand and say "burn now" and the car is on fire ........ more easy to believe !!!<br><br>Don't you find that it is funny, 3 idoit having a drink in the middle of the road, suddenly they  have rags to light fire with, also they suddenly have fuel to burn the car and stone ? Don't you find it funny ? Unless they know magic to make items appear out of blue, then i must say, they are very well equip, haha better then army guys - with stones, rags and fuel to burn a car !!!<br><br>To pull him in a mazda from front to back seat ? all three will have their hand full, so who is carrying the stone, who is carrying the stone, rags and fuels to burn the car later ?<br><br>If they have time to burn a car, they would have grab his wallet ! did you notice there is no mention of they grabbing his wallet ? Why would they want to grab him and his car ?<br><br>Haha the whole story base on timing, distance , location, items uses and what the people did, all does not add up...... sound more like he illegal crash the car and make up the story.<br><br>Think you will not see the story soon, is because even the police do not believe it enough to tell the press.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people here are just ridiculous. Do not jump to your own conclusions, make up your own stories without first finding out the facts. If you had seen some of the injuries, which I did, you would probably know that some of them are not possible to be self-induced, nor is it possible to attain in a car crash. As some kinder folk here have pointed out, that area is a danger spot for everyone, and the only reason I am bothering to type all this out here is so that guys like you will be aware of it's danger. Whether my friend's injuries were a result of a crash or an attack, let's leave that to the cops to ascertain. Fact is, LCK is a dangerous place and had this topic not been broached we'll probably see many more fellowmen get into trouble at that spot.</div>
