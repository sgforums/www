            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your replies. A friend of mine is scraping her Honda VTi and she's selling me the bonnet for a rather low price (friend's price..hehe)<br><br>Actually it's purely for show cause my SiR is rather stock except for CAI, re-chipping &amp; lightened flywheel. Like the look but as I said, concerned if I'll get stopped for having carbon fibre bonnet....<br><br>Btw, some of you guys mentioned about carbon fibre vinyl. How much would it be to do a bonnet. Thinking of doing it on my other ride....<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, it seems more like a safety issue than anything else. Carbon fibre is known to be harder than steel and whatnot, but the thing is, it also comes in different grades. Without going into the technical aspects of its design and structure, some grades of carbon fibre are better than others. Some might shatter, some will look like it's been torn away. The other thing which might be in LTA's list of considerations is the number of layers that are present in that particular product. The more layers probably = to safer for them cause it's going to be harder.</div>
