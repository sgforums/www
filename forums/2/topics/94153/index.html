            <div class='col-md body'><br>I have noted for a long time now, that a lot of motorists in Singapore, DON'T KNOW or DON'T REALLY KNOW, how to use an Exit road leading or merging onto an expressway.<br><br>Commonly observed while on the road, is that motorists will always rush in a tight cluster to merge into traffic on expressways, which is exactly what we all will see on MRT station platforms - all wants to board, versus those who all wants to alight. It appears most motorists here drive the way they would walk.<br><br>Properly, vehicles wanting to join traffic on an expressway should signal as they approach exits onto expressways, carefully match traffic speed on expressway and pace themselves out onto the left lane first by use of the taperred lane marked with broken white line. Instead people are coming to almost a STOP at the dotted line causing a line to form behind which always results in others overtaking or jumping Q to merge with traffic dangerously.<br><br>As an experiment, I always let all others rush forward into a cluster towards the expressway until they all come to a jammed up mass, and overtake them all from the left inner most lane of the exit ramp and merging further ahead of them. And it appears people prefer to jostle their way onto an expressway instead of pacing they're way onto an expressway.<br><br>If everyone co-operates, pacing their way onto an expressway, we would then be closer to an ideal world in motoring without clowns clowning around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreed. taligating screws things. 4 to 5 cars or lorries van or what, bumper to bumer on left most lane. how to get into the expressway like that? sometimes i end up in the shoulder, still no chance to squeeze in. or if i can see ahead got this problem, i cut a bit the chevron markings to merge into left most lane earlier a bit behind all the action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I drive everyday, and using the roads and expressways and by-ways, I find that our roads are so much better thought out and constructed than most HDB flat designs. Our network of roads are superb, but I really wish I can say the same for the mototirsts who uses them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Another comment:<br>Drivers on 2nd left lane (or sometimes middle lane) of an expressway should try NOT to cut into leftmost lane near an entrance into the expressway. This happened some of the times when I was trying to enter the expressway ... looked into the side mirror ... next vehicle coming up was about 80m away ... happy happy signal right and get ready to enter left lane ... then suddenly one stupid car just appear right next to me trying to push its way into my lane!
