That, you are just jealous.<br><br>What is a "Good" driver?<br><br>According to a survey, 80% of drivers think they are GOOD.<br>Take a moment to reflect about this.<br><br>Truth is, a good driver is a law-abiding and courteous driver. Are you? If not, stfu.<br><br>btw, I won't even declare I'm GOOD. I'm fast and dangerous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

But its your own opinion and whilst I cannot change what you think, I don't have to respect your comments or you as a person. Period.<br><br>Oh, just want to say something about critcising other drivers. Why should anybody never criticise other drivers? Didn't your instructor criticise you when you made mistakes when you were an L-plate? Don't tell me you never make mistakes when learning driving? Those occasions however, are constructive criticism. A good driver is willing to accept and think through on such forms of criticisms on his driving. A driver who ownself thinks he is good would ignore all sorts of criticism and continue driving like an idiot. Of course, pointless criticism like saying to someone like "My grandmother can drive better than you" should be ignored lah.<br><br>Oh, and btw, I wasn't trying to criticise or stereotype anybody in particular. Apologies if my poor way of structuring my words made it come out that way. Was just feeling that after driving every day for around 2 years, and seeing lousy drivers (really lah, some of them not say i want to say lah) in luxury cars just feel that a bit wasted lah. The car wasted on the driver...</div>
