GTRs can be bought at such a small sum, and even though it can hit speeds like supercars, there is absolutely no exclusivity in them. Sorry, but labelling the GTR a super is just absurd</div>

But thats nost suited for the track. imagine having a roll cage instead of rear seats, and a 5-point racing seatbelt system that takes a few minutes to get it on.<br><br>But I have to agree the RS is the ultimate GT3, but not in Singapore's context, unless u make ur may to Sepang or PAsir Gudang very weekend.</div>

The GTRs may cost more but their rate of production is insanely higher than BMW making their Z4Ms. This means that even though it is more expensive, the number of cars being produced is way of the chart compared to other supercars. The Z4M itself cant be classified as a super car. One reason, the number. Many people have Z4Ms. Its not exclusive enough, its not pretty enough. But both the GTR and Z4M, i still love them to bits.</div>

Oh and the new Reventon but they only have 20 of those so nvm..<br><br>Ok, from this, we need to get something straight. I would like to classify both cars as hypercars but in real fact, the gallardo is way way different from the LP640, both in terms of price and way way in terms of exclusivity. Ive just been to the Lamborghini showroom in singapore. So far they have sold 113 cars altogether, almost 75% of which are gallardos. So straight off the bat, i can tell that the gallardo will be classified as a SUPERCAR because even though it is very exclusive, it is still not as exclusive as the LP640 which is a HYPERCAR, both because of the difference in speed and the difference in exclusivity.<br><br>&lt;3</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generally, supercars are stock factory models delivering above 400bhp and sprints to 60mph in less than 4 secs in a somewhat coupe-like or chassis designed ground up with performance in mind. If a factory makes a 4 door sedan with a super engine means they are trying to appeal to the practical driver whom has loads of cash to spare. It also means they have compromised pure driver's pleasure to some form of practicality and marketability. These are not supercars, they are superbly-marketable cars. Modded cars are by nature in another category so we shan't discuss that.<br><br>As far as i recall, Japan has not yet produced a stock factory car delivering such power and speed. Not any STIs, Evos, S2Ks, NSXs, RX7s, or any other high performance sports cars in the Japanese stable has acquired such levels of specifications until the current GTR.<br><br>In other words, Nissan has by definition manufacured a "supercar" by virtue of paper specifications. You and he might not consider the GTR as a supercar, but i am sure those whom are fans do. The first Ferrari or Lamborghini weren't supercars either, but today they probably are due to their relentless pursuit along purist lines of delivering the ultimate high performance road vehicle.<br><br>I daresay that Nissan has just raised the bar on supercar affordability by building one at such low cost. Or rather, offering one to the mass market at such a low price. If you can build a 200 grand supercar but some other smart alec need 800 grand to make one, who's the dumb one i wonder. Either its overpriced on brand value, or it simply makes you wonder what the Japanese could have included and given to consumers with a sticker price of 800 grand for a car. Premium leather seats? You mean only Italian cows can be made into leather? The gap is still in existence of course, but the bridge has surely shortened.<br><br></div>
