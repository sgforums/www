              <p>OK guys, I came to SG with family on a 2 year EP, just 3 weeks ago. I have my family with (wife plus 2 kids - 9 &amp; 7) and working in Ayer Rajah area. Will be moving in to a condo near Bayshore Road (Kids's school is closer to there) . While the MRT/ Bus system here is great, I will be needing a Car as my office is quite far (~20+ kms).</p>
              <p>Buying a new Car is out of question, sold both my Cars back home and so no option but to buy a 2nd hand car here. Criteria as follows</p>
              <p>1) Budget - 25-28K (Any more and the downpayment will be a problem)</p>
              <p>2) Decent enough FC (due to long drive): Not necessary to be 14-15+ but not below 10 also. So a manual car is prefered.</p>
              <p>3) Good resale value - will be selling while going back 2 years later.</p>
              <p>Only 2006 Verna, Sunny and Rio seem to fit the above bill (as per sgcarmart). Saw and test drove one Verna and one Sunny till now. Seem to like the Sunny more (bigger, Japanese and so better resale, some extra features). Need advice on-</p>
              <p>1) What to ensure before buying from a used car dealer. Already paid the Sunny dealer to do STA evaluation, what else?</p>
              <p>2) This Sunny has upsized (+2 I think, 205/....) sports rims. They look cool but what will the effect on FC (I have read a lot of horror stories on Sunny's FC). I guess I can always trade later with OE rims with someone who wants the looks?</p>
              <p>3) The music player is original Clarion but can't play MP3 CD's. Where can I get some 2nd hand MP3 player?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for reading and advice, if any !!</p>

              <p>So are you staying in The Bayshore or the elite COSTA DEL SOL?</p>
              <p>First things first. Your Sunny manual will probably give you about 10-12km/l, but only if you can drive consistantly on highways. Yes the 205 profile tyres will make a difference to your FC. Change then back to the stock profile of 185 if I recall correctly. Do take note the road leading out from your condo onto ECP only goes in the ECP (Changi) direction. You'll have to drive out to East Coast Road and then enter ECP (AYE) from Bedok South entrance.</p>
              <p>Resale Value - None to speak of. Please take note that there is currently not much demand for Sunnys, you may have to scrap the car after your 2 years as you will be hard pressed to find a buyer for a 5 year ++ Sunny.</p>
              <p>Sound system - Most ICE units have MP3/USB support. Don't have to buy second hand! Get some cheaper brands good enough. Various china brands, with LCD touchscreen, can play DVDs as well, are very, very cheap.</p>
              <p>Sunny discount. Typical marketing tactic. Please do take note on top of you Sunny buying price, you may have to foot the bill for Admin fee, Transfer fee, STA fee, etc etc.</p>
              <p>In-house financing. Please read the fine print. Usually a lower percentage usually requires you to take up a) higher loan amounts, and b) longer loan tenures resulting in c) higher interest paid overall. Do your sums and see which payment plan you are more comfortable with.</p>

              <p><br>4) I think it's ok.</p>
              <p>5) Check out the terms and conditions like that Nightsky87 has mentioned. 2.68% isn't the lowest though but you got to see which finance company you are borrowing from. Read and understand the terms first before signing.</p>

              <p>1) If the report from STA shows that the car is fine, then I believe it should be alright. Be wary on the financing, insurance and delivery date of the car, quoted by the dealer. Got any qns, just shoot to them. </p>
              <p>2) I'm not too sure about that... Nightsky87 has provided some feedback on that.</p>
              <p>3) Perhaps, you can get some car magazines that feature some good MP3 players and you can decide from there. No need to buy second hand ones though, there's ought to be plenty of affordable ones on the market.</p>

              <p>The dealer says no admin fee, only one time trasfer fee to STA and of course Insurance. Yet to come back with financing details, will go through carefully.</p>

              <p>120 point? The report I saw had around 10 categories (e.g. engine, body, brake, transmission....etc.) with 4 possible Grades. The Car got A's in Engine, Chasis, transmission...and a few more) and B's in body (report of some minor body scratches), brakes and some more.) Overall equal A's and B's - could have been better but then its a 3.5 year car afterall, I guess one gets what one pays for.</p>
              <p>I have braced myself for the poor FC which I feel will be at least 20% poorer (say 10-11 km/ltr as against 12-13 from say a Corrolla Altis) than other possible cars that I could have bought but with a monthly commute of max 1500 Kms, that's an extra cost of max $500 per year or $1000 for the 2 years that I want to keep this car. But to get a same age Altis I need to pay way more than that $1000 (10 times more actually). So I am cool with this Sunny, given its really low price.</p>

              <p>120 point? The report I saw had around 10 categories (e.g.
                  engine, body, brake, transmission....etc.) with 4 possible Grades.
                  The Car got A's in Engine, Chasis, transmission...and a few more)
                  and B's in body (report of some minor body scratches), brakes and
                  some more.) Overall equal A's and B's - could have been better but
                  then its a 3.5 year car afterall, I guess one gets what one pays
                  for.</p>
              <p>I have braced myself for the poor FC which I feel will be at
                  least 20% poorer (say 10-11 km/ltr as against 12-13 from say a
                  Corrolla Altis) than other possible cars that I could have bought
                  but with a monthly commute of max 1500 Kms, that's an extra cost of
                  max $500 per year or $1000 for the 2 years that I want to keep this
                  car. But to get a same age Altis I need to pay way more than that
                  $1000 (10 times more actually). So I am cool with this Sunny, given
                  its really low price.</p>
