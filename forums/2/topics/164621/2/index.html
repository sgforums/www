            <div class='col-md body'>i think anybody who generalises should take a look at the bigger picture first.<br><br>i ride in the middle of the road and some guy in a car knocks my back wheel.  So does that mean ALL car owners are out to kill motorcyclists?  I don't come in here to generalise but if people have read my reports, I usually tell all motorists to look out each other.<br><br>All this mentality about wanting to knock motorcyclists down is the last thing we need on the road.  Utlimately you're no better off than the taxi driver who really killed the rider just a few months back.<br><br>Like what skeujin said, please process all aspects and information before generalising and making comments like these.</div>

It is a traffic light junnction so cars are generally slower. So when you signal and move slightly to the left, the more courteous drivers will stop to let you go pass. It is not dangerous. Just have to make sure you use plenty of your left side mirror.</div>
