            <div class='col-md body'>Put yourself into his shoe. There are so many drivers out there who wanted to turn right but din signal. Last time, maybe the MC would have stayed in the pocket and waiting for the non-signalling car to go straight, but instead it turns right. So experience make the MC thought you are going to turn right also. Infact, how many drivers would have gotten themselves into that 2-options lane?<br>I do admit the MC had erred in his judgement. But you can show him your intention by highbeaming...</div>

What i do is signal left to let other drivers know i want go straight. Then slowly cut into the lane. From my experiance, once a quater of your front is in the lane, drivers behind will let you pass. You might think that Im getting into the lane recklessly but sad to say ... thats the way to drive in singapore.<br><br>I understand how you feel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>oh by the way, im driving a monster 10ton lorry at times. also got no problem in changing lanes.<br><br>Predict well in advance is my advice to you pal<br>Good luck<br>nick34</div>

Last saturday around mid noon time, I was driving along marina sq outside going towards esplanade direction, i was on the right lane around 50-60. All of a sudden, a citycab speed out of the hotel lobby to enter the main road, I saw him speeding out but thinking he might slow down at the exit to turn out, I carry on with my speed of around 50+. As there are bushes and plants beside the road on the right side I did not see him trying to speed out till the last min when i get a clear view, he saw me he stopped halfhead out of the main road, I pull 1/2 hand brake + foot brake but realise it would still hit on the corner front right, I release my hand brake and swayed to the left. The floor was wet due to the earlier rain, In the end my car skid abit and stopped 45 degrees to the left taking 2 lane.  lucky for me the road was quite clear with very very little traffic. I stepped out of my car and curse at the driver he only juzz keep repeatedly say sorry. Lucky no accident happen.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether motor or car, in the end this type of dangerous things still happen irregardless of which type of vehicles. The only way to really reduce and prevent this type of situation, is to have all drivers to do their part. but sad to say, it wont happen. There are bound to be some drivers who think they are the only one paying road tax and owns the road.<br><br>Just less then 2 hrs ago an accident happen at Tampines Ave 10 between a taxi and car, from the damage and angle I presume the taxi speeding to do right turn to the HDB directions while the car was going straight towards kaki bukit. Still can see the altis whole bumper on the road and 1/2 the car head goes in while the texi ended in front of the traffic light post at the slip road.  It is a T junction and both party are driving along the main road. Poor altis fellow... plate was SFxxxxx... quite brand new...</div>
