            <div class='col-md body'>honda xr4.... u like abit out of point leh... regarding ur last post.<br><br>but wif regards to ur other post, u say cars disregard MC? i would prefer to say it this way..... it is easier for MC to take care of themselves instead of relying on cars to do it. and very sad to say this, cars are very very much costly in terms of price, road tax, insurance, parking, maintainence, etc. for a reason.<br><br>It may be wrong to think juz cars pay more they have right of way but i think dats sg mentality. and i dun really see MC taking care of themselves on the road. some of them juz deserve to get hurt b4 they learn not to be brash especially in a traffic jam.</div>

So proturuding out of the pocket is not going to affect traffic an anyway since that car will also be blocking the traffic. The pocket is only a guideline. Some junctions does not have pockets. However, they have yellow boxes and motorists turning can place themselves in the yellow boxes. So i see no reason why MC must stick closely inside the pockets. Maybe the MC that affected your drive made a wrong judgement, but i feel there is no need to stick strictly to the pocket rule.</div>
