              <p>Haha... actually I'm quite in the same situation as TS. Just that I passed TP about 3 years ago... My family do have a car but my parents use it and I don't get a chance to drive it. I did want a car (<em>any car</em>) to drive on my own but my parents sometimes good mood will say that they will buy for me; sometimes they foul mood will say, "<em>car where got cheap? Need to pay this and that!..."</em> Just recently abt 2 weeks ago, they say they will buy for me. I was so happy initially but it keeps going on and off. 3 years have passed and I really feel cheated 'cos they keep giving me false hopes yet, I am still hoping that one day they will buy for me. I feel kinda suffocated right now... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>

              <p>I calculate that it will take me more than 79.16 years to get a GTR <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But self calculation not very accurate, because once you grad from uni, start work, your savings rate will increase, so the time taken to get a car will also decrease.. not to mention once you have a stable income, you will be eligible for car loans, etc.</p>

              <p>I calculate that it will take me more than 79.16 years to get a GTR <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But self calculation not very accurate, because once you grad from uni, start work, your savings rate will increase, so the time taken to get a car will also decrease.. not to mention once you have a stable income, you will be eligible for car loans, etc.</p>

              <p>I think you are referring to Kia Sportage and Lexus RX350/450 / Toyota Harrier (same  car, re-badged only).</p>
              <p>Kia Sportage now stands around 62k w/coe.</p>
              <p>Lexus RX350 stands around 182k w/coe.</p>
              <p>Lexus RX450 stands around 198k w/coe.</p>
              <p>Kia Sportage interior quite plain.. as i have considered that car before i purchased my Carens.</p>
              <p> </p>
