              <p>For first time car owners, I would recommend any car with
              instalments not exceeding $500 a month.. Best is under $400..
              Unless you can really afford it..</p>
              <p>Recommended Models for those with tight budget:</p>
              <p><strong>Kia Picanto</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Perodua Kenari</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Proton Savvy</strong>: 36,999</p>
              <p><strong>Chevrolet Spark</strong>: 38,999 - 41,999</p>
              <p><strong>Hyundai Getz</strong>: 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>P/S</strong>: There are no China makes listed as they
              are cheap upfront, and you will suffer in the later stage..</p>

              <p>I think the lesson here is to think about what will be the problems if you buy a car...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like, can you maintain the car regularly, paying road taxes, parkings, repairs etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And by the way, So many times I notice a lot car owners still dont know how to park properly specially when going reverse... One time I saw a young woman parking her car slowly and hit the post, also a man takes so many times stirring his wheels to get into his parking slot, and his parking space is big enough, wow... I think the driving school should be tighter hahaha its embarassing for them...</p>

              <p>Btw, I am 24 years old too. Like you mentioned earlier, I also bought the car through my own pocket.</p>
              <p>And my parents cannot restrict my usage of the car, cos i did not ask money from them.</p>
              <p>I can go out as late as i wish, drive up to malaysia whenever I want (they got no say).</p>

              <p>Yes,</p>
              <p>There will be rebate upfront 17k. But i heard that the amount rebate given also depends on the type of car you getting.</p>
              <p>And you enjoy annual road tax savings of $800.. and your insurance is 15% cheaper (with NTUC).</p>
              <p>Not to mention, you enjoy having a nice red plate (gold seal) with white font sitting on your red car (if you get one).</p>
              <p>If i never remember wrongly, cars up to 1,600 cc pay only $50 in road tax yearly. Anything above will cost slightly more, but still cheap.</p>
              <p> Yes, you  can change back to normal plate. Just need to pay the prevailing quota premium (average COE price for your category over the last 3 or 6 months) plus a $100 conversion fee.</p>

              <p>And by the way, So many times I notice a lot car owners still
              dont know how to park properly specially when going reverse... One
              time I saw a young woman parking her car slowly and hit the
              post, also a man takes so many times stirring his wheels
              to get into his parking slot, and his parking space is
              big enough, wow... I think the driving school should be

              <p>Hey, I second that.</p>
              <p>It's funny seeing people struggling with parking. Seems like they thought what the school taught them was enough. They should practice on their own after they passed.</p>

              <p>Why cant it be that these parents are so busy and do not know what their kids are doing.. and buy cars for them just because they want it?</p>

              <p>You didn't exactly answer WhamBamTyMam's question.</p>
              <p>To add my 2 cents, there are always people out there (yes even kids younger than us) who are more fortunate. I have met young punks who drive like idiots, and also young exemplary drivers in their SLKs and Z4s. No doubt the car isn't bought with their own money.</p>
              <p>Indeed, there are 2 sides to a coin. You have only seen 1 side, unfortunately.</p>

              <p><br> Yup agree to that... besides... they still go to school and go
              NS... I dont think they have the time to learn on how to maintain a
              car...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyways.. once you have a car and dont know how to budget...

              <p>Do not underestimate what someone is capable of. Sometimes maturity, knowledge and age are not corelated. Who starts off knowing how to 'maintain' a car, technically and also financial wise? Everyone starts from somewhere.</p>
