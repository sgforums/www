              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>Other road users horn me cos my 100km/hr = normal 1.6 saloon car
              80km/hr.. I drove a Toyota Vios before.. 80km/hr like flying
              liao... hahaha..</p>
              <p>It all depends on usage.. Some people go for car leasing.. so
              you do not need to be tied down with 1 car for at least 5 years or
              longer (unless you can buy a car full cash lar, no need bank
              financing).</p>
              <p>Car leasing you pay slightly more per month (about 1k per month
              on a long term basis), but you don't need to worry about road tax
              and insurance.. cos the car leasing company help you pay that..
              Maintenance the company also help you pay.. Means you only pay the
              1k per month plus petrol. COE is usually included in car price when
              you buy cars..</p>
              <p>They won't make you pay COE for renting a car long term. COE is
              awarded to car owners, to make them eligible to buy cars. Since the
              car not yours to start with, why need to pay COE?</p>
              <p>Most Importantly, you have the freedom to change cars every few
              months (cos not tied down by any loan.)</p>
              <p>But you don't have a vehicle that you can call "your own
              baby".</p>

              <p>Apparently, the COE prices are shooting up 2k per bidding.. Now standing at around 11-12k, if i am not wrong.. I believe it will continue to shoot up due to COE quota reduction and economy slowly recovering, more people will start to flood the showrooms..</p>

              <p>If you slowly pay back bit by bit, I think you will take forever to return the car price to your parents.. and not forgetting to add in road tax and insurance.. depends on what car you get, it may add up to a whooping 100k !!</p>

              <p>Recommended Models for those with tight budget:</p>
              <p><strong>Kia Picanto</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Perodua Kenari</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Proton Savvy</strong>: 36,999</p>

              <p>If you want to buy a car, you got to work for it, do not ask your parents to buy you car. Dont be a daddy's girl or mama's boy, if your like that then youre a wimp, a coward and you cannot live independently, and most of all its embarassing to others knowing you got your car from your parents, then you yourself knows your a useless son of a bitch hahaha!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>For first time car owners, I would recommend any car with instalments not exceeding $500 a month.. Best is under $400.. Unless you can really afford it..</p>
              <p>Recommended Models for those with tight budget:</p>
              <p><strong>Kia Picanto</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Perodua Kenari</strong>: 36,999 - 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>Proton Savvy</strong>: 36,999</p>
              <p><strong>Chevrolet Spark</strong>: 38,999 - 41,999</p>
              <p><strong>Hyundai Getz</strong>: 39,999</p>
              <p><strong>P/S</strong>: There are no China makes listed as they are cheap upfront, and you will suffer in the later stage.. </p>

              <p>Not sure if you can take criticism or not.  Here's my two cents worth.</p>
              <p>Here are some questions for you and your mom:</p>
              <p>1) Why do you need a car? </p>
              <p>2) Why does your mom needs to buy you a car?</p>
              <p>3) Who is going to pay for the petrol/road tax/insurance etc?</p>
              <p>4) What car are you thinking of buying? New or Used?</p>
              <p>5) Who is going to maintain / wash the car?</p>
              <p>Many times, we are overwhelmed by wants, and forgets about what we really need, and owning a car in Singapore is not going to be anywhere near cheap.  I believe you are from a middle upper class family, and your family can well afford to have 2 or 3 cars.  And I do think that your mom is already having this intention to get you one, maybe when you are mature and responsible enough.</p>

              <p>Your mum has a point. If you can't bear to lift your bum to do some chores around the house, then what about washing your car, hoovering the seats, inflating the tyres, checking the engine oil and so on?</p>
              <p>Buying a car is easy, but the taxes, parking charges, fuel, ERP and maintenance add up. You'd better have very good reasons to justify why you should have a car.</p>
