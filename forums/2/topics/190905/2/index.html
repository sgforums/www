WHY are you associating illegally driving to racing on the track?<br><br>You may think that, just because on the race track there are less cars around so the chances of getting yourself into an accident is low. Come on admit it, that's what you're thinking, big open track space + less cars around = "safer" for illegal drivers.<br><br>But do you have what it takes to have proper control of the wheel in the first place? Even if there are absolutely NO cars on a track and you're drving there alone... the chances of you wrecking your car is just as high as you driving w/o a licence on the street. Because of the nice big open road space you'll natural wanna push the car more and the thrill of higher speed will get into your head. Then comes to slowing down you're desperate to prevent youself running off the track... lose control of the car, spin, hit wall, flip over... many senarios. And from the way you write, I think your mind would go, "wah lao my car..."<br><br>kron is right, ya full of bulls h i t. Indeed what, not everyone is capable of taking the devil's bend, look at how many cars when down the ditch. It's ppl  with the mind like yours that went down there. No experience how to take on the track. Still don't get it? Put it simple for you boy... no money how to buy things right? If you want to steal, get caught how? Bodoh. When you put  this...<br><br>freaking hilarious. dunno how to type properly even. gosh.</div></blockquote>correct...a sense of freedom...the curves are dangerous...</div>
