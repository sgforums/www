And if you do crash i hope you live to tell the tale of your pains. Seriously kid, you're one of the main causes why premiums go up and people lose their lives and why the age limit for driving license go up.<br><br>You think its fun to drive without proper knowledge on how to control a vehicle? It dosent' matter if you do so-called practise every night "rounding" the neighborhood the point is you didnt get the basic rules of controlling a vehicle.

Taken offence to what I said about not everyone being capable? Are YOU trying to tell us YOU ARE CAPABLE? Please, show us, don't talk, just show us that you are.<br><br>If a guy with no licence wants to speed, he should go to the arcades or play NFS. Or maybe you could recommend initial d as well. He or she shouldn't even be driving on the road in the first place and not take some genius' advice to speed at some secluded road.<br><br>PS: Why are you even offended when you aren't even old enough to register for basic theory lessons?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT has illegal driving has to do with racing on the track? WHY are you associating illegally driving to racing on the track?<br><br>You may think that, just because on the race track there are less cars around so the chances of getting yourself into an accident is low. Come on admit it, that's what you're thinking, big open track space + less cars around = "safer" for illegal drivers.<br><br>But do you have what it takes to have proper control of the wheel in the first place? Even if there are absolutely NO cars on a track and you're drving there alone... the chances of you wrecking your car is just as high as you driving w/o a licence on the street. Because of the nice big open road space you'll natural wanna push the car more and the thrill of higher speed will get into your head. Then comes to slowing down you're desperate to prevent youself running off the track... lose control of the car, spin, hit wall, flip over... many senarios. And from the way you write, I think your mind would go, "wah lao my car..."<br><br>kron is right, ya full of bulls h i t. Indeed what, not everyone is capable of taking the devil's bend, look at how many cars when down the ditch. It's ppl  with the mind like yours that went down there. No experience how to take on the track. Still don't get it? Put it simple for you boy... no money how to buy things right? If you want to steal, get caught how? Bodoh. When you put  this...<br><br><blockquote>betetr if he can practise illegal driving on race traack<br></blockquote>freaking hilarious. dunno how to type properly even. gosh.</div>
