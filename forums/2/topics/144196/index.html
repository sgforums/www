            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bro,<br><br>Looks like you are experiencing backfiring.<br><br>Having said your van is modded giving better performance, i assume that you are now running on a richer air/fuel mixture than stock. I also suspect that your exhaust might have a little leak.<br><br>The exhaust leak is probably the cause of the bubbly sound you were mentioning.<br><br>There are a few reason of backfiring.<br><br>I suspect for your case:<br><br>its when you release the acclerator i.e. to change gear or just backing off the throttle when cruising (especially at high rpm since yours is a van travelling at 80km/h), unbunt fuel due to the rich mixture (due to you accelerating) will still be momentarily present and not be fully ignited in the combustion chamber. It flows to the hot exhaust and if there is enough of oxygen i.e. maybe due to exhaust leak, there could be ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the exhaust, causing backfiring.<br><br>Check out with the guy driving behind you, a momentary burst of fire due to the backfiring might occur from the exhaust!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>One way to fix this is to seal the leak in the exhaust (if there is one), run on a leaner air/fuel mixture (be careful, too lean and it will lead to a MISFIRE! which is BAD FOR THE ENGINE).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Hope that helps. </div></blockquote>detonation occurs more likely as a result of poor ignition timing coupled coupled with other factors rather then juz the result of a lean a/f mix. u can basically run an engine lean as hell with the right ignition timing at the expense of overheating the engine if u wanted to. these other factors include a lean a/f mix, higher compression, poor fuels, higher cylinder pressure/ temperatures etc. none of these alone contributes to predetonation without the presence of poor ignition timing.</div>

Or does it not have?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Kron,<br><br>from what i understand, misfiring is usually caused by spark plug failure; the air/fuel ratio is out of balance to ignite; or loss of compression.<br><br>With the air/fuel ratio too lean, there will be lean misfire. This can be due to insufficient fuel pump pressure, fuel pressure regulator, fuel injectors.... etc.<br><br>Thus an example in a car with turbo, if too high a boost pressure is set, and the fuel pump and fuel injectors cannot handle the fuel required for the air/fuel mapping, it will misfire due to the lean mixture.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
