            <div class='col-md body'>pumping it to full would actually help you mantain the oil tank. If during a long period of time, rust or dirt or even something may crystalize on the upper level of the tank. Too much air gap might also harm your tank. It would be advisable to pump to full. It does not matter, in the end you will be using how much you travel. But for lasting reasons, it would be best to pump to full.<br><br>especially if you are pumping in malaysia, must pump to he brim...make full use of it. Do you know on average, after you set the auto-pump and once it stops, you can actually pump in around additional 5 liter into the tank. Normally pple would juz set to auto and stop when the pump gun detect a certain lvl. So far I have manage to get for eg, auto stop at around 15ltrs, I manage to squeeze in another 6 lter but it took me about 20mins... causing a long Q...but who cares... When I mean to the brim....I really mean it... totally to the brim. lolz</div>

And bTw...I am one of the regulars who always go in to pump. I always find it kinda stupid to shake, waste strength. You juz pump in bit by bit, let it flow in slowly. especially when reaching the brim. If flush out my tank now, all is jb v-power.. lolz...<br><br>All these juz take time only, when the pump gun auto-stop and manual pumping comes in, slowly let the petrol flow in. In this way, it is reducing the bubbles. so by the time, it reach the max, bubbles would be at the minimum.<br><br>Brush up my language...oMg... is this the first time u drink teh tarik, which is oso tea with milk being shake at prata house. Its in malayu. lolz</div>
