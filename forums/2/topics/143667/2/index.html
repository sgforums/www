If im buying a cheap pre-owned porsche for about 5000 quid, i honestly won't be worrying about resale value like i would if im buying a brand new car. so resale value seems to be a secondary consideration to price itself.<br><br>as for spareparts, well porsche spare parts, both 911 or non-911 models are all not cheap. but between 911 parts n non-911 parts, there is little to choose from, whether u're talking about ease of availability or price.<br><br>So yes, I would get a 944(Turbo S2) if I can find one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I absolutely love the looks of the new Cayman S!  Guess it'll cost about $300+k when it's out in Singapore since it's supposed to fill the gap between Boxster S and a 997.  Alternatively, the 993 C4S.. an absolute Classic! A second-hand one going for $200+k... Hmmmmm..*dream*dream*dream*<br><br>But, to be absolutely realistic, unless you got lots of cash in your hands to burn... dun waste money on such cars in Singapore... no value!  Maintenance costs in the region of $2000 per year for a 2nd-hand Porsche.  For you if you just get licence, insurance premium will kill liao lor...  Also, road tax a few thousand a year!  Good Luck anyway!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If you want to talk about cost, why dont we take into consideration other things such as car thief, cost of food, gas, VAT, housing, transportation (especially the taxi) etc. One plate of roast duck rice in UK will easily set you back 4 pound, which is about $13, and here we can buy the whole roast duck.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If im buying a cheap pre-owned porsche for about 5000 quid, i honestly won't be worrying about resale value like i would if im buying a brand new car. so resale value seems to be a secondary consideration to price itself.<br><br>as for spareparts, well porsche spare parts, both 911 or non-911 models are all not cheap. but between 911 parts n non-911 parts, there is little to choose from, whether u're talking about ease of availability or price.<br><br>So yes, I would get a 944(Turbo S2) if I can find one.</div></blockquote>Heng, if I want performance, I will go for modern sports cars, which is more reliable, better, cheaper to maintain.<br><br>As for price, spare parts and resale valuye, I hope what you say above is applicable to Singapore.
