We're talking about singapore here for Gawd's sake. Why don't u try driving an enzo out on the roads n see whether u get into trouble or not?<br><br>In UK, Enzos remain LHD but are road legal because our DVA allows LHD cars to be driven in UK. There is a premium u have to pay over RHD cars as levied by DVA, but otherwise the Enzo is considered road legal there.<br><br>In singapore, it is NOT road legal, which is why we can say someone who buys one in singapore really has a passion for cars. It is common sense that U can buy a car in singapore which has not been deemed road legal by LTA, but u cannot drive it. ownership itself is not a crime, but if u drive it on public roads, it is a crime.<br><br>All along what i've been saying is that the enzo is not road legal, in the context of Singapore! i wasn't saying that the Enzo is not a road legal car all over the world. I've seen it being driven in London, why would i say that? U have to take a look at previously, we were discussing in the context of exotics in Singapore, hence I wouldn't have to state unnecessarily that i am talking about singapore. on the other hand, u've come into the middle of a discussion, u have the responsibility to make it clear u understand what we were talking about, and not assume what u think we were talking about!<br><br>Lets just say if I wouldn't mistake a Murcielago as being only LHD because there are a pleathoria of RHD ones in UK. I dunno about being able to take a macro view or not, but i find your assumption without making sure that your understanding of the ongoing discussion was accurate, is indeed very irresponsible. As such why do u think most people here responded negatively to you? Non of my post was intended to demean, but perhaps some of them were intended to make u realise everyone here are talking about the context of singapore, as this discussion was originally set in.<br><br>As for other things, such as whether the Enzo is usuable as an everyday car, the answer is yes, but whether one would want to subject a car which is arguably a very limited edition and collectable car to the abuses of everyday uses, is subject to more discussion. And quite rightly, u will realise most owners would not use their Enzos as everyday cars. Why should they when they probably also own a plethoria of other more common exotics like a 360 or a luxuriobarge like a BMW 7 series? Ask yourself which car would give u a greater heartache if it got scratched or dinged: Enzo or 360 and I think u'd have the obvious answer.<br><br>Now that u've revealed what car u drive, i must say i am more shocked that u either don't know that LHD cars are generally not road legal IN SINGAPORE, or that u can be as irresponsible to assume that we weren't speaking in the context of what is considered road legal and whats not, in singapore. I mean unless your car's bought with parential money, u're probably doing some high paying job with heavy demands on responsibilities, so how could u make such a basic irresponsible mistake as to assume that our field of discussion was wherever YOU had thought laid, instead of finding out where it actually lay?<br><br>Finally, I have to say, I didn't call u a car moron.
