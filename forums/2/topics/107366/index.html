Everything inside very well built and looks good from the outside. Looks don;t change too much even after time.  At least picnic can get from borneo motors, but also be warned that bm SE are quite bad, esp in Leng Kee, procedures wise should be quite ok.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Very super comfortable, very spaceious, good engine and drive.<br><br>Stream is smaller, sort of cater for someone who only occasionally carry 7 person. The last row has small leg and head room. Go for the 2.0L instead of the 1.7 L. The price is now super good with a lot of stuff throw in. The 2.0L engine is very good, quiet, comfortable and handle better than some car. Very quiet, got back aircon duct.  The stream is althought a MPV but unlike other MPV, it stand out as it handle more like a car.<br><br>Wish, people who go for it for 2 things, the outer look and the space. The new wish have darken windows, and space is cooler than other MPV. It also have more space for the 3rd row. Have a 1.8 engine, which should be economical. But test drive it, - me and my friend don't like it  ! A let down in the interior, not too comfortable to drive, for the passenger also my friend feel not that comfortable. For me as I am tall and huge size, I was uncomfortable in the driver seat. The test drive did only make me feel like economy class compare to the Honda Stream, which comfortable and smooth handling is like business class.  However if space and exterior is what you want, then Wish is definititly better than the Stream 2.0.<br><br>The wish is around 83- 84K and the stream 2.0 is about 86K with lots of things thrown in , which make it a better buy.<br><br></div>

Honda is alway know to be more expensive, but know to be the better car for engine performance.<br><br>Fuel economy both is almost the same. Stream have 5 gear but Toyota have 4 only, if you travel highway often then Stream fuel economy will be much better.<br><br>I have the same thoughts on economy at first choice at first, till I test drive both car. Unless you test drive both of them , then you will know the huge different in feel which make me select stream 2.0.<br><br></div>
