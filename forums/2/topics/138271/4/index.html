Anyway I tot I rem U saying something abt pointing fingers?? and now upgraded to punching ar..wow violence filled..scares me away from the forum man.<br><br>Imagine..thousands of car roam the road everyday on our roads. If only 0.1% reported someone pointed his/her middle finger at them..there will be tens of reports a day..TP's job is not to look for fingers to catch, neither is that the job of the police. I dun even think you will get a letter. Coz I've pointed mine on lotsa ppl. You might think it's an ethic or driving 'rule' to not point fingers. But I'll rather reckless drivers start to wake up their idea and drive with more caution.<br><br>A finger is not gonna wake up their idea, but it'll at least lead them to think "wtf have I done wrong"..Lemme guess.. you must be a victim of such pointing fingers incident arent you?? haha<br><br>btw, TP rex is definintely fitted with NOS.
