            <div class='col-md body'>theres a speed camera near bukit timah area (quite near to the only right exit along that stretch of PIE). i have always been rather careful with it, and in any case i seldom drive more than 10 kmh beyond speed limit. anyway the traffic condition in the morning usually does not allow anything more. the limit for that stretch of road is 80 kmh.<br><br>this morning (6 something), was driving along PIE. i was driving along that stretch again. and when i was approaching the camera, guess what, the camera light flashed! i was shocked and immediately looked at my speedometer - it read 80 kmh! i was like - what?! well, even if i could be driving more than 80 kmh just before approaching the camera, i cant be more than 10 kmh beyond the speed limit if my speed could be 80 immediately after i got flashed! and i didnt brake at all!<br><br>anyway, just to confirm - the speed camera takes a picture BEFORE or AFTER the speeding vehicle passes it? (so it takes the front or the rear of the speeding vehicle?)<br><br>and speed cameras are SO unforgiving?!?!<br><br>and if i really get a summon, how much fine and how many demerit points am i looking at? and how, if possible, should i appeal?<br><br>sigh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
