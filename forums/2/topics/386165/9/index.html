              <p>Best thing is no extra charge if you rent as a P-Plater.. Petrol is top-up. Means when you collect the car is 3/4 tank, when you return also 3/4 tank can already. (Return at same level that you receive).</p>
              <p>Their weekend package is usually $180 or $200 (model dependant) for Fri - Mon rental.. which is still quite reasonable in the market and also cater to P-plater..</p>

              <p>Depends on which type of accident. If the accident involves you and non-living thing such as wall, tree, lamp post, you have to inform the company. Then you just bring the car to any workshop you like and repair. Then return them the car.</p>
              <p>If accident involves u and other person, you need to inform the company first. Cos when you rent car, you are covered under their insurance. If u kena banged, you should be ok. if you bang others, you may need to come out with "some" money. This you should check with the rental company.</p>
              <p>Breakdown wise, no charge. You can call them and they will arrange 1 to 1 exchange..</p>
              <p>I usually rent on weekends. The weekend package starts from Friday Evening till Monday Evening. You have to call them and ask what time is the car available. If the car u want is available on friday morning, you can collect on friday morning and return monday morning.</p>

              <p>Depends on which type of accident. If the accident involves you
              and non-living thing such as wall, tree, lamp post, you have to
              inform the company. Then you just bring the car to any workshop you

              <p>If accident involves u and other person, you need to inform the
              company first. Cos when you rent car, you are covered under their
              insurance. If u kena banged, you should be ok. if you bang others,
              you may need to come out with "some" money. This you should check
              with the rental company.</p>
              <p>Breakdown wise, no charge. You can call them and they will
              arrange 1 to 1 exchange..</p>
              <p>I usually rent on weekends. The weekend package starts from
              Friday Evening till Monday Evening. You have to call them and ask
              what time is the car available. If the car u want is available on
              friday morning, you can collect on friday morning and return monday
              morning.</p>

              <p>As for breakdown, they say they are not able to change other car. Stated at FAQ there, so is it can or cannot? I only scare kena accident then very leh chey.. need to do alot of contact company or whoever.. But you rent time, did you kena accident?</p>
              <p>How they charge as per day?</p>

              <p>for the breakdown, it depends. My cousin rent before and breakdown, they changed car for him.. for weekend, they dont rent per day.. for weekdays, usually is $40 per day onwards, depending on car model.</p>

              <p>I never tried before.. I always go down to turf city personally.. delivery charge I think is maybe 5 or 10 dollars. It's always good to collect car at turf city.. so you can inspect whether the car got any problem then move off. or else later the person deliver to you liao got problem he dont wanna change for you how?</p>
              <p>I don't think you wanna rent a car that breaks down the first hour that you start to drive?</p>

              <p>No worry..</p>
              <p>Yes, if you own the car, you have to pay an insurance premium yearly, and a road tax (6 monthly or yearly, depending on your budget). Your insurance and road tax starts from the day your car gets registered at LTA.</p>
              <p>Right, Let's say excess is 1.5k. You kena accident (touchwood) and repair cost is 2k. You have to come up with the <strong>first</strong> 1.5k and the rest covered by insurance company.</p>
              <p>For your family car, you have to check with your dad. They usually cover the main driver, 2nd driver and "all the drivers authorized by the owner of the car". But there is a catch here:</p>
              <p>"Additional Excess of $1000 - $3000 applies to young and inexperienced drivers: i.e. 26 years old and below, driving experience of less than 2 or 3 years"</p>
              <p>Means if you are the one driving the car at the time of accident. the excess will be</p>
              <p>$1500 + $3000 = $4,500</p>
              <p>If your repair cost is only $2k, means you<strong> cannot</strong> claim insurance..</p>
