Though my car is small and cheap korean car, I still have my car alarm on and my steering wheel lock on. You can get this cheap in Jb as low as RM19.90 for the steering lock.<br><br>I heed my cuzin advise to lock the car. As he is a malaysian, according to him, it seems that not only they are eyeing on big luxurious car.
