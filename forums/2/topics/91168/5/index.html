It's not that hard to find tyres, just cost more... if you are willing to pay... they will have it. The most important thing about these tyre thingy is to get a size as close to the original diameter so the gear ratio will not be affected as much. Well... if you can as close as 10mm... you are safe... my current difference is 19mm...<br><br>My next tyre change, I will switch to the 165/60 R15 tyres... though I feel 175 has a better grippy feel... but I think 165 should do the trick, since Picanto is not meant to be a fast car.<br><br>The Kyowa rims I got are pretty good... looks good too... I don't know about the rest of the brands... but you can ask around... I will do that too... update each other okay<br><br>Vincent</div></blockquote>hi vin, when u changed ur tyres n rims wat happen to the original ones? can trade in or something?</div>
