It shines your car without having to wax again and best of all, washing your car will never be easier.<br><br>Don't think it will protect your car from scratches completely; for example, self-inflicted scratches and accidental scratches are unavoidable.<br><br>"aren't ultrashield suppose to shield off those minor scratches"???<br>Yes, the thing is, without Ultrashield or other similar product/work done on your car, chances are, you will wax your car. When you wax your car, hairline swirl marks like scratches will develop due to wrong techniques or present of dust particles. (try to examine your bonnet surface under bright lighting or sun light at different angles).<br><br>So, never polish your car if you do not know how, unless minor scratches are okay to you...<br><br>I would recommend Ultrashield/Glare only.
