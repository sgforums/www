            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>A really Suay thing happen to me this morning. Was travelling on the road when passing by a few truck carrying stones. Tried to siam them for safty reason.<br><br>Thus, I was traveling on the third lane, and the trucks are all on the first lane (however, quite fast, as usual). Suddenly out of nowhere a small rock flew and hit onto my windscreen. Got a shock!<br><br>ThereÂ’s a 1cm or so deep crack on my windscreen now. It look really bad at first, especially from inside. Look like water will sip in like that.<br><br>However after arriving in office, a further check proved that the windscreen is not that bad till the extend that water will sip through, but its bad enough.<br><br>Now thinking of changing the windscreen, and was wondering if insurance does cover. A friend of mind change before and all he need to pay is $50. It wonÂ’t affect his NCB as well. However, his van is covered by NTUC, while mine is not. Another insurance company but under Comprehensive.<br><br>Now my question to all is that, is it true that all insurance covered does include a free windscreen every year, and itÂ’ll not affect the NCB (No-Claim Bonus). If so, I did better change quickly as my insurance is due soon. Better change now before it go into a new yr.<br><br>Hope some1 out there can advise.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Sign~ Really suay. Already avoid liao still kena from nowhere.

Already make my mood very bad since yesterday liao.<br><br>Okie, I already check and the procedure is as such, just to share with all.<br><br>1) You have to go to one of the authorised motorcar workshop to file a report and accessment.<br>2) This particular workshop will then feedback to your insurance company.<br>3) After that the insurance company will open tenders to all their authorised workshop.<br>4) After a few days, they'll then review the tenders, see who lowest and ask you to go there.<br><br>The bad thing is if the tender of the lowest is in Tuas area, and you live in Pasir Ris, you'll still have to go!!! Wow piang, sianz man. Hopefully it won't be that far off. Somemore needs a few more days. Jia lat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>well i got my windscreen repair yesterday (13th June).<br><br>I didn't pay a single cent cos i got a free windscreen every yr. However, if i want to be covered for another windscreen for the remaining period of the insurance for the yr, i got to pay an amount to reinstate it. Think it cost $80/- plus.<br><br>However, as I am going to renew my insurance soon next mnth, I didn't renstated it, thus didn't pay a single cent.<br><br>Not too sure abt NTUC but think NTUC got to pay 50 plus dollars. I think its okie price to pay for a windscreen. Btw, what car you driving? Certain car windcreen more expensive.<br><br>Also, do take note when your insurance is expiring. If still a long way before renew, think its better to pay and reinstated the windscreen.</div>
