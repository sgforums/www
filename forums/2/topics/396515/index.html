              <p>Currently I'm struggling, how I can buy a car for my necessary transport. Here you have Rich assholes complaining about Car Park Lots - No Enough!</p>
              <p><strong>Family with four cars unhappy they have only one lot</strong><br>By Ho Lian-yi<br><br>ONE night, when returning to their condominium home, they were stopped at the entrance by security guards.<br><br>The Lims, who live at <strong>Hillington Green in Bukit Batok</strong>, own four cars and insist on parking all of them there, though the condo rules no longer allow this.<br><br>The guards told them they could not park that car there.<br><br>The Lims reacted by stopping their car in front of the gates, blocking the entry and exit, around 11.30pm on March 15.<br><br>They refused to move their car and the police had to be called in to resolve the issue.<br><br>It was only an hour later that the Lims moved their car, after the security guards agreed to let them park it in the basement.<br><br>Recent changes in the condo rules had allowed them only one carpark lot.<br><br>The new rules do allow two carpark lots for those who have more than one car, but they lose the extra lot if they sell their car and buy a new one.<br><br>The Lims bought the new car in December after the rules came into effect, so they lost their extra lot and now have only one lot.<br><br>Yet, they continued to park all four cars in the condo carpark.<br><br>Mrs Lim, 44, a businesswoman, said the reason they had bought their penthouse in the Bukit Batok condominium for $1.2 million in 2002 was that they could park their four cars on the premises.<br><br>She claimed her family had been permitted to park three of the cars in the basement carpark, and one on the surface carpark.<br><br>But the situation changed after the condo's annual general meeting (AGM) last September.<br><br>Mrs Lim is unhappy about the new rules and is worried that they might have problems selling their unit if the potential buyer has more than one car.<br><br>In addition to the $300,000 Mercedes S-Class they were driving that night, the family owns a Mercedes SLK, a Jaguar and a Ssangyong.<br><br>A police spokesman said the police advised the parties involved to resolve the matter amicably.<br><br>Warning letter<br>In addition to her Mercedes S-Class being clamped, Mrs Lim has received several warning letters (above).<br><br>Before the incident, on March 9, Mrs Lim said the management had issued her a warning letter saying that if they didn't remove the car, its wheels would be clamped on March11.<br><br>The Lims are not the only residents affected.<br><br>Another resident, a sales consultant in his 50s, said he had to park his second car at his father-in-law's condominium, which is nearby.<br><br>"We are one of those pioneers who live here, they should entitle pioneers to two cars," he said.<br><br>"If at the beginning, the rule was one family one car, I wouldn't have bought the condo."<br><br>Another resident, Mr Tong Wai Chong, 73, a retiree, claimed there is plenty of parking space available at the open-air carpark.<br><br>Mr Tong said there are more than 400 parking lots available at the property.<br><br>According to the Hillington Green website, there are 480 apartments in the condo.<br><br>The condominium's management council did not respond to The New Paper's queries.<br><br>But other property management agents said that if the new rules were passed properly at the AGM, the residents have to abide by them.<br><br>They also said that parking issues are not uncommon in condominiums here.<br><br>Most condos have rules for the number of cars that each household is allowed to park on the premises.<br><br>Bigger units like penthouses may be entitled to more lots since they pay more in maintenance fees and have more 'share value' - that is, the share that an owner has in the common property of an estate.<br><br>But bylaws could override that, if there is a shortage of parking lots.<br><br>Mr Vijayen Nair, managing director of Philip Motha Property Management, said condominiums in less high-end areas may allow people to park more cars, as there may be fewer car owners among the residents.<br><br>But not so in more upscale residences.<br><br>He said the family could try to find if there are any households who are willing to give up their parking lots. They could then try to work out a compromise.<br><br>He said the management council could also charge the Lims a monthly fee for each additional car they parked.<br><br>Mr David Tham, managing director of Dawson Property Management, said: "The question is, why must you have four cars there? You are taking over a common area that also belongs to (others)."<br><br>He said in many newer developments, there is only enough parking space for one car per household.<br><br>In the Lim's case, he said that if the bylaw has been passed properly at an AGM, the Lims have to abide by it.<br><br>lianyi@sph.com.sg</p>

              <p>Ask that family, to give you one of their cars. They have one less car to worry about, and you get a car. I would ask for the S-class if I were you.</p>
              <p>Another thing, never buy condominiums that give you allocated car lots. Chances are, you'll get only 1.</p>

              <p>Those who buy condos think they are king of the place, but they forget that there are also other kings. All of them are kings, queens, emperors and dictators. So how?</p>
              <p>When they buy a unit from the developer they must ascertain if the condominium unit comes with a parking space.  If the sales pitch just says ample space, that means there might be 480 space for 400 units, enough for one per unit, with 80 extra. The space is not guaranteed. Does the sales agreement include one parking space? Usually no. They have to sort out how to manage their car parks by the management committees.</p>
              <p>They just buy the apartment. Thats all they own. Everything outside is common property, shared by all the kings, queens, emperors and dictators.</p>
              <p>So the condominium committee sets the rules on how all the kings, queens, emperors and dictators may share the common areas, which includes the car park, without causing wars to break out. These are the by-laws made during AGMs and agreed to by the condominum residents.</p>
              <p>Condominium living is community living, they have more rules than the HDB estates to abide by.</p>
