Slow moving car on the left, other overtake on the right. I have this feeling that you are not at fault. As for the other car, I find it hard to say if the fault is there too.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Giving and taking is what is necessary for everyone to complete a safe journey. It takes everyone to work together, to give way when at minor road or to maintain right of way at major road. At all times, being cautious as well. Seems familiar right?<br><br>When inside the roundabout, to stay in the roundabout, keep signaling right. To exit to the upcoming road, signal left in sufficient time.<br><br>As to your situation, IMO, I feel it is no one fault if you signal right to let others know your intent not to exit anytime soon.<br><br>The other car on the other hand should know when he need to exit and signal with sufficient indication time. He also should slow down safely to a reasonable speed to you, him and others to react, and try to filter out by letting you go first, if you were ahead. The car behind you should give way to the other car if reasonably possible and if safe to other traffic to do so.<br><br>If he did not realise until last moment, the safe and considerate way to handle it is to continue another round, safely filtering left and signalling intent while filtering. While not exiting in the roundabout, should still signal right until a reasonable distance from the desired exit.<br><br>As he horned you, well, could be the following few reasons:<br><br>1) depressed the horn accidently<br>2) he wanted to exit, got excited and quickly wanted to filter out by horning you  the intent. Who dun horn when excited. (For me so many times, car behind me cannot see my front and do not know got slow vehicle or bicycle or people, then horn me to go faster. Well, got to bear it and ignore them and maintain slow speed. When path clear, then accelerate carefully. Never fear the car behind, be careful of the traffic ahead. But of course cannot jam brakes too lah. Slow down sufficiently before traffic lights, if not either kenna red light camera or car back kenna crash.)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read all your replies and I'm surprised that there aren't more accidents on round-a-bouts in Singapore.<br><br>THIS IS HOW YOU USE A ROUND-A-BOUT!!!<br><br>Example 3 lane round-a-bout (like Newton Circus).<br><br>LEFT LANE IS FOR EXIT ONLY, unless there is only 1 lane at the coming exit, then you can stay on the outer most lane and not exit.   If there is more than one lane at the exit, center lane can also be used for for exiting, in which case LEFT LANE IS FOR EXIT ONLY!!!<br><br>If you need to take the 3rd exit, 2 ways you can do it.<br><br>1st way -  You filter to the middle lane BEFORE you reach the round-a-bout, the go straight to the second lane in the round-a-bout.<br><br>Now you have 2 more choices:<br>i.   You signal left after the 1st exit, then filter to the outer most lane on the round-a-bout, then exit to the left lane (if there is more than one lane) at your exit (3rd exit).<br>ii.   You can  signal left after the 2nd exit, then turn off from the second lane in the round-a-bout to the right lane on your exit (3rd exit), provided there is more than one lane at the exit.<br><br>Of course if there is only one lane at the exit, then you only exit the round-a-bout from the left most (outer) lane only!  As in step i.<br><br>2nd way -  You filter to the right most lane BEFORE approaching the round-a-bout, then go straight to the inner (right) most lane on the round-a-bout.<br>After the 1st exit, signal left and pull to middle lane of round-a-bout (cancel signal immediately if you can).<br>After 2nd exit, signal left again then exit to the right-most lane at your exit (3rd exit).  Of course, this only applies if there is more than one lane at your exit.<br><br>DON'T BE A CLOWN AND TRY TO SHOOT TO THE LEFT-MOST LANE AT YOUR EXIT FROM THE RIGHT MOST, OR EVEN 2ND LANE ON THE ROUND-A-BOUT!!!<br><br>ALSO DON'T BE A CLOWN AND SHOOT TO THE RIGHT MOST LANE ON THE ROUND-A-BOUT IF YOU'RE TAKING THE 1ST or 2ND EXIT!!!<br><br>This is pretty much common sense and is thought in every driving school in the world - BASIC use of a round-a-bout.

I seriously never been into a round-about in my practical driving lesson in Singapore. But due to my impatient nature, I will always over-take. So somehow I drove the right way in the round-about, according to your explanation. The right signal thing I also never heard before, and I was wondering if I am doing the wrong thing.<br><br>Guess I better dig up my basic/advance theory book to check.
