            <div class='col-md body'>Unichip is a piggybacks for piggybacking onto your factory ECU..... The factory ECU that comes with the car are mostly very difficult, or impossible to tune. Installing piggybacks such as the Unichip, SAFC, will enable the tuner to over-ride the factory ECU, to optimise the settings for your car.<br><br>But still nothing beats a total replacement of the factory ECU, with chips such as the Microtech LT8 ,.....  BUt itz gonna cost....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by letstwistagain:</div><div class="quote_body">What is unichip? whrere?<br></div></blockquote></div>

Actually, I do believe in the performance boost from such products and upgrades. . however, the GDI engine's ECU belongs in the same category of TS and Rexes, as you've mentioned on the resetting effects.<br><br>The ECU seems to be much smarter (shld say stubborn) and refuses to be over-ridden by a piggie.  Seems that there's some safety feature such that when the ECU sesnes abnormalities in fuel ratio, air mapping , etc. it automatically resets itself to factory settings....
