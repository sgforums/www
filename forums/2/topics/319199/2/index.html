              <p>Now now now, since n0x is not here I shall be the one to point out some points in your uber-long reply. You said you'd rather mind your own business and you like peace and harmony, then why this stupid reply in the first place? Is "shut up and kill yourself" considered peace and harmony? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And, you can call me slow in reading posts, but in your first post you said the Mazda 2 are better than "SIMILAR" cars like the Nissan Sunny and Mitsubishi Lancer. For god sake, they are NOT similar cars. The Mazda 2 is a small hatchback and the Sunny and Lancer are family SALOON cars.</p>
              <p>And once again, do not compare the Mazda 2 and Hyundai i30. They are hatchbacks I grant you, but the i30 is definitely quite a lot larger than the Mazda 2. And, IMHO, I seriously do not think the Mazda 2 is the better car than the i30.</p>

              <p>Okok, no argument is perfect. Even S'pore's top lawyers who represented us in the Pedra Branca case has arguments that are rejected by the court. What's more, I'm not a lawyer much less a top laywer. So let by gones be by gones and I admit some of the mistakes I made.<br><br>However, I would like to say that I still prefer the M2 because it is cheaper than most other 'quality' hatchback, clearly Chery QQ is not one of them. I haven't test driven the i30 so I can't comment anything about it. I think M2 has a good value of money. Ultimately, it's still the TS decision on what car he likes. But if TS thinks that money is not a factor in deciding the car, I'd suggest you get the VW Golf GTI. Beautiful car that one.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah nissan sunny does seem more unreliable than honda civic and toyota altis when negotiating turns and moving at high speed. (both cars which i have driven more than a 100 times each before).</p>
              <p>I used to dislike sunny too thinking it was an uncle's car but after using it, i think nissan sunny is not that bad.</p>

              <p>Sunny is a very tempting option in terms of price. Test drove twice but still decided against it. The body feels very light so no matter what, it provides little confidence in handling. But then again I’m a new driver. <br><br>Imho since you’re compromising on handling comfort, might as well choose a car with a nice design. Since you’re already forking out instalments, petrol and road tax, might as well drive one with decent style that suits your taste.</p>
              <p>Friend of mine bought a second hand nissan sunny on a whim but she's been regretting ever since because she dreads being seen in her own car. Now that really sucks. <br><br>No comments on Altis and Civic but Vios are fine, they can’t be that bad if comfort delgro conducts driving lessons with a whole fleet back in Ubi.</p>
