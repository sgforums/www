              <p>ur comments are always cui-ed i dunno why.. LOL</p>
              <p>firstly 1.6 and 1.5 both is in CAT A and its not necessarily tt CAT A is cheaper than open CAT... though is usually the case...</p>
              <p>u seriously sounded like a SE in mazdamotors...</p>
              <p>win awards so what.. nobody cares...</p>
              <p>how u know that this is a car that best suits his needs.. he din even say what he is looking for in his car yet.... LOL u can mind read ah??</p>
              <p>and the statement i find most offending is the engine is smoother than lancer sunny blah...</p>
              <p>so u implying that the mz2 is the smoothest car in the entire 1.5/1.6 range??? have u driven all of them??? have u even sat in all of them...</p>
              <p>with this statement u offended a lot of owners in this forums...</p>

              <p>If you're below 30, then the new Suzuki SX4, hatchback has my vote. Test drove the machine before. Spacious interior and smooth handling. Quiet and smooth engine. Not so sure about FC so no comments.</p>
              <p>In terms of styling, the Suzuki Swift is very common and imho, more suited for petite ladies and the younger brigade (below 25s). It's like having anyone above 1.6m or above 30 years of age drive a tiny 1.3cc Jimny. It looks quite silly and out of place.</p>

              <p>Why nobody saw the Hyundai i30 that TS mentioned? I think for $67k, it is a superb car and it's worthed the money. It's a Hyundai, but it's made in Europe. More specifically in Slovakia.</p>
              <p>And to make sure it competes well with other continental rivals like the Ford Focus and VW Golf, a lot of work went into it. It has MacPherson struts front suspension, but most importantly it has a multi-link rear suspension so that it's on par with other class leaders.</p>
              <p>So handling is not amazing, but good enough. And the interior quality is said to be superb, also on par with class leaders like the Golf and Focus. There's a lot of good reviews about it. Only problem is brand image. I'm simply repeating what I've read in car magazines like Autocar.</p>
              <p>Only problem is, Asian markets usually prefer saloons and not hatchbacks. So the i30 will have a problem selling well here.</p>
              <p>Anyways, here's the article about the i30 on Autocar's website.</p>

              <p>small cars and big boot space, as far as i noe, is mutually exclusive leh.. to me lah.. if u wan put CNG tank, becoz they have different sizes for tanks, would fit most boots. Honda Jazz 09, Stream (can perm put down last row of seats for mega boot space for CNG tank, car not small tho) Toyota Vios? Higher budget a bit can get VW Golf, Pug 207/307, Renault Clio (just launched).</p>
              <p>Go test drive and talk to the SEs a bit. Careful tho, some of them oni noe sales, dunno indepth about their cars de. Test liao then maybe u go talk to the CNG guys see what they say oso?</p>

              <p>I think chevrolet having this promo with CNG? from what I know, most ADs, if you buy their car liao then install CNG tank, will void the warranty. Of course that won't apply if the CNG installation is done by the AD..</p>

              <p>I would still highly recommend godfather to at least give the Hyundai i30 a chance and test drive it. Test drivers all commented that it has amazing ride quality. A very fine compromise between handling and comfort. I haven't sat in one, so I don't know. But I have yet to see a bad review about it.</p>
              <p>And the i30 is the worse wake up call the continental brands can get. The i30 is the prequel of what's about to come from Hyundai in the future.</p>

              <p>You again =.=. I don't know what you have against me, I don't give a damn and I don't want any trouble from you. I have a Mazda 2 and you can't change that fact. And what's your problem with smooth engines? Are you jealous that your car(if you even have 1) does not have a smooth engine? It's my opinion and you have no right in telling me off because I am stating my own opinions. <br><br>This is a forum and any relevant things can be posted. I expected crap replies by you before I posted by previous post because of your high tempered nature. I have seen you flaming other people because of the "oh so irrelevant and unconstructive" replies. And, is there any evidence that people are angry with my not so smooth engine comments? Don't spout nonsese just because you are the only one that find my comments offending. And don't come out with evidence saying that my brother say it's offending just because he owns a what ever nissan that I claimed it is not very smooth.<br><br>And have I said that the Mazda has the smoothest engine around? I just said it's smoother. Open your teary eyes please. I think you have been blinded by anger which shouldn't exist in the first place.<br><br>I am just suggesting cars and I have no plans to read the TS mind. Besides, his i30 is more expensive than the M2 which I think its a better car. I am giving my advice, and you can give yours. I won't give a damn on what you say because I am a normal person who minds my own business, unlike someone here. <br><br>As mentioned by somebody previously, you are the resident critic and I know that. On the same basis that you presume that I am a Mazda SE, I will also presume that you work in a newspaper company and is in charge of the "critics" section. Really, you should just shut up because you are creating disharmony in this forum. I know you don't care about what harmony shit but people in this forum hate to see flamings going on.<br><br>I hate flame messages too, thus this is my decision ---&gt; .This is the last reply from me to you because I find that talking to you is seriously degrading my moral values.<br><br>On this note, I would like to inform you that there's no need to reply me, neither do I want another crap reply from you. Well, if you choose to reply then I can't stop you can I? I won't flame you back because I am a person who wants peace and harmony and I will mind my own business, unless somebody needs help, like the TS here.<br><br>Shut up and kill yourself.</p>

              <p>Now now now, since n0x is not here I shall be the one to point out some points in your uber-long reply. You said you'd rather mind your own business and you like peace and harmony, then why this stupid reply in the first place? Is "shut up and kill yourself" considered peace and harmony? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And, you can call me slow in reading posts, but in your first post you said the Mazda 2 are better than "SIMILAR" cars like the Nissan Sunny and Mitsubishi Lancer. For god sake, they are NOT similar cars. The Mazda 2 is a small hatchback and the Sunny and Lancer are family SALOON cars.</p>
              <p>And once again, do not compare the Mazda 2 and Hyundai i30. They are hatchbacks I grant you, but the i30 is definitely quite a lot larger than the Mazda 2. And, IMHO, I seriously do not think the Mazda 2 is the better car than the i30.</p>
