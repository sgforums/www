            <div class='col-md body'>1 reason u can consider is that when urban driving in singapore u are stopping for the traffic more often then in NZ.i experience this situation too cos when i drive in singapore,1 whole tank of petrol can only last me +/- 350-400km depending on how i drive but over in aust, a full tank can last me 100km more and to think that the vehicle is of the same built....<br>the evaporation reason is not really that convincing but it is also 1 minor factor contributing to the fuel consumption, engine wear/tear is also 1 contributing reason that i know of and of cos ur tires pressure and size is also a factor.....<br>anyway this is just my 2 cents worth of view....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Think of the fuel as being swirled from time to time, like a mini tornado inside the fuel tank.  As a result, fuel burning is more uniform, hence better mileage.  Coincidentally, this is also the reason why hurricanes are only found in regions away from the equator and never in Singapore.</div>

Other than the usualy weather hot and cool part, since we know car runs better with cool air, prehaps we are missing the driving habits of both country. I am lucky to see some driving in Aust, so maybe the same is for NZ. I notice poeple take it easy around these countries, so might want to note the average speed travelled in their city compared to ours. Cause when I go JB, my FC isn't drop significantly. No that I am speeding, but I tends to accelerate faster. In singapore, majority of the cars seem to be starting off slower than in JB. So maybe in NZ, they start even slower!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
