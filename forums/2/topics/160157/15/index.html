As i mentioned in the other thread dealing with this incident,<br><br>"In a fatal accident like this, all evidence are essential. The investigators would have gotten to the scene fairly quickly because of the perishable nature of the evidence, and because they have to gather all their evidence quickly in order for traffic flow to resume. I would believe that he stood by and listened in while the investigators interviewed the eye witnesses, and very possibly spoke to the investigators a bit, and asked them about their prelimanary opinions of the accident. He would thus have some information which, regardless of whether he was 'somebody' or not, would have."</div>

My concerns were aroused when SpoonX said:<br><br>1- He had alot of confidential info which cannot be revealed.<br><br>2 - His account was from interviewing passer-bys, the other drivers involved in the accident and the "accused" himself.<br><br>So is SpoonX some official investigator? If so, I withdraw my concerns on his validity. Otherwise, all his postings are baseless just like each and everyone here, yes, including myself. All we're doing is assuming.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok fine. lets consider for a moment that we do not believe anyone here who claims to know the driver. Lets just say we do not know if he was speeding or not.<br><br>Judging by the laws of physics, is it possible for the MX5 to have clipped a curb and flown at 40? yes. Is it even possible for this to happen at 30? Yes. Was anyone speeding? we don't know. Did anyone have to be speeding for that sort of impact force to have occured? No they didn't have to, although they might have been. So can we conclude that, from an unbiased point of view, it was entirely possible for the MX5 driver to have been not speeding? Yes it is entirely possible. If I choose to ignore everything SpoonX has said about the incident, altho I will not say for sure the MX5 wasn't speeding, I'd at least admit it was possible for this to happen at 40. The force needed to launch such a light car up into the air is not a big one to begin with. Once it has left the road, its speed up to that point is no longer that relevant as everything else, the flip etc, were due to its velocity after launching, and the velocity of the BMW. resultant speed of impact between the 2 cars accounts for more of the damage than anything else. Do I think the driver is at fault? Certainly to an extent. Do I think he definately was speeding? No I cannot say that from what I know of physics, and what I know from spending 3 years racing on circuits and having racing accidents.</div>

And my heart goes out for her....<br>And if strike TOTO was me it would be great but i strike it in another way which is the I also know the driver of the MX 5.<br><br>Firstly, Rest In peace Angelia....<br><br>2ndly the story goes like this:<br>The driver was driving and he wasn't speeding, cos any kid will know the road is so congested at that time along upper paya lebar road and no way for u to speed under such congestion and a car swerve into his lane. he wanted to avoid the car by swerving left, but the road is made of metal plates and mind u the plates are slippery even if it's not wet, thus the MX 5 being a FR car the car oversteered instead. the driver isn't familair with a FR car tried to counter steer but the rear right of the car hit the divider and the car was tossed to the next lane. Mind u when a car oversteers with a driver not knowing how to control the oversteer( many of singapore drivers do not anyway) can go above the speed he was actually travelling thus going over the divider is not surprising at all.<br>Anyway with the rear right side hitting the divider, the force will make the frontal of the car slid to the left in a 180 angle, thus causing the car to flip (not somersault that type of flip) to the oppersite lanes. before the car actually landed again on the ground (it went over the divider of course not all 4 wheels are on contact with the ground), it so happen the angle the car is facing is the front of the car facing the right side meaning oncoming vehicles is going head on to the pessenger side, the BMW came smashing onto the car. and the MX 5 is still not really on 4 wheels yet thus the impact of a 1700kg car would easily flip a 1100kg car a few rounds into mid air as the mx 5 is in midair before the impact. (Kids also will know this). Doesn't nees the MX5 or the BMW to be speeding to cause the flip... 50-60km is all it takes. the the car landed on a van...... the rest is already publish on papers.<br>I wouldn't say it is not his fault BUT i would say judging from the situation it is not entirely his fault too... Call him names and assume watever theory all U want. But one thing I know is that the driver is going to live with guilt for the rest of his life. He hasn't been himself and is not in a right state of mind  saying weird things like " I think i should go down and say sorry to her" such stuffs.<br><br>The gal is my Fren. And my heart hurts more than any one of u here. And  I so happen to also know the driver which I was damn angry with him at first but after hearing how the accident occured and seeing him ao remourseful and sucidal makes me lost and pity him too...... Anyway he will sure face his punishment from the law but his worse is to live with a guilt the rest of his life.<br><br>And if u guys wanna ask me how come i know so much details of the whole accident.........................<br>I rushed down to the accident scene shortly after the accident. in fact the driver was in a daze and dun really know wat happen and i got the whole story fom the workers that witness the accident and from the van driver that the MX5 landed on. Later on then i get to hear the drivers side of the story which very similialy tally with the rest of the eye witnesses.<br><br>watever it is:<br><br>To Angelia: May your soul Rest in Peace and see u in heaven when it's my turn.<br><br>To her family and Boyfrend: My heart goes out to you. Sincere consoledense.<br><br>To the Driver: You will face punishment from the law and guilt ridden for the rest of your life. But you are alive and life still goes on. I know u feel like dieing. But u have your parents to think for. We already have one tragedy where a mother lost her daughter. we dun need another one where a mother and father will lose their son.<br><br></div></blockquote>Who's the person who intro him down to her?<br>Do u mind telling us?<br><br>The person who intro him down, knows the driver well enough, he knew the way he drive even on his own car (Reckless) but still than intro him down and he knew he got a car. Why not tell us the whole story why his down there testing the car, when he himself got a car at home. Is he too free to do other things or he is so sick of his brand new car!!!! Please tell us the story, from the start.......</div>

Might as well argue with his parents for giving birth to a son who will kill an innocent person. That way, his parents will have to shoulder the blame. Do not correlate his nature of being "kaypo" with the accident because when you do that, you have to take into considerations everything that precedes.</div>

The driver is in his mid twenties with a job mind you. Moreover, he is feeling remose over what he did. A punk would not even bother to feel remorse in the first place.</div>

My point being that this is an accident and therefore the nature of accident should be thoroughly contemplated and revised before hand. If this is a murder case, then you are free to do your finger-pointing at the murderer. But sadly, people are responding to this incident like that of a murder case.</div>
