One hour later probably means she was rushed to the hospital, and put on emergency life support. But a few factors, maybe the broken neck, etc etc, (no medical report so can't tell for sure) lead to her death. Heart attacks can be overcome by CPR or induced ventilation, but once the brain fails due to oxygen deprivation, then the damage is irreversible. This occurs in drowning as well</div>

The phrenic nerve (coming from C3, C4 and C5) is crucial in supplying the diaphragm (which helps us breathe)... If you sever that nerve, it's a bye bye, explaining why in paramedics, you have to stabilize the neck if you see an injured motorist lying on the roadside (the nerve is C3, 4 and 5) which is located behind your neck, which explains some movies why they crack their own necks and straight away fall down dead...</div>

And my heart goes out for her....<br>And if strike TOTO was me it would be great but i strike it in another way which is the I also know the driver of the MX 5.<br><br>Firstly, Rest In peace Angelia....<br><br>2ndly the story goes like this:<br>The driver was driving and he wasn't speeding, cos any kid will know the road is so congested at that time along upper paya lebar road and no way for u to speed under such congestion and a car swerve into his lane. he wanted to avoid the car by swerving left, but the road is made of metal plates and mind u the plates are slippery even if it's not wet, thus the MX 5 being a FR car the car oversteered instead. the driver isn't familair with a FR car tried to counter steer but the rear right of the car hit the divider and the car was tossed to the next lane. Mind u when a car oversteers with a driver not knowing how to control the oversteer( many of singapore drivers do not anyway) can go above the speed he was actually travelling thus going over the divider is not surprising at all.<br>Anyway with the rear right side hitting the divider, the force will make the frontal of the car slid to the left in a 180 angle, thus causing the car to flip (not somersault that type of flip) to the oppersite lanes. before the car actually landed again on the ground (it went over the divider of course not all 4 wheels are on contact with the ground), it so happen the angle the car is facing is the front of the car facing the right side meaning oncoming vehicles is going head on to the pessenger side, the BMW came smashing onto the car. and the MX 5 is still not really on 4 wheels yet thus the impact of a 1700kg car would easily flip a 1100kg car a few rounds into mid air as the mx 5 is in midair before the impact. (Kids also will know this). Doesn't nees the MX5 or the BMW to be speeding to cause the flip... 50-60km is all it takes. the the car landed on a van...... the rest is already publish on papers.<br>I wouldn't say it is not his fault BUT i would say judging from the situation it is not entirely his fault too... Call him names and assume watever theory all U want. But one thing I know is that the driver is going to live with guilt for the rest of his life. He hasn't been himself and is not in a right state of mind  saying weird things like " I think i should go down and say sorry to her" such stuffs.<br><br>The gal is my Fren. And my heart hurts more than any one of u here. And  I so happen to also know the driver which I was damn angry with him at first but after hearing how the accident occured and seeing him ao remourseful and sucidal makes me lost and pity him too...... Anyway he will sure face his punishment from the law but his worse is to live with a guilt the rest of his life.<br><br>And if u guys wanna ask me how come i know so much details of the whole accident.........................<br>I rushed down to the accident scene shortly after the accident. in fact the driver was in a daze and dun really know wat happen and i got the whole story fom the workers that witness the accident and from the van driver that the MX5 landed on. Later on then i get to hear the drivers side of the story which very similialy tally with the rest of the eye witnesses.<br><br>watever it is:<br><br>To Angelia: May your soul Rest in Peace and see u in heaven when it's my turn.<br><br>To her family and Boyfrend: My heart goes out to you. Sincere consoledense.<br><br>To the Driver: You will face punishment from the law and guilt ridden for the rest of your life. But you are alive and life still goes on. I know u feel like dieing. But u have your parents to think for.

The phrenic nerve (coming from C3, C4 and C5) is crucial in supplying the diaphragm (which helps us breathe)... If you sever that nerve, it's a bye bye, explaining why in paramedics, you have to stabilize the neck if you see an injured motorist lying on the roadside (the nerve is C3, 4 and 5) which is located behind your neck, which explains some movies why they crack their own necks and straight away fall down dead... </div></blockquote>And don't forget condemned criminals don't die from aphyxiation, but from the snapping of the backbone.</div>

Sunny, City, Latio, Altis, Camry, etc etc etc are all FF layouts. They will be more likely to understeer than oversteer.. Only a few cars are FR.
