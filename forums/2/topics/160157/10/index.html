Especially now that we know its a low speed accident. I expected better in this modern age of automotive engineering and technology. Like I said my impression of the car has dropped by 10 over notches.</div></blockquote>This is a freak accident and I believe it has got nothing to do with the car designs, engineering or its roll-over protection. Miata is no a new car, and I doubt it could survive for so many years if their safety feature are not properly designed. For this case with or without the roll protection the passenge will not be able to survive head on size impact from the BMW. (btw, I think this car has got permenent roll bar) The only thing that might save the passenger is probably the side protection airbags, but for this case it didnt.<br><br><img src="http://img479.imageshack.us/img479/6427/pic00036kb.jpg"></div>
