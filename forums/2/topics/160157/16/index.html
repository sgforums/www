I understand what you mean but in the first place why he want to test the car? Did he think about it? He has no need to new car because he has brand new one just few months old not even half a year. If he would have think, this "maybe" won't have happen, But this word "if" means nothing now because is happen.<br><br>Anyway i'm just here to type out how i feel, anyone has right to make a point. Some may think is his fault, some may not. I may sound like harsh but from my side if the man would have think before he test the car that he is not even well know in and knewing he has a new car already, "maybe" this won't happen now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Gazelle:<br><strong><br><br>young and sensible people will not get into so much trouble. young punk on the other hand are bad controlling cars and women. cars will be crashed and women will end up pregnant .<br><br>[b]The stereotypical midlife crisis is something that supposedly happens to a married man sometime in his forties (roughly). The allegations of this from women are well known. There the phenomenon is described as the man leaving his wife and family for a woman in her twenties -- or two women in their twenties, according to the deprecating "humor" -- buying a sports car, and generally regressing to adolescence.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Thanks for your explanation. I hope we have cleared up all of the misunderstandings between us.</div>
