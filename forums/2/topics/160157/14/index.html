To top it off, I bet you did not read the previous threads (SpoonX's clarification is crucial)<br><br><strong>he is in control of the vehicle at the point of the incident. what do u mean by deny? we throwing acid at him? come on. its the truth and fact that he crash the vehicle. no denying it.</strong><br><br>Firstly, I did not deny that the driver had caused the accident. It was a question of whether the person who had originally posted this hypothesis actually believed that the driver would not admit that he was the culprit. The part about throwing acid is in reference to the previous reactions people had regarding the driver (another proof you did not read the past posts).<br><br>Anyway, I do not wish to repeat myself as to the nature of accident. And I can safely assure you that a car do not have to travel at high speed to flip if enough momentum is gained along with a proper fulcrum.<br><br>Please refer to thread 2 for further discussions. I do not have that much free time explaining to every single one of you. And I bet you are not alone.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as for SpoonX's statement, how sure are we that the driver has choosed to tell him the truth? there are 2 sides of a coin. if the driver choose to tell SpoonX the head, we'll never be able to make out wat's at the tail. iraqis? there are just too many things involved &amp; some things are planned and staged. as for this incident, it can be avoided had the chap been careful enough &amp; not over-estimating his own ability by driving such a powerful car with his relatively lacking in driving experience. perhaps my post earlier was abit aggressive but i'm standing by my comments on the driver. but one thing i haf to make it clear..u aren't wrong too. just that we hold different views on this incident.<br><br>watever it is, a life has lost &amp; can never be replaced no matter wat punishment this chap's gonna received. he shall live wif guilt for the rest of his life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's just too bad that the new MX-5 doesnt really offer as much passenger protection as german-made cars.<br><br>has anyone noticed a couple weeks ago, a badly crashed white porsche GT3 being towed, or being transport as it was on a flatbed truck? that car encountered a pool of flowing water along the malaysian highway, aqua-planed off the road and down slope and landed upside-down. it's roof caved in, towards the left side.<br><br>Both the driver AND passenger escaped any serious injuries, the passenger car seat actually stopped the roof from smashing down onto the passenger himself. He suffered only a scratch on his hand as he was covering his head with them.<br><br>You always read on the papers that say "driver lost control of the vehicle", my guess is that he must have been speeding in the centre or outermost lane, suddenly encountered another vehicle which had cut into his lane or the car in front suddenly stopped, he veered the car to the side to avoid hitting but wasn't quick enough to steer back, car mounts the centre divider and hits the oncoming car. like i mentioned, just a guess.<br><br>i really feel sorry for the salesgirl's family... that driver on bail better have the heart to apologies to her family at least.</div>

Meaning in this case, I don't think ANYONE is to be blamed for detracting from the test route because, normally it is the responsibility of the sales rep to know, but since she is from another branch, and is unfamiliar with the area, their not being on the test route is really just a quirk of fate. Nobody is to be blamed and thats what philia is trying to put across. Nobody is trying to blame her either.</div>
