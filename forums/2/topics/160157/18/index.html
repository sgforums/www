How would an MX5's stability compare to say a Merc S class?<br><br>Let me ask u. U say u have done the same thing I did many times. What speeds did u do them at? PM me on this. Not something we should be discussing openly.<br><br>2ndly stability in a car is also measure by how likely it is to spin when u make an error. Some cars are more forgiving, some cars less so. The fact is that an MX5 does need some familiarity with it. Granted, once u know the car, the drive is rewarding, no doubt. U have to be clear about this, we're discussing the characteristics of a car from an abstract point of view, and its impact on the cause of the accident. Nobody is blaming the car itself. I understand that as an MX5 owner u feela certain sense of pride about the car, but u have to be objective about things.<br><br>Anyways, since u're comparing a WRX, well honestly, a WRX understeers at 1st, until u can use the power to tease the rear out. Cars like the EVO n GT-R, depend heavily on electric trickery to affect their handling and stability. When we talk about cars which still depend heavily on mechanical ability alone for its handling, a car which handles is always less stable compared to 'normal' cars. Do note that we're not saying that everytime u step on the gas or turn the wheel the MX5 spins. No in this instance, if the stability of a normal family car is say, a 10, then an MX5 would be a 7.5 to 8. More care is required, but not to the extent that u have to slip it in neutral and let it roll along by itself.<br><br>Anyways, like I said, I speak from past experiences from racing. I know that if I want my vehicle to handle better, I have to sacrifice stability. This golden rule of thumb goes all the way up to even formula 1 cars. if its a car, it generally cannot escape this rule unless u have a car choke full of electronic wizardry. Thats why the really fast F1 drivers, are the ones who can cope with oversteer. An oversteery car allows them to turn in at a higher speed, sharper, faster, IF they can deal with the oversteer. Drivers like Michael Schumacher and Kimi Raikkonen drives like this. Drivers like David Coulthard, Jenson Button, are fast drivers but they prefer stable cars, which is why they're quick, but not Kimi-quick. They depend on a smooth driving style to be fast because their car is more stable, but less responsive to handling inputs.<br><br>Since time immemorable, I've read about car magazine journos talking about the trade-off between handling and stability. Nothing escapes the golden rules of automotive engineering.</div>
