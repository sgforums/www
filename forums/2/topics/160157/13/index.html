But if you look at it from another point  of view, conti car, jap car, the driver is still a singaporean, right? The important thing is to educate the drivers.. to be responsible. So many of us see accidents along the highways, etc, but how many of us actually stop and think? Most of us assume that it wont happen to us because 'our driving skills confirm much better than that loser.. crash a camry somemore sia!' or something to that effect, but the fact is that road accidents can happen to anyone and everyone if we're not alert.</div>

But if you look at it from another point  of view, conti car, jap car, the driver is still a singaporean, right? The important thing is to educate the drivers.. to be responsible. So many of us see accidents along the highways, etc, but how many of us actually stop and think? Most of us assume that it wont happen to us because 'our driving skills confirm much better than that loser.. crash a camry somemore sia!' or something to that effect, but the fact is that road accidents can happen to anyone and everyone if we're not alert.</div></blockquote>Whenever I see accidents, I will think 'That could have been me...' or 'That may be someone I know.' I dun believe seeing a horrible accident won't affect u in any way la, coz we are drivers too (nope I am not from Mobil haha).</div>

Driver did not take Mazda TestDrive Route<br><strong>The salesgirl must share some responsibility in this field since she got lost. Besides, she could always say no to other road alternatives.</strong><br><br>2. Driver did not only kill Salesgirl but injuried another 5 in a BMW 3 Series.

The news papers already exposed him and you guys in the forums are already throwing acid bottles in his face before he could even admit. </strong><br><br>1. How fast was the car before accident?<br><strong>He was travelling well within the speed limit. There is NO evidence that he is speeding at any point of time or given situation.</strong><br><br>2.

Was it because the salesgirl disturb him and made him not consentate on The road as she was rushing off for a wedding dinner?<br><strong>Same answer to question 2.</strong><br><br>4. Why did he not take the Mazda TestDrive Route?<br><strong>The salesgirl was lost and please take into account that he might be totally clueless about the standard Mazda TestDrive Route. Anyway, it is also the responsibility of the salesgirl to instruct the customer regarding the directions and routes.</strong><br><br></div>
