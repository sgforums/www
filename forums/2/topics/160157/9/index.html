They missed out on a lot of major factors like wheelbase or curbweight. Everyone knows the MX-5 is a car designed to 'handle' as such it is set up to be rather 'nippy' around corners. Anyone who's driven a go kart(very short wheelbase, high bhp:weight ratio, nippy as hell) will know that a go kart's handling is excellent. But that also means its easy to overcook it into a corner, and spin or lose control in some way. Good handling does not equate to stability. As some WRC drivers commented on the Peugeot 206WRC in 2001: "it handles great but on the straights it is less stable than cars with a longer wheelbase (like the mitsu EVO or WRX)"</div>

You think initail D ah??? How do u think drifting courses just wet the roads and the FR drivers just learn to drift by not even pulling hand brakes at low speeds of 40 to 50km/h???? A hard jerk on your steering and change in accelerator control will easily throw your butt to either sides on a slippery road for FR cars unless your car is equiped with traction control which sad to say even with traction control a unfamilar driver might not be able to counter steer back calmly.<br>Looking at the pictures of the miata and idiots will know its not a head on impact but the side impact that the bmw caused head on to...<br>2ndly, when the front slided 180degrees with no brakes on there is no traction as the wheels are most like lock in turn position and most drivers will already be stunned to do anything thus causing the speed to be faster the wat it is travelling while spiining due to CG forces.<br>3rdly, whe the front of the car finally slammed on the divider on the left side, the dirve shaft will break due to the impact on the rimm causeing the rim to have a super 45 degree positive camber effect... ( in simple terms the rims would have slantted inwards) thus causing the rims to act as a mini 45 degrees ram that will bring the car over the kerb.thus flipping the car like helicopter blades to the next lane and suay suay the bmw ramed onto the pessenger side of the miata head on causing the car to flip to the rear.<br><br>Lastly i get all these information of the accident from not only bystanders, but the van driver and the MX5 driver as well....<br>There are other more classified info not even disclosed to the media, the familiy of the gal and the test driver which i shall not disclosed here at all. Dun ask me how i know....<br><br>Lastly I'm not aloof guy and dun even know him neither am i the driver... Assume and speculate all you wan for all i care if that wat u are good for. For all i know now is I lost 1 fren permanently and the other will never be himself again. Sorry for being rude in my remarks.<br><br>PS. Know your car character on FR or FF or 4WD before you give any comments if not others will think that a FR car will not oversteer at low speed which is totally wrong and will neglect that fact as a slight jerk and even additional trottle or decrease will send the butt coming to the front and say hi to u even at low speed esp slippery roads.</div></blockquote>If at low speed and with just a slight jerk or additional or decrease will sent out the butt, think thousand of accidents will happen.  Then the road speed limit must lower liao, not increase as what LTA did.<br><br>I maybe an idiots, I may not know what oversteer or understeer, but I only know one thing, Speed Kills. By the way, will you see fatal accident in a traffic jam?? The answer is no, bacause all the car is dead slow.<br><br>Lastly I really feel sorry for both of your friend.<br><br></div>

They missed out on a lot of major factors like wheelbase or curbweight. Everyone knows the MX-5 is a car designed to 'handle' as such it is set up to be rather 'nippy' around corners. Anyone who's driven a go kart(very short wheelbase, high bhp:weight ratio, nippy as hell) will know that a go kart's handling is excellent. But that also means its easy to overcook it into a corner, and spin or lose control in some way. Good handling does not equate to stability. As some WRC drivers commented on the Peugeot 206WRC in 2001: "it handles great but on the straights it is less stable than cars with a longer wheelbase (like the mitsu EVO or WRX)"</div></blockquote>Agree.. but the MX is not a new car.. It has been around for quite some time. If there were significant problems in handling, it won't have taken so long for something to happen, don't you think?</div>

I am not saying it's not the driver's fault (he should shoulder some of the blame), but since he couldn't have gone too fast in heavy traffic and the car came fitted with stability control (maybe he turned it off) or maybe it's just the most basic form of stability control system w/o all the blings blings, perhaps there's sth wrong with the car itself... (can be hardware or software problem). Afterall it's a new model and some bugs are bound to be present.</div>

Its the bloody poor roll-over protection im worried about! like this, u have to wonder how an Audi TT will fare. Or worse, how about those new roadsters and cabriolet with those fancy pop-up roll over hoops will fare! U do realise that while NCAP regulates frontal n side impact protection, they don't regulate roll-over protection ya? Nobody regulates standards for roll-over protection in cars!</div>
