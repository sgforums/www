I mean, I suppose the car behaved the way it was supposed to.. Sure, a lot of things could be changed, maybe the tires would not have slipped if it was S-03 instead of AspecDB (oops.), or you can say the car would have stopped if the brakes were brembos, of you can also say that the accident wont happen if the driver took Defensive Driving..<br><br>At the end of the day, no one wants accidents to happen..<br><br>Hope the gal RIP ba.</div>

And my heart goes out for her....<br>And if strike TOTO was me it would be great but i strike it in another way which is the I also know the driver of the MX 5.<br><br>Firstly, Rest In peace Angelia....<br><br>2ndly the story goes like this:<br>The driver was driving and he wasn't speeding, cos any kid will know the road is so congested at that time along upper paya lebar road and no way for u to speed under such congestion and a car swerve into his lane. he wanted to avoid the car by swerving left, but the road is made of metal plates and mind u the plates are slippery even if it's not wet, thus the MX 5 being a FR car the car oversteered instead. the driver isn't familair with a FR car tried to counter steer but the rear right of the car hit the divider and the car was tossed to the next lane. Mind u when a car oversteers with a driver not knowing how to control the oversteer( many of singapore drivers do not anyway) can go above the speed he was actually travelling thus going over the divider is not surprising at all.<br>Anyway with the rear right side hitting the divider, the force will make the frontal of the car slid to the left in a 180 angle, thus causing the car to flip (not somersault that type of flip) to the oppersite lanes. before the car actually landed again on the ground (it went over the divider of course not all 4 wheels are on contact with the ground), it so happen the angle the car is facing is the front of the car facing the right side meaning oncoming vehicles is going head on to the pessenger side, the BMW came smashing onto the car. and the MX 5 is still not really on 4 wheels yet thus the impact of a 1700kg car would easily flip a 1100kg car a few rounds into mid air as the mx 5 is in midair before the impact. (Kids also will know this). Doesn't nees the MX5 or the BMW to be speeding to cause the flip... 50-60km is all it takes. the the car landed on a van...... the rest is already publish on papers.<br>I wouldn't say it is not his fault BUT i would say judging from the situation it is not entirely his fault too... Call him names and assume watever theory all U want. But one thing I know is that the driver is going to live with guilt for the rest of his life. He hasn't been himself and is not in a right state of mind  saying weird things like " I think i should go down and say sorry to her" such stuffs.<br><br>The gal is my Fren. And my heart hurts more than any one of u here. And  I so happen to also know the driver which I was damn angry with him at first but after hearing how the accident occured and seeing him ao remourseful and sucidal makes me lost and pity him too...... Anyway he will sure face his punishment from the law but his worse is to live with a guilt the rest of his life.<br><br>And if u guys wanna ask me how come i know so much details of the whole accident.........................<br>I rushed down to the accident scene shortly after the accident. in fact the driver was in a daze and dun really know wat happen and i got the whole story fom the workers that witness the accident and from the van driver that the MX5 landed on. Later on then i get to hear the drivers side of the story which very similialy tally with the rest of the eye witnesses.<br><br>watever it is:<br><br>To Angelia: May your soul Rest in Peace and see u in heaven when it's my turn.<br><br>To her family and Boyfrend: My heart goes out to you. Sincere consoledense.<br><br>To the Driver: You will face punishment from the law and guilt ridden for the rest of your life. But you are alive and life still goes on. I know u feel like dieing. But u have your parents to think for. We already have one tragedy where a mother lost her daughter. we dun need another one where a mother and father will lose their son.<br><br></div></blockquote>told you he wasn't speeding.

And my heart goes out for her....<br>And if strike TOTO was me it would be great but i strike it in another way which is the I also know the driver of the MX 5.<br><br>Firstly, Rest In peace Angelia....<br><br>2ndly the story goes like this:<br>The driver was driving and he wasn't speeding, cos any kid will know the road is so congested at that time along upper paya lebar road and no way for u to speed under such congestion and a car swerve into his lane. he wanted to avoid the car by swerving left, but the road is made of metal plates and mind u the plates are slippery even if it's not wet, thus the MX 5 being a FR car the car oversteered instead. the driver isn't familair with a FR car tried to counter steer but the rear right of the car hit the divider and the car was tossed to the next lane. Mind u when a car oversteers with a driver not knowing how to control the oversteer( many of singapore drivers do not anyway) can go above the speed he was actually travelling thus going over the divider is not surprising at all.<br>Anyway with the rear right side hitting the divider, the force will make the frontal of the car slid to the left in a 180 angle, thus causing the car to flip (not somersault that type of flip) to the oppersite lanes. before the car actually landed again on the ground (it went over the divider of course not all 4 wheels are on contact with the ground), it so happen the angle the car is facing is the front of the car facing the right side meaning oncoming vehicles is going head on to the pessenger side, the BMW came smashing onto the car. and the MX 5 is still not really on 4 wheels yet thus the impact of a 1700kg car would easily flip a 1100kg car a few rounds into mid air as the mx 5 is in midair before the impact. (Kids also will know this). Doesn't nees the MX5 or the BMW to be speeding to cause the flip... 50-60km is all it takes. the the car landed on a van...... the rest is already publish on papers.<br><br></div></blockquote>I thought MX-5 is a rear wheel drive car??  Anyway it is hard to convince me that he is not speeding.<br><br>I own both Front/Rear wheel before, the fish tail thing wont happen at such low speed (to you should be heavy traffic speed, 40-50maybe??) unless you pull your handbrake hard and change direction at the same time. If too slow, with the handbrake thing, you still wont fish tail the car.<br><br>If what you say is correct, the rear right hit the curb, the car will not have a head on with the BMW lor. By the way, if the car loose control, it will not go above the original speed, unless he is going down slop, hitting anything will only reduce the speed.<br><br>And I am even more suprise that a bystander that you found can describe this detail to you. Not even reporter got to know what happen!!  Think you can be a very good reporter. Is he staring at the road all the time?? I think this incident happens in split second, even you are staring might not know how it happens.<br><br>But anyway what did happen already did, lets see whats the report from the traffic police.

You think initail D ah??? How do u think drifting courses just wet the roads and the FR drivers just learn to drift by not even pulling hand brakes at low speeds of 40 to 50km/h???? A hard jerk on your steering and change in accelerator control will easily throw your butt to either sides on a slippery road for FR cars unless your car is equiped with traction control which sad to say even with traction control a unfamilar driver might not be able to counter steer back calmly.<br>Looking at the pictures of the miata and idiots will know its not a head on impact but the side impact that the bmw caused head on to...<br>2ndly, when the front slided 180degrees with no brakes on there is no traction as the wheels are most like lock in turn position and most drivers will already be stunned to do anything thus causing the speed to be faster the wat it is travelling while spiining due to CG forces.<br>3rdly, whe the front of the car finally slammed on the divider on the left side, the dirve shaft will break due to the impact on the rimm causeing the rim to have a super 45 degree positive camber effect... ( in simple terms the rims would have slantted inwards) thus causing the rims to act as a mini 45 degrees ram that will bring the car over the kerb.thus flipping the car like helicopter blades to the next lane and suay suay the bmw ramed onto the pessenger side of the miata head on causing the car to flip to the rear.<br><br>Lastly i get all these information of the accident from not only bystanders, but the van driver and the MX5 driver as well....<br>There are other more classified info not even disclosed to the media, the familiy of the gal and the test driver which i shall not disclosed here at all. Dun ask me how i know....<br><br>Lastly I'm not aloof guy and dun even know him neither am i the driver... Assume and speculate all you wan for all i care if that wat u are good for. For all i know now is I lost 1 fren permanently and the other will never be himself again. Sorry for being rude in my remarks.<br><br>PS. Know your car character on FR or FF or 4WD before you give any comments if not others will think that a FR car will not oversteer at low speed which is totally wrong and will neglect that fact as a slight jerk and even additional trottle or decrease will send the butt coming to the front and say hi to u even at low speed esp slippery roads.</div>
