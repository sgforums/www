            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by girlnextdoor:</div><div class="quote_body">think it this way.. how many people go to car showrooms in curiosity of finding out how fast some cars are.. whats the engine like.. whether its good to drive and so on? many. but does everyone who test drive a car buy the car? its just a norm that guys have an interest in cars. honestly when u test drive a car... you're testing its engine and everything important. but dont tell me you find no thrill at all in driving a car u like? we're humans after all arent we?<br>plus it is the SE or the car company that designates where the car should be test driven. it was the SE who guided the driver all the way until they got quite lost and ended up at a road unsuitable for test driving. it is really a pity that the SE died. but this is nobody's fault. if she had survived and the driver died, the media would point their finger at her, u realise that right? so nobody's at fault in this situation. just victims..<br></div></blockquote>I think getting lost or out of the test route is a damn lame excuse for the accident. we are test driving a ROAD CAR, not a F2005 on publich road. Getting lost or not it doesnt matter, because this car is designed and built to drive on public road.<br><br>As a driver, you should have the common sense that if the road or traffic condition is bad, dont push it. And more so if you have less than 5 mins of experience driving it.<br><br>honestly I find it hard to believe how can a modern and proven roadster like the MX-5 can suddenly get into this kind of freak accident? I strongly believe that the driver had push the car very hard on low gears in those wet weather condition. Could the driver been trying to impress the SE with the limited opportunity given to him on the road? honestly i do think so, probably just like how a NS recuit make love to his gf after his 3 weeks confinement in the army.<br><br>And before you try to test a car's performance and handling, I think you better ask yourself if you are qualified do what you want to do. If you have enough knowledge and driving experience behind you, fine. If not just stick to Playstation or Xbox.<br><br>And FYI, most performance cars are sold without any test driving. F430, M5, M3, Zonda, Enzo Cayman,RS6,Gransport, Conti GT etc...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you *Lord Kang*. .<br><br>My cousin, she had lots of dreams yet to fulfill. It pain us so much.. and we still cannot believe that she's gone. She is so young, and is going to persue for a Degree soon. She was the top sales woman of the month October. We are just wondering and can't understand why must the driver insisted to test drive the car when he himself didn't intend to purchase it? He just bought a car recently. Never mind, I understand human nature as well..<br><br>I just hope that no one will try to neutralise this issue by saying its my cousin's fate or whatever that concerned my cousin that lead to this accident. The fact is, i believe anyone, be it new or experienced drivers.. running on a road even with the worst condition, as long as its meant for a test drive, things will go smooth and not fatal like this. Eye witnesses TOLD me they saw the car was speeding.<br><br>For the driver's friends who took the initiative to register themselves into this forum to defend the driver, come on, feel your conscience before you type next time. She's not your cousin, you don't feel the real PAIN. Get it?<br><br>Alright, i'll see the driver in Court. Thats all. My last post.. for the rest.. thanks for everything.. especially your concern.  Really appreciated.<br></div>

There is a saying "it's just my opinion, I can care less on what u think otherwise."<br>What ever whether he did or did not ask the accused to go find the sales agent or not is non of our concern. Like u said, U would if it were u.<br>2ndly, they went down initially cos the buddy of the accused was interested in the RX8. The MX5 was never in the picture innitially.<br>This is all i Know.<br><br><strong>I'm Not SpoonX and neither do i know the accused or the deseased.</strong>. so I dun know the truth and cannot be bothered to ask him unless he tells me himself cos unlike u, asking him does makes him worse as that is not the whole Jizz of how the accident occur and doesn't help in any case even if it's intro or whatsoever.<br><br>Neither is Spoon X the driver or the deseased. He only relayed what he knows from reports to general public so as to let pple know the whole picture and how a car can flip and cos such serious accident even without the need of really speeding so that more can learn from this tragedy. <strong>Never once did he mention that the driver is not at fault at all.</strong><br><br>Lastly the truth is only known by the Accused and the deseased. So what ever any one of us say here is only speculationg. Even the reports from spoonX is also just reports from i also dun know where. It's just up to u to beleive or not.<br><br>There are only few facts and truth we know:<br>1. The accident happened.<br>2. The poor SE died.<br>3. The driver will face guilt and punishment from the law.<br>Unless the driver comes out and tells the truth, the rest are just speculations and reports. The above are the only truth that we will ever know.<br><br>So whatever u wan to think ar assume or point out or just to proof a point(like what i'm doing u may say) or scorn or whatever shit is non of mine or his biz. The mind is yours and yours to control.<br><br><strong>Right now rather than breaking up the so call truth u so strongly beleive in, I rather let's do practical by doing what we can do for the SE family rather than be hypocritical here in the forum pointing fingers and acting detective. </strong><br><br>This is my last reply to u as SpoonX told me not to bother about anything said in here as this is a forum and there will be pple coming in to put others down with their theories and beleives if not it will not be called a forum and if i continue this useless debate i'll be just degrading oneself to the same level. <strong>He was telling me "ever wondered y no one really quoted this guy on his questions? cos it's more of a personal attack not relating to the accident at all and most pple are more interested on how the accident happen and not making another victim feel bad. For all u know this person might (just an assumption by him) know me and has personal grudges against me."</strong> He has already done what he could by saying what he knows as a person at the scene and knowing both driver and deceased and what ever others want to think is non of his biz.<br><br>Anyway safe riding or driving to all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What has happened has happened.<br><br>A precious girl in her prime, died and it was really tragic to see this happen.<br><br>Although the boy is to be blame for the incident, no doubt at this point in time, he must be extremely disturbed and traumatised.  I think cases like this, probably a lifetime ban in driving.<br><br>The bottomline is, I see too many people saving up every little cent that they earned. I think it is justifiable to use some of it to do things that we like, splurge a bit once in a while. Because we will never know what will happen tommorrow.<br><br>Also, buy some insurance for god's sake. Half of the people around me doesn't even have a insurance policy.
