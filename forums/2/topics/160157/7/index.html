            <div class='col-md body'>It would appear that the BMW is from the recently superceded 3-series. Some visual cues there I would take to come from that series.<br><br>I don't know what kind of road was on the opposite side of the road (where the accident started) but where the car came to rest, it appears to be normal tarmac, not metal plates. I do agree that driving on that pierced-steel-planking even in dry conditions is very dodgy.<br><br>Front left of the MX5 shows abrasions (looks like from asphalt) while the left side passenger has a large crumple that matches the vertical crumple damage on the bumper of the BMW, which runs up the length of the bonnet. Can you imagine the orientation of the cars at impact? This accident was a T-bone not only horizontally but vertically as well. I would imagine the car corkscrewed/pirouetted through the air from the moment it got airborne. The number of rolls it managed to do is probably an indication of the speeds it carried. The question is, how much speed do you need in order to lift the car up like that in the first place?<br><br>The car appeared to be travelling on the overtaking lane, and the MX-5 is a car with very immediate response. Without judging his forward speed, I would feel that he had very possibly steered the car much too quickly to snap the tail out like that - the car *should* have responded with a directional change and began turning into the slow lane way before the rear wheel had a chance of tagging the right hand side road kerb.</div>

She had to be unbuckled from her seat and carried out by passers-by.<br><br>The horrifying seconds before the out of control car came to a halt also caused Ms He to have a heart attack, as paramedics later found she had suffered cardiac arrest.<br><br>Her light blue blouse and black slacks Â– the uniform for Mazda sales staff Â– were stained with blood. Her strapless high heels lay by the side of the road. She was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital but died there an hour later.<br><br>The Mazda driver has been arrested and is out on bail.<br><br>The five people in the BMW were taken to Changi General Hospital where they received outpatient treatment for chest pains and breathing difficulties.One of them, a seven year old boy, also had abrasions on his knees. A couple in the van escaped unhurt.<br><br>Ms He started working at Mazda dealer Village Credit in Upper Bukit Timah four months ago. Before that, she was with a car rental shop. Colleagues say the Village Credit showroom had run out of the MX-5 model, so Ms He had to get one from another showroom in Macpherson Road.<br><br>She did not want to go for the test drive at first because of her friendÂ’s wedding dinner later in the evening. Â“She wanted to let another agent handle the customer.but we were all busy as it was a Saturday evening and the showroom was quite packed then,Â’said a colleague,who did not want to be named.<br><br>Â“She initially thought she would tell the customer to come back another day, but she felt it wasnÂ’t good customer service so she agreed to go with him.Â”<br><br>Barely 5 minutes into the journey, the customer lost control of the car on the winding road which is layered with metal plates due to construction works there.The colleague said they were not travelling on the usual test-drive route taken by Mazda sales agents.<br><br>The Mazda MX-5, also known as the Miata, costs about $110,000. It can hit a top speed of 191kmh.It uses rear-wheel-drive system, and motoring experts said such cars can easily swerve out of control if the driver suddenly takes his foot off the accelerator.<br><br>Ms HeÂ’s employers declined to comment on the accident, but car agents interviewed could not recall any colleague killed in a test drive accident before.<br><br>Ms He was the only child of an odd job labourer and a mother who works in a bakery. At the mortuary yesterday morning, her mother was in tears and declined to be interviewed.<br><br>Mss He stopped school after her O levels. But a relative said she recently started night classes for a marketing diploma as she wanted to Â“earn more money so her parents can retire.Â”<br></div>
