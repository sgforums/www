            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone!<br><br>I am new here!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I had recently encountered a horrible experience with one of the car rental shop in Singapore and will like to highlight my horrible experience with them.<br><br>The story goes like this..<br><br>On day.. I decide to rent a car to brush up my driving skills for the coming National Day holidays... And so I searched the web and chanced upon a car rental advertisement that ask me to sms for queries.. and so I did.. There were several SMS correspondence and then I paid my $70/- deposit thru bank transfer as the car rental deposit. It had been agreed on that I shall rent the car for 2 days starting from Sat afternoon.<br><br>On that Sat afternoon... just as I had packed everything and were happily going to collect my car... an SMS came.. and tell me that I have no car to drive on as that particular car that I had booked was extended by the previous hirer and all the rest of the cars had been rented out! I was left in a total shock as I had never thought that this type of thing can happen as I thought that by placing a cash deposit, I will definitely get a car somehow from the shop. But no! The guy just reply me that the previous hirer got the higher priority!!! Thus my weekend was left with no car to drive on... I frantically tried to call the guy whom I had SMS-ed all these while.. and he persistently refused to pick up my call. He just give me a lame excuse that his battery is going to run out and can only SMS. I then SMS to him about my complaints and reasoning and he tried to reply me several times trying to ask for my account number to give me back my money and rejecting my appeal to help me to get a replacement. The funny thing is that he can continue to SMS me for numerous times during the past 3 hours and yet his HP battery haven't run out yet! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I went on to search on other car rental websites and found that they have policy that states clearly that if the hirer place a deposit on a car, he will get a car replacement if that particular model got extended by the previous hirer!<br><br>My cash deposit was returned back to me though but it left me with great disappointment and a feeling of betrayal. I learnt this lesson through the hard way. So people up there.. be extra careful when you want to rent a car. Check whether if the company got such policy to protect the hirer.  I obtained the advertisement thru Singnet classifeds. So guys just be more aware.. ok?<br><br>One last thing.. I am appealing for any other tested proven good car rental lobang.. Will attempt to rent another car for the next weekend.. and hopefully I will get a car to drive!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys.<br>I also encountered a bad car-renting shop in Balestier Point.<br>I had wanted a van for my biz one day so i went to rent. Inside the shopping mall got 2 rental shops. The one on the 2nd floor cant rent out to ppl with license below 2 yrs and so I am not eligible. The insurance thing is the cause.<br><br>So i went downstairs to the one at the first floor. I already sense abit weird when i was abt to enter the shop as it as got no shop name. But i needed the veh so urgently so i went in to try my luck. The owner was a China man and he said he can rent to me. I know its kinda funny cuz I was wondering how come his insurance allows him to rent to me.<br><br>But since i can get to rent, i did not bother much. Paid up a deposit of $50 and gota rent an old broken down van. Ok.nvm...since can use can liao.<br><br>Didnt even get to read the rental doc properly and his mechanic jus hurriedly ask me to sign and go. Cuz its raining and they are abt to close shop. Wanted to ask to read the doc properly they kinda hav bad attitude.<br><br>The bad thing happened on the day when i went back to return. I was late by abt 45 mins due to a massive jam along PIE and also along balestier rd. But luckily when i got back, the owner was still there.<br><br>But he refused to take back the veh saying i was late and that he has got no more parking space for it. What kinda crap. He is doing rental and got no more parking lot for it? He did not even talk to me nicely but in a hurried way and walk out of his shop. I had to shout to him "hey..so how?" He jus refuse to take back his veh. Only upon asking a few times and chasing him all the way, did he tell me to return the next morning. I had to ask him how much is he charging me for that before he say 1/2 of the full rental. I was not happy cuz other car rentals only charge 1/5 of the full rental upon late returning. I said I will complain to CASE and he shouted back and say "Go complain!"<br><br>I was very angry with the way he is treating me. I tell myself nvm..who ask me to be late. So I returned the nex day at abt 11.30 am.<br><br>Upon returning the keys on the table, he made me wait so long while he sent his guy to check the veh. He entertained his other customers and just treaed me like transparent. I decided to ask him how long he wanted me to wait b4 he returned me some notes to me.<br><br>Upon counting, it was not the right amt tat i should get back. He looked at me and dare to ask me "why?" I asked him how come its so little. Only then did he say that I am late again and is charging me another one day.He did not even tell me the day b4 wat time to return but jus said "return tomorrow morning".<br>. Whats this man? I had no way in arguing as the money is in his control.<br>I felt very cheated in such a way. I had wanted to complain to CASE but I had no black and white to support my claim. In the end I had to take it as my bad luck.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah.. sound like your experience is worse than mine.. I did also wanted to complain my incident to CASE but like what you had said, I did not have any black and white document to support it. Just some SMS correspondence. And also when I tried to visit the CASE website(http://www.case.org.sg), I was shocked to see that they are charging money for membership so that people can file compaint on it. So much for a non profit organisation...<br><br>from CASE website:<br><br>"If you wish to resolve your matter through CASE, we will need you to register as a CASE member ($25 for an individual membership valid for one year and a minimum of $10 for administrative fees). Click here for other membership packages. "<br><br>Think we can try create a black listing of all Car Rental shop in Singapore and post it on the internet so that everyone can be aware of it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya..precisely...now CASE gota charge money....How to be a member? They expected us to be always complaining or what..haha<br><br>Now it seems like there is no controlling body for such car rental shops. We consumers have to be aware of our own actions now....sigh<br><br>Wonder if going to LTA would be useful. If there is no government body to look into this, those bloody cheaters would be harming more innocent ppl and yet they know we are not able to do anything to them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
