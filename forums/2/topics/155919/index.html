Lane 1 to Lane 4 and even sometimes along the shoulders also motorbikes (Malaysian). They like to squeeze I also squeeze with them (One bike and One Car in one lane). Sometimes I will purposely drive and go alongside them and match their speed. heheheh. Evil....haiz...what have I become???!!!</div>

If on highway I driving on Lane 1 and sekali I see an obstacle on the right. And this gungho motorcyclist chose to ride between my vehicle and another on his/her left...and traffic is fast moving with vehicles in front and at the back of my car. Isn't the lane designed to make allowance for my vehicle to move left or right? So why must the motorcyclist take away my right of lane.<br>Did our driving school teach motorcyclists to squeeze between vehicles at traffic light or on the road?</div>
