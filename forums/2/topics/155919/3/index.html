The handle should not wobble at low speed, not to teach riders squeeze in-between vehicles. The speed on the prank is like 10km/h or less only. So get the fact right and don't miss lead the young riders and think that our Driving centre teach them to ride between vehicles is safe/right. We don't encourage that.</div>

However, you forgot all motorcyclists also dun wan to die. Certain things that appear to you as being dangerous are not viewed as dangerous to motorcyclists. If you also ride motorcyclist, then you will know what i mean. From my pt of view, squeezing in traffic at 60km/h is not dangerous. But squeezing at 100km/h is. If traffic is fast, most MC also wun squeeze. WHen they do, it is because traffic has slowed too much.<br>Whatever MC do, car drivers just have to check make sure no MC is coming up behind whenever you want to change lane. This is normal safety taught by schools. Check rear and blindspot before changing lane. Dun bother abt MC because they will weave around you such that they will not bump you. Accidents happens only because cars suddenly change lane when the MC is coming up from behind and there is no time to react.</div>

[b]Accidents happens only because cars suddenly change lane when the MC is coming up from behind and there is no time to react.</strong> [/b]</blockquote>I think it is difficult for a car-driver to know when to change lanes safely if MCs are going to weave in and out right? Since we are given and drawn lanes on the roads and highways, shouldn't the MCs also stick by the One-Lane-One-Vehicle rule? I mean that is the whole purpose of the lanes. Else it becomes like those countries mentioned by a so-called self-knowing-Coffee-Drinking-Spug.<br>It is really getting worrying. Just last week alone, everyday, there is either one MC and car, or MC and lorry accident that I saw on the highways and roads. That is at least 7 MC related accidents in one week.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is true that a lot of accidents involved MC. But if you are driving a car in a lane and the left or right lane is empty, wouldn't you also go in and fill it up if the traffic is slow? Similarly for MC, since they are small and can fit into the in-between lane, most MC will normally just do it.<br>I do understand there are many dangeous MC around. Even riding myself sometimes can get a scare from another MC coming so close to me. Imagine if i had just strayed a litttle, accident will had occured.<br>I believe(no proof, only believe) a lot of accidents occur because cars change lane without proper signalling. I felt this way because i had a few close encounters when cars did that to me and i had to jam brake. You know the feeling of jam braking in a car. Imagine doing that on a MC. However, if cars were to give proper signals, i will normally let it change lane. If you want to change lane, try signalling and put you car bonnet a little sideways. MC should give way to you, unless they are suicidal.</div>
