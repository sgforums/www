So why must the motorcyclist take away my right of lane.<br>Did our driving school teach motorcyclists to squeeze between vehicles at traffic light or on the road? </div></blockquote>ya, i ride and drive also.<br>not that they like to stay in between. they do that because they want to go faster(many times when traffic heavy, cars will be moving at like 60 or 70km/h, so motorcyclist like to move inbetween so that can go faster). Motorcyclist dun stay all the way in between 2 vehicles one. THey go very fast when they are inbetween 2 cars so that they can get out of the narrow corridor ASAP. Of course when u are unlucky, then there will be a few MC one after another squeezing inbetween, then you can say you are hindered from changing lane.<br>you are rite to say school dun teach MC to squeeze directly.

If he really want to prevent me from oncoming car, he could have shifted more to the left curb and let me pass in my lane. Many drivers do that actually, and MC really are very thankful for such thoughtfulness.

            <div class='col-md body'>i usually ride a motorcycle to school. i agree that sometimes i'm a nuisance to drivers as i squeeze even when its too darn narrow and accidentally hit someone's side mirror once. hehe. on weeknights or weekends when i drive the family car i also get irritated by motorcyclists occasionally, mostly m'sian plate. but since i'm sitting in air conditioned car and for fear of getting car scratched upon hitting the motorcyclist i let them have their way. there are days when i just follow behind cars faithfully and not squeeze.<br><br>i wont side motorcyclists/drivers. just want to say patience solves all problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My bf rides. I am naturally the one who usually sit behind him. I've seen my fair share of awfully scary stuff that drivers do (including my dad).<br><br>Mainly the taxis scare the wits out of me. Cars are not as bad, but I understand why my BF sometimes cuts between cars. Those who have only driven and never ridden before would not understand the heat/rain that one is exposed to on the roads. Motorcyclists expect it, but would still like to get out of that situation asap.<br><br>Being in between cars is NOT fun. No motorcyclist in his/her right frame of mind would want that. If there's a way out of that gap, he/she would take it.<br><br>I, too, feel the danger everytime I feel a vehicle close. I always have to pray that the fella doesn't do some wrong estimate and accidentally brush us. Drivers, please know that just one slight touch from your wonderful big comfy cars will send us rolling on the roads and a couple of families will be in grief for the rest of their lives.<br><br>My bf tries to get ahead of traffic so there's as few vehicles around us as possible. Trying to get to our destination quickly is also one of the other reasons. We're not asking you to give way exclusively to us, but please don't try to purposely make life difficult for the motorcyclists when we're not doing anything to you.</div>
