            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to settle the matter privately, remember to get it written down and both signed on it. Juz a short and sweet note will do. Main thing to state is that both agreed to settle and not report to insurance or police.<br><br>Don't be play out as I have a friend who went through hell for it. 2 weeks after the accident was supposed to be settle privately, he received a summon from the police and a claim from the insurance, despite paying the other party $300 to settle. He has no prove to show he pay, so in the end, he got 9 points, $150/- fine and almost $5000/- claim from insurance( he pays excess $1000/-). Cursing all over as he kiss the other guys's ass.<br><br>So better be careful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The investigators will not really seriously consider both sides' stories because either one could be making false accusations, just as you said. Instead they will look for 2 things, the areas where the cars were damaged and the statement of any independent eye witnesses (meaning people who were not in your vehicle but saw the accident).<br><br>Generally, the vehicle whose rear got damaged has a pretty strong case.....abt 80-90%.  Damage to the side gives you about 50-50 chances of winning. These were the usual rates according to IDAC.<br><br>As for eyewitnesses, if they are not related to you...probably stronger case.<br><br>For your case since the other person hit you from behind, you should probably make a claim to his/her insurance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.... Anyone else sees a problem with the whole system here?   The people who decides who is in the right and wrong weren't even present when the accident happened.<br><br>Your insurance company can easily accept 30 to 40% liability, and then remove your NCB the following year.  Beneficial to them if the amount claimed is small no?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I was involved in a little accident more than a year ago on the highway.  Traffic stopped, so did I and another car hit me from behind and my car moved forward a little and bumped the car infront of me.  The guy infront had a brand new car so understandably he wasn't too happy with the little scratch on his rear bumper.<br><br>We all made our individual claims (and luckily the guy behind me admitted full responsibility).  I thought everything was settled.   When I tried to renew my insurance 2 months ago, I found out that my insurance company stripped away my NCB because of that accident.   Seems that the insurance company of the guy infront of me, and my insurance company has still not decided if my insurance should pay, or the guy behind me should pay for the front guy's bumper.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Just a tiny scratch, if my company wants to pay the full $100 or so to touch up the little paint work... my premiums rise by 50% !!!!<br><br>There has to be a better way than this.    The party who has the most to gain (i.e. insurance companies) can not be the ones who decides on who pays what!</div>
