              <p>Hi folks. Thinking of fishing in troubled waters, to get a car while COE is still low.  Would appreciate some advise out there as to get a honda civic 1.8 2009 facelift edition or opt for the Mitsubishi Lancer EX 2.0 GT. If anybody know much of the insights of these 2 cars, pls advise me which is more worthwhile for the approx 70++ k value and why.</p>

              <p>But City is kind of like a downgrade, since his options are Civic and EX GT. But personally, when you talk about worthwhile, I guess resale value, etc are of importance and it does not take a genius to figure out whether a Honda or a Mitsubishi will have higher value a few years down the road.</p>
              <p>Hence my vote will be the Civic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Then again EX GT vs Civic, I think the rest of the singaporeans who invested in Honda's best selling model won't be wrong. Throw a rock at any stretch of road and chances are it'll hit a Civic instead of a EX.</p>

              <p>Aside to Nightsky87: Thanx 4 sharing. Your view reinforces my initial stand on buying the civic. However, was pondering over these 2 models due to these factors:</p>
              <p>1) Lancer EX 2.0 Sports comes with 2.0 litres engine, body kits and rims , rear spoilers and sports tyres, still a few k cheaper than an empty civic 1.8 </p>
              <p>2) Nid to buy full body kits and sports rims, tyres as i intend to make my car sporty. Thus forking out more $ for the civic</p>
              <p>3) Advises given to me that civic's maintenance is relatively high and way overpriced for mid size sedan.</p>
              <p>Pardon me for not mentioning the sporty point earlier in my thread. =X </p>

              <p>I support Lancer EX GT purely for its looks. Asthetics wise, it looks more sporty than the Civic. The side skirting, rims and the spoiler completes the ideal package for a sporty GT.</p>
              <p>But that's so far the GT goes...</p>
              <p>If you look deeper into the ownership costs and stuff, the Civic will save you more in terms of road tax, fuel, and insurance even though it may be seem more expensive than the GT. I doubt the GT will be as fuel-efficient as the 1.8L civic, being a 2.0L car in its class.</p>
              <p>Hence, in my opinion, if you have set aside a substantial amount of money and wish to garner the sporty image that you might have, by all means the EX GT is for you. If you wish to find areas to save money while not compromising on the power and efficiency of the car, then you can consider the Civic and possibly change the rims or add the spoiler to create the sporty feel that you want.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents' worth...</p>

              <p>1) Lancer EX 2.0 Sports comes with 2.0 litres engine, body kits

              <p>That is true - in terms of aesthetics, you get a lot of additional pieces of good stuff (including the Rockford Fosgate sound system on the EX GT). Bodykits and rims wise, sad to say the Civic 1.8 rims are nothing impressive, unless you get the Civic 2.0A, but that's a whole new price range to contend with. Another thing to note that if you intend to get genuine mugen kits/spoiler/spoon sports rims etc, they don't come cheap - usually in the 4 digit price range.</p>
              <p>In terms of engine specs, yes you are right in the sense the in the EX GT you will get more power from the 2.0 DOHC (155bhp), as compared to the Civic's 1.8 SOHC (140bhp). Maintanence wise I honestly have no idea, I don't own either so you probably have to hear first hand from EX and Civic owners.</p>
              <p>To be honest, buying a car is a very personal thing, because you are the person who will be behind the wheel day in and day out, I think its best to go with what you like - go test drive the both of them. All I can say is, follow your heart and you'll be a happier person.</p>

              <p>I support Lancer EX GT purely for its looks. Asthetics
              wise, it looks more sporty than the Civic. The side skirting, rims
              and the spoiler completes the ideal package for a sporty GT.</p>
              <p>But that's so far the GT goes...</p>
              <p>If you look deeper into the ownership costs and stuff, the Civic
              will save you more in terms of road tax, fuel, and insurance even
              though it may be seem more expensive than the GT. I doubt the GT
              will be as fuel-efficient as the 1.8L civic, being a 2.0L car in
              its class.</p>
              <p>Hence, in my opinion, if you have set aside a substantial amount
              of money and wish to garner the sporty image that you might have,
              by all means the EX GT is for you. If you wish to find areas to
              save money while not compromising on the power and efficiency of
              the car, then you can consider the Civic and possibly change the
              rims or add the spoiler to create the sporty feel that you
              want.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents' worth...</p>

              <p>Rarely rev up to 6k rpm? You'll be surprised <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> but in any case I was just highlighting the differences between the civic 1.8 and the ex gt 2.0, just for TS's comparison because he ownself said he wanted a higher output engine mah.</p>
              <p>In any case, I don't think the WRX output more than 300bhp, that's STI level of output liao.. Unless I recall wrongly, the WRX only outputs about 230-240bhp?</p>
              <p>Your point about the not using the power hence getting a cheaper engine, if that's the case then using BMW as an example, people will be only driving the 320s and 520s.. But I'm sure you see many uncles or aunties driving 325i, 335i, 523i, 530i, 745i, etc etc who drive slower than japanese 1.6 sedans.. I guess end of the day it all boils down to personal choice, they got the money to spend, we also cannot say anything..</p>
