              <p><br>Yea, and the bentley is 700k - my dad actually was interested but ordered some Jaguar instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay guys, I'm seriously confused what to get.</p>
              <p>My mum suggested trading in her BMW 523i for a <strong>3 series BM</strong> for me.</p>
              <p>(BMW runs a 3.0L engine so insurance premiums already added up)</p>
              <p>Also suggested the<strong> Mazda series 6</strong>.</p>
              <p>Currently she suggested that a 1.6 car is good enough, but personally still prefer a sedan car and it is debated that the WV golf is not worth it.(My car actually must have more practical purposes then just-for-show).</p>
              <p>Anyone has any other good 1.6 to recommend?</p>

              <p>just stick with the 523 lor, it's quite a good car. but if your parents are willing to change to a new car cuz u just got your driving license, how about a camry or accord if u want a bigger sized car. practical too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if 1.6, civic, corolla? or bmw 320, though it's not 1.6 but judging from your posts, i think u prefer continental and more high class cars?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but some advice, when u get new car and got a new license, u tend to overestimate yourself and may scratch the car etc. so must drive safely k!</p>

              <p>Right now the norm seems to be a 2 litre car...do consider the 323i since its future proofed by BMW's famed inline-6 engine technology.And since u prefer professionalism,do opt for the Highline or Professional package to decor the car up :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i do agree the 523i's still good...the 5 series is quite luxurious and things u wont find that in the 323i is i.e rear air-con,"joy-stick" gearstick if applicable.</p>

              <p>U seem to like them Mazdas eh. Heh. Something you might want to know tho. Mazdas in general do not hold onto their value very well. Especially when compared to Hondas and Toyotas.</p>
              <p>Mz6 - Very nice car. If possible would personally prefer the 2.5 HB</p>
              <p>Mz3 - V pretty car. Not v high on space. Old line with replacement coming soon.</p>
              <p>MX-5 - 2 door 2 seater. Nice, but not easy to handle for new drivers. Just ask Regan Lee.</p>
              <p>RX-8 - 4 door 4 seater. V nice, esp manual. Quite fuel thirsty tho.</p>
              <p>207 - CC? GTI? Lots to choose from with these numbers only. Personally like the GTI version, but it's mainly manual only.</p>
              <p>AR 159 - Gorgeous car!! 5yr warranty also looks good. Seldom does well holding value wise tho. Personally would go for manual as well as I dun trust their Selespeed yet</p>
              <p>Cefiro - EOL model with new one just months away.</p>
              <p>Accord 08 - Car with looks that polarise opinions. Heard raves, but personally dun like. If you can get past the looks, the 2.4 might be the best buy.</p>
              <p>Mark X Zio - Available only from PI. Do you need a MPV?</p>
              <p>Civic Type R - 2 versions available locally. Both Manual. 2 door HB from kah motors. 4 door sedan from PI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R and V are their grade lvls. Dunno which is which, diff rims, trim, HID vs halogen lights etc etc. Check with ur frenly neighbourhood Mazda dealer for details. :P</p>

              <p>back to topic, accord and cefiro provide good space for passengers and has decent boot space. not too sure abt the alfa romeo but it sure looks small to me. i would suggest going for JDM models if u want a jap car or just get the 3 series straight.</p>

              <p>U seem to like them Mazdas eh. Heh. Something you might want to know tho. Mazdas in general do not hold onto their value very well. Especially when compared to Hondas and Toyotas.</p>
              <p>Mz6 - Very nice car. If possible would personally prefer the 2.5 HB</p>
              <p>Mz3 - V pretty car. Not v high on space. Old line with replacement coming soon.</p>
              <p>MX-5 - 2 door 2 seater. Nice, but not easy to handle for new drivers. Just ask Regan Lee.</p>
              <p>RX-8 - 4 door 4 seater. V nice, esp manual. Quite fuel thirsty tho.</p>
              <p>207 - CC? GTI? Lots to choose from with these numbers only. Personally like the GTI version, but it's mainly manual only.</p>
              <p>AR 159 - Gorgeous car!! 5yr warranty also looks good. Seldom does well holding value wise tho. Personally would go for manual as well as I dun trust their Selespeed yet</p>
              <p>Cefiro - EOL model with new one just months away.</p>
              <p>Accord 08 - Car with looks that polarise opinions. Heard raves, but personally dun like. If you can get past the looks, the 2.4 might be the best buy.</p>
              <p>Mark X Zio - Available only from PI. Do you need a MPV?</p>
              <p>Civic Type R - 2 versions available locally. Both Manual. 2 door HB from kah motors. 4 door sedan from PI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R and V are their grade lvls. Dunno which is which, diff rims, trim, HID vs halogen lights etc etc. Check with ur frenly neighbourhood Mazda dealer for details. :P</p>

              <p><br>Hmm thanks, really interested in the Mazda 6 over the rest. But if it doesn't hold it's value well might reconsider. The Honda Accord 2008 series was remodelled wasn't it, looks pretty sleek now.</p>
              <p>Would like to have more advise on Mazda 6. Hmm, also, the Civic R, authorised importers don't carry 4 doors sedan - any news of them carrying or am I able to order? How's the handling too? I'm not sure but they say driving on manual is a pain. Do advise</p>

              <p>To start with Lamborghini and Bentleys were not im option, I would have gotten the Z4 if there weren't a minimum age of 26 for insurance without add-ons. I realise that my options do have alternatives - that's because I did not devote myself to only certain models; though I do have a preference for sedan models. Furthermore the listed cars are of lower ends.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>One more question: The mercedez E series Kompressor; am looking at E180 but from what I see at SgCarMart they only carry the e200? Is it a new model and the old E180(or the 1.8L model) is phased out? Furthermore the new ones are priced at 180k? Do enlighten me about this. Need to educate my mum about it - because if they are initially worth 180k it wouldn't be a good buy(furthermore I don't fancy it; thus I need some arguing points).</p>
              <p>Opening up my options again, thanking the forumers who have been actively helping out. Please do recommend cars that fall within the following catagories.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>4 doors</li>
              <li>1.6-2.0L Engine(Preferably 1.6-1.8)</li>

              <li>Value (Value for money as well as resale value)</li>

              <p><br>That's because I believe it's good to have varying options, because my 'sponsors' have to be persuaded and alternative options to be set up in case my suggestions get rejected.</p>
              <p>If I fix my decision on a single car there are many things to consider -</p>
              <p>Firstly, their priority would be safety, then price(resale value) then practical use.</p>
              <p>Although I would be using the car, time to time my sister(who's car got sold) would fly back to Australia to use it. The decision doesn't lean towards her but she's also a factor.</p>
              <p>Also, my mother claimed that it would be ridiculous to drive a Mercedez SL 500 or a ML350 to get groceries from the market. the 523i will get sold prior to the of this year/early next year because the ML350 is more spacious and more 'family-friendly' as compared to the 523i. Thus my car has to be 'family-wise'.</p>
              <p>However, though it might be the case, they might forfeit that mindset in view that I'm a young driver and thus the option of safety - thus they insist on a 'trusted' brand, a BMW or a Mercedez. A 1.6-2.0, already comtemplating whether the 2.0 is already too powerful.</p>
              <p>Then it comes to my personal choice which they might respect if I fancy it - with reasonable factors coming in.</p>
              <p>Price factor is only a concern as prior to me being a new driver - they have concerns on accidents/scratches thus damage payout. Also resale value is a concern because my cars usually get sold within 2-3 years of it's life.</p>

              <p>i would recommend a merc C or E class. or maybe a bmw 320. u have to cross out the mx5 rx8 too cause they r not family wise. the humble accord will suit your needs too.</p>

              <p><br>Hmmm, my mum suggested the C180, but it's more grand than fancy. Will consider it, but 140k for a 1.8L car, worth? It's Mercedez I know but...(can someone give me enough reasoning?)</p>

              <p>Well, for 140k you be paying for the brand,reputated reliability, luxury, origin of manufacturer etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A " barebone" 1.8l Japanese car cost roughly 70-80k, so you can add up the cost of luxuries and all from that point.</p>

              <p>Dude, from all the above, this is what I feel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the SG market, Toyotas, Hondas, Mercedes and BMWs tend to hold onto their value better, AFAIK. It is because they are the more well known and well liked and more bought makes. If value when you sell is what you are looking at, you can do far worse than the above.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, the 4 door Honda Civic Type R is only available from Parallel Importers. It is a 2l engine + 6spd manual. Only Manual. Cannot be indented from Kah Motors. Handling is amongst the best in the business. Downside is that it has 0 comfort. Which lets you know what is going on between tyres and road, but also might introduce your dinner to the dashboard. Personally, driving a manual is a none issue. Better control, better FC, easy maintenence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personal recommendation.</p>
              <p>Honda Civic FD - Same body as the Type R, but far more comfortable. Also far slower, unless you are into modding. Available in 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0. Auto or manual to your preference as well. Spacious too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Volkswagen Passat 1.8T - Luxury sedan from VW. Spacious and comfortable. Only available in 6spd auto.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Merc C200 - Newly launched with 1.8 supercharged engine. Luxury and pace should be best amongst the 3 here. Price also accordingly highest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and for your query about the Mazda 6. Its mainly the same drivetrain with a new fancy dress. Spacious, not very quick, heard not very FC friendly as well, but thats also very dependent on how you drive. Personally not very seduced by it, but if you dig the way it looks over everything else, it would be a good buy. Just don't expect to sell it for much in 2-3 yrs time.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm thanks, really interested in the Mazda 6 over the rest. But if it doesn't hold it's value well might reconsider. The Honda Accord 2008 series was remodelled wasn't it, looks pretty sleek now.</p>
              <p>Would like to have more advise on Mazda 6. Hmm, also, the Civic R, authorised importers don't carry 4 doors sedan - any news of them carrying or am I able to order? How's the handling too? I'm not sure but they say driving on manual is a pain. Do advise</p>

              <p>To start with Lamborghini and Bentleys were not im option, I would have gotten the Z4 if there weren't a minimum age of 26 for insurance without add-ons. I realise that my options do have alternatives - that's because I did not devote myself to only certain models; though I do have a preference for sedan models. Furthermore the listed cars are of lower ends.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>One more question: The mercedez E series Kompressor; am looking at E180 but from what I see at SgCarMart they only carry the e200? Is it a new model and the old E180(or the 1.8L model) is phased out? Furthermore the new ones are priced at 180k? Do enlighten me about this. Need to educate my mum about it - because if they are initially worth 180k it wouldn't be a good buy(furthermore I don't fancy it; thus I need some arguing points).</p>
              <p>Opening up my options again, thanking the forumers who have been actively helping out. Please do recommend cars that fall within the following catagories.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>4 doors</li>
              <li>1.6-2.0L Engine(Preferably 1.6-1.8)</li>
              <li>Safety(I guess the car casing and body hardness based on materials?)</li>
              <li>Value (Value for money as well as resale value)</li>
              <li>Good handling for beginners</li>
              <li>Preferably Sedan model</li>
              </ul>

              <p><br>there.. this is what we are looking for.. it makes it so much easier to narrow down the choices...</p>
              <p>okies japanese there are the usual suspects...</p>
              <p>toyota camry/altis</p>
              <p>mz3/6</p>
              <p>mistubishi lancer</p>

              <p>nissan selphy/cefiro</p>
              <p>subaru impreza/legacy</p>
              <p>and of cos there are those using forced induction engine (aka tubrocharging)....</p>
              <p>subaru impreza wrx/ legacy gt</p>
              <p>mitsubishi lancer evo</p>
              <p>mz6 mps</p>
              <p>conti wise...</p>
              <p>i would only look at 3 marques....</p>
              <p>volvo s40</p>
              <p>bmw 320i</p>
              <p>mercedes c200</p>
              <p>why... bcos volvo is relatively cheaper than the rest of the conti marques and its proven saftey track record...</p>
              <p>bmw and mercedes due to the simple reason tt they are rear wheel driven.. if i pay so much for a car.. i wld expect it to be rwd at least even for its base model... and of cos like a lot of forumites said..their deperciation are not so steep...</p>
              <p>so lets evaluate... from the japanese side... i totally do not reccomend FI cars for obvious reasons..</p>
              <p>so we are left with the rest of the NA cars... lancer and mz3/6 and civic fits ur image the most....</p>
              <p>civic fits most of ur criterias...  civic 1.8 is the choice i feel....</p>
              <p>do note tt there are lotsa other cars available through parallel importers...however i feel that u should play safe and go for authorised dealers as u do not seemed to be quite in the know...</p>
              <p>as for conti...</p>
              <p>there is a cheaper variant of the s40 and is called the mazda 3... they share the same platform....</p>
              <p>i do not particularly reccomend the 320i as many consider the 325i as the "real" entry level 3 series...</p>
              <p>c200 seems to be the choice.. but the looks of the c class doesnt appeal to me...</p>
              <p>and since u said conti is ex and eats a lot of fuel and stuff... i strongly reccomend tt u go for jap which is the civic....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on a side note.. if u are willing to stretch it a little and go for 2.5litre.. i will reccomend the lexus is250 or the bmw 325i</p>

              <p>power la nox. TS, consider a jap car first for your first car. u wont know when u will *touch wood* scratch the car or get involved in any accident. toyota's engine is more rugged while honda is more refined. they provide good value too. for conti, usual suspects as nox mentioned are merc and bmw. y pay so much for conti? the comfort level they give, the accessories, the reliability, the safety equipments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe u can get your parents to bring u down to the showrooms and have a look at the cars. possibly test drive the car too? bet it will help.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Mazda 3 at the moment is quite dated as the current model has been out since '03.Other than present facelift, there may not be a replacement until &gt;2009,where even '09 may be a mere facelift too according to rumours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want a fresh looking car,consider the higher-up Mazda 6. Its not using the same platform as Volvo(which itself use a Ford's) but that of another Ford ( CD3 instead of Volvo's C1)</p>
