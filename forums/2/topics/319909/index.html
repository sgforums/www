              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Just hit 18 and am an idiot at cars but am very interested. Considering the new insurance policy I can't drive a sportscar and I can't drive a BMW 5series neither. So I would have to buy a new car.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anyone can be kind enough to list the things to look for in a car</span>, e.g. smooth handling, engine, fuelÂ consumption, comfort blah blah.. and the things that affect it. I have no idea what cc means. Looking for a 1.6 to 2.0 car, no budget.</p>
              <p>Anyone has any idea what a BMW 3series carries? Typically the 320/323.</p>
              <p>Also can anyone tell me the difference between hatchback and a sedan(Is it just the design at the back?) And why people prefer hatchback/sedan(Is it totally due to design)</p>
              <p>P.S. Getting a car only in a couple of months time, so gathering some recommendations.</p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>
              <p>Tim</p>

              <p>Hi there... Although I am not a pro car enthusiasts, but based on what I have read through the various car magazines, I can help to answer some of your questions above...</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether what does CC stands for, but the higher the CC, the higher fuel consumption it takes up for a car.. It also means higher and better performance in general in terms of the top speed, time taken from 0-100km/h, and usually the cars with higher CC are equiped with better engine specs such as V8.. (Pro car enthusiasts, can help to confirm this point?)</p>
              <p>As for the difference between hatchback and sedan, I believe it's only the difference in the design part.. A few factors that people consider in choosing hatchback/sedan are design and practicality (i.e easier unloading &amp; loading of stuffs in the boot area).</p>
              <p>If you got the free time, you may also wish to read up more about the reviews of the various popular cars in various car magazines such as Motoring and Autotrend (IIRC as I haven read that for quite a long time). Currently I am reading up on this magazine title called "Car Buyers' Guide" featuring "Car of The Year 2008 Awards" which is being divided into 12 categories from Budget/Compact Car to Luxury SUV.. Quite a nice magazine to read during my free time..</p>

              More cc <i>generally</i> equates to more horsepower, which means you can carry more load on your car before it starts to max out. But it also means you automatically use more fuel (and incur more costs), though it will still be better than using an underpowered car. Hence, the guideline is generally to only choose based on your needs, and this usually means you will get a 1.6l car (or just a few cc lower).<br><br>
              
              More torque is good for quicker acceleration at low speeds.

              <p>yeah.. the 'real thing' is called the engine displacement, in cc, and most engines do not come in specifically 1600cc or 2000cc, instead what you get is something like 1598cc, or 1.6L,Â Â Â  orÂ Â  1999cc, or 2L. Thats basically how it works...</p>
              <p><br>And hatchbacks/sedans are (if i'm not wrong) just the 'name' that differentiates each from its counterparts, hatchbacks being those non-protruding, quite flat kind of rear, and sedans those rear which protrudes out. i think you should know this..</p>
              <p>and IF given a choice of hatchback and sedan for a particular model, i guess most typical 'kiasi' singaporeans would go for sedans as 'got boot safer'..... kind of thing.. Not discriminating!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p><br>Good/average fuel consumption for most cars would probably be around 10-14km/L.. i think.. cause i don't drive heh</p>
              <p>And yea as mentioned the Car Buyers Guide is a very good read, price may be a little high, but good price to pay for what you get inside!</p>
              <p>If you really really want to know alot more about cars you can visit http://www.carbibles.com/ ,Â  i think it's a really great site i learnt alot from there ;) good luck in getting your first new car!</p>

              <p>@normalboi, was expecting the regulars to give me some suggestions, in my case the original idea(might still go ahead) was to buy a BMW Z4. 216k but my family agreed on it on the basis that it should be all play while I'm younger. My dad suggested Lamborghini(spelling?), on my 21st birthday.</p>
              <p>But on top of the 216k, the high fuel consumption, COE, high insurance coverage with an additional 50k(if not insurance companies will not cover) leads me to think that the money could be spent more wisely.</p>
              <p>The other plan was to drive a BMW 3 series or a Mini Cooper(So my sis can drive when she returns from Australia time to time)</p>
              <p>I prefer sedan designs as imho; they look more professional(which is important in my futuristic line of work and of course my personal preference)</p>
              <p>Do you mind going on theÂ specifications ofÂ bentley continental gt speed with technical details in layman terms(so I can understand) and also price.</p>

              <p>100-120K - Volvo S40 2.4 or the new Ford Mondeo. Don't even consider the basic BMW 118i cos anything less than a 135i is useless.</p>
              <p>If you like going fast and considering you're young get the VW Golf Gti with DSG, its got loads mod potential; for more info try <a href="http://www.vagsg.com">www.vagsg.com</a></p>
              <p>65K-100K - Not much in the conti section unless you want your Focus ST ($95K); killer power and color scheme; definately good handling cos i've driven one. If you want something with decent power and good fuel economy you can try looking at the Golf GT sports 1.4 with the supercharger and turbocharger.</p>
              <p>The usual japanese suspects in this range - Civic Type R JDM, Mazda RX8, Mx-5 roadster; all these cars would cost less than 100K if you get them fromÂ PI.</p>
              <p>Thats just my 2cents.</p>

              <p>Ford Focus ST, Peugeot 207 GTi, VW Golf GTI or GT, Mercedes C180 or C200, Honda Civic 2.0, VW Passat 1.8T, Alfa Romeo 159 are some that I can think of..</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Some of the above cars only come in Manual, some have Autos only, while some have both options. Since u mentioned luxury 1.6 - 2.0, I only mentioned those with at least a modicum of luxury, and left out the super sporty, hardcore speed machines. Hope this helps.</p>
