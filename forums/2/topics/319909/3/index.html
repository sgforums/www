              <p>Okay, thanks alot.</p>
              <p>The following cars will be under consideration:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>BMW 325i</li>
              <li>Mazda 6(But might overlook this choice in view of low holding value)</li>
              <li>Honda Civic FD(Slow is not an issue, love the type R body)</li>
              <li>VW Passat(Not bad a choice, comparable with my mum's choice)</li>
              <li>C180 in respect of my mother's view</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Okay some questions.</p>
              <blockquote>Oh and please,try not to consider cars with rear drums...all round discs are at least future proofed <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></blockquote>
              <p>Explain rear drums/round discs(Where they are found; function, etc.)</p>

              <p>The C180 and C200 both have similar engine, it's just that their supercharger runs different tune to produce different power outputs. Both have 1.8-litre engines, but the C180 has 156hp while the C200 has 184hp. That's the only difference.</p>
              <p>And I would recommend you get the C280 instead over the 325i. The new C-Class has been very well-received and road testers that tested it all think that it triumphs the current 3-Series in nearly every department, especially exterior and interior design and handling. And the C-Class, no matter what, is a newer model compared to the current 3-Series.</p>

              <p><br>agree with u. anyway TS, drum and disc = brakes. just different kinds. drums are generally used in older generation cars. discs are the way to go now cuz of 1)their stopping power, 2)servicibility and 3) everyone is using them now. old birds, correct me if im wrong on that one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from the 5 choices u listed above, i will go for either the 325 or C class, but will be looking at the c280 at least. just for the power. =)</p>

              <p>Yup,but if you are considering a European car,there's no need to worry about drums because all european car generally have all round discs due to their technological advancement.</p>
              <p>Drums are only found in certain cheap Japanese cars(there's no definite link between cost and the brakes) which some of them n0x listed in his list such as the Selphy so i though of pointing that out.</p>
              <p>So if you agree on the C class,its now on the engine capacity preference,if you prefer a simple 1.8 engine,the 180 and 200 will suit you while the 230 and 280 is the way to go for 2.5l-3l capacity range</p>

              <p>Anyone of the above cars would serve you well. They are all good cars. Might I suggest you go get a couple of car mags for a read. Do not get any of the local rubbish for they are mostly paid advertisements and are only good for getting the car's stats. Then again they sometimes get even that wrong too.</p>

              <p>Hmm, true. But if it comes to power output and acceleration figures, the C280 is closer to the 325i. And won't you think the power output and acceleration of the C230 is too close to the C200K? Making the C230 seem not worth it for the extra money. Might as well stretch a bit more for the C280 instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hmm, true. But if it comes to power output and acceleration figures, the C280 is closer to the 325i. And won't you think the power output and acceleration of the C230 is too close to the C200K? Making the C230 seem not worth it for the extra money. Might as well stretch a bit more for the C280 instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
