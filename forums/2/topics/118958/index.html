            <div class='col-md body'>How much is your full tank, and putting in what grade of petrol, travel ? % expressway, r u heavy footer? Had to consider all this before saying that fc is high. However, petrol saving is critical, if you pump $300/m and if your another car could squeeze another 33% more mileage would mean another $100/m saving. Think wisely, you could save this for a better car.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Try going across the causeway to get yr engine overhauled. Think they do for half the price there. The older Sunny engines are quite economical. Not sure why yrs is having fuel problems. Heard even 12-13 yrs old car, they get about 10-11 km/litres.<br>Another option is to change the engine completely. Heard could be done as you just need to register with LTA. Nowadays, with more newer cars scrapped. may get a better engine. But heard the newer CVT sunny cars fuel consumption are just as bad. So, may not be a new idea afterall.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why engine overhaul for a 1993 car? not worth lah. furthermore, new cars are affordable nowadays.  fc tends to be higher for old cars. sack yr car and get a new one lah.  btw, this morning, saw a new red Latio on the road. wah lau....so ugly. the ad on tv and newspapers looked so impressive. sure reminds me of the forgotten skoda!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
