              Lols...I nearly bought a Jaguar before I bought that mercedes...I was thinking..alamak..later I parked that jaguar in the hdb parking lot how..kena stolen or scratch by someone so on..mercedes not so bad..pretty common to see in hdb parking lots. Well...wheel of life of mine changed...from bottom rose to the top and then went down to the bottom. No more like a high flyer in the past...now more like ordinary people...no more ambitious...no more rat race...just plain down to earth kind of guy. Nissan march was in JB..had it scrapped...now no more car. Just let the bus driver and taxi driver become my driver lols.

              Yes, I know what you meant there. I still preferred continental cars too because once you step into the car, the noises outside subsided. Continental cars are usually designed with high performance and proficiency. When you travel at high speed the car doesn't wobble and you also feel as though the car is travelling below 100 kmph though you are driving at 180 to 200 or above kmph. I like cars that is rear wheel drive then front wheel drives because you have better control of the car. Its pushing the car forward and the engine power doesn't control the front wheels unlike most Japanese and Korean cars...its front wheel drive and the engine power is controlling the front wheel as it pull your car forward while you try to control the steering wheel....quite unpredictable when the road conditions changes.

              Continental sturdy chassis,better handling cause heavy and mostly rely on turbo or supercharge thats why its powerful.Quality is top notch and sound insulation is way better but parts and maintenance a big headache.My bro VW Golf got dsg problem and would take a few days to troubleshoot.
              Japanese engines are known for their robust and reliability.Chassis is mostly super light thus the save on fuel for most model especially Toyota and Honda.But safety wise can be a bit of compromise here cause of its weight shedding style.Parts and maintenance depend on brand and models..But nowadays even Toyota got many problems
              Koreans,rising n rising but engine still lack refinement behind the Japs nevermind its powerful outputs.Design is way better than Japs or Malaysian with generous stuffs and affordable pricing.But as it aging can see those unrefine engine what its meant then and have to do a top servicing regularly to maintain top notch.But overall still the best money can buy.
              Malaysian cars generally have improved over the years except for the few hiccups that can be avoided.Avoid using 3rd party spare parts and youre safe.Not all workshops are trained to repair engines like Campro by Proton which is a co develop between Proton and Lotus.Ride n handling also surprisingly much better than Jap cars for certain models.Problem lies with their dishonest vendors which supply reject parts.Another thing they should improve to reduce lagging with their drive by wire system that reduce the acceleration.Advantage ton of vheap parts at neighbour country.
              China for the time being i will avoid at any cost.The only i can trust is Quros which is co develop with European engineers and certain Chery models

                              <p>Continental sturdy chassis,better handling cause heavy and
              mostly rely on turbo or supercharge thats why its powerful.Quality
              is top notch and sound insulation is way better but parts and
              maintenance a big headache.My bro VW Golf got dsg problem and would
              take a few days to troubleshoot.<br>
              Japanese engines are known for their robust and reliability.Chassis
              is mostly super light thus the save on fuel for most model
              especially Toyota and Honda.But safety wise can be a bit of
              compromise here cause of its weight shedding style.Parts and
              maintenance depend on brand and models..But nowadays even Toyota
              got many problems<br>
              Koreans,rising n rising but engine still lack refinement behind the
              Japs nevermind its powerful outputs.Design is way better than Japs
              or Malaysian with generous stuffs and affordable pricing.But as it
              aging can see those unrefine engine what its meant then and have to
              do a top servicing regularly to maintain top notch.But overall
              still the best money can buy.<br>
              Malaysian cars generally have improved over the years except for
              the few hiccups that can be avoided.Avoid using 3rd party spare
              parts and youre safe.Not all workshops are trained to repair
              engines like Campro by Proton which is a co develop between Proton
              and Lotus.Ride n handling also surprisingly much better than Jap
              cars for certain models.Problem lies with their dishonest vendors
              which supply reject parts.Another thing they should improve to
              reduce lagging with their drive by wire system that reduce the
              acceleration.Advantage ton of vheap parts at neighbour
              country.<br>
              China for the time being i will avoid at any cost.The only i can
              trust is Quros which is co develop with European engineers and
              certain Chery models</p>

              About Malaysian made car....I had driven WAJA campro many times before at the speed of 120 kmph and I found it to be very stable...not bad. And the Japanese cars that I had owned in the past...Toyota Corona and Toyota Crown were rear wheel drive...late 70s model. Their engine all six cylinders like a truck...easy to maintain and I don't spend so much on maintenance too....good for long distance travel and stable when driven at high speed of 120 kmph or 130 kmph.
