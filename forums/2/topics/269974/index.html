If they choose not to pay the fine, they can turn back.<br><br>Malaysia requires foreign-registered cars entering the country to let in at least 70 per cent of light through the front windscreen, and at least 50 per cent of light through the side windows and rear windscreen.<br><br>Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) has the same standard for the front windscreen and front side windows, but since July 2004, it has allowed Singapore cars to let in just 25 per cent of light through the rear windscreen and side windows.<br><br><strong>INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES</strong><br><br>LTA's spokesman Naleeza Ebrahim said the standard applied here is in line with international practices, such as in Japan and the European Union, and enhances the efficiency of a vehicle's air-conditioning while providing better shielding against harmful ultraviolet rays.<br><br>'We understand that Malaysia may have different requirements for the light transmittance. Owners and drivers of Singapore-registered vehicles are advised to check and comply with the vehicle and road traffic laws of the foreign country that they wish to drive in,' she said.<br><br>The difference in standards caused problems this year, after several Singaporeans reported receiving summons while driving in Malaysia.<br><br>In March, Singaporean LW Sim was even arrested and jailed for a day when he refused to let police in Johor Baru impound his car for further checks.<br><br>Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS) president Bernard Tay said all foreign cars travelling to Malaysia will have to abide by the rule, but 'this stricter ruling will have an impact on Singapore cars going to Malaysia'.<br><br>He added that the AAS conducts pre-trip car inspections for those who want to know if they comply with standards.<br><br>A spokesman for the Malaysian High Commission here said it was concerned that fewer cars may visit Malaysia because of the new rules.<br><br>'We have sent a fax to Putrajaya and are waiting for more information on the issue,' he said.<br><br>After the first crackdown earlier this year, the Malaysian High Commissioner to Singapore Datuk NParameswaran had appealed to the Malaysian authorities not to take 'unilateral action on tinted glass'.<br><br>Last year, it was reported that about 23,500 Singaporeans visit Johor daily and spend RM3.5 million each day.<br><br>Between January and October 2005, about 7.6 million visitors entered Malaysia from Singapore.<br><br>Mr Chan Chang Choy, assistant secretary-general of the Johor Baru Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said the new rules were likely to affect tourists and younger Singaporeans as they prefer tinted windscreens.<br><br>'But older Singaporeans and those who visit Malaysia to do business usually drive untinted cars, so I don't think their numbers will be affected,' he said.<br><br>He said the chamber would write to the transport ministry to review the ruling. Mr Michael Tay, chairman of the Malaysian Chinese Association branch in Bandar Tampoi in Johor, added: 'Singaporeans are generally more law-abiding and Malaysian cars are mostly summoned for the windscreen tint offences.<br><br>'When I visit the border checkpoints every weekend, I see long lines of Singapore cars and they are mostly untinted or slightly tinted.'<br><br>Some car dealers and workshops in Singapore were also taken by surprise by the announcement.<br><br>A spokesman for Kah Motors, the agent for Honda cars, said: 'Our cars come with minimally tinted glass in the front and back, and our customers ask to add layers of solar film to get the required tint levels, or they do it at workshops. We have told our sales personnel to warn customers about the different tint rulings.'<br><br>In Malaysia, some motorists have asked for darker windows even as their authorities tighten the rules.<br><br>Its transport ministry spokesman said a number of Malaysian motorists have complained about the country's windscreen tint standards.<br><br>'Because of global warming, they said they feel that more tinting is needed to make the cars cooler inside,' he said, adding that the police, road transport department and other agencies would meet to discuss such feedback next month.<br><br><strong>INTENSE SUNLIGHT</strong><br><br>Several Malaysian motorists felt that darker windscreen tints should be allowed because of the intense sunlight, especially when driving along highways.<br><br>Malaysian motorist Angeline Bala, 29, said: 'Under the current hot weather, I prefer a darker tint as the car would be cooler and still safe to drive.'<br><br>But another Malaysian motorist, Mr Walter D, 42, felt that the country's windscreen tint standards are fine.<br><br>'The current standards would not make the car too hot. If the car is too dark, it will be unsafe to drive at night and the driver cannot be seen clearly from outside,' he said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>TINTED GLASS: WHAT'S ALLOWED</strong><br><br>MALAYSIA<br><br>Cars have to let in:<br>70% light through front windscreen,<br>50% light through all side windows and rear windscreen<br><br>SINGAPORE<br><br>Cars have to let in:<br><br>70% light through front windscreen,<br>50% light through front side windows,<br>and 25% light for rear windscreen and side windows<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong><br>Will they still drive to M'sia?</strong><br><br>GO to Malaysia and pay RM300 fine each time?<br><br>No way, said the majority of 50 car owners who have tinted windows.<br><br>Most of them acknowledge they have to follow the rules when driving in a foreign country.<br><br>But some find the ruling unfair and feel that it will eventually discourage Singaporeans from visiting Malaysia.<br><br>But for now, many say they will take a wait-and-see approach.<br><br>Here are some of their views.<br><br>If I need to change my car's window film in order to drive to Malaysia, I would rather not.<br>- Mr Ben Ang, 29, a system administrator<br><br>The food and shopping there is cheap, but it may not be worth the trouble.<br>- Mr Alwin Liaw, 28, a software engineer<br><br>I will go by public transport, if neccessary.<br>- Mrs Lew Swee Wah, 62, a clerk<br><br>If it's for business on a regular basis, then I'll have to re-tint my car.
