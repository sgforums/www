            <div class='col-md body'>Here's some qns for you to ponder about...<br><br>1. Are you eager to get your license?<br><br>If yes...<br><br>2. Are you willing to spend much more money for your practicals?<br><br>If yes... Go for school..<br>If no... try taking private.<br><br>For me, i took school after i passed my basic theory because i'm eager to get my license. I enrolled in December and finished in March, thats about four months. To me, i prefer taking school because everything is fast but just alittle costly. But comparing the time you need to wait for private... i think it will come roughly the same but just slightly cheaper if taking private. I'm not sure though, i heard someone actually offering very cheap practicals out there.<br><br>Anyway. If you are living in the west side, take BBDC. Honda VTi if i'm not wrong and regarding about AT or MT, i would advise taking MT instead. AT is a waste of time. You can check out the rates at the various driving center website, or go down personally and enquire, that way you can get a better explaination of how everything is really calculated.<br><br>If you haven't taken any theory test at all. Schools provides lessons and alot of revisions and tips to help you pass both your basic and advanced theory. I even heard that some school provides driving simulation also, there weren't any during my time. School is pretty much organized. Of course, its a price you have to pay.<br><br>Hope this helps..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with Brian. But there's another pros and cons. If you are taking the school, cost will be high depending on whether you can afford.<br><br>If you want lower cost, you can consder taking private. No matter what, you will still get your driving license. It's only a matter of time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can take your basic theory the time you turn 18. Upon passing your basic, you can start to apply for a PDL or Provisional Driver's License so as to allow you to drive on the road while you're learning. This PDL lasts you 6 months at a stretch. You can start to apply the practicals upon passing your basic and getting your PDL. But of course, up to the time of your practical test, you must have passed your advance theory then.<br><br>School is definitely moer expensive but faster. Say should you fail your first practical test, you can book for another test date at a faster time as compared to private. Also, private instructors tend to be F### up as encountered with my previous instructor. If you are those type easy going and not too sensitive type, source for a good private driving instructor. Saves money. But it doesnt matter lar actually, you heck what that instructor say, sometimes i feel they wanna make you retake so you have to go to them for extra lessons, which means more income for them. All you have to remember when you start learning driving is, master your half clutch technique(you will know what im toking about once you start learning) ang a smooth transmission when changing gears, such that it doesnt jerk too much. Dont care if the instructor keep scolding you or not, dun be afraid. If you feel confident when you drive on the road, rely on that as an affirmation upon nearing your practical test.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(a) If you take school, here's the sequence you have to go through<br><br>1. 4 Basic Theory lessons. (BTT)<br><br>1st lesson teaches you whats in the book, giving you tips and reminders and what sure come out for test and stuffs. the next 3 lesson will be your revision time where you will do alot of papers/booklets similar to the actual test to get you prepared.<br><br>After you completed the required lessons, you have to undergo a trial test and you have to pass that inorder to book your basic theory test. If fail, you have to take this trial test again.<br><br>After you pass your basic theory, you can apply for your PDL, which is required for practical lessons, mostly when driving on the road. You have to pay for the PDL.<br><br>2. 4 Advanced Theory Lessons. (FTT)<br><br>Same as above. It is adviseable to take some of your practical lessons before you take your test as if gives a clearer view. Esp. for the clutchy thingy. Note... you can start your practical lessons as soon as you get your PDL while taking your FTT lessons.<br><br>3. Practical Driving<br><br>Basically, 2 modules... circuit and road. School requires you to take as least 20 lessons for all i think.<br><br>hope this helps!<br><br>btw.. wtf... learning AT are more expensive?? omg...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MeTaEffeCt:</div><div class="quote_body">Erm.. i went through the flash intro on class 3 thingy.<br><br>(a) So.. how many basic theory lessons.. should there be ?<br>(b) What are they teaching.. where are they teaching (if private)<br>(c) What is the evaluation test for basic/advanced ?

That's why it is not advisable to pay so much money to take AT when you can learn it in a day.<br><br>For private.. theories is all on your own.
