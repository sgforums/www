CDF, GHI and JKL said they, too, will follow suit...<br><br>It happened again on Monday. Within hours of each other, the four petrol companies in Singapore - First Shell, then Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC), ExxonMobil and lastly Chevron - each revised its prices.<br><br>The retail price of petrol and diesel rose by 10 cents.<br><br>Coincidence? Not when it happens almost every time there is a price adjustment.<br><br>What is it then?<br><br>Petrol companies have in the past weathered accusations of price-fixing. Nothing new there. But, with the Competition Act in full swing now, should there be a re-look at the petrol companies' pricing behaviour?<br><br>Price-fixing is not allowed under the Competition Act, which kicked in last year. And recently, the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) scrapped its fee guidelines - which set the range of prices that doctors could charge.<br><br>The SMA was concerned that the guidelines - first introduced 20 years ago to prevent overcharging - might be construed as a form of price-fixing.<br><br>Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) chief Lam Chuan Leong told the press that guidelines 'stifle market forces and harm consumers by reducing choice'.<br><br>Well, should CCS then look into petrol prices, which are almost the same across the board and can seem to move in unison?<br><br>ALARM BELLS<br><br>To the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case), the recent price adjustment has set off alarm bells.<br><br>Executive director Seah Seng Choon said that Case planned to write to the CCS.<br><br>Mr Seah said: 'We have made representations to the CCS before in previous price adjustments, and the CCS has felt that the petrol companies did not collude and individually made their own decisions.<br><br>'We don't buy that.'<br><br>Noting how the most recent hikes came all on the same day, he said he was concerned that this indicated an 'anti-competitive environment, with petrol prices being about the same'.<br><br>But when The New Paper contacted the CCS, its response on petrol pricing was terse.<br><br>NO CARTEL<br><br>First, there are markets in which we simply should not expect prices to vary widely from seller to seller: That is, as with petrol, where the products offered by various sellers are extremely similar.<br><br>'Undifferentiated products would tend to have similar market-clearing prices,' a CCS spokesman said.<br><br>Second, on same-day price adjustments, 'a seeming co-relation in the movement of prices does not prove the existence of a cartel'.<br><br>A cartel, the CCS spokesman said, is where 'businesses come together to fix or co-ordinate prices to support a price level'.<br><br>Such price-fixing would lead to intervention by the CCS.<br><br>And this is why fee guidelines - in keeping individual doctors from setting their own prices - 'harm competition, and are detrimental to consumer welfare'.<br><br>Even Mr Seah of Case acknowledges that 'we have no evidence' of collusion in the petrol market.<br><br>Indeed, there have been cases in which an oil company raises its price, only to retract it after its competitors did not follow suit.<br><br>'This has happened at least twice with ExxonMobil,' said oil industry consultant Ong Eng Tong.<br><br>ExxonMobil is the market leader, with 74 Esso and Mobil stations.<br><br>When contacted, industry observers and players pointed to other reasons for the lack of price competition.<br><br>First, Singapore is a small market and the costs for each chain is about the same, noted Mr Ng Weng Hoong, editor of energy news website EnergyAsia.com.<br><br>PRICE VARIATIONS<br><br>This is unlike in bigger markets, where land costs, for instance, might be different from area to area, and so lead to price variations.<br><br>Also, Mr Ong said that the petrol companies here depend on each other for supply.<br><br><strong>SPC does not even have its own gasoline depot, he noted, and relies on Chevron, which owns the Caltex chain.</strong><br><br>In Mr Ng's graphic terms: 'There is no incentive for anyone to slice anyone else's throat.'<br><br>But what about the way in which prices generally move in step?<br><br>Well, it could be argued that, as ExxonMobil communications manager Eva Ho put it, 'it was precisely because of competition and market forces that prices move the way they do'.<br><br>Take the case of a few provision shops, near each other, selling the same product, say a soft drink.<br><br>If costs went up, any one shop would be reluctant to raise prices, since customers might abandon it for its competitors.<br><br>But if one shop did raise its price, the others are likely to feel safe in following suit.<br><br>The recent petrol price hike comes on the back of higher global oil prices.<br><br>Shell, which has 67 stations, also characterised the petrol market as 'a highly competitive market'.<br><br>Ms Mavis Kuek, its general manager for external affairs &amp; communications, said that 'decisions to adjust retail pump prices have always been in response to market conditions such as movements in internationally-traded finished product prices'.<br><br>DISCOUNTS<br><br>At the retail level, competition comes more in the form of discounts and loyalty programmes, though Mr Ong noted that this meant the actual cost to the consumer was 'not transparent'.<br><br>A spokesman for SPC, which has 39 stations here, said its pump prices were adjusted 'from time to time to reflect prevailing market conditions'.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright Â© 2005 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
