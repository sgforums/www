It had a profit of 37.36 billion yen the previous year.<br><br>Mitsubishi Motors' net automotive debt stood at around 726 billion yen six months ago, while total interest-bearing debt was 1.141 trillion yen.<br><br>"This could be the end for Mitsubishi if nobody else injects fresh capital," said one industry source.<br><br>DaimlerChrysler bought the stake in Mitsubishi over three years ago with a view to expanding in Asia, and the decision to cut its losses will intensify pressure on Schrempp, who faced calls to resign at the annual shareholder meeting on April 7.<br><br>David Healy, an auto industry analyst with U.S-based Burnham Securities, said that in "pulling the plug" on Mitsubishi it looked as if group board members had "finally rebelled against Schrempp's pouring money down that financial black hole."<br><br>Schrempp, who has presided over the loss of some 37 billion euros in market capitalisation since Daimler merged with Chrysler in 1998, will provide further details of the strategic U-turn in a teleconference at around 0900 GMT on Friday.<br><br>Unwinding the Mitsubishi investment will also have significant repercussions for Chrysler, the group's other problem child. Chrysler and Mitsubishi have established close production ties in a bid to cut costs.<br><br>The major unanswered question, Burnham's Healy said, was whether DaimlerChrysler had made alternate plans for new cars that Chrysler and Mitsubish were due to develop jointly.<br><br>"It really depends on whether Mitsubishi Motors survives in its present form without the financial backing of its largest shareholder. The Chrysler Group and Mitsubishi have been co-developing new platforms and that's a very important part of the small and intermediate passenger car programme for Chrysler."<br><br>Chrysler spokesmen were not available for comment.<br><br>Shares in Mitsubishi Heavy, which owns 14.8 percent of Mitsubishi Motors, were down four percent in early morning trade. Mitsubishi Corp was down 4.8 percent and Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group was down 0.98 percent.<br><br>Tokyo's main Nikkei average was up 0.77 percent.<br><br>(Additional reporting by David Crossland in Berlin, Tom Brown in Detroit) ($1=.8424 Euro)<br><br>($1=109.58 Yen)</div>
