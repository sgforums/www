              <p>Go through 2nd Link ?</p>
              <p>It is just as bad, but cannot be worst, except that the finger printing is not done at the Passport Counter, but at another forward stop that require all passengers to get out, walk to a GS field foldable table, where only two lap tops are linked to two infra-red thumb scanners.</p>
              <p>They were smart enough to have two tables - one on each side of each traffic lane.</p>
              <p>At least the ICA officials attempted to be resourceful to clear the traffic log jam by directing traffic into the lorry clearing bays at the Woodlands checkpoint.Tthe trucks leaving Singapore are re-routed through the old ICQ - by-passing the new block and rejoining into the Causeway flow from another side entrance.</p>
              <p>It is the return from Malaysia that is a total disaster, with the passport checks as stringent as when you are leaving - some Malaysian cars with two passengers can take up to 6 minutes to clear. </p>
              <p>The Customs checks by the older, more senior and fatter personnels being petty and meticulous in checking each car for at least 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
              <p>It now seems that the Malaysian ICQ is more efficient, with their end of the Causeway and Second-Link being empty most of the week.</p>

              <p>Unbiasedly and speaking from the bottom of my heart,</p>
              <p>I would say that based on the evidence that there is perenial traffic congestion and air pollution at the causeway, I Urge the government to implement ERP at the causeway.</p>
              <p>Since it is not yet implemented,</p>
              <p>I like to ask them :</p>
              <p>1. Why not implemented? It is implemented elsewhere in singapore where there is heavy congestion. Just give a brief answer but convincing and clear one.</p>
              <p>2. Would ERP not work to Reduce Traffic Congestion at the causeway? 2 things here:</p>
              <p>   a) Why is it said to work elsewhere in singapore?</p>
              <p>   b) Why is it said that ERP is implemented also to reduce Cost to the Environment (this case, air pollution) ? There is plenty of air pollution at the causeway. I been there sometime ago when on holiday in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Again, just give a brief but clear answer will do. Am not asking much. I am sure they do not have any problem giving a sound reply.</p>

              <p>1. What is the difference between the 2 pics?</p>
              <p>2. Do you think ERP  if implemented at Woodlands causeway WILL ABSOLUTELY not Reduce the traffic congestion problem there ?</p>
              <p>3. ERP at Woodlands will not lead to higher utilization of the 2nd Link? How will this affect the investment made? The money spent on 2nd link?</p>
              <p>4. Is ERP effective or not? If so, why not implement at causeways?</p>

              <p>a little known fact is that there is a small but growing group of singaporeans living in JB now. these are mainly malay retirees and also the `neglected' group of singaporeans (age 40 and above, blue collar worker) of all creed who finds it intimidating to live here. these group of people include commercial drivers, taxi drivers and factory supervisors, etc.</p>
              <p>i found this out from one of my taxi rides when the driver told me about it. he is one of them and he told me there are probably thousands like him. his experience is with his $2k/mth odd salary, he cannot afford to keep a roof under his head. what he and many others have done is rent or buy a house in JB, rent out out their HDB and commute to singapore for work. his living expenses is much more manageable, and with the rental proceeds he gets, another $1-2k for the rent, life is actually pretty good there. the problem is the commuting back and fro. the risk of crime, robbery? it is something they are willing to take. in any case, they are not filthy rich there. but to have their life back, get some savings done and not coop up in a 100m sq apartment is a real treat for them, who otherwise will live miseably and have to go to CDC (whom some forumers here so strongly advocate) for help.</p>
              <p>relating it back to this topic, that is partially why the causeway is perpetually jam, exacebated by the inefficiency of the custom officials here.</p>

              <p>You really think Singapore is that damn safe. Wake up, go travel around the world. Milliosn of people live in countries that are so-called "unsafe" compared to utopian singapore. Yet they survive day to day; they take steps and are aware of dangers around their homes.</p>
              <p>Do not blame the country if you think its not safe when you hapen to be mugged or robbed or in any other way criminally victimised. Blame yourself first for not being aware.</p>
