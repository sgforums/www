              <h1 class="clr">Bespoke Gemballa Porsches tempt Asia's car-mad elite</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Aug 1 - If you thought it would be difficult to improve on a Porsche, think again.</p>
              <p>German
              firm Gemballa is reaching out to Southeast Asia's wealthy elite with
              upgraded Porsche models that aim to take the marque to a new level of
              luxury and performance -- if you're willing to pay a premium of about
              400,000 euros on top of your car's already hefty price tag.</p>
              <p>At a
              glitzy launch in Singapore on Thursday, scores of the island's
              multitude of millionaires flocked to see two of Gemballa's Porsche
              models, the 650-horsepower Avalanche GTR-650 EVO and the GT 380.</p>
              <p>The
              bright-orange GTR, with aggressive front and rear spoilers and menacing
              black wheels, costs about S$1 million in Singapore, one of the most
              expensive places on the planet to buy exotic cars. It is based on the
              996 turbo.</p>
              <p>The GT 380, based on a 911 Carrera S coupe, costs
              about half this amount but both had potential customers clambering for
              a closer look as they sipped champagne.</p>
              <p>Asked if his company was
              making better Porsches, company founder Uwe Gemballa told Reuters: "You
              can't say so. Porsche is already a good car. They could do what we do.
              But we are more flexible, we concentrate on a small niche group of
              customers."</p>
              <p>"I won't say we make it better, we make it
              different," he said during the launch at Singapore's National Museum
              where dozens of Ferraris, Porsches and Lamborghinis were parked out
              front in an impromptu auto-show for passersby.</p>
              <p>Local company
              Exquisite Marques is handling the Gemballa brand in Singapore and
              customers can arrange to have their Porsches kitted out to various
              Gemballa specs locally or order a bespoke Gemballa from Germany.</p>
              <p>Exquisite
              Marques said it has set a target to sell a dozen Gemballas in Singapore
              over the next year, despite the tiny city state's high automobile taxes
              and limited driving space.</p>
              <p>Gemballa said South Korea was Asia's
              top market for the brand at the moment, selling about a dozen cars, but
              he expects the brand to do well in China, home to a growing class of
              newly rich, after just starting business there.</p>
              <p>He said the key to the Gemballa brand was customers being able to make each car individual.</p>
              <p>"You
              can do a 100,000 euro modification up to 400,000 euro modification," he
              said, explaining changes can range from total engine rebuilds, new
              interiors, to suspension and body kits.</p>
              <p>"We have always tried to
              convince customers to have a round package -- front spoilers, rear
              spoilers, side-skirts, bonnet, wheels, exhaust, so the car is really a
              Gemballa car, not a mixture of accessories," he added.</p>
