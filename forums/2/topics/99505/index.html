            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion depends on why u wanted a car in the first place? Hmm... is it a need or a want? Examples:<br><br>Need: Shuttling a few young kids around everyday; Handicapped / Sick family member who needs private transport; Work in the sales line; Business need; Celebrity who must have privacy; etc<br><br>Want: Just dun want to take public transport; To show-off; etc<br><br>If it's a REAL need, then the recent COE prices can be found at: http://www.aas.com.sg/coe/coe4.htm. Happy referring to them and hope u'll get ur private transport soon.<br><br>If it's a want, then pls note that a car is a pure expense. The expense is high because of the fact that Singapore is small and has limited space. It drains off our cash for life... Hmm... (I did a simple calculation before and was shocked to realise that having a car all the way to retirement would lower my retirement funds by $500,000 to more than $1 million. Omg!!!!!!!!! The little comfort derived from having a car certainly is not enough for me to give up so much $$$.) Taking public transport most of the time and cab when urgent seem a much better deal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

It's cheaper to take public transport and the occasional cab, right so that's what I will do.  It's been 5 months and I can't stand not having a car anymore and currently eyeing the picanto.  Yes, I am going to pay for it myself.<br><br>From a "want" point of view: Why would one buy a car?<br><br>1. The freedom to roam anytime anywhere.  Public transport is a pain when it comes to late night suppers with friends.<br><br>2. The value of one's time.  For example, I have a friend who works at least 1.5 hours away by public transport.  so that's 3 hours a day on the road.  Not to mention the aggravation of spending so much on the bus / MRT each day.  Cab?  It costs him about $20 one way.  So that's more $800 a mth.  Not exactly a cheaper alternative.<br><br>3.  There are also shallower reasons like for skirt chasing etc.  (Hey, women go for cars, men go for T&amp;A, both genders are as shallower as the other if you ask me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>So I would not say owning a car is a "little comfort" for me (and I suspect for a lot of people).<br><br>My point is that IF you are financially comfortable enough to buy a car, there are a lot of reasons to go for it.  Like most things in life, there is always a trade off. Of course, anyone is considering skipping lunch for 10 years to be able to own a car needs seek help right now.</div>

Perhaps for females who're fortunately surrounded by reliable drivers such as daddy or boyfren wun find driving that important as a main mode of transport. Want late supper? There's bound to be someone with a car around me. Lucky?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>(I also admit to being ultimately lousy at directions &amp; driving skills, real lack of talent in this area. The risks of putting mine &amp; others' lives in danger have to be considered too!!! haha....)<br><br>Well, the decision for me is that a car is out if it significantly deprives me of other enjoyments in life. A rough guideline is that transport costs gotto stay within 10% of my income level. (Eg. Will spend $1,200/mth on a car only when my pay reaches $12,000/mth.) In fact, this goal can be really motivating sometimes. Hee... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
