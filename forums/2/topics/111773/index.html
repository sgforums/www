You have to ask BM's SE for the advise and how much. The good thing is, on that day of car collection, just drive there and change car. Got a friend who did that, but his car less than 10 year old, so you need to check with BM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually to be honest, had a family discussion regarding this. My dad heard from his ex classmates that the government will be discussing and maybe announcing additional tax cuts for new cars after Chinese New Year, so I guess we might adopt a wait and see attitude becos the new car will be meant as our family's second car.<br><br>Since the COE for our march expires in June 2005, so might wait till after the Lunar New Year before we decide to 'give it' to BM.<br><br>ANy comments on this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One-to-one car exchange is only true on the day of delivery, if the car is scraped through 3rd party dealer, with the dealer also settle the outstanding loan amt of the old car, and redeem the logcard... But will suffer 2% PARF as commision to the 3rd party dealer.<br><br>If already loan settled by the owner himself, then it's 7 days required to hand over the old car for scrap , and use the PARF rebate to offset part of new car price during registration, to new car collection.<br>Here you pay no commission for the whole process, just 7 days waiting time...<br><br>During this weekend, understanding from the car dealer showrooms that more people book CATB car<br>Likely for next bid, CATA COE will continue to drop, while CATB rises, cos more people book big car due to 14K CATB coe.<br><br>Few mths back, the relevant minister said it's govt direction to continue lower car ownership cost gradually.<br>During Govt finance budget which will take place in Feb at Parliment, possible ARF will further be cut, to reduce car cost.<br>Can happen with election coming this year.<br><br>So...good time to book vios is end Feb / early March...<br><br>Current average CATA 2500plus COE for each bid round  lasts from Oct 2004 to Mar 2005.<br>If look at LTA statistic, year 2004 shows record number of car scrap when compared to previous years.

My SE wasn't that generous, but she managed to get my car in a mth's time. And some of the people I know who booked from BM much earlier than me didn't even get to smell anything from their SE about their new rides. My friend's SE was much friendlier, and had much rebates and freebies thrown in. So it is really the luck of the draw.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I am planning to get a Vios in a couple of months... you mind recommending ur SE to me?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by owak:</div><div class="quote_body">I will be collecting my new vios next week.<br>So I can tell you from my experience...<br><br>First, most importantly, MUST get a good, recommended Sales Engineer.<br>I have seen a number of those arrogrant, senior SE from Ubi Showroom.<br>I got my SE recommended from someone, and luckily I am recommended one good SE from Leng Kee..<br><br>You cannot use the PARF of 10K as downpayment, since in this case it's car scrap due for 10 years. But you can use it to offset part of ur new car price.<br>Downpayment for vios is $6300<br><br>Depending on ur intended loan amount &amp; loan period from HSBC, your SE normally provides you some cash rebate, in range of $300 to $400.<br>Dont book if ur SE claims there is no such thing as cash rebate, and claims that their commission is low..<br>SE earns  commission too from HSBC car loan and AIG insurance.<br><br>To be entitled to HSBC rebates of $1500 from car price, need to loan minimum 20K with loan period 1 year. But if you go for minimum loan amt and loan period, then likely wont get much for the cash rebate.<br><br>Currently HSBC has the 12mth interest rate rebate loan package until 31 jan,<br>Where it's minimum 7 years loan, with minimum 70% loan of car price.<br>Then only pay for total 6 years amount of interest over 7 year period.<br>Effectively it's 1.89% rate over 7 years. But this requires loan lock-in period of 2 years.  If break the loan agreement within  2 years, not only there is the standard rule of 78 penalty, also additional interest penalty.<br>So it's better off to take normal loan at 2.2 %, with lock-in period 1 year.<br><br>Talk to your friend who bought Toyota, very important to get a good Sales Engineer first.</div></blockquote></div>
