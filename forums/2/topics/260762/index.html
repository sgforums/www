            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bros and sisters..<br><br>Need advise again.. Today, b4 noon, i received a call from my mum telling me that the car has some whining and vibration when she drives off from a standstill position and i arranged with mazda motor to get a tow truck to pick my car up (worried that it is unsafe to drive).<br><br>The tow truck arrived at about 5pm this evening and 3 incidents occured which really made me unhappy..<br><br>1. the car jack was stuck at my side skirts while jacking the car up..<br>- he had to ask his colleague for assistance (who came at 6.30)<br><br>2. my mum heard a crack sound from the front of the car (bumper cracked)<br><br>3.  my exhaust pipes were ON the ground when the car was lifted up..<br><br>fortunately, my neighbour came home at that point of time and saw incident #3 and told my mum.<br><br>i wish to write a complain to mazda motor so that they can do something about #2 and #1.<br><br>or is there any advise that you guys can give?<br><br>my aunt, who is a lawyer said that the tow truck company is liable for the damage.<br><br>thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mazda ain't gonna do much about... they might only refer the matter to the towing company, which i believe yes, they are liable for the towing damages.<br><br>From your description, it seems that your mazda has a bodykit or lowered suspension? stock cars usually have high enough clearance to accomodate the tow thingys... as for the exhaust, was the car lifted way high up? Perhaps in the future, if you have concerns about damage to the car while towing, you might wanna ask for a flatbed tow truck instead.</div>
