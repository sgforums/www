            <div class='col-md body'>1. To the Silver Subaru 1.6TS(M) driver who tailed me at the traffic light towards Loyang (aft the traffic junction of Downtown east).<br><br>I dunno wad you see in my humble Corolla, i have no spoilers no fancy-ful head lamps i dun have a fog lamp, YET you still want to tail me ... even when i want to pass the T light because i am afraid it might go red as it was green quite sometime, you still want to tail me ... i was afraid to step on my brake because you were too near my back, i could see your Face and your hairs in my rear view mirror. What are you trying to convey to me? driving at my speed limit irritates you? why din't you jio the white corona on my left instead?<br><br>I turn off my lights and stick to your butt after sometime not because my hipporolla cannot catch up with you, i did it just to see whether you check your rear mirror. Hope the same treatment i did to you knock some sense into you, is kinda pain in the ass to be tailgated ... i could have blasted my head light when you least notice and make you buang, but i realised that there is always something called retributions ... You are lucky that there were no other cars on the road after the White Corona passed us, i can afford to switch off completely any lights that is emmiting out of my car ...<br><br>After sometime before the mall right before the exit to Tampines/Loyang, why did you turn on your hazard lights? Issit you saw me too near to your rear bumper and decide to tell yourself that Tailgating causes Stress? I have seriously no Qualms to Ram you from the rear if you do a suddent brakes ... Or you wanted to make friends with me? Before you pulled over at the bus stop, i remember seeing you looking into my car, i waved at you to tell you Thank you for going so fast as i saw a TP bike infront on the opposite direction.<br><br>I am a very safe driver who follows the speed limits every where i go, please do not make me show the bad side of me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>OR maybe i should have jammed my brakes instead at the Traffic lights we first met so i can claim a big amount of $$$ judging by the distance apart from our car and the speed we are travelling? That should save you 6 points 2 weeks from now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>2. To the RAV4 Driver i met at Buangkok at the IMH hospital towards Sengkang.<br><br>Thank you for showing me how much my car can perform, we played dragged clean and proper, i salute you. your car is a much powerful car but i was itchy for a drag, and part of the reason is to take a look at your HU in the car which was really Cool! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  This i admit i am in the wrong but you played along. Maybe we can meet up sometime then you can tell me where you get your HU ah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>(All this happened today between 12-2am)<br><br></div>

But why can't we stick to the international practice of driving on the left hand side (for left-hand drive) unless over-taking? Such that whoever is faster will be able to overtake on the right and then get to the front of the queue, in this way, the slower cars will never block the faster ones, such a healthy practice can prevent a lot of conflicts and accidents. Let us learn from our counterparts in Australia. Over there, no matter how fast one is driving, he/she will let a faster car pass. Of cos there will always be some black sheeps over there too, but sad to say, the black sheeps are a majority in S'pore. I'm not trying to promote speeding but adopting a better driving mentality.<br><br>Of cos for john cooper's case, 70kmh wld probably take him to the next traffic light in no time so the person has no reason to actually make such a demand.

I mean, if he needs to speed for whatever reasons, let him go by ! I don't see what's so hard about it ! Even driving on the malaysian highway is less stressful then driving in Singapore. I admit that sometimes i do travel alittle fast on roads but I have my reasons and i just hate it when someone doesn't give you way esp on the highways ! The right lane is only for overtaking. Hate to have to pull out some F1 stunt to overtake a road hogger ! If a traffic police stops me then it's just my luck !<br><br></div>

When you think of braking u afraid of him banging your back, and cause unecessary trouble, then when you want to speed up, you are afraid it will go amber then quickly red, and then followed by a flash ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
