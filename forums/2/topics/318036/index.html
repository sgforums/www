              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I am having a rather bad dilemma i think think sgforums would offer a more unbiased comments for this two cars then the other forums so which would your suggest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Civic 2.0M SI = $77000</strong></p>
              <p>:Mirrors electronic fold and signal</p>
              <p>: Alot Lighter in chassis and smoother engines</p>
              <p>but no bodykit</p>
              <p><strong>Lancer EX 2.0M GT = $76988</strong></p>
              <p>: keyless entry</p>
              <p>: Rockford sound system</p>
              <p>: Bodykit all in</p>
              <p>but body too heavy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have went to test drive both cars out both have their own plus points, please anyone which would you think is a better choice.</p>

              <p>U would have to give more information than that for us to give u constructive comments. Tha said tho, I would also plumb for the Civic. Space, FC, handling, pace all should be better than in the Lancer.</p>
              <p>There would be more toys like keyless entry and a better sound system, as well as autolights for the Lancer. But as I said, only you would have a better idea of what you look for in a car, so for us to make objective comments, more information would be needed.</p>

              <p>Why should i put myself as target practice?As you say here,this is the forum where anybody can pose their own views...so what if i view the Civic as boring?Its my frank view..comeon.. the 1.6,1.8 and 2.0 Civic all has the same bodykit and such and even if u have a stock 2.0 u look no different from a 1.6.</p>
              <p><br>As i said already,the Civic is much more common even when compared to the whole range of EX-es available on the road now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In real life,i will also say the same thing..yes i respect the known VTEC technology of Honda,but so what if i say the current gen is boring?Its my view and its that way.</p>

              <p><br>Anyway,it wasent u that stated the uncomfortable ride..u said that u <em>feeled </em>the dangerous-ness of a RWD car with a turbocharged engine and the underlying problems...im sure this already at least dented the ego of the owners beccause the peformance was slightly criticised..performance is not only about the engine but also about the handling...as with track use,track day cornering etc etc</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I am having a rather bad dilemma i think think sgforums would offer a more unbiased comments for this two cars then the other forums so which would your suggest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Civic 2.0M SI = $77000</strong></p>
              <p>:Mirrors electronic fold and signal</p>
              <p>: Alot Lighter in chassis and smoother engines</p>
              <p>but no bodykit</p>
              <p><strong>Lancer EX 2.0M GT = $76988</strong></p>
              <p>: keyless entry</p>
              <p>: Rockford sound system</p>
              <p>: Bodykit all in</p>
              <p>but body too heavy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have went to test drive both cars out both have their own plus points, please anyone which would you think is a better choice.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I am currently driving a 2.0L Civic Si manual. It's been a year plus now since, never encountered any problems whatsoever. In my opinion, mind you I'm not being biased or anything but interior wise, the Civic is a lot more spacious and I trust i-Vtec technology. Fuel efficient and comfy. Though most ppl think the Lancer EX is a headturner because it mimics its cousin the EVO X, so the question is what are you looking for in a ride?</p>
              <p>In no way, shape or form am I promoting the Honda Civic but I am an owner and I have test driven the Lancer EX. So, giving you an insight from an owner's perspective, I would still choose the Civic. But that's just me. I hope no matter the choice you make, you will be satisfied with your ride. Try narrowing down the key points and choose which suits your needs.</p>

              <p>Anyway for this post i have a <em>unbiased</em> comment of the Civic(becoz i saw one modded one the other day).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Civic really look stunning if the front headlight is projector based instead of the common reflector type.It give the car a fiercer look(or to each's perspective)..perhap Honda should formally introduce this for a facelift?</p>

              Dont buy first hand car. Buy Used cars. Its much cheaper. I bought a used nissan sunny car (autodrive) recently lol. Actually its pretty good and the fuel consumption is not that bad. It can be used for another 8 years and after paying a $10000 deposit, i only need to pay a monthly instalment of $290+ per month for 7 years.
                  
                  My elder brother drives a toyota altis and previously, a honda civic. I have also driven his cars quite frequently before. In my opinion, civic &gt; altis &gt; sunny (more stability)but it doesnt really matter as long as its safe and get you to your destination, its good.
                  
                  But i think the lancer is too expensive. My nissan sunny only costs $33500 and will last till may 2016. Fuel consumption: $75 at SPC can use for about 450km. The fuel tank is smaller than the altis.
              
              And there's no point in thinking a lancer just because it looks like an evo. A lancer is a lancer and will never be an evo.

              <p>Unless you're referring to the upcoming '08 Lancer Ralliart,which will be placed between the top of the line Lancer and the Evolution.In fact,so much it shares with the Evolution that it's also using the same engine as the latter,albiet detuned with a slower turbo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree the Lancer will never be an Evo(tho u can make it look like lol),its simply meant to be a fast cruiser in the case of the GT.</p>
