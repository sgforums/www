No, you are not forced to book the weekend package for the weekend. You can book one hour anytime on weekend within 1 month from the booking. If another person wants to make a weekend package booking on the same weekend, then the system will prompt the person to choose another date/package/location. It's all on a first come first serve basis. Too bad so sad... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Availability of car. Usually if you can confirm that you want the car 2 weeks to 1 month in advance, then you would probably have at least 2-3 car to choose from. It is usually the case at the stations around my place: Clementi, B. Batok, Jurong East.<br><br>Do check with them if they have any promotion (waiver of fees, free hours of driving) before you sign up.<br><br>Hope this helps... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
