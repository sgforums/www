If a petrol-powered car can travel 500km on a full tank, can the same car, but electrically powered, travel the same (500km) distance on one full charge? The answer is NO..and this is the main reason why fully-electric cars are still far from reality..<br><br>And once again, I'm repeating myself here..some other forumnites also said before..How is electricity generated? By the burning of fossil fuels! Whether they use CNG, coke or other fossil fuels, power plants burn fuels to generate electricity..so at the end of the day electric cars is LPPL.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And why a lot of people still think petrol-powered car is still the best? Because it is still the most powerful method of powering a car..and even if consumers wanted to buy electric cars or hydrogen-powered cars, it is still a long way before any of these are commercialised because it is not even fully developed yet..so hence the reason why cars are still sticking to petrol currently..<br><br>VW also said before, hydrogen will never replace petrol because turning hydrogen into liquid hydrogen is an expensive, dangerous and power-consuming activity..meaning even if the car's exhaust only emits water vapour, but there is still carbon dioxide generated indirectly when they pump liquid hydrogen because a lot of electricity is needed to convert gaseous hydrogen into liquid hydrogen..so once again, LPPL..<br><br>Even though now there are ways to use natural and renewable energy sources like wind, water and heat energy to generate electricity, but most of the energy used to generate electricity is still coming from fossil fuel..unless we humans find ways to use 100% renewable energy sources to generate electricity, if not all the alternatives to petrol cars are still useless..only ethanol powered cars are the most practical IMHO..and best would be PURE ethanol powered cars..very powerful and the carbon dioxide released will be re-absorbed by the sugar canes..<br><br>So YOU are the self-certified complete ignorant.</div>
