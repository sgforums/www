              <p>This post tells me that this guy talks no sense. Of cos 2.5k can maintain a BMW 740Li lar.. He no need to pay the instalments mah.. Try paying the instalments and you are dead. (Btw, at least 3/4 of your $2,500 can go to car instalments already. So where is the extra money for oil, road tax, insurance and maintenance?)</p>
              <p>In reality, how many people can buy a car with full cash without instalment, or rather have someone (father or mother) pay their instalments?</p>
              <p>I am disgusted by how easy he put it:</p>
              <p>"You don't need to earn so much to own a car. like my youngest brother drive BMW 740 Li to school ,my dad
                                          give him a 2.5k allowance per month enough what ..no need 20k and
                                          above per month to earn a car"</p>

              <p>If you have to think off the additional cost(gas,insurance, maintenance) in owning a car in SG then you really cant afford to own one.</p>
              <p>I just left singapore and attended the Import car show at the exihibition hall that featured all the tuner cars, nice but on a smaller scale than Nort America, having said that, I too asked the same question, how can average Singaporean afford to buy cars that has a almost 300% tax.</p>
              <p>A Honda Fit is selling close to $60, 000 !!!;also most cars on the road have their wheel/tires and suspension upgraded (added cost)</p>
              <p>I bet average combine income has to be at 8 grand for a family to own a house and a car comfortably.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

Start selling your dream or beloved car.. lots of bad things... haiz... Since is a past then treat it like a lesson and learn from it.. Now i am glad that everythings turn good or even better!!!! Commiting a car is not problem with calculation done. (Insurance,Petrol,Parking,Tyres,Servcing,ERP,Rd tax and many more Hidden Cost) Drivers will know.. Easily $1.5k just for a Car) But You Sure You Can Afford it? Everyone need a Saving. Buy a Car when is useful not to hook chick unless you'r RICH..  </p></div>

              <p>This post tells me that this guy talks no sense. Of cos 2.5k can
              maintain a BMW 740Li lar.. He no need to pay the instalments mah..
              Try paying the instalments and you are dead. (Btw, at least 3/4 of
              your $2,500 can go to car instalments already. So where is the
              extra money for oil, road tax, insurance and maintenance?)</p>
              <p>In reality, how many people can buy a car with full cash without
              instalment, or rather have someone (father or mother) pay their
              instalments?</p>
              <p>I am disgusted by how easy he put it:</p>
              <p>"You don't need to earn so much to own a car. like my youngest
              brother drive BMW 740 Li to school ,my dad give him a 2.5k
              allowance per month enough what ..no need 20k and above per month
              to earn a car"</p>
              <p>People like him will never understand.</p>

              <p>its not eating sour grapes or what. Itedino is just trying to say that these people who leech off their parents are not being independent, that's all. And these people do not have to go around showing it off, because afterall, it's their parents' money. Nothing to be proud off. If you are 20 years old and you drive a BMW with your OWN money, then i give it to you.</p>
              <p>Btw, if you all want to play cars (assuming if you have the cash to play cars also implies that you have quite a good job/qualification) , why not migrate overseas to a foreign country? Such as new zealand. i lived there for 3 years and my car, subaru RSK B4 is only 15k, year 2001.</p>
              <p>just my 2 cts worth guys =))))</p>
