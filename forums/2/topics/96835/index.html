            <div class='col-md body'>I am likely to buy a 2nd hand car. Want to know how can I ensure that the car has no problems apart from physical visual examination (I am no mechanic) and test-drive?<br>There was a case recently of a buyer finding out about the rusted (flooded) condition of her 2nd hand car only after buying. How can one avoid such situation?<br>Is it possible or acceptable to have the potential car to be checked by VICOM or some similar organisation before buying?<br>Do they provide such a service and how much does it costs??<br>Anyone able to enlight on any of these issues is appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AA at 2 kung chong road (near leng kee) offers used car evaluation service. member &amp; non-member pays $80 &amp; $120 respectively. Pretty thorough check but there will be no dismantling of parts. mainly to check if there's any major accidents and other major parts condition.<br>Hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Lesporty,<br><br>One word of advice if you are going to AA or VICOM for this kind of inspection: As cyberpug had advised, they mainly check and verify for evidences of major accidents. They cannot spot technical problems (or maybe they can but it's not in their scope to do so) so at the end of the day you may feelt cheated of the $123 that you paid. When I bought my 8yr old ESi 3 years ago, I also had it sent to VICOM for a thorough check. No major accidents though. BUT I went through 2 years of hell with the car before it's time to scrap it last year. My ESi had an overheated engine and a kong cheng Gearbox. The gearbox sound was so obvious that during the test drive I insisted that the sales guy get it fixed before handling it to me. At the end of the day, the gearbox was changed at his cost. But the overheated engine did not give me problem for 3 months and by the time I got my mechanic to check, it's confirmed that it's overheated before and teo siong already. And for the rest of the life span of the ESi I went through hell everytime the temp needle shoot up.... So better not have too high of an expectations from VICOM and AA to spot all these kind of problems for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shell used to give out some booklets on things to look out for in buying a used car. I am not sure if they still have it. Anyway, here's a few pointers:<br><br>a. Handbrake - Without depressing the release button, pull it up and hear the clicking sound. There should not be more than 4 click in the process. Anything more than that indicates the handbrake needs a repair job.<br><br>b. Clutch - Depress clutch fully. If you need lots of strength just to depress it fully or there is some strange noise in depressing it, the clutch system needs repair. With clutch fully depressed, engage 1st gear. Release till 'biting' point. It should be 1/3 of the way or close to 1/2. Anything more than that means the clutch is almost worn out. If engine stall at 1/3 or 1/2 level, it is also another indication. Next, with clutch fully depressed,engage 4th gear. Release gradually and the engine should stall immediately at 1/3 or 1/2. If it does not, the clutch is worn out.<br><br>c. Car Body - Walk around the car. Look from every angle. Is there any misalignment or the body surface uneven? Look especially at the door seam and joint section. Look at front door and rear door. Are they aligned? Open bonnet and look at the welding spot. Non accident car will show factory welding spot(looks like crooked line but identical on both sides). Do the same with boot open and look at both side.<br><br>d. DIY chasis/steering system test- At the wheel fender, btw the gap of tyre and fender, use the number of fingers to measure the distance. Let's say 4 fingers at right side should also gives you 4 fingers distance at left side. If it's not, chasis or steering system has been damaged before or worst chasis damaged.<br><br>e.  Water leakge test - During your test drive, request to go for car wash and during the wash, watch out for any leakage at the doors area. Next open the boot and see if water has entered the boot area.<br><br>f. After test drive, check the area underneath and see if there is any dark oil patch(engine leakage) or greenish/blueish liquid stain(coolant leakage). pen the bonnet and inspect the engine area. Any oil leakge aroud engine block? If there is, engine casket gone or worst engine needs top overhaul. If exhaust emitting dark blueish smoke, another indication of worn engine. Open radiator cap(allow to cool down) and watch for any rust stain present or bubbles. This could spell radiator problem and may lead to overheating.<br><br>The list is endless. Hope above helps.</div>
