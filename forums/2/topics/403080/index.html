              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I realise i have been paying more than i should to my private instructor and he didn't tell me. No wonder he didn't count the money like what he did during early lessons because I am already giving more. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">How i found out?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1.5hour lesson should be 28X1.5 = $42. If i were to practice circuit, i will need to book 2hr from him which is $56. After my 1st circuit lesson, i have been giving him $56 for 1.5 hr lesson also. I realise it when i counted my money which i just withdraw. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Its really disappointing. We chat and laugh, listen to songs. I thought he is good person. He slp during lesson, nvm as i know the road to drive back or so. He didn't teach me somethings i should know for test(that's the risk for learning from private). I accept that. but he cheat and act blur....that's unacceptable. A few times, he slp i almost bang car. he will only scream at you and say immediate fail, horrible, bla bla. He wan to go drop cheque, fine, i stop a while on the way back to yck. Can i complain him? or whatever? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I'm just waiting for my TP and after that i will make sure he got no students no more. This person simply has no heart to teach you, but just looking at your money. He wont teach you everything, he will purposely make you fail, to keep you as his student. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thank you so much for informing us! It is really very valuable although got good recommendation from Hardwarezone forum! I totally agree it should let as many people kown as possible. YOu may ask a name card from him! I guess his surname is Lek. I heard some of my friends talking about him (because same phone number). Initially my friends thought he was good and learned under him since good recommendation from Hardware zone, but after several lessons, they found it was not the truth. and his passing rate is very low (about 20+ only, can check TP police report online, only one person's surname is Lek). I support you to post your experience to sg forums and do not let this kind of PDI cheat people's money!</p></div>

              <p>I think it's better for you to change an instructor no matter whether you need to pay for the third hour. As what I have known so far, the car rental is 120$. You'd better confirm with your this PDI and make sure he doesnt overcharge you again.</p>
