Vios totally out-classed Optra if you are talking about power, handling, efficiency. But Optra looks more classic and is definitely more spacious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thank u all for replies... maybe true, vios is more common on the roads than the optra. its all abt the toyota brand and its ease of getting spare parts... any optra owners would like to comment? reason why i considered optra was partly the price and also that its interior and fittings are "near" corolla like if not more. whereas for the vios it means i have to settle for less space. im not so much for looking for a fast car, just a reasonable family car with good fc and maintenance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>considering that vios is abt $57K now, would it be a good time to get it? cos the se told me that price will increase by $500 by tues...</div>

So to me, space is almost at the last of my list. Plus I am only 1.65m, I can feel comfortable in any car. For my first car, I want to go for a Hatchback. With my budget, I can't go for famous brand like Honda Jazz and Mitsubishi Colt. Anyway, I liked Aveo for its looks. Got a younger feel compared to Vios. Build wise, I don't see much flaws to it. Much cheaper too.<br><br>In the end, my brother super strongly advise me against it. So I settle for a small car, Kelisa. This little fish feels stronger than Aveo, still cheaper and can be easily maintained.<br><br>Anyway, like what <strong>imprezaWRXSTi22B</strong> said, test-drive both, bring your family along. Discuss it through and then make a choice that everyone in the house is happy with.</div>

If you are buying Auto, go for City. It has the best Auto system around at that price. If manual, go for Vios. If comfort, have to decide for your own then.<br><br>Seriously, to be on the save side, Vios is the one. It has the most things packed into a budget car. But you have already test-driven it (I hoped), so you should know which you are more comfortable driving. If it is really so hard to decide, let's just throw the passenger concern out the window first. All the space and boot should be secondary to your driver's feel. Think about yourself, driving the car all the time, most importantly paying for it. The car should be what you want, not what you think your future passengers want.<br><br>Be self-centered, those are your money right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im one step closer... went down to bm today and the se just refuse to give any freebies though i asked for it... its like she say "best price" and there's nothing she can do abt it... im going down again tmr to sign the contract but does anyone have any hints on how to get freebies? by the way, vios comes with an optional 788 package which includes leather seats, "alloy look" dashboard, and a negligible spoiler... but it seems that this package leaves out the fog lamps.. which im more interested in. any advice?</div>

My advice is go back, try another SE. Since the last one didn't want to give you anything, don't have to go back to her. Then you must really be aggressive, show them you are not that eager to buy yet. Must be ready to walk out the moment they said no. Tell them you are still looking at other cars, things like that.<br><br>Didn't Vios already comes with leathers? Why still need package? If I were you, I ask for V-kool.<br><br>Good luck!

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, i have heard too that it is standard practise for them to give freebies! kinda weird you're not getting any. tmr before signing try and ask again maybe they'll give?<br><br>as for the package, you will need to consider if you have that 800 more to spend and if you really want what is in the package. 800 for leather seats + others is quite a bargain imho.<br><br>the choice is still up to you tho! good luck!</div>

How to sell your car the next time? when u add all these so call 'extras' in... you have to pay a hefty premium for it over the VIOS...<br><br>remember honda's volume is low(not in top 3) so its pricing strategy is different from toyota's high volume, low margin...<br></div>
