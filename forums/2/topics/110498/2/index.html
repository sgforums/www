            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some tips:<br><br><strong>Optra Sedan</strong><br>- Heavier than Vios ,contributing to stability at high speed / cornering but slower acceleration<br>- Consumes more fuel than Vios but compare well with other 1.6 sedans<br>- Definitely more spacious than Vios<br>- Quality of material a bit better than Vios . Take note that both are made in Thailand<br>- Availability of parts not clear but seems cheaper. Eg. original fog lamp with installation is $150<br>- Handle humps comfortably, no sweat<br>- Latest version includes optra station wagon<br>- Can bargain for freebies<br><br><strong>Vios</strong><br>- Lighter than Optra. You can feel it when cornering. Acceleration is a bit faster.<br>- Brake more sensitive than Optra<br>- Rear passenger space a bit cramp. At 1.69m, my head is about 4cm from the roof of the car. Squeezing 3 adults may be a problem.<br>- Rear seat cannot be folded to increase storage space or to access the boot compartment<br>- Availability of parts confirmed ok but you must get parts from parallel importers and not BM. Eg. original fog lamp with installation is $280 but parallel importer charged $145<br>- Handle humps at ok level<br>- The 2005 version includes a spoiler<br>- Cannot bargain for freebies<br><br></div>
