So i am thinking that qetting a used MPV will not be as bad as getting a new one.. am i right to say that?<br><br>Basically I am trying to ask what's the pro and con for getting a used car instead of a new one..</div></blockquote>Hi hi.....<br><br>Actually, my knowledge is only as an amateur car buyer.  Its really just common knowledge lah....er.....I'm not liable for any extraordinary losses incurred hor? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Generally its true that Singapore cars depreciate the most in the first 3 years - and least in the last 3 years.  Thus, if you plotted a graph with car value (y axis) vs. time 0-10 years (x axis), you will see a curve concave upwards.  But there are some cases where its not true (mainly due to over-ambitious pricing on the part of the seller), so its best to examine each case individually.<br><br>You may want to check them out by surfing through used car websites like <a href="http://&lt;strong&gt;www.sgcarmart.com&lt;/strong&gt;" rel="nofollow"><strong>www.sgcarmart.com</strong></a> and <a href="http://&lt;strong&gt;www.singaporeusedcars.com&lt;/strong&gt;" rel="nofollow"><strong>www.singaporeusedcars.com</strong></a>.  From there, you will know the resale values of the cars, COE and OMV values....and coupled with the original prices, you can have a rough estimation of the first 2/3-year depreciation.<br><br>Ok, as far as I can think, here goes......<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROS OF BUYING A NEW CAR</span><br><br>- Prices are low now, so future depreciation will be low in terms of cash value.   It may depreciate the same percentage-wise, but since the values are lower now, the same percentage depreciation carries a lower dollar-value loss.<br><br>- Peace of mind because a new car will come with the warranties (many offering 3 years now).  With used cars, you may get some serious defects due to accidents, rough use, etc.  With used cars, you will have to spend some money on repairs (change tyres, servicing, timing belt, etc).  There is a small percentage of new cars which give unsolvable headaches too (eg. alignment, leakages, strange sounds), but you've gotta be quite unlucky to get one of those.<br><br>- There is no expensive transfer fee to pay, unlike when buying used cars.  To see how expensive transfer fees are, you can use your own car example at this website:  <a href="https://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=LTA-OSMC-ETF&amp;isNew=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.psi.gov.sg/NASApp/tmf/TMFServlet?app=LTA-OSMC-ETF&amp;isNew=true</a> (I think it should come up to almost $1k for a 2-year-old Sunny).<br><br>- You can choose the options, colours, etc.  With used cars, this is usually limited.  In fact, there are not many used Wishes in the market - so you may have difficulties.<br><br>- New car distributors are usually much more professional and easier to deal with than used car dealers (this is not always true - just a very general statement).<br><br>- Your sweat will be the first to be absorbed by the seats.  You'll get the fresh new car smell.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROS OF BUYING A USED CAR</span><br><br>- Prices are low now if you buy a 2-3 year car.  This is because the first owner usually takes the most depreciation which occurs in the first 2-3 years of the car's lifespan.<br><br>- Depreciation may be low now because (a) used car prices are forced down by the low new car prices, and (b) cars of 2-3 years of age have high COEs, maybe around $30k.  So you'll be buying a car with high-value COE at a low price.<br><br>- Used car prices are quite negotiable now due to low demand for used cars.  Even rich used car dealers can keep their cars for only 4-6 months max before they start getting into trouble (losing money, legal matters like ownership change on paper, etc).  They don't always have the luxury of playing the waiting game, like we (buyers) do.  In fact, some have already started going bankrupt.....(walk around Ubi Automobile Megamart and you'll know what I mean).<br><br>- When buying a used car of, say, 3 years old.....you can actually estimate the worst-case depreciation quite accurately (worst case depreciation is when you have to scrap it).  Because from the OMV and COE values, you will know that the scrap value is at 5 years.  Thus, worst case depreciation = (buying price of 3 y.o car - scrap value at 5 years) / 2 years.<br><br>- Minor defects may have been already done up by the previous owner (that is, if he did it).<br><br>- The previous owner may have already installed some aftermarket accessories - eg. glass tinting, reverse sensors, rims, leather, aftermarket arm-rests, alarm and other security systems, etc.<br><br>- Waiting time is typically a few days, unlike new cars which can take up to weeks for delivery.<br><br>- You don't have to go through the whole 10,000 km run-in period again.  I hate the run-in period, especially for performance cars....because here you are driving a turbo car at slow speeds, and outside uncles driving schoolbuses are all zooming past you.<br><br>For me hor, when buying cars, the three most important things are:<br><br>(a) I like the car.<br>(b) Condition of the car is good, if its a used car.<br>(c) After the above two are satisfied, then price is important.  A little difference in price to get what I want and what I think is good is OK for me.<br><br>If you're looking for a car which is 2-3 years old, I would recommend that you look for cars with only 1 previous owner.  If there was more than 1 owner in the first 2-3 years, I'd be a bit suspicious.  And try to allow a maximum of 25,000 km per year (anymore than that MAY be considered high usage).  And try to ensure that that car's engine and exhaust systems are not modified.  Most important for auto cars, ensure that the gear is OK (these are VERY expensive parts to repair/replace).<br><br>If you should decide on a new MPV and don't care much about power/acceleration, the Toyota Isis seems quite nice.  I saw one that day, but its only available from the parallel importers (you can't test drive it).  Another good one which I test-drove recently is the new Mazda 5 (you can test drive it at Mazda's MacPherson showroom).  Both should be around $80k now.<br><br>Toyota Isis:  <a href="http://www.toyota.co.jp/jp/tech/new_cars/isis/presentation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toyota.co.jp/jp/tech/new_cars/isis/presentation/index.html</a><br><br>Mazda 5:  <a href="http://www.mazda.com.sg/mazda5/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mazda.com.sg/mazda5/index.html</a><br><br></div>
