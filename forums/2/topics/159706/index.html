I'll try to answer your questions in point form....<br><br>(1) If you SCRAP your car by yourself by driving it to a scrapyard, you will get $38k back...in which case, yes, its a big loss.  You must also remember that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> get the $38k back in cash....its just an electronic record in LTA's computers that they are holding $38k of your money.  The ONLY thing you can do is to buy another new car with it.  Its important to remember that you cannot get the scrap value back in cash, if you de-register the car yourself.<br><br>(2) If you ask a car dealer to SCRAP it for you, they will discount about 6.5-7.0% from your scrap value - unfortunately, this is the market rate now.  The rest is their profit.  The only advantage is that you will get cash back.<br><br>(3) If you SELL your car to buyer directly, the very rough asking price now will be as follows:  <a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html</a>.  Actual selling prices will be up to a few thousand below asking price.  Used cars don't sell so fast now, so some patience is needed.<br><br>(4) If you SELL it to a car dealer, the price will be quite a few thousand lower than the asking price as shown above - because the car dealer needs to make a profit.  However, I have doubts if used car dealers will be keen to take your car in now...because they're all overstocked with cars which can't move.  If you go to the Automobile Megamart at Ubi, you will see 6 stories of used cars....and maybe 10 potential customers walking around.<br><br>(5) I'm afraid that you're also right in that after selling/scrapping, you still have to pay the bank for the remaining loan - at one go.  I don't know about your loan agreement, but some banks do give rebates for interest if you settle the loans early - better to check with your bank.<br><br>(6) Unfortunately, brand new cars lose most of their value (highest depreciation) in the first 2-3 years of their lives.  Sometimes, even 40-50% of it within 3 years.  Your case is not that bad already....I know people who lose S$50k in 2 years!<br><br>(7) Well, it is not really unfair, because the buyer is expected to know the conditions before he/she enters the deal.  But I know it comes as a shock and it hurts like hell.  Lots of people have gotten caught in situations like yours, so you're not alone.<br><br>I'm sorry for throwing bricks at you, in giving you directly these cold hard facts.  I hope its not an urgent case that you need to get rid of your car.<br><br>My advice to you is to keep the car for now if you can.....till its at least 5 years old, then examine selling/scrapping it again to see if its better (by then, the depreciation per year would have dropped significantly).  If its really urgent, then try to share the car with a family member - eg. try to get your brother/sister/parent/spouse/whoever to use the car half the time, and help to pay for the instalments.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post Script</span><br><br>I'm going off on a tangent here.....(nothing to do with your case).....<br><br>This case illustrates what many people here have asked questions about.  As I've always stressed....just because the COE is low, doesn't mean that brand new cars are good buys.  In any business decision (cars, shares, forex, etc), you not only need to know the buying price, but also the selling price.<br><br>Also, it is never advisable to take a loan with too long a tenure, or with too big an amount.<br></div>

If it is because it turns dull after these years of usage, then send it for repainting or polishing to make it into shiny showroom condition.<br>Should cost only a few hundred dollars. THen do some touchups like adding sports rim if you havent got it, tint its glasses...<br></div>

After downpayment of $8K+, i still have to loan $32K for 4 years. Based on an interest rate of 2.5% pa, i would need to pay $3.2K interest in total. Can't imagine him paying $17K+ interest over 10 years, it just sounds scary (i.e. that makes 26.5% of the loan quantum) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ..<br><br>I am rather flabbergasted by the singapore car market. Its like u can get a normal car for $70K this month and then in a couple of month's time, u can get the same car at $50K+. For those who paid $70K then will have to service the $20K extra loan for nothing.. even though their COE value is higher.<br><br>My advice.. never never take max loan for max tenure.

I'll try to answer your questions in point form....<br><br>(1) If you SCRAP your car by yourself by driving it to a scrapyard, you will get $38k back...in which case, yes, its a big loss.  You must also remember that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> get the $38k back in cash....its just an electronic record in LTA's computers that they are holding $38k of your money.  The ONLY thing you can do is to buy another new car with it.  Its important to remember that you cannot get the scrap value back in cash, if you de-register the car yourself.<br><br>(2) If you ask a car dealer to SCRAP it for you, they will discount about 6.5-7.0% from your scrap value - unfortunately, this is the market rate now.  The rest is their profit.  The only advantage is that you will get cash back.<br><br>(3) If you SELL your car to buyer directly, the very rough asking price now will be as follows:  <a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html</a>.  Actual selling prices will be up to a few thousand below asking price.  Used cars don't sell so fast now, so some patience is needed.<br><br>(4) If you SELL it to a car dealer, the price will be quite a few thousand lower than the asking price as shown above - because the car dealer needs to make a profit.  However, I have doubts if used car dealers will be keen to take your car in now...because they're all overstocked with cars which can't move.  If you go to the Automobile Megamart at Ubi, you will see 6 stories of used cars....and maybe 10 potential customers walking around.<br><br>(5) I'm afraid that you're also right in that after selling/scrapping, you still have to pay the bank for the remaining loan - at one go.  I don't know about your loan agreement, but some banks do give rebates for interest if you settle the loans early - better to check with your bank.<br><br>(6) Unfortunately, brand new cars lose most of their value (highest depreciation) in the first 2-3 years of their lives.  Sometimes, even 40-50% of it within 3 years.  Your case is not that bad already....I know people who lose S$50k in 2 years!<br><br>(7) Well, it is not really unfair, because the buyer is expected to know the conditions before he/she enters the deal.  But I know it comes as a shock and it hurts like hell.  Lots of people have gotten caught in situations like yours, so you're not alone.<br><br>I'm sorry for throwing bricks at you, in giving you directly these cold hard facts.  I hope its not an urgent case that you need to get rid of your car.<br><br>My advice to you is to keep the car for now if you can.....till its at least 5 years old, then examine selling/scrapping it again to see if its better (by then, the depreciation per year would have dropped significantly).  If its really urgent, then try to share the car with a family member - eg. try to get your brother/sister/parent/spouse/whoever to use the car half the time, and help to pay for the instalments.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post Script</span><br><br>I'm going off on a tangent here.....(nothing to do with your case).....<br><br>This case illustrates what many people here have asked questions about.  As I've always stressed....just because the COE is low, doesn't mean that brand new cars are good buys.  In any business decision (cars, shares, forex, etc), you not only need to know the buying price, but also the selling price.<br><br>Also, it is never advisable to take a loan with too long a tenure, or with too big an amount.<br></div></blockquote></div>
