Actually I can only down full for a OPC kelisa then. Anyway, Kelisa down full need to pay S$3k extra because of not taking loan. Actually now most dealers have some kind of clause like this. So must take at least a certain amount of loan. So most people would down MAX, loan Minimum, for 1 year. This way, the interest will be lesser than the "fine" for not taking up loan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gentlerock:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>Please be prepared because the cold hard facts are not exactly pleasant to know......<br><br>Seems like you're one of the many who are caught at the losing end of our "car casino" ( otherwise known as "car market" ).  I'll try to answer your questions in point form....<br><br>(1) If you SCRAP your car by yourself by driving it to a scrapyard, you will get $38k back...in which case, yes, its a big loss.  You must also remember that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> get the $38k back in cash....its just an electronic record in LTA's computers that they are holding $38k of your money.  The ONLY thing you can do is to buy another new car with it.  Its important to remember that you cannot get the scrap value back in cash, if you de-register the car yourself.<br><br>(2) If you ask a car dealer to SCRAP it for you, they will discount about 6.5-7.0% from your scrap value - unfortunately, this is the market rate now.  The rest is their profit.  The only advantage is that you will get cash back.<br><br>(3) If you SELL your car to buyer directly, the very rough asking price now will be as follows:  <a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/info-2foaBeQB-1000.html</a>.  Actual selling prices will be up to a few thousand below asking price.  Used cars don't sell so fast now, so some patience is needed.<br><br>(4) If you SELL it to a car dealer, the price will be quite a few thousand lower than the asking price as shown above - because the car dealer needs to make a profit.  However, I have doubts if used car dealers will be keen to take your car in now...because they're all overstocked with cars which can't move.  If you go to the Automobile Megamart at Ubi, you will see 6 stories of used cars....and maybe 10 potential customers walking around.<br><br>(5) I'm afraid that you're also right in that after selling/scrapping, you still have to pay the bank for the remaining loan - at one go.  I don't know about your loan agreement, but some banks do give rebates for interest if you settle the loans early - better to check with your bank.<br><br>(6) Unfortunately, brand new cars lose most of their value (highest depreciation) in the first 2-3 years of their lives.  Sometimes, even 40-50% of it within 3 years.  Your case is not that bad already....I know people who lose S$50k in 2 years!<br><br>(7) Well, it is not really unfair, because the buyer is expected to know the conditions before he/she enters the deal.  But I know it comes as a shock and it hurts like hell.  Lots of people have gotten caught in situations like yours, so you're not alone.<br><br>I'm sorry for throwing bricks at you, in giving you directly these cold hard facts.  I hope its not an urgent case that you need to get rid of your car.<br><br>My advice to you is to keep the car for now if you can.....till its at least 5 years old, then examine selling/scrapping it again to see if its better (by then, the depreciation per year would have dropped significantly).  If its really urgent, then try to share the car with a family member - eg. try to get your brother/sister/parent/spouse/whoever to use the car half the time, and help to pay for the instalments.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Post Script</span><br><br>I'm going off on a tangent here.....(nothing to do with your case).....<br><br>This case illustrates what many people here have asked questions about.  As I've always stressed....just because the COE is low, doesn't mean that brand new cars are good buys.  In any business decision (cars, shares, forex, etc), you not only need to know the buying price, but also the selling price.<br><br>Also, it is never advisable to take a loan with too long a tenure, or with too big an amount.<br></div></blockquote>Hey dude how's the Muay Thai going haha..<br><br>Anyway your post was really filled with useful info..My situation is similar to the topic starter's just that I have a 7 year loan and the car is an Xtrail. However I am luckily not in the situation where I have to the sell the car. I remember when the Xtrail was 2 years old we thought of selling it off to replace it with a Mazda RX8 but decided not to cos we'd owe like 15k to the bank after selling it off and the RX8 didn't come with a test drive. The sales exec said he could arrange a test drive AFTER we bought the car. WTH?<br><br>Anyway, he did mention something, which is "Roughly, when you got a 7 year loan you break even in 3 years, and for 10 years it's about 5. Luckily I opted to take the 7 year loan for the Nissan.<br><br>Maybe when the Nissan breaks even in about 4 months or so if prices hold we'll maybe get a second hand Volvo or some German car.<br><br>My mom's not impressed with the S60, which I think is a great car. She likes the 5 series and E200s but I'm kind of doubtful with their reliability. We were checking out some of the Legacys that are turbocharged but they seem kind of smallish inside.<br><br>Any recommendations? We'll probably go for second hand, since it seems that most new cars really f up when it comes to depreciation. Maybe a nice Volkswagen Passat? Audi A4? Or how about a Saab? I loved them since I got to know my Swedish host mother..<br><br>P.S. Luckily my COE wasn't the lowest yet when we bid for the Nissan, so we've got some remaining value left that is pro rated.</div>

Have you decided on the club to join yet?  There's actually a Muaythai fight this weekend (both pro and amatuer) and four of my friends are fighting, but I've just returned from a hectic two-day KL drive-up trip this evening and I've no mood for anything else, so I've gotta settle with not watching the fights.<br><br>Oh yeah, the distributors don't bring in many performance cars like the RX-8 and so they can't risk letting potential customers try them out.  They have to sell their test cars at a few thousand lower.  If they bring in 2000 cars, they won't mind selling one cheap.  But if they bring in only a few (as I'm sure will be the case of the RX-8 ), selling one car cheap has more impact on profits.<br><br>Not being cheeky or difficult here, but I can't really grasp the concept of "break-even" where cars are concerned.  One can never break-even with cars because its always a financial loss.  The way I see it,iIts just how much one loses, thats all.<br><br>Woah, I've never been rich enough to own any expensive continental marques myself....but I've driven some before (belonging to parents, companies I've worked for, etc).<br><br>Personally, I'm not a big fan of cars like the Merc 200 (used to have an E190 as a family car, now we have a C200) because...well....besides being underpowered, I feel a bit old driving one.  This is stereotyping, but my impression of people who drive Merc 200 cars are like...er....old businessmen with gold Rolexes and heavy gold chains around their necks.  haha.... hence, I never touch my family car.<br><br>I've driven an Audi A4 2.3 many years ago on the Malaysian N-S highway (company car, not mine), with a load of 3 adults including the driver (me).  Overall comfort level quite OK (although I found the seats firm probably because I was too used to driving Japanese).  Power wasn't not fantastic, but just like other continentals, they're quite steady at highway speeds.<br><br>I've never driven a Volvo - only sat in some before.  One of my neighbours has a 5-year old Volvo and he's sent it for repairs quite a few time already.  Its not cheap each time....he's thinking of selling it away.<br><br>The only BMW I've driven is the old 3 series (family car) and I liked it.  I've sat in the newest 5 Series a few times (friend's car) and its typical of a "high-class car"....quiet, smooth, wide, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, etc.  I don't know about its responsiveness because I've never driven it.....but he did complain a bit on the cost of maintenance (he goes back to the agent for all his BMW matters).<br><br>VW...sorry, can't comment as I've never been in one.<br><br>Saab....sorry, never driven one too.  Only sat in one (in Thailand) many years ago and wasn't impressed at all.  The aircon didn't blow out cold air, the dashboard looked worn out after being in the sun for too long, etc.  But that was like 3-4 models ago.....so whatever judgements I've made probably cannot apply to the available models now.<br><br>I think you're more towards the continental cars type....unlike me, cos I don't like RWDs.  They're fine in everthing else, except on wet roads.  I've seen them out of control in Hamburg's morning ice, I've seen them in the longkang on the Malaysian highways in rainy weather (just saw another one yesterday), I've sat in one which went slipping and sliding in Japan during winter, etc.<br><br>This will be biased, but I'd go for the Legacy.  I like AWD turbos.  I had a Legacy 2.2 AWD (non turbo) before.....and I'm driving a Forester 2.0 XT now.   Because my backseats are seldom used, I never cared about cabin space.  Er.....and if you could consider the RX-8, the Legacy's cabin space should be acceptable to you leh....but I'm not sure if you can find any Legacies in the used-car market.<br><br>I started liking 4WDs since years ago, when I tried using my FWD Jap car to take an off-road short cut (stupid me) from Ayer Keroh and Tanjung Bidara (both in Melaka).  It got stuck in the mud - and I had to be saved by some kindhearted Indian villagers in the area, who came to the rescue with planks and raw human pushing power.  Imagine....I was illegally driving through their village and yet they still helped me.  hahahaa..... they must've been saying "oh, these idiotic Singaporeans".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I also favour Japanese as you favour Swedish - because I've lived with some Japanese before, in Japan.  The impression does last....I guess its a kind of repayment to kindness and warmth, a kind of gratefulness shown in our support to those who have been nice to us before.<br><br>If you hadn't listed sedans only, I would've suggested the Harrier/RX300..... particularly the one with the "panoramic roof".  Saw one in the used-car market some weeks back....but now not sure where I saw it, not sure if its still around.  One of my neighbour has one and she always drives back with the roof open at night.  Make me jealous <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> .  Maybe next time she does it, I'll throw some stones in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

If I can afford it, I try to minimise my loans because the interests paid is very "sim-tia" (heart pain).  For my current vehicle, I took a 3-year loan only (was forced to) and yet the total interest earned from me will be S$3000 (total, over 3 years).  Thats good money I could use for meals, massages, etc....<br><br>I'm a cheapo too, but want to make my dollars stretch to the skies.  hahaha....I'm only a salaried worker lah, what to do?  And sometimes its possible, if you can find a used car in good condition (say, 2 years old).  You may get an almost new condition car at a much lower price (sometimes up to 40% lower than its original price).  Its a risk though.....'cos you'll never know what you're buying.  And used-car salespeople are also not the easiest to deal with too ....oooohh.....<br><br>I'm a regular to Malaysia myself.....the situation is actually not as bad as reported, but just once is once too many.  Hey, in that case, it may be better to get something thats not in "high demand" there - eg. Hyundai, Subaru, Volvo, Saab, etc.  Yeah, the BMWs may attract unwanted attention.    Waliow, I can't imagine the panic when walking back to the carpark to find an empty lot....<br><br>Haven't seen Tom Yang Gung yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Gentlerock,<br>u are very knowledgable about all these, impressive.<br>Anyone, I wish to seek yours(or anyone else) advice.<br>I was thinking of selling my 03 Nissan Sunny to a 03-04 Toyota wish.<br>Yeah my sunny's losting alot too, but I figured that the used wish will lose just as much. So i am thinking that qetting a used MPV will not be as bad as getting a new one.. am i right to say that?<br><br>Basically I am trying to ask what's the pro and con for getting a used car instead of a new one..</div>
