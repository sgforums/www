Anyways the fake 6 i saw had the puny stock exhaust so it was a dead giveaway.</div>

Or my distant nephew, who also loves cars. Think kids nowadays are more car aware from a young age. Or is it only those who come into contact with me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
