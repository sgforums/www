            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed with the enclosed area reasoning where the CO2 will build up within it, causing CO2 poisoning. But then again, I would not take the risk of leaving engine on even in non-enclosed area, afterall, life is too precious to be gambled away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there was a case where a couple died in their car, in a mult-storey carpark. The car was found with the engine dead, but the ignition and air-con on. It was found out that the car had rusted holes in the floorboard.<br><br>So even if ya not in an enclosed space, there will still be a chance of CO2 being sucked in fron the exhaust from the back, unless the outside weather is breezy and not blowing from behind to front. The effects is similiar to being in an enclosed space, just takes a longer time along with the right conditions outside.</div>

Typically the amount of exhaust gases leaking into the passenger cabin is so small to be insignificant, but over a long period of time it can accumulate and become lethal. Considering also that it was a baby left in the car, the baby's tolerance to CO poisoning would be much lower than a healthy adult. Normally people who want to commit suicide use the hose method because it speeds up the process.</div>
