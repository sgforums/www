In Japan, Bus and trains comes at fixed timing with no more than 1-2mins delay or early. But generally, Singapore is 1 of the few countries that you only need to wait for 15mins for a bus that can practically take you to most places. Other countries either have longer intervals or don't have bus for that route at all.<br><br>As for the Taxi-drivers, what a relief to be driving myself now. They are the major reason for not taking public transport. I used to take taxi at least twice a week, and have seen all kinds of taxi driver. Some could be so un-reasonable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> that I rather walk a few metres and take the bus/mrt.</div>

Instead, it's the other way around; you need to plan your daily route, get up a little earlier to beat the rush hour jam, ERP, and get that parking space at your office.

            <div class='col-md body'>Having a car or not having a car, both have their own problems and advantages. With a young family with three toddlers, I carry the stroller and big bags when we go out taking public transport. Of course, car sharing is good in this situation. But, going out alone, it seems that travelling by bus and MRT is more convenient.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is tricky but i always wonder whether owning car in sg is luxurious/necessary activity or not.<br><br>accoring to "rich dad poor dad": if i buy a car for commercial usage it's asset whereas if i buy one for my own usage it's non-investment which do not retun any money. then i have to consider a few factors,<br><br>- ROI: based on his criteria, it is not investment as there could not be any retun in the future for my puchase of a car<br>- PRIORITY: chance cost (let say, owing to my as-is gf i can't see prettier girl; just kidding i have ONE wife and 2 kids) of car. owing to speding of this stuff, i have to give up another activities(Travelling oversea/Study/Books/Kids stuff etc.).<br>- SUBSTITUTE: public transportation in sg is one of the best i think (including taxi service)<br><br>PROS:<br>A. CONVENIENCE (COOLED CABIN, EASY TO ACCESS)<br>B. PSYCHOLOGIC SATISFACTION (INCLUSING SHOW OFF)<br><br>CONS:<br>A.
