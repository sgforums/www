A car here, is like maintaining a wife."</strong><br><br>well i've got news for ya DUDE. so you're saying Singaporean girls can't support themselves? so we're weak and sh_t? i don't blame you.. it's the story you've been told since you were a kid, "females are weak, men should support them, men drive, women cook, men this, men that". i love my bf. we both drive. we tuned our OWN cars with our OWN money. it's all about money? yeah sure... pfft..<br><br><strong>"It's not all about money, It's all about car. Even if u have no money, u can still pick up gals if u have a car. If the gal falls in love with ur car.... "</strong><br><br>i fall in love with cars. not other people's cars. do you think we need yOu to drive us around? so your car acts as a transportation machine and as a attracting-girls device too? a$$... i think this guy loves cars as much as i do, but i bet this huge male reproduction organ hasn't been to the 240km/h mark. hell, i bet he hasn't even been to 200 before.. lol</div>
