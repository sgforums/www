            <div class='col-md body'>i was wondering what the ppl here thinks of this question. i have been told that when i grow up, get a job, i shall get a car as it will be easy to drive to work and simply also because as well everyone else is doing it.<br><br>however, with the recent increase in oil prices and also my sudden realisation that a car is something that you need to continally contribute money to maintain it, i feel that if i were to get a car, i might face problems in my finance later on.<br><br>then again, there are rumors of public transport hikes again recently and hence now even public transport sounds more and more expensive nowadays.<br><br>therefore, what are your views on this? is it better to get a car or stick to public transport? is a car, in your opinion, a necessity or a luxury?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a little of both. You don't expect an executive to be taking bus right ? or a sales person running into the place hes supposed to meet his client all sweaty. for them its a neccessity.<br><br>Get a small / cheap car. i don't think thats a "luxury" what .. if you get a small / cheap car just for basic travelling needs i think its ok cause if you took taxi everywhere it will still be expensive so might as well just get a small/cheap car.<br><br>for those who cant afford but still want to buy nice car to show off, thats a "luxury" people see you have cool ride but they don't know your pocket got 1 big hole.<br><br>I think for a teen lets say 18 - 23 *still schooling* to own a car no matter how lousy, is a luxury<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me it is more of a necessity.. Driving a car is more than just point A to point B.. there is many things to learn and to improve one's skill.. also modifying a car has no limits.. so more or less is a hobby.. an expensive one perhaps but very rewarding...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the car is been used by more then 3~4 person everyday in your family. I think a car is a necessity.<br><br>If just to sent your wife to work &amp; put yourself to work, the car sit in the parking lot for the rest of the working hours, it becomes a luxury item. Provided $ is not a problem.<br><br>Why not opt for a Bike? Like me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Cheaper then cars &amp; get to where you want. No parking problems, no traffic jam, Summon also cheaper. Only have to put up with rain but look how big is Singapore. If I really need to make that trip in rain, I dial a cab. For family days, public transport &amp; cab makes sense for me. Sunshine is pretty ok for me here in Singapore. I have tried riding on the road at more then 50 degrees. I find Singapore heat condition is ok. Even wearing a tie &amp; coat riding a bike also looks cool <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Basically car have 5 seats, fill at least half or more makes sense to owning a car. Lesser filled means you are paying for nothing.<br><br>Some informations for your considerations:<br><br>I ride a 125cc Bike. Paid the bike Cash, I don't have loans. Petrol cost me average SG$60 per month. Bike insurance is $169 third party per year. Road tax is $80 per year. Parking is free at work &amp; shopping place. Parking at HDB, I don't pay at all, I cover my bike everyday. ERP cost me average $10 for 3 months.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A car in Singapore is both, a luxury and a necessity. Here's why:<br><br>It's a Luxury because you would not have to arrive at work already sweaty and moody from rushing for seats in MRT and squeezing with other commuters.<br><br>It's a Necessity because our Public Transport, though touted to be WORLD CLASS, still has plenty room for improvements - such as buses should arrive on time more often, and the LRT/MRT should breakdown less often. While Taxi drivers should stop playing with Peak Hours to pick up commuters, and drive safely instead of recklessly.<br><br>Driving a car doesn't necessarily mean you can sleep longer and arrive early. Instead, it's the other way around; you need to plan your daily route, get up a little earlier to beat the rush hour jam, ERP, and get that parking space at your office. Otherwise, you'd be stuck in jam, get charged for ERP, and then arrive late to realize you can't find a convenient parking lot, then go see your boss's black face.<br><br>Yes haviong a car is luxurious, comfortable and privacy assured, but it has it's own frustrations and stresses.<br><br>Driving, needs a lot of pre-planning. Unlike taking Public Transport.</div>
