            <div class='col-md body'>Ford Focus should be a good buy now as the new Focus will be launched soon. Before a new model is launched, the old model is normally at rock bottom price. One thing for sure, you must bargain for more freebies. If not, workshop will charge you according to continental car rate if you wish to install something in future.<br><br>If you get to see the new Focus, some parts eg. lights do not looks as nice as the old model.<br><br>Altis should be ok , looking at the sales figures for Toyota. But i have heard some negative comments on the quality. Unless you are looking at the Japan version of Corolla, there is no clear comparison. Just like Ford Laser from Philippines.</div>

Focus excels in the mid/high torque regions ... the rpm for my Focus reaches only 2.5k at 90kmh so high speeds can be reached w/o you knowing it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

On the other hand, Ford took three full years to do detailed survey what the masses actually wanted in a car, and built the perfect benchmark which other manufacturers still could not match, even six years later, after it was first lauched in 1998.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all for the input.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Buying a car is so expensive, I will need to do lots of homework and hear from your valuable experiences before decidingÂ…<br><br>To answer Anulf's question on the price of the focus, it was at $72988 for the 1.6 AT (not the hatchback version). The hatchback will cost additional $2K. Not sure if the price has dropped a bit since the COE dipped yesterday. Now, the banks are offering some cash rebate to entice you to take up the loan with them (and stay for 2 or 3 years). 20% of the total interest payable will be paid back to buyer out front now. Taking that into consideration, the price is about $71K+.<br><br>I personally am more favorable towards the focus as its interior is much more stylish than the Altis. However the price of the Altis has now dropped to $68,688Â…! If focusÂ’ price remains at $72988 (or $71+ after loan interest rebate and stuff) then the disparity in price between the two may make me decide otherwiseÂ…<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
