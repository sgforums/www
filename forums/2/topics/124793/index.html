Its power, handling, FC isn't much to talk about. Do go down and have a look at their showroom. If I haven't heard rumors that its FC is about the same as Getz, I would have booked 1.<br><br>If you are looking for Auto car, I suggest you seriously consider City (idsi). For its FC, you could easily save S$5k in 10years for moderate driving. Savings will be much much more when you compare it with Matrix. I mean since you aren't jumping into Vios, you must have wanted something different from other people.</div>

Any more advice for a newbie?<br></div></blockquote>Bring a experience driver, best if he does how to drive aggressively. Get big family members or friends along to test space and power during test-driving. Don't be afraid to ask for a test-drive. Don't sit down with them to discuss payments and plans..... only waste your time. Get their namecard enough, so later you can call for an update of the price. Spend you time browsing the cars' interior and test-driving. Plan your road, so you save time, they only allow test-drive until 7pm.<br><br>If you are considering Picanto, you can also consider Kelisa. Both are Cheap nice car that can easily hit above 16km/L FC. Do check out Swift, very quiet cabin when I last sit in 1. Oh ya, if you have time, check out those cars above your budget. So you want what you are missing while saving those few thousand. Manual Lancer is a nice car to test. Will let you experience decent power and good handling.</div>

If no, he would have asked about the price of car ownership. So let's supply him with the necessary info. Think back, he already have a sister who drive a Vios.<br><br>Anyway, Bloop... also mention the best auto car (in my opinion) around the budget. If not, smaller cars like picanto and kelisa might be a good choice. Oh, forgot to mention Lancer. Though many hated the CVT, there are still a decent population who support it. Ultimately, choose a manual whenever possible, it is cheaper and have a better FC. Don't be lazy and you will find your wallet a little more loaded.<br></div>

With its steermatic option, you can drive auto and still have a little fun with gear shifting.<br><br>Usually people are only concerned that the wife drives Auto, you are the first I know who think of gf.
