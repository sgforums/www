            <div class='col-md body'>Tailslide! How you been? Nice to see you again!<br><br>Well, yes. Fools and inconsiderate idiots are aplenty, but thankfully, it hasn't yet reached saturation levels akin to that of the haze in KL.<br><br>Parking mindful of dents, is pretty much a game of chance and luck. It alll depends on the neighborhood, the kind of location, what sorts are likely to come park next to you, and other factors come into play. But much personal plays a big part in incuring as little dents and dimples are possible.<br><br>I have seen cars with their sides looking much like the worktop of some metal machining workshop; scratched, dented, dimpled, scraped, bumped, and abrased. But I note that old rust-bucket cars are less likely to incur dents.<br><br>So, the shinier and newer your vehicle appears, watch out. And it is true that dents are sometimes left by children who open their doors mindlessly - swinging it wide open innocently.<br><br>But still, I believe in precautionary measures and porcedures. So far, I need not visit any dent removing specialist.</div>
