A Van Gogh is worth millions but all u can do is to hang it up n look at it. why do ppl still buy it? for appreciation. Anyway that dude who owns a F50, im sure he can put it on a transporter n drive to sepang to have fun. Most rich ppl who own lots of cars dun often drive them either... which leads me to another thought... let say u owned lots of cars.... since u know cars if not driven often will also spoil, how the owner make sure his cars are in working condition? if he dun drive a car for too long, all the oil and lubricants all thicken, the metal parts turn rusty because there is no movement to keep rust from forming... things jam... etc....... so how he make sure his cars are in working contition?</div>
