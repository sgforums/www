Sweet handling? no. The latest "Best Handling Car Test" carried out by Autocar, while it proved the TVR to be extremely fast, they also said it was a nightmare to handle. It 's rear suspension settings were delibrately set softer to maximise rear traction, hence the car always felt under the threat of snap-off oversteer. It was simply a challenge to get the car to stay neutral, and the racing drivers who tested it labelled the car "Inaccuracy" These racing drivers included 2 F1 drivers and 2 BTCC drivers, so I think their comments carry quite some weight. The TVR is fast because of its lightweight, but they've always had some problems with regards to their chassis design. Roadholding capability is just not good enough, with the net result being a car which has never beenn able to be a mainstream player.</div>

The latest "Best Handling Car Test" carried out by Autocar, while it proved the TVR to be extremely fast, they also said it was a nightmare to handle. It 's rear suspension settings were delibrately set softer to maximise rear traction, hence the car always felt under the threat of snap-off oversteer. It was simply a challenge to get the car to stay neutral, and the racing drivers who tested it labelled the car "Inaccuracy" These racing drivers included 2 F1 drivers and 2 BTCC drivers, so I think their comments carry quite some weight. The TVR is fast because of its lightweight, but they've always had some problems with regards to their chassis design. Roadholding capability is just not good enough, with the net result being a car which has never beenn able to be a mainstream player.</div></blockquote>well u might be right, but different driver or magazine gives different testimony.<br>those ppl in autocar thinks that car is a sweet handler, but MX-5 is still the best in this world.<br>all these testimony must depend on the driver himself and cant be compared.<br>only a track time will prove the TVR ability.<br>and the TVR 350C score the fastest for road car on a "tight" circuit.<br>even faster than evo and sti spec c, including the almighty gt3(personal favourite).<br>sad case to see this 350C smoking all my dream cars.<br>and this 350c tamora is one of the lowest end TVR.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
