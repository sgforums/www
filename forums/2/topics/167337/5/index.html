Lol, I should have gone up to the SMSA clubhouse since im a member, but I think it was closed that nite? Anyways I didn't really come over n say hi because Im not actually driving a Nissan. Like I said i was really just there to make sure the xtrail guy dun get himself into trouble. If i went n sat with u guys. I would feel a bit out of place I think. Next time when I finally can afford GTR, I'll join u guys ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Suddenly received a call from my friend that she wants to go for supper.<br><br>So got opportunity to chee hong. She's driving a Celica btw. So i drove my evo ix there, hoping to impress her. So whilst eating at a 24hour kopi tiam there at serangoon, got this group of boy racers keep peeping my evo ix. then i kay siow, i clear my throat "ahem ahem" very loud,press hopefully to frighten off them away. Maybe they see me i small boy 19 year old, so they nv take notice of me. So i press my alarm. "Beep beep, they look left , look right, they then say :knn, lj car. f**k this car.<br><br>I damn offended. I stood up, i say " this is my car. u got any problem with it ? "<br>Then they laugh, say "dont bluff la. u small boy only drive evo ix."<br><br>enough trash talk. i unlock my car. blast the stereo. i pointed to the guy in pink shirt, and i look into his eye " u and me, 1 on 1. " see u at the traffic light. the guy in pink shirt driving a rex sti. blue one. he start his car. omg. my morale went rock bottom. his bov whistle is so loud, and the turbo jus psst psst, make me freaking scared. his engine decibel easily could exceed 120. i was like "shi_t, i really in deep shi_t"<br><br>anyway, bo pian . a challenge is a challenge. his friend driving the ek9. so i ask my friend, who is a girl to sit beside me. give me some motivation.<br><br>road was clear by 1030pm. i tailgate him. we went to TPE, started at the industrial area there, around the pasir ris. the cue was to wait any car to overtake us, they we start to race. there were 4 lanes. he took the extreme left, i took the extreme right. VRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOmMMMMMMMMMMM , all hell broke loose. the rex lead first.my friend was thrown aback by the vast g-force. the road condition was still quite ok. we zoom in between cars. most of the time, the road was filled with the bov psst psst sound. then i started to catch up with him. side by side. then my friend wind down the window, she pointed middle finger at him. the wannabe look stunned. then the wrx floor the accelerator and went in front of my lane, then suddenly he slammed the brakes. WTDF F!!!!!!!!!!!!! fook him, luckily i slam my brakes, shift down, whack the accelerator, manage to miss him, or not accident jia lat liao. i dunno la. then time to unleash the power of my evo ix turbo. now i think, "argh, f**k la, die die la" . so just slam the accelerator, dont care, went zig zag like a mad man on the road. after that, i reach around woodlands. cant see his car.<br><br>haha , so proud of myself. nv see him. so later, fetch my friend back to collect her celica at the serangoon kopitiam. i hope i can race with more of these wannabes somemore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheers</div></blockquote>Is this the opening scene of "Initial-S" S for Singapore!<br></div>

I enjoy R&amp;B and rap songs when I drive so I like a bassy sound system. The other car's sound system is nicer.<br><br>Anyways the stock ATR's standing acceleration is decent enuf. 0-100 in 7.6. The recent its not better is because its mired with an automatic box. But under rolling conditions, where the autobox is less of a consideration, the rolling acceleration is pretty impressive. The way the engine sounds when revved hard is pretty enjoyable and u can also drive it in a relaxing manner because u get the full torque at a low 2500rpms. Boot space is, surprisingly for an SUV, not fantastic, although its not lacking either. U actually sit quite deep in the car and its nose is slightly high, but its quite comfortable to sit in it for long distances. I think, although i cannot be 100% sure, that because mines the Ralliart SE, the ride is a bit firmer than usual. U know how normal cars behave when going over humps yea? The ATR goes over it, bumps once, and returns to level. Anyways overall I think its a nice vehicle. A bit niche, but still a nice vehicle.</div>
