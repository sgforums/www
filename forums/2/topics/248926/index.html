            <div class='col-md body'><br>We all drive everyday, and we all depend a lot on all our existing Mainroads &amp; Expressways to get to our destinations.<br><br>But I like to draw your attention to all those large, tall and old trees with overhanging branches that lined most of Singapore's Expressways &amp; Mainroads; I see most of them have got branches that stretches almost halfway across roads. What will happen, if one of those thick branches break and fall during a thunderstorm? Even without thunderstorms, branches of old trees are known to come crashing down and flattening cars either passing by, or parked beneath it.<br><br>What's my point? Well, shade from trees in carparks and along roads and expressways are a welcome benefit, but what and who is ensuring that branches of these trees don't break off and harm road users? And when such a thing happens, who do we claim damages from?? I find it hard to accept the counter-claim under 'Acts of God',  when such hazards were not prevented through maintenance by the responsible gov agency, in the first place.<br><br>I know that the PWD or Nparks conducts regular Tree Pruning along expressways, but why don't they remove all overhanging branches instead of trimming off twigs?<br><br>Or must they wait till something horrific and sad occurs before resorting to my suggestion?<br><br>Your opinions would be good in this concern.<br><br></div>

But ideally, I wasn't suggesting the total removal of trees, but to 'shape' their growth so that there are no dangerous overhanging branches over carriageways.<br><br>I do agree trees makes our country "Uniquely SIngapore", but we also do not want problems tha are Uniquely Ours...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>very good topic and excellent suggestion, i support! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">We all drive everyday, and we all depend a lot on all our existing Mainroads &amp; Expressways to get to our destinations.<br><br>But I like to draw your attention to all those large, tall and old trees with overhanging branches that lined most of Singapore's Expressways &amp; Mainroads; I see most of them have got branches that stretches almost halfway across roads. What will happen, if one of those thick branches break and fall during a thunderstorm? Even without thunderstorms, branches of old trees are known to come crashing down and flattening cars either passing by, or parked beneath it.<br><br>What's my point? Well, shade from trees in carparks and along roads and expressways are a welcome benefit, but what and who is ensuring that branches of these trees don't break off and harm road users? And when such a thing happens, who do we claim damages from?? I find it hard to accept the counter-claim under 'Acts of God',  when such hazards were not prevented through maintenance by the responsible gov agency, in the first place.<br><br>I know that the PWD or Nparks conducts regular Tree Pruning along expressways, but why don't they remove all overhanging branches instead of trimming off twigs?<br><br>Or must they wait till something horrific and sad occurs before resorting to my suggestion?<br><br>Your opinions would be good in this concern.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
