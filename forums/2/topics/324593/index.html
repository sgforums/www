              <p>Hi, please help me with this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, when I was doing a parallel parking , as I was coming out of the lot to do an adjustment. I hit a car that was driving by me as I came out and my bumper hit his door causing an approximately 30cm scratch . Do bear in mind that it was a scratch and not a serious dent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the guy got my contact, I got his and we plan to settle this dispute personally. I asked him to go to the workshop I frequent for the repair but to find out that the scratch cannot be remove by polishing, hence a respray job is needed. I was quoted X amount for the repair, so I decided to let him do the respray and I will pay for it when the job is done. We agree to the plan</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then this guy sms'd me a few days ago, stating that he is very busy these few days and can't manage to find the time to go for the spray job. He requested me to pay him the sum of the repair and he will go get it fixed himself. I refuse to pay him the money and he ended up calling me irresponsible. The thing is, I will only pay the workshop for the repair as I feel this is only right. So my friend say to pay him Y amount should he insist on getting it repair himself and not the quoted X sum originally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it correct to refuse to pay him the money for the repair and insist I pay the designated workshop directly? I need some advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>And I am not complaining about the inconvenience on my part, I am just trying to justify his intention of having me paying him rather than the workshop when he might not even go for the paintwork in the first place.</p>

              <p>surely X is bigger then y for sure...</p>
              <p>My advice is, do not pay him any amount. If he want, go to workshop, you pay workshop. Do not pay him directly.</p>
              <p>Unless Y amount is a reasonable amount.</p>
              <p>My reasonable amount for repaint job is 150.</p>
              <p>If not i rather pay workshop more, let it repaint.  That's my view</p>

              <p>With my accident experiences, you have 2 choices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Tell him nicely that there is no hurry or duration to get his damage respray. When he can find the time and go to the workshop, just give you a call and you will settle the agreed bill with the workshop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Give him the X amount of money and make him signed an agreement that the damage was settled. He might not use the money to spend on the damage but technically you caused the damage so let it be.</p>
              <p>Afterall, regardless where the chap spend the money at, you have no loss as you still have to pay X amount at the end of the day so get it settled with both parties comfrtable with each other.</p>

              last time i reverse my vehicle out from parking and seemingly i knocked into a situatory vehicle in the blind spot. He quoted me the price and we met up on another date after we exchanged particular. I might have paid more but it's okay cos i seems to be in the wrong.
              
              The most important thing is that get the person to sign an agreement with the particulars in writing for the settlement before handing him the money. That's the most important part.
