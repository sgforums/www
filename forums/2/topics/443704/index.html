              <p>Bus 124, South Bridge Rd.</p>
              <p>I was there yesterday.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bus front and rear dio langa</span>. And although damage is rather superficial, its still a big dent at the front left and a huge crack at the rear left bumper.</p>
              <p>TS is not telling the full story.</p>
              <p>Bus was also on extreme right lane and did not appear to have deviated from lane. I reckon TS's car cut the bus's path and pretty fast too judging from the damage. Damage on the bus is at the side as seen in the pic. Bus did not bang the car. Its clear car bang bus from side.</p>

              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My hubby has a accident with a bus today. Basically, we were
              cutting the line from right to left while the traffic light is red.
              When my hubby has cut slowly into more than 50% of the line. We
              suddenly got crashed with the bus behind. <strong>But before cutting, my
              hubby and I both look at the mirror and it was clear. </strong>We suspect
              the bus is speeding. When the bus hit the front wheel the car
              bounced back and make the left side of the car hit the private
              vehicle in front of us. Now the axel of our car has gone
              case. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you guys think that we can claim 100% from the bus? P.S. we
              are sure that we almost cut into the whole right lane coz we only
              hit the corner of the car in front of us but not the back
              . </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>TS, you are very contradictory.<strong> </strong>Even your statements are contradictory:</p>
              <p><strong>1.</strong> You said:</p>
              <p><strong>we were
              cutting the line from </strong><strong>right to left while the traffic light is red</strong></p>
              <p><strong>we are mostly totally
                                      changed to the right lane already</strong>...</p>
              <p>So, which is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2.</strong> You said:</p>
              <p><strong>we are mostly totally
                                      changed to the right lane already...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When my hubby has cut slowly into more than 50% of the line. We
              suddenly got crashed with the bus behind.</strong></p>
              <p>If you are in the new lane already, how come the bus can hit your wheel and not your back?</p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong>You said:</p>
              <p><strong>But before cutting, my
              hubby and I both look at the mirror and it was clear.</strong></p>
              <p>You should be turning your head and not looking at the mirror. How did you pass your driving test?</p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong>You were changing into the bus's path in the right lane, the 
              bus hit your right front wheel and pushed your car back into your lane, 
              causing you to hit the car in front.</p>
              <p><strong>4.</strong> Some advice to you. If you are entering someone else's lane, it does not matter if the traffic light in front is red or if you accuse the other driver of speeding.</p>
              <p>In summary, good luck to you.</p>
