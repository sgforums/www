            <div class='col-md body'>Normally for in-house insurance, they have discount under the price list. For example, they quote u a discount of $2500 for in-house insurance. If you do not want to purchase the in-house insurance, then you got to pay additional $2500 for the car.<br><br>I recommend you to go for the in-house insurance for the first year. then for second year, see if the company give any discount, etc...<br><br>For me, I bought under Cycle &amp; Carriage. They have in-house insurance under AIG. Not bad, second year still give discount and best of all, in case of accident, I go to C&amp;C, which is one of the authorised workshop.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like that harh...i was not told of any discount for using inhouse insurance.<br>Actually, was rather pissed off, cause at first, say its $1000+, then after a while add another few hundred, then after a while add another few hundred. My SE say I less than 1 yr liscence, so insurance gonna a little higher.<br>Higher is never mind, but the table say 0% NCD is $x. So I buy the car, causee I feel the insurance acceptable.THen now say i no experience, so happy happy go and add my premium. Where got this kind of things one?<br>Add until now the premium more than $2k. So I dun like AIG. Now you people say AIG good, so I also dunno how...</div>

Unless you are admitting that you are lazy, why dun u pay the various showroom a visit and posed as a potential buyer? In that way u get to ask and learnt everything first hand rather than absorbing possibly distorted views over here ?!?!? Anyway all the showrooms are bundled together in 2 areas.
