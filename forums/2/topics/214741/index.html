            <div class='col-md body'>Today was supposed to be a happy day for me... I signed a contract on a demonstrator BMW E61 530i M sport Wagon in carbon black, dakota leather, 19 inch rims, a beautiful car done only 2500kms. 3 months old. New N2 engine...<br><br>Thing is that the sales person told my wife and I that TV was optioned and that the road tax for this car was stil valid for six months, I made my offer based on this as part of the overall criteria. When I asked to see th vehicle, he was most reluctant to show it to me, and so we just looked at it form the outside and went back to the show room to negotiate the price etc... so after signing the contract, we insist on seeing the car and to our great disappointment.there was not TV option. At this point my wife is pretty upset because of two things. 1. no TV and second 2. only one month road tax left.<br><br>The sales person did apologise and say that it was his mistake, but when we asked how he was going to rememdy the mistake, he basically said, it is still a good deal anyway and you don't need the TV. He was very flippant about the whole thing and even when we pushed for some rectification, he said, if you are not happy, there is nothing I can do and we can go upstairs to tear up the contract. When I then asked him whether a TV could be retrofitted, he said no. But going through REAL OEM on the web, I find that there is a retrofit option. He has lied to us again.<br><br>We are upset also because the previous day, we had passed up a great deal in Melbourne on another wagon which was more highly specced and about $15K cheaper just to do the deal in Adelaide. Now I am not very happy. What do you think? I still have not paid the deposit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you seeking legal advice or general opinion as to whether or not to cancel the contract?<br><br>With regards the latter &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.<br><br>With regards the former:<br><br>1) Your vehicle purchase contract should have a clause that includes a "cooling-off" period, i.e. during this period taking effect immediately from the purchase, you can rescind the contract without incurring liability.<br><br>alternatively,<br><br>2) As a bona fide purchaser, having acted to your detriment, on the misrepresentation of facts by the vendor, you are entitled to seek a refund of your deposit/purchase price. However, it should be noted that as you have already taken notice of this misrepresentation (with the vendor acknowledging and admitting to this), any delay would act against your claim (acquiescence). I have not mentioned specific performance because I am doubtful the vendor would have a model, exactly/similarly close to what was promised.<br><br>Please do not regret your purchase and never let circumstantial pressure get the better of you.<br><br>FYI, the TV, is not cheap; 3rd party installations might give rise to subsequent warranty issues, and it wouldn't be cheap either.<br><br>Which BMW dealer did you go to? The one on Kingsway?<br><br>EDIT: The views above represent that of an individual, and is not intended to be/represent any form of professional legal opinion.</div>
