            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the worst is the Honda City. Saw a few with spoiler &amp; so on. Typical Ah Beng. Come close next is the VIOS. Third is the Matrix. Come on, these are budget cars, the drivers thought that by addding some touch up can make the car fly. Nuts... If want to speed, drive a sport car.<br><br>Even heard someone who like to boast that his city attract a lot of attention from other car &amp; always like to jio him to race. Wah lau eh, it's because they see him or his car no up that's why. If he's driving a ferrari of porche &amp; u think the rest will jio him?<br><br>Somemore, have any of you come across drivers whom like to hang out their car key in their pants pocket or holding their car key in their hand or swinging around in shopping centres or restaurant? These are mostly youngster driving their parent cars or driving budget cars &amp; want to show off. Scared people dun know they drives... but budget car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Liteace structure is such that the drive will escape unscath even in head-long collision with another van. If its a saloon on headlong, the saloon driver and passenger should die on the spot.<br><br>Liteace is the only vehicle in Singapore which, for the past 5 years, has never had its driver died or suffer any serious injury.

Just that ah bengs = low ass, no money in pocket punks.<br><br>Rich, low ass punks who drive Ferraris, Porsche or EVOs are called Yuppies. So in relation to this thread, the definition is all wrong. These yuppies are probably so low ass they call their Ferraris, Fer-La-Li. No joke. I have a few yuppie friends who drive EVOs, WRXs and one who has a Murcielago. And btw, they're old farts. The rich young ones earn their keeps from selling pirated DVDs or some underground work. Not convenient to disclose here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
