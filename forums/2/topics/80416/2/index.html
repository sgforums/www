Sorry. Just curious cos at first you said test drive then in second post you said you're lucky to sit and then now you said you test drive again. So it confused me lah.<br><br><blockquote><strong>The MR is good but when you corner hard the Body roll is much better then the normal 8 ... it can go thru a normal bend faster then a 8 ... take the first bend at Marina south for example ... (if you all know who is Patrick) his evo 8 turn in at 65 kph and it seems like its going to understeer ... but thanks to the company that i mention in the latter, they gave me and a friend of mine the privilege to drive there for a test ...  i took the corner on the 3rd gear at 75+ and make it through smoothly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong></blockquote>So you went Marina South to test drive? Which part cos there are always speed regulating strips there and I find that there is not much room to really try cars.<br><br><blockquote><strong>But as for the T25 ... i din't go much except the docking area of the port ... </strong></blockquote>So... it's stored at the port? Is it for a Singapore owner? Would be nice to see the car...<br><br>And I still dunno who's PCS Security....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
