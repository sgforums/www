            <div class='col-md body'>Once i came across this guy who parked his Kia across 2 washing lots... using the hose, happily spraying. After that he proceeded to wipe dry his vehicle. Once done, he then emptied his car mats, cleaned up the interior.... and all the while i was there, with my car, waiting for that a** to f**k off. I told him how inconsiderate for him park like that and he just gave me this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> and said "sorry sorry sorry" and drove off. Shameless.<br><br>I agree with that the lots are for washing only. If you wanna clean the interior, polish rims, fiddle with the engine or whatever, why not drive up to the empty lots and do all these. Usually washing lots are found in multi-storey car parks and it's usually the higher floors that are very empty.</div>

Sometimes you might be waiting, but they might be too busy to notice you. In any case if you think they are doing something at the washing bay which they are not suppose to. Then approach them and ask them to move. If you confront them, they SL, wanna wash their car for a second time you also LL. But if you talk nicely, they refuse then make a complain to the RC or town council or watever organisation la. I dun think its very effective to post it here.
