Hear the new model will be release end of this year.<br><br>One of my friend are dring Citroen C5.  Due to malfunction of a sensor in the rear side, its bumper is always dragged down by the stoppers in car park.  Its a design problem, you cannot repair it.  Just keep sending the car to workshop to fix back the bumper.  Don't know whether C3 have these problems or not.  But it spoil my impression to Citroen.  If you are interested in continental car.  May consider renault magene.  Its 2nd version is pretty good.  Spacious, safe, a lot of features.  But it is a real heavy car, not sporty at all.<br><br>I like Subaru, AWD is kind of unique in the range.<br><br>I like Mazda3 more.  Good exterior, interior.  Excellent handling, suspension.  Combine the forte of Euro car architecture and Japanese car engine thechnology.  A lot of garget for driver to play with.  A confortable driver's car<br><br>What car is good?  It is something very subjective.  Try yourself, pick the most loved.  It won't be too wrong to pick anyone in your list.</div>

But still each time I see a nicely done up Focus, I think of Colin McRae.<br><br>With regards the Fit/Jazz, yes it seems out of place.  I am kinda set on either the Mazda 3 or the Jazz.  I hope that this is a temporary stage before I get back to driving Alfas again so although between the 2 I like the Mazda 3, FC-wise, the Jazz will probably beat it hands down.

But I think there is some good issues to think abt here.<br><br>a.  Fuel Consumption: JAZZ wins hands down. The iDsi engine is one of the most fuel saving engines in the market now and depending on how u drive, an average of 16km/llitre is possible......some higher, some lower but generally it has to be one of the highest in fuel savings.  In terms of car price, I believe Jazz would be one of the cheapest amongst all ur choices.<br><br>b.  To me, when I buy a car, I dun look at how expensive it is. I ask myself whether I am emotionally and financially stable to accept that price. If yes I go ahead.  A first hand car need not has high downpayment, in fact the downpayment part can be considered non issue in first hand or 2nd hand becos both can be almost the same anyway.  Therefore I declare that buying first hand is always better unless the price difference is so great or you are getting a damn good deal (my fren's fren sold him the Nissan Sunny 6 mths old at just 55k which he bought at 68K, to me thats a good deal lah.).  WHY? becos u never know what problems u have in a 2nd hand car. I have experience that. Buying a 2nd hand car can be good or can be bad. If you can live with that risk, then sure! If not, u better buy a first hand to ease ur worries.<br><br>c.  I am not sure abt warranties with parallel importers. But just a food for thought in buying from parallel importers.<br><br>Will they stock parts for you? Even so, will they be cheap?<br>Anything happen to ur car, you think servicing will be easy?<br><br>The thing abt PI is that when ur car spoils or anything happens, it gonna get expensive and the authorised dealer are not going to help u man cos this is not their car.<br><br>d. What u wan lor. How to tell u leh? hahaha</div>

Hear the new model will be release end of this year.<br><br>One of my friend are dring Citroen C5.  Due to malfunction of a sensor in the rear side, its bumper is always dragged down by the stoppers in car park.  Its a design problem, you cannot repair it.  Just keep sending the car to workshop to fix back the bumper.  Don't know whether C3 have these problems or not.  But it spoil my impression to Citroen.  If you are interested in continental car.  May consider renault magene.  Its 2nd version is pretty good.  Spacious, safe, a lot of features.  But it is a real heavy car, not sporty at all.<br><br>I like Subaru, AWD is kind of unique in the range.<br><br>I like Mazda3 more.  Good exterior, interior.  Excellent handling, suspension.  Combine the forte of Euro car architecture and Japanese car engine thechnology.  A lot of garget for driver to play with.  A confortable driver's car<br><br>What car is good?  It is something very subjective.  Try yourself, pick the most loved.  It won't be too wrong to pick anyone in your list.</div></blockquote>I think Ford Focus is now offering discount.... the SE whom I meet at the showroom is SMSing me to consider their new price.....can go showroom to check out..... but the minus is the new forcus is coming out!</div>
