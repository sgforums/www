            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I took HL car loan 4 years ago, and I just recently redeemed early my car loan with them.  Let me tell you, their loan terms and conditions are not attractive.<br>I suggest you go for DBS auto loan, which could be paid by credit card, and with other benefits.<br>DBS just advertised their auto loan on Sat Straits times.<br><br>HL auto loan at 2.45% for 10 years.<br>20% rebate means 1.99%, it's standard.<br>You should check if there is any additional penalty if you redeem loan early, besides the standard rule of 78 penalty.<br>Normally there is "no free lunch" with promotion,  with lots of restrictions.<br><br>Compared to BM HSBC loan offers 12 mth interest rate rebate for 7 years, effectively at 1.89%.<br><br>Smarter way will be to take normal loan(non-promotional loan package), with lock-in period of 1 year.<br>Then re-finance from 2nd year onwards at 1.6% from other banks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>However, when you considering a new car. You have to take up their financial loans. Else, there will be  void of Car rebates. As for MM, you may need to pay up addition 4k if you choose not to finance your car with their financer.<br><br>This happens to almost all of the dealers (eg. TC, BM etc)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>If MM really charge additional 4K if not taking up their finance package, then MM is special...<br>MM is not in the top 3 dealers for car market share, I am surprise they have these 4K additional if finance from other banks.<br><br>BM is different. More reasonable.<br>If buy vios/Altis, HSBC rebate is $1500. Minimum loan amount is 20K, Minimum loan period is 1 year.  Generally, loan lock-in period is 1 year, except if take their promotional 12mth interest rate rebate package ( lock -in 2 years).<br>The interesting part here --&gt; If take 20K loan for 1 year, total interest is $440 with 2.2%. Hence, after 1 year, effective difference is HSBC rebate ( 1500) minus $440, equals $1060 gain by buyer.  Rule of 78 does not apply here because it's 1 year loan here.<br><br>In the long term, I still feel that 1.6% or lower will be available, even 1 year from now.<br>Reasons :<br>(1) Singapore interest rate is not really correlated with rising US Fed interest rate.<br>(2) Govt forecast economic slow down for this year, with GDP growth bet 3 to 5 %. Partly due to the high crude oil price effects. Hence, loan demand will slow due to slowing economic activity.<br>(3) Govt direction is towards lower car ownership cost gradually, with potential further ARF cut during Feb annual finance budget in parliment. Also, with record 2004 number of car scrap, LTA may release even more COE from Apr to Sep 2005. And this will see more people buying cars, auto loan market will become more competitive, and banks and Finance will need to come out more attractive, competitive loan package to grab greater share of the lucrative auto loan market.<br><br>So....Why tied up with 10 year loan, with those many restrictions/penalty if redeem early, when there are many other attractive loan packages from other banks ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do calculation, and findout when can breakeven. best is 5 year; i think!<br>car over 5 year, maintenance cost go up and car value go down alot. Maybe next 5 year, COE might go lower and lower. I have my 1st car with COE 40K++, 6 year later, COE drop to 25K. Then I get a new car with COE 27K, just less than a year, now it is 18K!<br><br>Try to shorten the loan if posible, else might you have to drive a old car with same cost or higher compare with new car.</div>

For example, if you take a $100,000 loan for 10 year @ 2.45% interest, you total payable interest will be 2.45%x100,000x10=$24500.<br><br>If you dont know rule78, you will probable assume that your monthly interest payment is 24500/10years/12month = $204.

I dun think anyone in the right mind will change a car within 1 year unless he has lots of cash to throw down the drain.<br><br>Also, there's not many finance product on the market without lock-in. Consumers are now acustomed  to some sort of freebies &amp; goodies thrown in. Matter made worse by dealer who insisted buyer take their in-hse finance or risk cash penalty.<br><br>1.6% interest may sound low now, but who knows it will go even lower.
