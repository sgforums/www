Got such thing meh?<br></div></blockquote>During the old days back in 1997, the car costs me $179k.  Hence $100k is not more than the value of the car.  It is a Ver 3 Japan Spec 280 PS model.  The list is very long.  Basically, the engine was blueprinted overseas.  In Sg no one can do it locally.  The engine block was crack tested, even the gearbox bell housing.  Pistons were all done up and strengthened.  Molydenum coated and later HPC coated.  The conrods were from Carillo and they are Titanium with additional bearings oil galleries.  The gundgeon, conrod and head pins are ARP made, aircraft grade.  The piston rings are chrome moly and gapless.  All combustion chambers are ported and polished leaving no casting marks.  Chambers are all cc flowed.  The engine is a close decked one.  The heads are also cc:ed.  The valves are 3 angled grinded.  The valve springs are all changed.  Head gaskets are metal ones with CR at 8.0:1.  The cams were retained as they are the highest lift available for a street driveable car.  Flywheel is also chrome moly and light at 6kg plus.  Anything lower, you can forget about going up slope.<br>The clutch is a 3 puck one with copper linings, unsprung.  Can take up to 3600lbs of pressure.  Gearbox is retained at 4.1 final drive to ensure have top speed.  Turbo is a 360 thrust bearing, double fin TD05 20G.  The reason for not going to TD06 is the driveablility.  You don't want a car which is only good at 40 tiang in LCK.  You also want it fast on the roads, b roads, track etc.  Body is seam welded to take the twisting force of the engine.  All driveshafts were upgraded.  ECU is an Autronic SM2 which initially, I was running Apexi Power FC.  At 1 bar, the car produces 350HP and 500nm of torque.  at 1.7 bar, it is like close to 490HP with 610nm of torque.  You also need a FMIC which cooler air is needed to keep pinging down to a minimum.  Was using Trust.  0-100 was tested at 4.2s which is modest when compared to a Spec C out of factory which can do 4.3s.  Rims were 16" Compomotive Rally Spec which were later upgraded to Speedlines.  All components are dynamically balanced right up to the nut securing the flywheel and clutch.  Mind you, the car is only 1200kg full tank.<br><br>The turbo lag was minimum because of the choice of turbo.  Was not aiming for all right HP claims but more on driveability.  The GTTi conversion, is still running on a mechanical turbo.  Lean it out in between gear changes, check injector duty cycles etc.  It will help with an after market ECU.  Not all turbo cars have lag unless they are running on a ridiculously large turbo.  Even the Merc Diesel Turbo taxi will have them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br><br>I did not keep the car for long as the COE and OMV was too high.  Now I think it is in NZ as the next owner crashed it big time.  Right now, I don't even mod much as the money can be used for other better purposes.  The money spent previously can be used to buy property.  So my advice to would be modsters, stay clear of this hobby else you will never know where your money go to.  Best if to buy a car which is already fast out of factory.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

As you know, the more air compresses, the hotter it gets.  Plus the top mount gets heat soaked especially in a WRX.  The Evo is an inline 4 hence the pipings are shorter, air travels lesser distance so FMIC is ideal.  For the boxer engine, the pipings are damn long for an FMIC, hence Subaru retained the TMIC.  The bigger the intercooler, the more pressure needed to push the air thru, hence it needs to be built up.<br>Trade off is, the air going into the throttle body and engine is much cooler with a bigger intercooler or a FMIC.<br>To run high boost, yes, the CR needs to be lower...it has to be considered carefully.  Example, Civics EG6 withy CR more than 10:1 wants to be TC'ed, CR needs to be lowered to prevent detonation and overheating.</div>

Most of the cars come with plumb back valves, meaning it goes back in instead of venting out to atmosphere. Wrx, evos, A4t all inclusive.  Most cars run on MAF, Mass Air flow sensor to determine amount of fuel to apportioned to the amount of air going into the engine.  If it vents out (the reading of air is taken before air is vented out) using BOV into atmo, most of the ECUs will think that the amount of car going into the engine is much much more....but actually less air is going (because vented out to atmo)......fuelling will be super rich and you will get bad fuel consumption, poor power etc etc.<br><br>Rex and Evo have plumb back BOVs as standard fixtures.
