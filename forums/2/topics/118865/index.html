            <div class='col-md body'>its best to check ur psi on ur tyres? i got a thread on tyre pressure before.. maybe u can do a search on it.<br><br>most of the tyres out there is 220. so go to the petrol station and turn the knob to 220 and pump till the bell stops ringing..<br><br>but just to be safe, check the sides of ur tyre or door sill for the suggested/intended air pressure before start pumping.<br><br>hope ur FC increases after pumping air.. cheers.</div>

But think of it as if you are driving a manual transmissions car; when you are driving on expressway on 5th, you want to overtake a vehicle infront of you, so you'd shift one lever down (4th) for more power. This process is similar of to the Tiptronic.<br><br>I didn't know Honda City also got Tiptronic, which is nice to have.<br><br>Your FC is consider very good already, considering yours an auto ride. My FC is around there also; my best was 18+ but average at around 16+ when I rev a bit plus air-con. Of course, mine is a manual ride, stock.</div>
