But if you are just concern about your engine when you found that your FC is low, then I guess your friends have already confirmed that it is normal. Then just drive normal.

That rule have to be use together with all the other 11 rule. Cannot be the case of when you off your aircon when running below 80km/h, you floor your accelerator once time you move off a stop. Then back to square 1 lah! Actually offing your aircon should give you a few extra HP too, maybe you too pedal-happy you forgotten to watch your foot.<br><br>.....OR......you actually have already off air-con all the way? So now you on air-con beyond 80kmh is actually increasing your air-con usage.</div>
