            <div class='col-md body'>Hi im new here, have been lurking around this forum for quite some time already.<br><br>Anyway, after reading this post, i decided to share with you my experience on tailgaters. Few weeks back, i was cruising along the NS highway at a speed of about 110km/h, then as i checked my rear view mirror, this particular proton perdana (?) was tailgating me so closely and boy was it a powerful car. So, i increased my speed, in hopes that car would get off my back. However, i got increasingly frustrated as he was still tailgating me at about 150km/h. Then i came up with any idea  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  i changed lane and let that car pass, then i swerved back and went behind to tailgate it instead  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  He simply sped off and i was following quite closely behind, i wanted to give he a taste of his own medicine. That was when i jammed that S (sport mode) button on my gear shift. I then chased him for quite some time up to 210 km/h. Finally he changed lane and let me pass.<br><br>So the moral of the story: Don't back back, get even with them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
