The vehicle flew over the road divider and crashed head-on with a BMW before flipping over and smashing into a van in another lane.<br><br>Lee, a warehouse supervisor, reportedly drives a Fiat Punto HGT Â— a high-performance car that was a gift from his father Â— and had no intention of buying the Mazda.<br><br>He escaped unhurt in the accident but Ms He Â— the only child of an odd-job labourer and a bakery assistant Â— died in hospital.<br><br>Lee, who was Ms He's last customer for the day, was later arrested but released on $10,000 bail.<br><br>The five BMW passengers were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties and chest pains, while the van's occupants, a couple, escaped unscathed.</span><br><br>Lee, <strong>who will appear in court on June 18 </strong>for a pre-trial conference, faces a maximum five-year jail term if found guilty. Yesterday, his lawyer Julian Tay said his client was "haunted" by the accident.<br><br><span style="color: olive;">Earlier this month, the youth incurred the rage of Netizens and car enthusiasts after he wrote in a motoring forum that he was shopping for sports cars and could not decide between a Subaru WRX and a Volkswagen Golf GTI. Many were angry that he was allowed to drive while investigations were ongoing.<br><br>Yesterday, Lee's indictment sparked a host of comments on several Internet forums.<br><br>"He is boasting about which sports car to buy ... Does he look like he has been 'haunted'?" asked Flyer_king, in a sammyboy.com post.<br><br>Aside from the criminal charge, Lee also faces civil proceedings brought against him by other parties in the accident. According to lawyer Daniel Goh, who is acting for the driver of the BMW, his client is suing Lee for damage caused to the former's car as well as injuries suffered by those in it. </span><br><br>9 more days..</div>

Yeah, no amount of blame pushing will do anything, but it can spur those who ARE making the decisions to react faster.<br><br>The new question is that how will his punishment match his deeds? Is there a standard guide for crime punishment? Take a life = 50yrs in jail? Who and how can punishment be determine? Is it fair? Who will determine if its bias? How much does someones life worth? Who determines the values? Doubt you can answer that.<br><br>And at lease i'm trying to be nice, YOU on the other hand, try to snub people with your witty comment when people are discussing their THOUGHTS &amp; OPINIONS, and i dont care what u think of it. If you cant take in other people's thoughts and opinion and take it in strides, then it speaks MORE on the arrogance, ignorance and that red-neck ego of yours then mines.<br><br>And dont <strong>EVEN</strong> try to read another post if you, or anyone, cant spend the time. Its quite insulting of you to pretend you care when you dont.<br><br>Still not happy? Then go some other forum where they take in England-english-wannabes who snubs on other's english yet blindly ignore his own lack of paragraphing.
