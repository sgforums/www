'Would really like to own the GTI, but an extra $10k in car price would mean i gotta eat less every month ...lol...What you guys think?' ('lol' stands for 'laughing out loud' in online forum parlance.)<br><br>Discussions had begun on a cordial note, with forum participants offering their personal assessments of the GTI and the WRX.<br><br>Soon enough, someone recalled that Mr Lee was the one at the wheel of the Mazda MX-5 in the crash that left 22-year-old sales executive Angelia He Xueli dead.<br><br>That was when civility went out the window.<br><br>'Put him behind bars,' went the posting by Hamster Fest.<br><br>Legendkiller declared: 'He can run but he cannot hide. I will do my best to ensure that he does not get to drive another car again.'<br><br>The online attack spilled into other online forums such as Sammyboy.com and Hardwarezone.<br><br>In the latter, the discussion thread in the current affairs section pulled in a whopping 63,000 views - more than 50 times the average number that other topics in the section attract.<br><br>On the day of the accident, Mr Lee took a $110,000 Mazda MX-5 convertible for a test-drive.<br><br>Barely five minutes into the drive, while along Upper Paya Lebar Road, Mr Lee lost control of the MX-5, a car known for its above-par road-holding.<br><br>The car flew over the divider, smashed head-on into a black BMW, flipped over it and came crashing down onto a van on another lane.<br><br>He was unhurt, but Ms He died an hour later in hospital.<br><br>Mr Lee was arrested but was released on bail.<br><br>He has not been charged to this day, and police said yesterday that investigations were still being carried out.<br><br>Since the accident, Upper Paya Lebar Road has been repaved and realigned. Mazda Motor (Singapore) has received an insurance payout for the badly crushed MX-5, which is believed to have been scrapped.<br><br>Mr Lee could not be contacted for comment.<br><br>Hardwarezone member James Ng, 25, when asked why he thought forum participants have come down so hard on Mr Lee, said it probably had to do with the perception that justice had not been served, and that 'he still has his driving licence and he still poses a danger to others'.<br><br>Mr Ng, an undergraduate at SIM University, said forum posters were assuming Mr Lee was responsible for the accident.<br><br>He added that people also had not forgotten that it cost the life of a young woman.<br><br>christan@sph.com.sg<br><br>NETIZENS SAY<br><br>'He can run but he cannot hide. I will do my best to ensure that he does not get to drive another car again.'<br>LEGENDKILLER<br><br>'He still has his driving licence and he still poses a danger to others.' </blockquote><a href="http://alphas.blogs.friendster.com/alphas/2007/03/who_is_he.html" rel="nofollow">Do you think its really him?</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well one thing for sure , the police are really very slow in their investigations but anyway what else is there to investigate that they need to take such a long time ? The smell of the tyre ? Or is the guys father trying to make some personal settlement out of court ? By considering to buy another sports car , obviously he is not feeling guilty at all . And to cut long story short , i wish he will die in a similar car accident alone if he should drive agn , or die as a passenger in a car driven by a stranger . The laws of retribution will come to him one day ... sooner or later ...</div>

Thank you to all who provided your condolences and best wishes, and for lending me your support in this cause.<br><br>Once again, like a good lecturer, I will recap the things we learnt in this thread<br><br>1. Name of driver: Regan Lee<br>2. Nick in MCF: Dracon<br>3. CRIME: Killing a Mazda SE, who accompanied him as a passenger during a test drive.<br>He had no intention to buy the car then, could never in his life afford it, and merely wanted to impress the gal.<br>4. Works for: HMT Pte Ltd<br>5. Stays at: Hume park in bukit timah<br>6. Son of: a "prominent citizen" warehouse supervisor/ alternatively sonofabitch<br>7. mobile: 91057558<br>8. current hobbies: test driving cars he cannot afford to buy, sometimes killing one or two passengers in the process<br>9. Frequents: KTVs and sex joints<br>10. Drives: Yellow Fiat Punto HGT.<br>11. And the million dollar question: Is he the son of a big shot?: No way in hell. As i mentioned, if his father is of any significant social standing in Singapore, then most of us can form the ruling council of the United Galaxies of the milky-way.<br></div></blockquote>Someone reported seeing him on the road ... stared at him and gana the middle finger from him???!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
