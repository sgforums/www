B) have to cover himself and left the building?<br><br>all this was just a helping hand of his friends who gang up with him to help him to get over with the media... hey regan Lee , your tricks   s u c k s     la , next time try another way , okay? who the hell will buy your car and besides , if u really sold your car , do u still need to be in the building while u have been ordered to resign last year? wat the hell are u doing there then?<br><br>"'The speculation is just making trouble for our car.
