            <div class='col-md body'>HIS name, picture and contact details have been splashed all over the Internet and newspapers.<br><br>But the man who has been fingered as the driver of the fateful Mazda MX-5 has remained silent through it all.<br><br>The New Paper called the main telephone line of his company on Wednesday and asked for him by name.<br><br>The receptionist transferred the call immediately.<br><br>The man subsequently answered 'Yes' when we asked for him by name. But when we told him we were from The New Paper, his tone changed.<br><br>'Please don't call my office line,' he snapped.<br><br>When we asked if he had seen the earlier press report on the recent Internet talk about the crash, he said: 'There are a lot of things wrong about it, but I don't wish to comment.'<br><br>He then hung up.<br><br>We also called the handphone number posted on the forums, but it had been disconnected.<br><br>The New Paper team then went to his workplace in Tuas for a third try to clarify claims with him.<br><br>In the company's parking lot was a yellow Fiat Punto HGT - the same model of car that his father had reportedly bought for him shortly before the accident.<br><br>At about 5.45pm, three young men, none of whom resembled the picture of the supposed driver, came out of the building and got into the Fiat.<br><br>One of the men, who refused to give his name, said he was a worker there. He got out of the car to speak to us while the other two drove off.<br><br>He claimed that the man named on the forums had quit the company early last year.<br><br>He also claimed that the supposed driver had sold the yellow Fiat to one of them.<br><br>'The speculation is just making trouble for our car. Please (tell the public), don't tailgate our car, it endangers our lives,' he said.<br><br>But when The New Paper told him that we spoke to the supposed driver that morning through the office line, he changed the subject.<br><br>ZOOMED OFF<br><br>At 6.15pm, the yellow Fiat returned to the factory complex. Twenty minutes later, we saw that it was driven to the back of the factory. A metal gate was pulled behind it to block it from view.<br><br>Five minutes later, a medium-built man came out of the building with a group of other men.<br><br>We could not see his face as he was wearing a motorcycle helmet with the visor pulled down, his head lowered.<br><br>Then he got onto a motorbike and zoomed off as we flagged at him to stop.<br><br>At about 7.30pm, the security guard locked the gates of the complex.<br><br>The New Paper had also sent an online message to the driver via his supposed forum-user identity, but he did not respond.<br><br></div>

It doesn't make sense at all.<br>So there's tis loop-hole, &amp; those jerks like tat guy out there<br>can still go to 2nd-hand market &amp; ease their itchy hands.<br><br>Hmm.. travelling on authorised route?<br>Mazda Motor has their own authorised route for test-drive, yes.<br>In fact, all dealers &amp; auto companies hav their own authorised routes.<br>Tat stretch of wavy test-route which e accident happened<br>is an "under-construction" site with steel roads &amp; lotsa curve roads<br>It was one of e test-routes my company authorise for customers<br>to drive to our workshop.<br>I would say it's freakin dangerous under normal road conditions already,<br>&amp; he's drivin a MX5 &amp; speeding during PEAK hours.<br><br>But bein a 2nd-hand sales exec b4,<br>i would say 95% customers will follow e route instructed to em.<br>Jus tat 5% incl white-collar workers, some newbie drivers some even<br>Directors or CEO of companies, will try play punk wif us,<br>by tellin us they know e area better than us, &amp;<br>"politely" requesting a longer (unauthorised) road such as<br>expressways to test out speeds betw 70kmh to 90kmh,<br>&amp; stuffs like wheels alignments, etc,<br>&amp; whether e engine vibrates or gets noisy at higher speed.<br>All these r unavoidable, &amp; we as sales exec been thru countless times,<br>but most sales exec jus suck-thumb.<br><span style="color: red;">Most Sales exec will oblige e customers &amp; allow them their way,<br>thinkin e "Customers r always right" policy,<br>&amp; also didn't want to offend e customers in fear of losing this<br>sales opportunity.</span><br>Everyday as car sales exec, jus to earn a living,<br>we hav to outrightly put our lives in e hands of these drivers, really.<br>Jus for tat few hundred bucks commission, we literally put our lives at stake<br>everytime we go out for testdrives.<br>I feel for e lady &amp; her family too.<br><br>The only thing i can think of is by forming a network among dealers<br>for information sharing. Request their Identity Card to b kept in a folder,<br>while they bring their license with em to test-drive. Dealers r not to even<br>peek into e folder as it's confidential customers' information.<br>If e customer fools around during test-drive, the auto-dealer company<br>will hav e authority to note down e particulars of tat driver &amp; log it in e<br>shared network tat only authorised dealers will gain access. This will warn<br>others of potentially dangerous drivers out there on test-drive spree,<br>so next time e fellow enters another dealer, he'll be rejected e rights to<br>test-drive, or otherwise, e sales execs can be more cautious of ppl like him.<br><br>Jus my vague suggestion to authorities such as e Singapore Automobile<br>Dealership Association &amp; others.</div>
