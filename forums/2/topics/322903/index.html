              <p>Oil is a commodity.</p>
              <p>Its rumored that speculators or investors are causing it.</p>
              <p>Is it legal to :</p>
              <p>&gt; setup a company and buy oil in bulk and keep it somewhere cheap. Given that oil price will continue to go up, would it be legal to keep buying oil but hold it,  as in not to sell it until a later time when the price is even much higher , and profit from it?</p>
              <p>&gt; gather as many investors as possible, collectively buy as much oil as possible. Keep for sometime until the supply is showing problem?</p>
              <p>I mean, if the rumored investors can get away with doing that and seems that nothing can be done about price speculation and investors, can I say that it is legal or can get away with this?</p>
              <p>Pls let me know what you think about this idea.</p>

              <p>Im sure its legal but the execution of such a business proposal is financial unfeasible as the costs of doing so outweighs the benefits. Here are the reasons why:</p>
              <p>1) You do not have the proper storage facilities and technical know-how to conduct proper oil storage. Keeping oil in its barrelled from requires regular maintanence as it is after all a flammable and hazardous commodity. What about rental costs of a factory and the respective costs of hiring respective manpower?</p>
              <p>2) In Singapore, im sure you need a permit to do so. How long would you need to apply for it and for how long does it take for you to be granted one, given the protectionist policy of our governement towards the oil industry?</p>
              <p>3) Assuming you get points no. 1) and 2) right, what about your sources? Its definite that you would be purchasing oil at its already lofty market price and even paying more for it if your unlucky. Upon doing so, what about the costs of import tax, duty tax and the relevant logistical and transportation costs?</p>
              <p>The relevant costs as stated above makes your proposal excessively risky and outweighing the potential benefits if any, assuming oil price DOES continue to rise. Probably oil will have to hit USD$200 for you to break-even and hit it fast before your creditors come knocking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These rumoured speculators participate in the upward price movement of oil through speculation of oil related derivatives. Such future contracts would normally include the barrels of Brent Crude Oil and North Sea Sweet Crude as the underlying asset. Its highly unlikely that they(the speculators) would hoarde oil in its physical form and thus create an aggregate supply shock to the world economy.</p>
