Honda City has 8 spark plugs for the 4 cylinder engine. Friend drove one and says that he can cover 700km on a full tank of petrol. But you know Honda lah, always come with expensive insurance. Market spoiled by those EG, EK ah bengs who keep on crashing their hondas. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok,.. my bad.. i read it as honda wave- a bike. Honda Airwave is not bad. 1.5 litre with V-tec engine! But i am just afraid it may underperform since its quite big. then again, I kw Honda makes good engine for a japanese marque. But I would prefer the city or accord for the look. I haven't seen many Honda Airwave on the road.</div>

Normally the car workshop will get you a equilvalent from the car rental company during the repair period. Cos all the cost for rental already cost into the repair cost especially continental car.

            <div class='col-md body'>If Honda car insurance and parts are cheap I don't mind getting a Civic, a City is not bad but base on the look it turn alot of ppl off. For common ppl who drive a Nissan,Mazda 3 or Conti car they will be more concern about the FC, for those who drive a Mit lancer know that the gear Box is ex. In the past many ppl know Mazda is not reliable. And for ppl who drive a Toyota for many years, they normally don't have much worry about their car. Thai made is here for 3 years liao, didn't hear much problem except you guys compliant about it cheapo interior. To me engine and gearbox is more important than anything else.</div>

The Vios started on the right foot as a young man's car but recently its image has been marred by the Beng owners who did everything to make the car look as close as possible to a typical Beng Civic.<br><br>Whichever model you finally choose, do yourself a favour:<br>DON'T<br>1. Use midnight black solar film;<br>2. Add clothes-hanger spoilers;<br>3. Add side skirting that seems that is "added-on";<br>4. Choose black rims with chrome outline;<br>5. Hang oversized illuminated dice;<br>6. Install 6 to 9 units of fake speedometers (and what have you);<br>7. Stick after-market brand decals on the side of the front doors:<br>8. Iluminate the interior with sleazy blue neon light;<br>9. Remove the Brand and Model logos (coz' you can never pretend it's a bimmer);<br>10. Drive as if your ride is a V6 3500cc (BECAUSE IT'S NOT &amp; IT WILL NEVER BE!);<br><span style="color: red;">11. Oh, stick your freaking right hand out of the window holding a cigarette </span>(coz' you will never ever achieve the Chow Yun Fatt coolness no matter how you try);<br>12. BEHAVE LIKE A YOUNG AH BENG WHO IS HIGH AND ALMIGHTY AND A NUISANCE OF A ROAD HAZARD!!!!<br><br>Have a good ride!</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since ppl here are talking about FC, I have somthing to share.<br>When you drive, do you look at the rpm? I drive my nephew Accent and when it hit 80km/h the rpm was 3k. When I drive Mazda 3 at 70-80km/h somtime it hit 3 gear as shown on the display, then I drive Altis it was 2k at rpm from 75-80km. On a manual car, at 80km/h the rpm is about 3k using fifth gear.<br>I know you will say is the gear ratio, but when so call VVT or VVTi come into picture what are they for? seem like the i alone make alot of different.<br><br>When ppl say mazda 3 (1.2 ton) is heavier then Altis(1.1 ton) then why issit 0.1 ton  can make alot of different in FC. And I heard Mazda 3 is using a old engine on 323, issit true?<br><br>I think the technology use by different manufacturer do play a part on a car FC<br>If City is using a better technology then it is worth considering, but base on the feedback from Jazz owner after 2 years the car is giving alot of problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Base on spec given Mazda 3 is 1197-1209kg with power of 77-79kw/rpm and torque of 145 @ 4000rpm.<br><br>And Altis is 1115-1175kg with power @ 81kw and 150 @ 3800rpm.<br><br>Unless you put 17" rim for Mz 3 if not unless the spec given by MM is Bullshit! as you say is 1.3 ton not 1.2!<br><br>The different of torque is only 5Nm with 200rpm diff and why not power???<br>My conclusion is the technology they use make the different after all.<br>One is VVT and the other is VVTi.<br><br>At 80km/h their rpm is different liao, and behind the engine is the gear box , and both gear box are 4 speed. Why can the rpm be different?</div>
