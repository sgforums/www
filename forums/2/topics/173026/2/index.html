Average Lancer's FC is 12kpl, Vios is 15kpl (There are better figures for this 2 cars, but I am assume generally the average). Assuming normal milage of 20,000 per year. In 10 years, you will be losing S$5k for lancer on a S$1.5 per litre petrol. If drive more, or fuel price increase, then good luck. But if spacious-ness is important, I guess Lancer is a much better bet than even sunny.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kentheman:</div><div class="quote_body">u can try the chevy aveo. was doing my solar film at one of the workshop and there is this aveo doing his too. talk to him and its FC is quite good. and also, it looks small on the outside, but inside is spacious. worth considering.</div></blockquote>Aveo's FC is as bad as Getz. Because I almost bought this car, so I have been following its FC report contributed by various Aveo drivers. Lightest foot can do 14kpl, while others will do about 11-12kpl. Manual's figures only, cause if fuel is really that important to you, auto should never come into the picture.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Passionate-Shalom:</div><div class="quote_body">Automatic saves alot energy mah.. haha..  further more i might be driving to Malaysia, long distance.. If manual, reach there.. already.. zzzz </div></blockquote>I drove both auto and manual car up and down KL before. My experience with auto cars on the highway isn't that good. Simply because I can't get the power I want as and when I want. Even though I release and floor to cause the down-shift, it is still slow as I don't know how to get a auto car to down-shift by 2 without causing a decrease in speed. Thus it is very hard to over-take cars. For manual, I will just down gear from 5th to 3rd, rev the rpm up. Power comes more willingly and more confidence when overtaking. Just a thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I don't really have a good impression of Lancer cars, expecially their engines. They do sound 'hollow' and forced. Civic's pricing is at 72k minimum, though for that you are getting state-of-art wizardry and 1.8L Vtec power. But I guess it's out of your budget.<br><br>For Korean cars, they have improved by leaps and bounds, but they are still losing on engine technology in my opinion. Not forgetting to mention the dull interiors for most.<br><br>As for Vios, so sorry, it's just so common on the road, and while I admit the engine's good and it's fast, it is not spacious, and there are no vanity mirrors on the passenger's side. Driver's side has one tacky small reflector which is attached by velcro. The car seems like it's put together with a very painful budget, and it is.<br><br>However, it seems like you already have your mind on the Lancer, and are hoping for us forumnites to comment favorably on it, to justify your choice. Well my advice ultimately is this - no matter which car you buy, the most importantly thing is YOU like it, not others. Then you will be able to stick with the car for many ages to come.
