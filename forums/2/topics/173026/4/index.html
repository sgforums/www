            <div class='col-md body'>If $50k is your absolute max, then I would say the best value cars are:-<br><br>1. Kia Rio<br>2. Hyundai Getz<br>3. Toyota Vios<br><br>Depends on where your priorities lie but my personal choice would be the Getz as I find the Vios a bit boring shape-wise and I have doubts over the Rio's build quality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have test driven the new Getz 1.4A and found it to be reasonably responsive. Downside was the ride was a bit bouncy. Went over some undulations on Alexandra Road ata round 80km/h and had to slow down coz the car started to bounce too much.<br><br>If you want a bit more performance then the 1.6M is a bargain at around $47k.<br><br>I'm also in the market for a new car but as my budget is $60k, I'm planning to get the Swift 1.5A at $53,500. Excellent ride/handling; good refinement and nice interior. Only downside is the Auto box is a bit sluggish.</div>

However, I think the savings will be wiped out by the COE going up as all the people who have been waiting for the ARF drop, jump in to buy their cars.<br><br>At the end of the day, I think the effective price will be similar to now.</div>
