            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Passionate-Shalom:</div><div class="quote_body">hmm.. alright that will be great.<br><br>Here is the list:<br><br>Mitsubishi Lancer,  2006 Subaru Impreza Ts Sedan, Honda Jazz, Honda Civic, Toyota Vios, Toyota Corolla Altis, Mitsubishi Colt, mazda 3.<br><br>These are the cars currently on my mind, if you have better suggestions, please feel free to add on to it.<br><br>Thanks.</div></blockquote>Lancer - I have mentioned before. Cheap. hollow engine, nice interior, subjective appearance. Not especially poweful nor fuel-economical.<br><br>Subaru Impreza - Super cheap now. But I have driven a WRX before and frankly, while the car is alright, their service sucks, and they will rip you off for maintenance. My money was stolen then when I left it inside the car ($80++). They gave me poorer grade engine oil for what I originally ordered. Nor forgetting the fact that their management bears the wrath of many Subaru owners thanks to their reckless price slashing and blatant ignorance of customer loyalty. I know of many buy-eyed owners who will be stuck forever with their rides, and even for the newer models too. Overall, car is good with boxer engine, but consumes hell lot of petrol. AWD is not really necessary in Singapore. Interior is very plain but functional.<br><br>Honda Jazz - It's a hatch you know? And the pricing is out of your budget. Overall, it's Japan's best selling car, it beat the Corolla, so the truth speaks for itself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Honda Civic - Pricey, around 70++K, but is exceptionally smooth, high-tech and unbeatable value for money in my opinion.<br><br>Vios - Fuel-saving, fast, but dull interior and too common on the road. Less than 50k though.<br><br>Altis - Singapore's favorite car. When I saw it last week, I was rather disappointed - some may feel the wood furnishing looks classy, but to me it is just too plain and 'ah pek'. Engine is world-class of course. Only thing I like is the digital air-con climate control. Looks better than the old Corolla too.<br><br>Colt - Cute little car, though a bit too tall even for a hatchback. Preppy little engine and cosy interior. Engine wise I believe to be same as Lancer.<br><br>Mazda 3 - Beautiful exterior, beautiful interior. Unfortunately engine not as smooth and rather noisy at times. But this car is a looker, inside and outside. Turn on the inner lights at night and you'll see what I mean. But dun expect it to be a roomy car. It isn't. At 62K, it is a lot cheaper, though out of your budget.<br><br>Citroen C3 - At less than 50K (!!), this car is pretty to look at, continental, and has a very teutonic interior with luxurious furnishing expected of continentals. Very slow though, unless you get the 1.6L. Very safe. But as with most contis, expect it to drink more.<br><br>City - I'm buying it, because of the F1 style gear shifts on the wheel and also for practicality. Mid 50k's, it has a responsive engine, big trunk, pretty interior and one of the best fuel consumptions around. Cons: Its look are kinda subjective, rather like the Latio.<br><br>Whew, hope that helps you some. All of the above are in IMHO, so no arguments please. I have personally viewed all of them, and test-drove some, hence my comments. I believe experience varies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

When you are bleeding through your wallet the next time something happens to people's oil tank, then regret already too late. Anyway, you are going to be in the car most of the time anyway!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Unique taste, ...... everyone thinks it is ugly, only those who look beyond that are really ones with unique taste.

            <div class='col-md body'>Passion - i was like you comparing btw a lancer and a vios as i am/was going to share with my gf....<br><br>i reached a decision, the Vios.<br><br>Why?<br><br>1. Vios = DOHC (high compression/more power)<br>Lancer = SOHC (Low compression/good for turbo charging)*<br><br>2. Vios = 4 Disc brakes (Better stopping power)<br>Lancer = 2 Disc 2 drums(rear) ... (although drums better on lower speeds)<br><br>3. Vios = VVTi (power/torque when i need it)<br>Lancer = ??? (Not even MIVEC)<br><br>* = correct if wrong</div>
