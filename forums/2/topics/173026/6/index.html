When last time I select my car, I want very much to keep it within the budget I set of S$62.5k. Then my bro start bringing me to some test-drive like Jazz (S$71k then), TS, Lancer, City. I almost would have fallen and got a lancer (S$63k then) if I haven't chanced on my little kelisa.<br><br>Basically what I am trying to say here is the more you looked the more you want to get your dream car and the more you over-estimate your budget. Now with kelisa, I found that I just barely surviving. If I have gotten a Lancer or Aveo then, the fuel expense would set me poorer then I am now.</div>

It is more a individual car. Anyway, I think Civic is a good buy no matter how ex it is. It is just a matter of whether you can afford it. As long as your dad is still working, I think he should be old enough to do some calculations, or you can do for him and explain using figuares that it might be over-budget. But I don't think old people would go for Vios, I think rather Altis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got this price at sgmart, altis priced at 54,488, inclusive of COE.  Vios i think can be made a family car.. see how u look at it and your budget. But I suppose Vios is more recommended for a smaller size body as I believe it can get a little cramp.</div>

Ask you, when you see a vios drive pass you, normally you expect a young driver of less than 35years old, single driver or with only GF, OR you expect a middle-aged driver 40 odd, taking a family of 4 out.</div>
