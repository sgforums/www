Review was that the old Civic 1.6 easily top TS in term of handling and thus there goes its only good point. Small cabin too. So ultimately, it is still a fun car instead of a practical one.</div>

So if after getting your license, if possible, get a manual car. With constant driving, 2 months later, you will be shifting gears naturally.<br><br>Secondly, even my manual kelisa can drive up sheares bridge with total driver/passenger load of 330kg, 80kph and accelerating.

So to the gentleman who's interested in lancer, go ahead, I believe the latest pricing could well be another 1k lower than last month's. The new facelifted model will be available at the leng kee C&amp;C show room, so have a look there and not take others comments too hard...<br><br>for a sports edition manual, last month's lowest I heard after all the rebates is abt $48.5k<br><br>I predict this month it can go to $47k.

So to the gentleman who's interested in lancer, go ahead, I believe the latest pricing could well be another 1k lower than last month's. The new facelifted model will be available at the leng kee C&amp;C show room, so have a look there and not take others comments too hard...<br><br>for a sports edition manual, last month's lowest I heard after all the rebates is abt $48.5k<br><br>I predict this month it can go to $47k. Good catch..jus imagine..it was sold for $75k 2-3yrs back..</div></blockquote>Ai ya, all of our comments said nothing about the outter appearance of Lancer, as a matter of fact, I think most of us think it is very nice looking. It is the engine we are throwing bad reviews on, and only the auto CVT one, or should I say transmission ......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> So unless we are talking about "engine-life" or "transmission-life", else it is still the same old lancer to us.</div>
