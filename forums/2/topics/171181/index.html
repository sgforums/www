            <div class='col-md body'>The reason I didn't choose any FR cars for drifting in the game is because of its physics engine.  I chose 4wd cars because the problem didn't lie in entering the drift, but getting out of one.  I required grip and traction on the front wheels to get it out, thus playing with the torque settings for the front wheels.<br><br>The suspension I didn't really play around because those are the more touche settings I cannot seem to figure out, but lowering the spring height and stiffening should give a little bit of added handling.  I wouldn't play with the dampers if I were you, they don't seem to affect anything.  For the toe angle, the fronts should be 1.5 more than the back.  Try not to exceed 4 for either front and back.<br><br>LSD i din't mess around with it either because I'm not so pro. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  The 1.5 one works pretty well all round for me.  I've only managed to tune one perfect drift car using the 22B, it is simply impossible to spin yet goes ultimate sideways and out when I need to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The 86 if you want my frank opinion is impossible to tune for drift, the rear wheels rev way to much, just can't find the oomph. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I do know the torque distribution was somewhere with 30% front.  Super soft front tyres and medium at the back.  Car only had 522bhp.  Spring height all the way down, Rate all the way up.
