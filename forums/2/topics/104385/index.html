Your comments on the ignis and the other 2? any owners driving them? I went to test drive the ignis sport yesterday, pick up and road holding is good, stable at high speeds.<br><br><img src="http://www.suzukitafak.hu/new/isport.jpg&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.nextcar.com.au/i.mms04.suzuki.ignis.sport.JPG&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.suzuki.se/0203_sz/Bilmodeller/ignis_sport/bild/p06_07.jpg&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.anmo.dk/Suzuki/billeder/Ignis/sport/sport104.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ignis is marketed as the Swift in Japan.<br><br>It is being replaced by the new Swift.<br><br>There should be a new Sports version of the new Swift with a similar engine as the current Ignis/Swift Sports<br><br>Not sure if this will factor into yr buying decision.<br><br>Personally, I think the Recaros of the Ignis Sport look pretty dated. What's with the netting!!?<br><br>YRV Turbo looks IMHO too much like a mini van. And I really don't like Auto trannies.<br><br>Heard Colt Turbo here will be a 5 door auto version. Blech. If they can get around to bringing in the 3 door manual, it might be worth considering.<br><br>Personally, of the 3, I find the exterior of the Ignis the nicest of the lot. I am not terribly convinced that the new Swift looks better than the current Ignis/Swift, but the insides of the new Swift seems to look a lot better.<br><br>If I were u, and could afford to wait a while, I'd wait for the new Ignis Sport (whenever that gets launched)... hope they fix the Recaros <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Still getting the perenial nagging from Mum over my choice of ride.. hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .NVH(noise Vibration and HArshness) is kinda poor. Refinement is not your kind of priority when yer in this car. Exhaust emits a burble and constant hum at highway speeds. Dated Plastic feel for dashboard and interior. overlook all this short comings, and what you get is a car that feels really zippy and quick on its toes.(110Bhp)  Decently good Fuel economy too! Albeit the most 'anti social' of the lot.<br><br>On a more pratical note. the Colt Turbo would be excellent given its station wagon like configuration in the rear. The only down side would be the messy CVT transmission as well as the TURBO.( puts a big $$ dent on insurance premium). Excellent family transporter. with an evil alter ego (150BHP)<br><br>my car insurance premium is based on a normal 1.5L saloon car with 20%NCD. Note: it Aint a Performance car. so Dont let the Insurers Make u Pay that kind of Premium.<br><br>Daihatsu YRV turbo.. ahh the other punchy pocket rocket. though some would be critical of its outward appearence. Powered by a 1.3VVTI Engine( toyota owns the co.) n its Got a turbo to boot.(130BHP). the Speedometer and tachometer does a fancy startup sequence. Plus its a 5 door car. Easier to convince your S.O to the purchase. Only jig is the auto transmission as theres no manual. But it gives u stuff like a moon roof. and a front bonnet scoop for the intercooler. Note, the car signal stalk follows the European std.(i.e. left side) so when u depress the signal indicator.. be sure to take note, lest you get 2 wipers smiling at you on your windscreen.<br><br>Cheers!!<br><br>All in all the Colt turbo commands the highest price out of the 3.
