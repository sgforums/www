            <div class='col-md body'><br>I have been driving my Matrix for about 3.5 years now.  Enjoy the drive as it is comfortable although fuel consumption is high.  Had never gone to Komoco until two weeks ago as I found the sharp screeching sound in my front brake a bit unbearable after two years..  First time going there and was there in the morning at 9am.  Had to wait for about an hour before queue number is up.  Told them my problem and also want to check brake balancing and alignment.  Told them I need the car by 5 pm.  They told me I can collect my car about 4 to 5 pm.<br><br>I called them about 4.15 to check I can collect car and they told me they haven't even started checking my car!!  I was furious as I need to collect it by 5.  I wanted to cancel it but they say they will do it immediately and asked me to go there at 5pm.  I turned up at 5 and was told that they had checked the brake and not the rest of the items I asked for.  I decide to pay up ($75.00) and get on with it thinking that the sound will be gone.  But the problem is still there.<br><br>I wrote in to complain and asked for refund and they called me to say no refund but can do my car again.  They say will arrange with me but three days already and they haven't got back to me.  Can you blame me if I call them crook?<br></div>

My wife and I decided to change car.  The decision is easy now..  now like you I am getting from Tan Chong.  My Latio will be here in two weeks time.<br><br>Not that I care about the service failure from Hyundai when my Latio is coming.  But there is a need to let innocent people know that there are crook in big organisation.</div>
