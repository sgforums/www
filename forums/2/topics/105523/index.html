Under Toyota's new product and distribution strategy, the Mark X will serve as a leading vehicle series for Toyopet dealers, the leading channel in the medium-sized vehicle market.<br><br>This luxury-class vehicle was developed with the concept of creating a dynamic and stylish rear-wheel-drive sedan for a new era that evokes the sensation of driving, features handling that enhances the joy of driving, and cleverly utilizes light to create a comfortable interior, in addition to its outstanding safety and environmental performance.<br><br>Proportions suitable for a comfortable rear-wheel-drive vehicle convey the driving performance at a glance. A silhouette with a low center of gravity combines with a trapezoidal form to express dynamism and energy.<br><br>Sharp, deeply sculpted character lines and attractive surfaces, together with a three-lamp configuration for the headlights and an integrated rear bumper and diffuser, convey a sense of quality suitable for a luxury sedan.<br><br>Either a 3.0-liter or 2.5-liter V6 engine is paired with a Sequential Shift-matic transmission for a manual gear-shift feel (either a newly developed six-speed for 2WD or existing five-speed for 4WD). Additional driving pleasure suitable for a new platform comes from class-leading strong driving performance, excellent maneuverability and driving stability, as well as from high levels of quietness and riding comfort.<br><br>The Mark X features excellent and innovative lighting, including a large, advanced ceiling light that uses LEDs, as well as lights in other interior areas including foot areas and doors. The lighting patterns as well as the intensity of the illumination are controlled according to the circumstances to create a new interior feel, such as when a door is open or when driving.<br><br>Eight-way Power Seats with a seat cushion length adjustment function for both front seats, along with front passenger-specific audio controls and other features help ensure optimum comfort for front passenger as well as driver.<br><br>The rear seats have a reclining function and an electrically operated sunshade to ensure the optimum comfort can be extended to all onboard.<br><br>Safety features on all vehicles include a GOA (Global Outstanding Assessment) collision-safety body that has been further developed and, with a view toward lessening pedestrian injury, a body structure aimed at achieving world-class levels of head protection performance*2.<br><br>All vehicles achieve emission levels 75% lower than 2005 standards under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and TransportÂ’s Approval System for Low-emission Vehicles, and major grades boast fuel efficiency that exceeds by five percent the level called for by Japanese 2010 fuel efficiency standards</div>
