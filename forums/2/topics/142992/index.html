            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. I also dun no is it truth anot.. I had a friend who works as a service advisor in borneo motor told me that many of the newly car owners of vios complain that the engine is very noisy when the car is stationery.. and even on the road it is also quite noisy.. My fren also told me that since this year onwards, the engine is manfacture and assembly in thailand,  unlike last time the engine is manufacture in japan but assembly in thailand.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The quality of the interior platics is still not on par with the earlier Toyota models.  Vios is meant to be a budget car and dun expect anything special inside. Bear in mind that the rear seats cannot be folded down and the car is pretty light at 900++kg.<br><br>For that price I would be better off with a Lancer or Sunny thought in the long run, the petrol and road tax will be higher. According to one Sales Engineer from Toyota I spoke too when I was scouting around for a car, he mentioned that the car can only last for at most 5 years then problems start to surface.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But if you would want to look far ahead, toyota would be more durable.. Toyota is famous for her engine and auto transmission, one of my relatives is driving a 92 corolla and his engine is still prefectly good, unlike me who used to drive a 95 lancer, after 3 years the engine start to knock and the transmission also seems to have problem.. As for the petrol, it is proven that toyota with vvti engine is indeed very good and powerful, low Fc as compared to nissan sunny.. I also heard that nowadays lancer are manfacture in malaysia too.. So do you see the difference.. However if you make an comparsion, the price of a toyota vios or altis is higher than many other cars even they are assembly in thailand..<br><br>In fact for many and even all cars at most 5 years, then problems will start to surface, and it will depends on how well you maintain ur cars.. It is the reasons why the warranty is only 3years or 100,000km whenever comes first..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by win_ong81:</div><div class="quote_body">The quality of the interior platics is still not on par with the earlier Toyota models.
