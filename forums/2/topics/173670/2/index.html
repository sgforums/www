            <div class='col-md body'>For your information, Geely cars are being sold in Europe now and they have also attended the latest Detroit Car Show.<br><br>And to those who are jeering "Made in PRC" cars, come over and take a look at the "Made in PRC" BMWs, Audis, VWs, and Mercs. To most of us, we can even tell the difference in standards (by the way, the Audis A6s here are bigger than what you are getting in Singapore). Mark my words, very soon, most continental cars in Singapore would be "Made in PRC"!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey when they're finally up to standard AS AN INDEPENDENT CAR FIRM, we'll praise them. but until the time comes, expect the criticsm to come.<br><br>as for cases where already established car firms open manufacturing plants in china, u're forgetting that the manufacturing is done to their standards. the fitting is also done to their standards. The QC still has to be up to Audi, BMW, Mercedes etc 's standards. Ok? They have a written set of rules there saying, this is the minimal standard, if the finished product does not meet it, it is either rectified, or junked. So it doesn't make a difference whether it is made in china or made in USA. besides, maybe u dunno, but most car manufacture and assembly plants nowadays, are heavily reliant on robotics and largely automated. so all u need to do is to program a certain set of instructions into them, and they will work the same way whether they are in china or in europe. the quality is there, because at the top its still the Europeans, Japs n American car companies in charge.</div>
