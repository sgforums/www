            <div class='col-md body'>if you are driving at 100km/hr, and the volvo overtook you, it should be at least 110-120km/hr.  And if you chased from behind, you should be at least 120-140km/hr in order to catch up.  Why you don't just let it overtook you and that is? Why you need to chase after him and caused all the unnecessary?  Sometime accident happens in 1 to 2 secs only.  You better make a report to TP rather than taking risk.<br>Again, if he could overtook you from your left, means the centre lane was clear? then why you did not use the centre lane instead of the most right lane which is meant for overtaking only?  Sometime also need to ask oursleves first...<br>I will look out for that volvo....</div>

Was returning from uni after studying overnite. That guy, who must be in his mid 20s was with his gf in his car. I guess he wanted to show off and have some fun with his gf.

I just change to second lane and increased to 90kmph just to get away from him. But he happy, happy accelerate and do the same thing again :/<br><br>I decided enough was enough and honked n flashed lights at him.

There was once when a jaguar tried to bully me by cutting into my lane and slowing down although there were no cars in the front and all the other lanes were empty.<br><br>I was doing abt 100kmph on first lane at quite late nite. Was returning from uni after studying overnite. That guy, who must be in his mid 20s was with his gf in his car. I guess he wanted to show off and have some fun with his gf. So there he comes at 120kmph on second lane, cuts into my first lane and drops to 70kmph :/<br><br>I was irritated obviously as I was very tired from studying whole freaking day. I just change to second lane and increased to 90kmph just to get away from him. But he happy, happy accelerate and do the same thing again :/<br><br>I decided enough was enough and honked n flashed lights at him. He must have realised that I'm getting irritated and decreased his speed further.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I got pissed off and just held my horn button and used high beam.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I for sure irritated the hell out of him! lolz.. He left soon in like 20 or 30 seconds after that. lol.<br><br>Losers.</div></blockquote>No offense but ur actions are totally uncalled for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha. Think u guys misunderstood me =) I wasn't challenging him in anyway. I know whats the bhp for my sunny and his jag la <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Besides I am a p plate. I won't risk anything as stupid as that. I was just driving as per normal. U don't expect me to change to second lane and drop to 60kmph do u? 0.o<br>I was just "asking" him to go away and leave me alone...<br>IF i wanted to "challenge" him then i wont accelerate and stop at 90kmph :/ I would keep on accelerating past 120, 130 and so on... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>---EDIT---<br>I think u guys misunderstood my this statement becoz of the way I phrased it: "I just change to second lane and increased to 90kmph just to get away from him."<br>I meant that i just change lane and resume my normal speed and just continue driving normally. Didn't even make eye contact with that guy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
