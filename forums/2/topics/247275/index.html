            <div class='col-md body'>i was driving my car-a 1.1L white hyundai getz on CTE at the speed of 100km/h at the extreme right lane, on the way back to jurong. i saw a car going quite fast from my back, the next thing i knew, the car overtook me from the left. the driver swerved so close from my left that our side mirror almost hit each other. its a 2L volvo s80. so i tried to catch up with him, just to take a look who is behind that wheel. when he know i try to catch up with him, he slow down and went to my left side of my car. The worst thing is, he tried to corner me to crash into the wall while in the CTE tunnel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> then he speed up and went in front of me, kept braking in front of me..is he hoping i crash into his bumper?.. i heard that if that if 'suay suay' back car crashed into the front car's butt, still gotta to compensate front car even if not back car's fault?... very 'ze er' if really like that.<br><br>when i drove a small car, i already prepared to be bullied but didn't thought that some big cars will be so mean to try to play with people's life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  even when the driver saw i was scared, he still tried to cut into my lane so close like trying to scare me.i tried to overtake him *haha just joking he 2L car.. me tried to shift to other lane but he kept trying to cut into my lane pretend to crash into me... you should have seen his grin..sha gua also know he purposely one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ... i know some big cars drivers, they play but at least not with people's life!!!<br><br>i hope if anyone with good skills and good cars, if you see this black volvo car on the road, pls 'bully' him.. sounds mean but if i was injured in the car crash today, who's the one who is too much and mean? i'm only 21,i don't wish to be a car accident victim even when i didn't do anything...<br><br>the driver is a young man around mid 20s short hair with a very arrogant smile. he is driving a black volvo S80 SGF58U.<br><br>dear people, does it mean that when those who drive big or fast cars, they have the right to bully the slow??? is there any justice to it? we young people are happy to have our own car, it may be slow but that doesnt mean that we can be bullied, am i right?<br><br>Ps:even no car, but thanks for listening to me grind about my bad bad day<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>expressway? if it's smooth traffic.. next time just jam ur brakes and slow to 30km/h then continue crawling at that speed. the volvo will leave sooner or later. anyway after u jam to 30kmh other cars will overtake u and be in between u and the volvo. then since got "new" car in front of u, try to follow the car in front of u and leave no space in between for the volvo to cut in, however, pls make sure u can see beyond the car in front of u (if it's SUV with glass tinted until 0% light transmittence then dun follow, wait for someone else to overtake n go in front of u first)<br><br>if all dun work, jam brakes n stop on expressway. if police come blame it on the volvo and say u juz avoiding accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was driving along the BKE weeks back in my 1.6 Lancer and a 3.0 V6 Honda Accord tried to play punk with me in a similar way. I prided myself as a defensive driver for the longest of time till he floored his brake so hard and I almost hit him on his back.<br><br>I took a moment to calm myself and studied the situation before I decided that enough is enough (There were no cars infront of him at all) The ah beng driver who was probably driving his dad's accord then taunted me with the constant switching on and off of his hazard lights.<br><br>So I signalled right, overtook, signalled left and cut into his lane... Jammed my brake and he came so close to me (almost hitting me) I could see the ah beng's face turned pale on my rear mirror.<br><br>Lesson learnt: Live and let live is applicable only in some situations.
