This car is created by Suzuki to re-join the JWRC after leaving this event for the past couple of years. Imagine this car used almost all the same cars part and body (including the 1.5 engine and suspension) that are used in the WRC rally car... except the following that applied to the WRC car only - the engine is re-bored to produce higher HP and KW, bigger brakes, roof ventilator (just like the STi spec C) and body kit protectors. As WRC focuses many different driving tarrains, Tarmac, Sandy, gravel and snow racing, the Ignis sport must be built to handle all these tested grounds. The old GTi type model with low suspension may not be fitting too well then... tarmac ground only?<br><br>The new Ignis Sport 2004 is already out using a bigger and more powerful 1.6 engine producing 160 KW. In the opening race held Jan 04, it has already clocked the 1st and 2nd position.<br><br>A good news is that it is now available in a newer and bigger 5 doors version. I hope it could reach to the showroom here soon. Of course the output will be cut by a lot but i believe would be still a fun drivable machine to own  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
