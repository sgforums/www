              <p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cash rebates, unrestricted use on Saturday to get motorists to switch to off-peak cars</span></strong><br></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is dangling more carrots to encourage more motorists to switch to off-peak cars. <br><br>By the end of January next year, motorists can use their off-peak cars on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saturdays and the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eves of the five main public holidays, namely New Year, Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali and Christmas. <br></span><br>Currently, owners of such cars have to buy a supplementary licence if they wish to drive their vehicles between 7am and 3pm on Saturdays. <br><br>But with the extended usage, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">annual road tax discount will correspondingly be reduced from a maximum of S$800 to S$500. <br></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Existing off-peak car owners who choose to opt into the scheme will also have to pay an administrative fee of S$100. <br></span><br>For owners of normal cars who want to switch to the new off-peak car scheme, they will receive up to S$1,100 in cash for every six months' of registration as an off-peak car, until the car reaches 10 years old. <br><br>Currently, if a person converts his normal car into an off-peak car, he receives a rebate of S$2,200 per year, paid as a lump sum only upon de-registration of the car. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">The new initiative will also take effect at the end of January next year.</span> <br><br>A third enhancement announced involves replacing existing paper supplementary licence with an electronic version. <br><br>From November 23, owners of off-peak cars can purchase day licences online at the One Motoring portal, AXS stations or use an SMS service. These are in addition to purchasing the licence at Singapore Post outlets and the Automobile Association of Singapore offices. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Motorists will also have the option of buying the supplementary licence up to a day after using the off-peak car during restricted hours. Current practices require motorists to purchase a licence before using the car. <br></span><br>LTA said this post-payment option will allow for greater flexibility especially for motorists who need to use their off-peak cars during restricted hours for emergencies. <br><br>These changes follow Transport Minister Raymond Lim's announcement in February during his ministry's committee of supply debate. They are also the result of extensive consultations with various groups, including existing off-peak car owners.</span></p>

              <p>goto onemotoring website for better detail CNA only get half right.</p>
              <p>here is the detail from l t a offical site</p>
              <p><strong>Enhancements To The Off-Peak Car (OPC) Scheme</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">1. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is pleased to announce
              that it has completed its review of the Off-Peak Car (OPC) scheme and will be
              implementing the following three initiatives to enhance the OPC scheme:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">(a) e-Day Licence to replace the current paper licence, which
              offers greater flexibility with more channels for purchase and post usage
              payment;<br> (b) Revisions to the OPC scheme to allow unrestricted usage on Saturdays and on
              the eves of 5 public holidays; and<br> (c) Cash Rebates for conversion of normal cars to the new OPC scheme of up to
              $1,100 for every six months' registration as an OPC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">2. These new initiatives follow Minister for Transport Mr
              Raymond Lim's announcement on 12 February 2009 that the LTA would study how to
              make the OPC scheme more convenient and attractive so as to encourage more car
              owners to opt into the scheme. These enhancements are the result of extensive
              consultations with various groups, including existing OPC owners.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">e-Day Licence</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">3. From 23 November 2009, the electronic day licence (e-Day
              Licence) will replace the existing paper supplementary licence when the OPC is
              used during the restricted hours.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">4. The new e-Day Licences can be bought online at the
              ONE.MOTORING portal, AXS stations and using mobile-SMS service, in addition to
              Singapore Post outlets and Automobile Association of Singapore (AAS) offices.
              The new channels of purchase give OPC users the added flexibility of making
              purchases anytime between 6am and midnight daily.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">5. Besides the benefits of extended hours and more alternative
              channels of purchase, motorists now have the option of buying the e-Day Licence
              after using the OPC during restricted hours, as long as they do so before 2359
              hours the next day. Currently, the paper licence must be purchased before the
              use of the vehicle. Please refer to <strong><a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/OPC%20-%20Annex%20A.pdf">Annex
              A</a></strong> for the implementation details.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">6. <em><strong>With the e-Day Licence, OPC drivers no longer need to be
              inconvenienced by LTA's enforcement officers stopping their vehicles to check
              for a valid paper licence. LTA's enforcement officers will instead note down the
              vehicle registration number of the OPC and subsequently verify against the
              system records if a valid e-Day Licence had been purchased for the car for that
              day.</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">7.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> LTA will be sending to all existing OPC owners a
              notification letter and an accompanying <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/e-Day%20Guidebook.pdf">guide
              book</a><a href="http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/">www.onemotoring.com.sg</a> from 1 September 2009. </strong><strong>on the e-Day Licence system sometime in September 2009. Information on
              the e-Day Licence system will also be made available on the portal </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Revised OPC Scheme</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">8. The existing OPC scheme is such that owners of OPCs will
              have to display a supplementary licence (or purchase an e-Day Licence come 23
              Nov 2009) if they wish to drive their OPC between 7am and 3pm on Saturdays,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By end January 2010, the OPC scheme will be revised to
              allow unrestricted usage on Saturdays and the eves of 5 public holidays, namely,
              New Year, Lunar New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali and Christmas. Existing OPC
              owners can choose to opt into this revised scheme to enjoy the extended hours in
              exchange for reduced tax discounts and an administrative fee of $100.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">10. With the extended usage, the annual road tax discount will
              be correspondingly reduced from $800 to $500. The minimum annual road tax will
              be $70, instead of $50 under the existing OPC scheme. This means that existing
              OPC owners who opt for the revised OPC scheme will have their annual road tax
              discounts reduced by between $20 and $300. This is because the tax concessions
              given to OPC owners were computed taking into consideration the restricted usage
              periods. The removal of Saturday restrictions and 5 public holiday eves will
              have to be accompanied by corresponding adjustments to the tax concessions.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cash Rebates for Conversion to Revised OPC Scheme</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">11. At present, a person who registers a new car as an OPC
              enjoys an up-front tax rebate of up to $17,000. However, if a person converts
              his normal car into an OPC, he does not get any refund of the taxes paid.
              Instead, he receives an additional Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF)
              rebate of $2,200 per year, which is paid as a lump sum only upon de-registration
              of the car provided it is PARF-eligible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">12. By end January 2010, instead of waiting until their cars
              are deregistered, owners of normal cars who convert to the revised OPC Scheme
              will enjoy a cash rebate of up to $1,100 for every 6 months' of registration as
              an OPC, until the car reaches 10 years old. The car must be kept as an OPC for
              at least 6 months after its conversion, except in cases of de-registration or
              when the OPC reaches the age of 10 years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">13. More details on the revised OPC and Cash Rebates Schemes
              will be made available nearer the implementation date. LTA is currently
              finalising the implementation details and upgrading the backend system.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">About the Off-Peak Car (OPC) Scheme</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The OPC scheme replaced the Weekend Car scheme from 1 October
              1994. It helps to alleviate peak hour traffic and offers an alternative and a
              lower-cost means for people to own cars, if they use their vehicles during
              off-peak periods.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The OPC scheme fits into LTA's overall objectives to better
              manage congestion on our roads, particularly during the peak periods. At the end
              of 2005, there were only about 5,000 OPCs. Today, there are about 45,500 OPCs, a
              nine-fold increase over a 3-year period. OPCs currently make up about 8 percent
              of the car population in Singapore.</span></p>

              <p>Guess it will be like driving in some Australia roads. You can pay their version of "ERP" 3 days after you passed by the "gantry". If not, you will pay the "ERP" fee + a fine. How they catch u is by cameras that will match ur car plate against whether u pay up or not lor and paying is quite easy, can be by phone using credit card haha</p>
