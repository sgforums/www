However, when the traffic light turns amber.. you can see him open throttle and dash thru the road...<br><br>Haha... sometimes I wonder if some drivers are trained to go on amber instead...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yah sometimes frustration can cause even experienced drivers to make mistakes... once when i was on the circuit practicing, i got caught behind a newbie driving a rental kart for about 2 corners... i was trying to pass him but can't, so when i finally got to a long straight i was damned sian and just pull out sharply to overtake, and accelerated hard at e same time. BIG MISTAKE. i was planning to pass him on his right. Accel too hard, i immediately got wheel spin and my tail slid to the left, i countered, it slipped right, and i shot past him sliding sideways... praying i had enuf road to recover, which i didn't, smacked and destroyed a road cone, which was also hard enough to bend my sprocket, which put me out of commission for a good 45 minutes and cost me the cost of a perfectly good sprocket.</div>
