Hows that even got to do with the accident or how one judges it? If u were saying that u think he/she is mistaken because he/she lacks certain knowledge in certain fields, I would accept that. But sex? whats sex got to do with this all? It just makes u look like u're taking even cheaper potshots. Not the way to go really is it, if u want people to seriously consider what u're trying to say about philia.</div>

I've had a few experiences where I've clipped low objects(other competitor's wheels for eg) at low relative speeds where the difference between the 2 vehicles are not even 5km/h and I have flown in those instances. As well, I've personally witnessed other similiar accidents during practice with vehicles with even smaller wheel diameters than the MX5's, which is why I am very sure that it is entirely possible and in fact, quite likely for the MX5 to flip on impact at low speeds.<br><br>Just to clarify where Im baseing my logic from.</div>

I don't see anyone attacking so_nice even tho he is puttng forth his reasoning for the speeding theory. He is able to give examples to substantiate his reasoning and logic, which I have not seen u do. Perhaps, instead of thinking that u got a harsh reply because u're not arguing the same case as us, go and think if thats actually because u were just being unnecessarily mean-spirited and snotty sounding from the start.</div>

I spent 3 years racing very lightweight vehicles on circuit, so I know the impact of a vehicle's weight on the way it reacts to an impact. Combine that with what they're teaching me now, and I speak from both pratical anf theoratical knowledge.<br><br>Besides, I never attacked the MX5's handling all along, because no matter what, the truth is that the MX5 is a car that handles brilliantly well, and the truth is also that a car which handles brilliantly is always a rather unstable car as compared to a sedate family saloon. That inherent instability can be compensated for to a certain extent, but never fully. So the fact is that this applies to all cars like the MGTF, MX5 and even the mighty Pagani Zonda! Its not a personal attack on a car, but rather, a discourse of the physics of cars which handle well.</div>
