            <div class='col-md body'>To Philia,<br><br>Ever thought of representing the accused in court? I mean, instead of rattling on here arguing behind your computer, why not go help out the defence team. Since you are so certain you are accurate to the 5th decimal, I'm sure your expertise in this area can get the defendant clearance of a heavy sentence. All the more, you can also show your fuckked up face to the family of the deceased. Let them see who is the motherfuckker who is sooo eager to point out that their dead daughter is partly to be blamed for her own death.<br><br>Also, please tell me 4 things. Firstly, who was behind the wheel? Secondly, who was behind the wheel when the accident happened? Thirdly, who do you think should bear the most responsibility? Fourth, who was arrested and why?</div>

I mean, instead of rattling on here arguing behind your computer, why not go help out the defence team. Since you are so certain you are accurate to the 5th decimal, I'm sure your expertise in this area can get the defendant clearance of a heavy sentence. All the more, you can also show your fuckked up face to the family of the deceased. Let them see who is the motherfuckker who is sooo eager to point out that their dead daughter is partly to be blamed for her own death.<br><br>Also, please tell me 4 things. Firstly, who was behind the wheel? Secondly, who was behind the wheel when the accident happened? Thirdly, who do you think should bear the most responsibility? Fourth, who was arrested and why?</div></blockquote>I shall answer your questions first.<br><br>Who was behind the wheel? The driver.<br>Who was behind the wheel when the accident happened? The driver<br>Who do you think should bear the most responsibility? The driver<br>Who was arrested and why? The driver was arrested because he was the one behind the wheel. (However, he is not totally responsible of the accident)<br><br>In response to your first paragraph. I am not here to help the driver, I am only here to bring out the FACTS that people have overlooked. Since when did I say her daughter should be partly blamed for the whole accident. I stated that people should CONSIDER the fact that the salesgirl FAILED to recognize the road because IT IS PART OF HER JOB.<br><br>In response to you calling me "motherfuckker" and having a "fuckked up" face, I will be in Singapore between December 16 - February 10. Leave me your no. and I will meet you for further clarification. I will be more than freaking happy to met you.<br><br>LET ME WARN YOU. MY MOM HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FACTUAL PROPOSAL IN THIS TOPIC. BEFORE YOU CALL ME A "MOTHERFUKKER", LEAVE ME YOUR CONTACTS SO I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, COWARD.<br></div>
