As such, it's EVEN more likely that he would have lost control even without speeding. Sudden steering inputs, unstuiable application of the throttle, eg when the weight transfers to the front after heavy breaking etc. Actually now that we know his driving style is aggressive, Im not surprised that this happened. But Don't u agree an aggressive driver is more likely to have an accident even at low speeds?<br><br>Not saying he is not speeding tho.</div>
