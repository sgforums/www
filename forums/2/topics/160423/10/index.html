Am I right??<br><br>Never been LA, dont know how high is the divider.</div></blockquote>Yes it flew over the divider. The Mazda was hit by the BMW before it could even land on the ground (this is solely my presumption and I do not guarantee the accuracy of this claim).<br><br>So... that brings us to the conclusion that the Mazda has LOST a reasonable amount of speed since he got flipped in mid air (the car could not be travelling 80kph in mid air anyway). But judging from the impact of the accident, the crash was resulted from a high speed crash. With the possibilites of the Mazda travelling at high-speed in mid-air being greatly reduced, that eventually leads to the rational conclusion that the No.2 BMW was the car which was travelling at a fairly fast speed.</div>

But judging from the impact of the accident, the crash was resulted from a high speed crash. With the possibilites of the Mazda travelling at high-speed in mid-air being greatly reduced, that eventually leads to the rational conclusion that the No.2 BMW was the car which was travelling at a fairly fast speed.</div></blockquote>just cant help to post one more   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>From the damage from the BMW, it also might be the speed of the Mazda which lift the car high up after crossing the kerb, land on the BMW follow by the flip and finally land on the van. right??<br><br>Already say, we not CSI, everyone can say something one. bye.</div>

There are many manners of lane cutting but one has to consider the distance between the subject and agressor.</div>
