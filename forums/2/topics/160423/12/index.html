Philia claims that the metal plates + FR contributed to the accident, but if the guy was driving a esp-enabled mercs, the car wld not skid and flip... So probably a mercs isnt FR? Or maybe a mercs is FR but bcos wif esp, it will not skid n flip</div></blockquote>-_-" ALL mercs are RWD except AWD and A-class, according to Wikipedia. And the MX does have skip protection, just that it's called DSC Dynamic Stability Control.<br><br>Well, I guess you pay twice the amount for a Merc. And I don't think in this case the MX's DSC has anything to do with it. There are so many Mazdas in Singapore, 2 SP, 3, 5, 6, 6MPS, as well as other MXs. You don't see them skidding and flipping. It's not the car; its the driver.</div>

I cannot be bothered to explain more anyway.<br><br>2ndly u all keep claiming that without speed how the bmw got smashed so badly?<br>Let me ask u this, the impact of the mx 5 was at the side not the front. How you go speeding on the side with 4 wheels on the side acting as traction to caused such damage? One conclusion.... the on coming BMW is going above the speed litmit.<br><br>thirldly i've explianed on how the whole incident happened not wholely by me but by experts after looking at the damage of the car and surverers surveying the roads afther investigating statements from witnesses and drivers involved involved. How a car can spin and in the end using the broken drive shaft with the rim in a positive camber angle acting as a pivot point to bring the car over the divider are all phiysics and investigation reports by experts. Not me.<br><br>Lastly. Non of u guys are even anywhere near the accident of spoke to any of the witnesses or drivers or even at the scene yet hauling baseless accusations and theories.<br><br>Touch your own heart and Ask yourself this simple question. <strong>Have u ever driven recklessly or have near accident cases with a passenger inside? Or Riding with a pillion and self sidded with her along? Just that you were lucky no one got hurt. For this case is just unlucky someone get hurt. Before u point fingers search yourself first.</strong><br>Finally all heresay are just plain Bullshit. There was no merc involve at all.. YEs there were 2 guys that went down to view the cars together but they both went down in one car. Not the mercedes. the other only ask how much can trade in the merc. never once did the merc appeared in this whole incident. See baseless accusation again.<br><br>Lastly. You all are angry?<br><br>I WAS AT THE WAKE SEEING MY FREN LYING IN THE COFFIN A LAST TIME WHEN I WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HER A DAY BEFORE THE FUNERAL!!!! I'M FUCKING MORE UPSET HERE THAN ANY OF YOU PRICKS HERE THROWING ACCUSATION HERE AND THERE!!!!<br>YES SO HAPPEN I TOO KNOW THE DRIVER AND HIS FREN THAT WENT DOWN TO VIEW THE CAR ABD SO HAPPEN I RUSHED DOWN TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE.<br>SO HAPPEN I MANAGE TO GET INFO AND REPORTS AND SPOKE TO BY STANDERS AND DRIVER OF THE VAN INVOLVED ON THE ACCIDENT SO WAT?<br>CAN U GUYS HERE BRING HER BACK TO LIFE BY HAULING ACCUSATION??<br>CAN U IMAGINE THE PAIN AND TORMENT THE DRIVER IS NOW GOING THRU?<br>CAN U IMAGINE HOW FUCKING HURT I WAS WHEN I SEE ANGELIA IN THE COFFIN?<br><br>SO STOP ALL THESE BASLESS ACCUSATION AND LET ANGELIA REST IN PEACE AND LET THE DRIVER SUFFER HIS GUILT TORMENT FOR LIFE!!!</div>

How you go speeding on the side with 4 wheels on the side acting as traction to caused such damage? One conclusion.... the on coming BMW is going above the speed litmit.<br></div></blockquote>I agree. drifting, or more accurately, oversteer can occur even at low speeds. And I do have to remind people that the MX5 can BE this badly smashed up not because of its speed alone, but the resultant speed during moment of impact. What do i mean by resultant speed?<br><br>Normally when we think about a car hitting the wall, the speed at moment of impact is the speed of the car alone. But that is because the wall is stationary. Now imagine if a car is travelling at 40km/h, and the wall is travelling towards the car at 40km/h as well, resultant speed will be 40+40k = 80km/h<br><br>Similiarly, resultant speed of the impact between the MX5 and the BMW will be the speed of the MX5 AND the speed of the BMW. I don't think its fair to say the BMW driver is speeding either. Might I remind many of u here that Possum Bourne died in 03 after his Forester hit another competitor's recce car head on during pre-event recce. As that was an official event, recce speeds were limited to 30km/h. But as it was a head on collision, the resultant speed was 60km/h, which was enought to kill Possum even tho he had his seatbelt on.<br><br>I think, right now unless there is enough evidence to say that someone was speeding, we should all refrain from such baseless accusation. I AM very surprised to read that many of you in your frenzy to throw accusations, totally forgot about the physics of resultant speed.<br><br>Of course just because the MX5 was hit on the side by the BMW doesn't mean it doesn't have any velocity in the direction of the BMW. velocity is not fixed in the same direction as the front of the car. Once the MX5 left the road and went airborne, even tho the side was facing the BMW, the velocity of the MX5 can be such that it was moving sideways now. So once again its not fair to say the BMW is speeding either.<br><br>Anyways I say again, lets all not speculate further, because there is no point. We'll wait and see what the court say.</div>

It didn't flip when it hit the curb. It went airborne. It doesn't take a lot of speed to go airborne, this i will testify to from my racing experience on track. I remember I once hit something about 40cm tall while I was braking for a corner and I est the resultant speed when I hit it was roughly down to 30km/h. I flew BIG TIME. Its definately possible, altho it takes a bit of a freakish angle for that to happen.</div>
