(Again I am Assuming) Let me tell u u have suceeded big time without even the need to tell him.<br><br>The accused fren that went down with him was sincerely interested in looking at the RX8 and SpoonX asked them go down to see the car as he felt it was a good car. Eventually The accused was also interested in the MX5 and thus the whole tragedy happened.<br>Initially he blamed and rebuked the accused but after gathering all reports and surveys from I dun know where he gets them also, he realised that it really isn't the accused fault thou the accused also need to Face substaintial responsibility for such tragedy. Thus he put all the blame to himself.<br><br>many of us already told him it is not his fault as he is merely introducing a car and no one expect such things to happen. But he still cannot stop blamming himself as he felt that he not only caused one death But the ruined life of another.<br><br>Yet u came in and further inflict his guilt. (Again i'm only assumming. Forgive me if i'm wrong).<br>I appreciate it if u just be more sensitive in your comments as I personally think that he is not at fault at all yet he is putting all the blame to himself rather then the accused. Of course u can think otherwise.<br><br>and before i forget... He never thaught anyone how to drift so hope that answers your first question.<br><br>I hope we all just let this matter rest and just wait for the verdict and most impt of all learned from this tragedy to how to prevent such cases from hapening again.<br><br>PS: I'm neither related to the deseased or the accused.</div></blockquote>In the first place why the driver want to test the car?<br>Did he think about it?<br>Does he has a need to new car?<br>He has been telling around about his brand new car, just few months old not even half a year.<br>Why is  The accused was also interested in the MX5???<br>SpoonX are you sure he is interested in the MX5, or he just want to test the car which he thinks it's nice and which he has no intention to buy it?<br>Maybe He has the intention but can he affort it?
