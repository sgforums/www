The driver's decision to test drive the car is really irrelevant because at that point of time, he did not foresee the accident. I think I have said this to you before that an accident is an unforeseen event thereby there is no whatsoever motive.<br><br>If you begin to question his decision to buy the car and if you think that has an effect to the accident then you should also question his parents. Why would they give birth to someone who would end up in a fatal accident?<br><br>And also consider the following questions:<br><br>Why did the salesgirl insist on going with the driver evn though it was not her job?<br><br>Why didn't the girl know the route well and ended up getting lost, hence leading the driver to travel on the fatal route?<br><br>Nonetheless, those questions are irrelevant. Please understand.<br></div>
