            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by philia:</div><div class="quote_body">Do you want me to question the reliability of SpoonX's statement? His statement is backed with various research and accounts from the eyewitnesses. Due to that, we have every right to consider his statement as a factor towards the accident.<br><br>Also, there is no proof of him performing aggressive driving during the course of the event. It's like sentencing him for his PAST crimes.</div></blockquote>philia, i must point out here that until we know for sure SpoonX really knows what he says he knows n he is who he is, u have to bear in mind that u cannot take his information as being 100% correct. Right now we shouldn't discount speed as a factor completely, although I do want people to consider that this accident could happen at low speeds too. In any case, now that we do know that he's been aggressive in the past, we might have to consider the fact that while he wasn't speeding, he might not have reacted in a proper manner to someone cutting into his lane i.e. instead of swerving to avoid n braking, he might have tried to swerve n accelerate for some reason.<br><br>in any case, ultimately we will still have to let the courts decide.</div>

How do we know for sure that he was speeding or not speeding?? But looking through all information gathered and discussed, SpoonX's statement seemed to hold the most legit account due to the fact that he CLAIMED to have interviewed the eyewitnesses and the driver himself. Therefore, we should take side on SpoonX's statement until the authority has a more concrete evidence to overthrow SpoonX's instead of calling the driver "punk", "prick", etc or assuming him to have "watched too many Initial D", "tried to be cool or arrogant" etc.<br><br>I just feel the need to bring SpoonX's statement into consideration upon reading all the baseless accusations made. But it seems, the audience dislike it when I show the possibility of the scenario going against their wills.</div>
