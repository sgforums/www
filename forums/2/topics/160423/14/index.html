But more importantly, the C230's tyre did not act as a fulcrum like what happened with MX-5. That being said, I presume the MX-5's weight is a crucial point to ponder about. The fulcrum fail to flip the C230 largely due to the immense weight and height of the curb. It is only logical that by lowering the weight of the car and height of the divider, the % of a flip is increased.</div>

Thus, to keep the wheels in constant contact with the ground, your suspension does exactly that.  Imagine your car going over uneven surfaces without suspension, you might have 2 wheels with no contact with the ground while going full rev, then imagine the instantaneous moment when those 2 wheels touch the ground again.  Not very nice.</div>

SpoonX just Mentioned that he wasn't speeding and flipping a car at 40-50km/h with an oversteer on slippery road conditions is possible. Never once did he mentioned that the accident happened at 40-50km/h.<br>So y is everyone here assuming that the MX5 flipped of went over the divider or watever at 40-50km/h?<br>Pls do get your facts straight before any assumptions as it will be very unfair to either the accused or SpoonX who are feeling much much worse of than any of us here as I never seen him haurled Vulgarities in forums before and it be the first.</div>
