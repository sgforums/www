            <div class='col-md body'>How reliable is MX5?<br><br>Mazda Motor Corporation revealed the all-new MX-5 to the world at a press conference held today at the 75th Geneva International Motor Show (Salon International de l'Auto in Geneva). Updated, improved, and at long last unleashed, the all-new, third-generation Mazda MX-5 is the latest and most-advanced evolution of the world's best-selling lightweight sports car. Takao Kijima, program manager for the new vehicle, said, 'Our effort with the all-new MX-5 was to retain the key roadster attributes that made this car famous--the lightweight feeling, the balanced handling, the overall nimbleness of the product--but make the vehicle more useful for a wider range of customers, offering better value, more comfort, and overall higher levels of interior quality.'<br>The MX-5 (known as the Roadster in Japan) debuted at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1989, and since then Mazda has relentlessly pursued the fun found in a lightweight, open sports car. The Japanese expression jinba ittai (meaning the oneness of motion, 'rider and horse as one') best describes this evolved MX-5's 'fun-to-drive' character. Development focused on creating a car that would be enjoyable in any driving situation--whether it is sports driving or just daily use. It was designed and engineered to achieve a dynamic balance between a powerful engine and a more lightweight, compact body.<br><br>Evolution of 'Jinba Ittai'- lighter, stiffer body<br><br>For improved performance, safety, comfort and also to be more useful, Mazda employed a variety of new equipment and technologies to find any possible way to minimize weight and achieve a lighter model. The result: a total increase for the entire vehicle weight of only about 10 kg compared to the previous generation MX-5.<br><br>Utilizing advanced materials such as ultra-high-tension steel, the new MX-5's unibody delivers an increase of 22 percent for flexural stiffness and 47 percent for torsional rigidity compared to its predecessor. Moving the engine rearward by 135 mm (5.3 inches) was a major step toward balancing front-to-rear weight distribution and reducing the yaw moment of inertia.<br><br>Delightful Design - Fun and Modern Styling<br><br>The low, flowing shoulder lines established in the original roadster are still there. Long associated with being approachable and fun, the new version was further transformed into a lightweight sports car of simple functionality and athletic solidity, both of which remain obvious design DNA attributes. The fender arches are more pronounced for wider wheeltrack dimensions, providing a more athletic stance.<br><br>The interior design themes of the new Mazda MX-5 are simple functionality and comfortable openness with high-quality craftsmanship. Four round heating and cooling vents help establish a straight reference line across the front of the cockpit. Several areas of the interior consist of a Piano-black finish that render a modern, high-quality surface. Five round gauges with metal-look trim have glass covers with a coating to reduce reflections and maintain legibility even in direct sunlight.<br><br>Eight exterior colors are available. With base models, tasteful black upholstery and a matte-silver metallic finish can be selected. High-grade models offer two choices: a combination of saddle-tan and black leather or black leather in a monotone treatment.<br><br>Improved safety and comfort<br><br>Although the new MX-5 is an open car boasting the Mazda Advanced Impact-energy Distribution and Absorption System, Mazda sought--and achieved--higher collision safety performance. Newly developed side airbags protect the torso, and it is also equipped with a larger-volume head protection airbag.<br><br>Various types of body statures can comfortably fit in the cockpit driver's seat. New waist-level vents and a mesh-type air deflector mounted behind the seats improve ventilation inside the cabin for an improved sense of open-air motoring.<br><br>Perfected Powertrain<br><br>Equipped with a newly developed 2.0-liter MZR engine in all markets, models with a 1.8-liter engine are available for the European market.<br><br>Throughout the engine development, work focused on what engineer's call 'response', 'expansion feel' and 'pleasant engine sound.' A lighter flywheel and a stiffer drive shaft contributed to realizing the responsive, direct feel of the new MX-5. Also, a 57 percent reduction in intake restriction was achieved. Pressure loss in the exhaust system was reduced 40 percent to keep the engine torque curve nearly level at high rpm. Furthermore, the intake manifold and the intake and exhaust system were tuned, and the engine sound that resulted is one of the pleasant appeals of the new MX-5.<br><br>The newly developed 6-speed manual transmission is available in all markets. Shifting gears is a breeze--seems like just a flick of the wrist--when using the triple-cone synchronizers for the first four gears. The gearshift lever can also manually control five-speed manual and advanced six-speed automatic transmissions.<br><br>Predictable, lively handling<br><br>Realizing a light-but-stiff unibody that serves as the chassis foundation, a double wishbone front suspension and multi-link rear suspension system with optimized geometry help extract the best that 205/45WR-17 radial tires have to offer. Aluminum was used for some chassis parts to minimize unsprung weight, and attaching the rear cross member directly to the unibody with no rubber isolation enhances chassis rigidity while reinforcing the driver's feeling of oneness with the car.<br><br>Unwanted steering and pitch motion of the body during acceleration and braking are tightly controlled by anti-drive, anti-squat geometry. Also, a 65 mm (2.56 inches) increase in the wheelbase helps balance the stable driving.<br><br>The rack-and-pinion power steering gears yields low friction, high linearity, and delightfully smooth steering responses. Another significant change that induces improved handling is a 75 mm (3.0 inches) increase in the front track and a 55 mm (2.1 inches) increase in the rear track.<br><br>Class-leading level stopping distances are achieved in the new MX-5 because front and rear rotors are increased in diameter and calipers are increased in its stiffness to engineer a precise brake pedal response with a high degree of linearity.<br></div>

Let some young guy who just learnt how to drive, drive a car with lively handling in an aggressive manner, and no matter how predictable it is, he will lose control. Predictablilty comes when u can gradually push it towards the limit, and it will drop hints b4 losing grip. Push over the max in one instant, sure die.<br><br>Anyways im wondering what is the new MX5's turns to lock ratio?</div>
