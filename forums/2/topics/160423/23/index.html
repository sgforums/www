Here are the following scenarios you presented to me:<br><br><strong>1. Your mom should have told the driver not to speed</strong><br>The driver was not speeding as quoted from SpoonX. Therefore I do not see any relation between your remark and the accident.<br><strong>2. Your mom should have taken the "correct route"<br>3. Your mom should have made sure the driver is old enough to control the vehicle.</strong><br><br>The aforementioned remarks are in no way related to my proposal of "points to ponder". If you read my previous posts, I have been stressing the following <strong>points that are worth considering</strong> (quoted from reliable sources: Newspaper articles and SpooX):<br><br>1. Salesgirl failed to recognize the route which, in the first place, questioned her eligibility to accompany the driver for a test-drive.<br>2. Either the salesgirl /  the showroom itself has allowed the "underaged" driver to proceed with the test drive.<br><br>Your scenarios involving my mom is a huge deviation from my points that I presented (bearing the the fact that yours are a clear-cut finger pointing while mine is no more than a proposal of points that should be taken into consideration). After reading my posts and views, whether or not you decide to point the finger at the salesgirl is totally insignificant for me. Of course if, upon reading my supported "points to ponder", you decided to come up with such conclusions, it is totally beyond my control.<br><br>Anyway, with regards to "In all my years as a prominent solicitor, I have never seen a case where a passive passenger is charged with causing a traffic accident." I would like to highlight that I did not try to push the blame to the salesgirl nor did I ever stated that she should be charged by the law. Therefore, I deem your statement unneccessary in relation to my posts.<br><br>So much for me trying to present some sensible and legit factors.</div>

I do not see the relation of your statement and the accident; point being there is no tangible evidence to show that the driver was speeding.  Researches, interviews and witnesses' accounts gathered by SpoonX has led him to a conclusion that the driver was travelling well within the speed limit.<br><br>Furthermore, none here has the right to pass any kind of verdict. Instead, as bystanders, it is socially imperative that we adopt a neutral stance in response to an accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Car saleswoman said he took a corner at very high speed; she had to tell him to slow down<br><br>THE 24-year-old driver of a Mazda MX-5 that went horribly out of control during a test drive last weekend, killing a young saleswoman in a high-speed three-car crash, had taken another saleswoman on a white-knuckle ride just a few months before.<br><br>The saleswoman, who formerly worked for BMW, said she was used to clients driving fast, but this particular customer crossed the line.<br><br>'It was a very short test drive in the Leng Kee area and I had to tell him to slow down,' said the 30-something saleswoman, who did not want either herself or her current employer to be named.<br><br>'He took a corner at a very high speed. I would describe his driving as aggressive and I seldom use that term on a customer.'<br><br>The test drive 'did not leave me with a good impression', she added.<br><br>The Straits Times understands the driver is a warehouse supervisor whose father recently bought him a high-performance Fiat Punto HGT.<br><br>On the day of the accident, he had accompanied a friend to try out the MX-5 at the Mazda showroom in MacPherson Road, and had no intention of buying the car.<br><br>He could not be contacted.<br><br>The police would not confirm his identity, merely saying the driver of the wrecked car was 'out on bail and under investigation'.<br><br>The accident happened along Upper Paya Lebar Road last Saturday at 5.55pm. The two-seater convertible flew over the road divider, smashed head-on into a black BMW, flipped over it and came crashing down into a van in the other lane.<br><br>Ms He Xueli, a 22-year-old Mazda saleswoman who was just four months into the job, was seated next to the man in the silver car. She was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital but died there an hour later.<br><br>Five people in the BMW were taken to Changi General Hospital where they received outpatient treatment for chest pains and breathing difficulties. A couple in the van escaped unhurt.<br><br>Mazda Motor (Singapore) managing director Phng Hooi Chay said yesterday that the company was reviewing test-drive procedures, especially for high-performance cars.<br><br>'We are consulting with others in the motor industry to see what's the best way,' he said.<br><br><strong>'This is a very sad and tragic incident. If only the car had gone on our usual test-drive route, which is up Aljunied Road to Upper Serangoon Road, this would not have happened.' </strong><br><br>The route the newly launched MX-5 took was through a heavy MRT construction area, where the road was twisty and undulating in many places and the surface paved with temporary metal platforms.<br><br>Dealers of high-performance cars say they either do not allow test drives altogether or are extremely stringent about it.<br><br>At Subaru agent Motor Image, drivers who take the WRX sports sedan out for a spin must have a motor insurance policy with 50 per cent no-claims bonus, be above the age of 25 and must sign a form agreeing to stick to a prescribed route.<br><br>At Porsche, drivers must be aged 28 or older.
