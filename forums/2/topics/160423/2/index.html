A driver has to adjust himself to the prevailing road conditions and if any accidents were to happen, his incapabilities/lack of cautious-ness should be blamed instead of the road conditions.<br><br>Of coz the driver never meant to harm anyone.....he must be real distraughted now, but his moment of folly took away an innocent life.. which really pisses lots of people off , don't you think?

Yes maybe the guy driving skills sucks.. but to get into that kind of situation, it takes more than lousy driving skills.. he could be speeding in which also because the saleswoman allowed him to speed.. and thus such an accident happened. if it's because of that, then the saleswoman did not ensure he is driving within the limits. and she unfortunately partly contributed to her death. in such a situation, yes the driver could be charged for reckless driving but dont you think the woman partly caused her own death? if she did do her job properly, there's no way the car would be in such a wreckage, unless it's other factors like the road or the car itself</div>

(assuming she did allow the driver to speed and resulted in such an accident) because u are afraid of offending ppl and losing sales and what happened was something really extreme and caused her to die. this is what happen when people compromise their standards. im sure ppl compromise all the time... but they are just lucky nothing bad happened to them... however, in this case, this young woman died.<br><br>the driver is mostly to blame becoz he's driving, n the fact he's alive... because he compromised safety and she did not want to lose sales.. now u got a dead girl. it's just not worth it u see. if she's alive and the driver is dead, i'm pretty sure she's gonna take most of the blame because she allowed the driver to speed.<br><br>im sure looking at this incident from both angles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the sales agent should not be made compulsary to accompany the customer in a test drive..for safety sake. I mean..u already got the guy's IC!
