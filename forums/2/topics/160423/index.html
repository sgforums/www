            <div class='col-md body'>I just came back from the poor Gals Wake at Yishun. Quite a Tragedy I must say.....Well.....some details are as follows bout the Lady.<br><br>She is a Christian. So naturally she had a Christian Wake. Hope the Lord has her safely in his arms now.....May God Bless her whole Family too...<br><br>Some of the things I heard at the Wake:<br><br>There were actually 2 drivers. 1 Guy Driving a Merc looking to buy a RX-8, and his fren, the Punk who caused Ms He's Death, Driving a Fiat Punto. I heard the Punk actually had no intention watsoever to buy a Car....but just wanted to test drive the MX-5 for FUN!! Which in turned caused the death of Ms He.<br><br>Apparently, this Guy had just obtained his license only, and asked to take the MX-5 for a Test Drive for FUN.......So Ms He attended to him, and they took a different Route other then the designated Route. Apparently while negotiating the Bends on the Metal Plates, the car, which was speeding, skidded....so the Punk actually applied brakes, and skidded even more....hence the Loss of Vehicle Control.<br><br>This is wat I got........So I guess the rest, u guys can see the end result.<br><br>May the Lord be with her, protecting her, guiding her, and give her happiness over in his Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>May the Lord also Bless her Family with the Strength to carry on and to cope wif the Tragic Loss of their one and only Daughter.......<br><br>Amen....</div>
