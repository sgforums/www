            <div class='col-md body'>Why are you guys being so insensitive with the driver? It is not completely his fault.<br><br>The salesgirl should share some responsibilities:<br>1. She did not recognize the road and was lost (a salesgirl should have a knowledge on the routes that customers are supposed to travel). This means she was poorly-trained or did not pay attention.<br>2. She could have insisted the driver to take other routes which she would be familiar with. However, she let the driver to make the decision.<br><br>Other factors that attributed to the accident:<br>1. Road condition i.e. metal- plating<br>2. BMW no.1's reckless lane-changing.<br>3. The brake fail to work (as mentioned, the driver applied brake)<br><br>And before you start flaming the driver as an "idiot who tries to replicate Initial D", "trying to be smart jerk or condemning him to a death (such as hanging, freaky car crash and etc), please consider the fact that he may be wrong but does it make him any less depressed than the salesgirl who lost her life?<br><br>Please put your shoes in the driver's and, with a liberal mind, think about his emotional well-being right now instead of blatantly spewing acid from your mouths.<br><br>It's so easy to empathize with the dead victim but most of you just fail to realize the fact that the driver is a victim too. He is remorseful, apologetic and has probably lost the will to live. The accident had not only affected the family of the dead but the driver as well.<br><br>And I am sick of Initial D being mentioned here. The driver was not trying to re-enact any of those fictitious scenes of Initial D. He was not even speeding to begin with.<br></div>
