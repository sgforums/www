Forgive me if i'm wrong as I'm assuming.<br><br>You came in questioning SpoonX on questions that are definately gonna hurt him further if he ever comes in to read them. like i said. If his answers to your question is yes he did tought the accused to drift and yes he did introduced the SE to them as they are interested in buying a Mazda and she is working there.<br>So are you tring to imply that SpoonX is the ultimate person that caused the whole tragedy by saying yes to your initial 2 questions. I'm also assuming so forgive me if i'm wrong.<br><br>Whatever if u beleive that Such person SpoonX existed or not. But what if he really existed and suffered the setback of losing a fren? Dun you think your questions will hurt him further.<br><br>Rant and debate all you want. this is an open forum anyway.</div>

(more power needed to provide higher inertia).<br><br>base on same road condition, same tire used the heavier car will have oversteer first because with the same level of grip (same max inertia), the lighter car can achieve a direction change at a higher speed due to the fact that it need lesser inertia to change direction.<br><br>When I reading on oversteer, it is the rear wheel which looses the grip and still moving along the initial direction without following the direction change of the front wheel. correct me if I got it wrong.<br><br>lets assume both same car, same design, same tire, same road contdition only that one car fetch more ppl than the other to create the weight different.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

With that the rim actually acted as a mini 45 degree angle ram acting as a pivot point to launch the car over the kerb. Look at the picture of the MX 5 and see the angle of the left rim maybe u will know wat he meant.

With 43 yrs drvin exp it is news to me. after reading all these threads last few days i actually went driving around at 40, 50, 60 kmph to personally feel the speed. My conclusion is at 40-50kmph , very unlikely short of a freak accident to flip the car metal plates not withstanding.<br><br>so i conclude it is freak accident or the speed is over 60kmph.</div></blockquote>I've personally mounted a curb at 30km/h b4. Car actually flew up a bit. Was in a corolla. light but still heavier than MX5. If it can happen to a corolla at 30, it can happen to a MX5 at 40.<br><br>Reminder. Car did not quite flip until it was hit by oncoming BMW.</div>

(more power needed to provide higher inertia).<br><br>base on same road condition, same tire used the heavier car will have oversteer first because with the same level of grip (same max inertia), the lighter car can achieve a direction change at a higher speed due to the fact that it need lesser inertia to change direction.<br><br>When I reading on oversteer, it is the rear wheel which looses the grip and still moving along the initial direction without following the direction change of the front wheel. correct me if I got it wrong.<br><br>lets assume both same car, same design, same tire, same road contdition only that one car fetch more ppl than the other to create the weight different.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> </div></blockquote>well, lighter car will actually oversteer 1st because quite simply, less weight pressing down on the wheels to keep it in contact with road surface. HEavier car has more inertia, so when the same steering force is applied to both cars, what happens is the heavier car will change direction more slowly, while the lighter car will change direction much faster. As a result, the heavier car will 1stly be sluggish, almost perhap it will understeer. Due to its inertia, and due to the extra weight on the tyres pressing it down into contact with the road. Esp in a car which has more people than another car of the same make n brand, most of this weight will go over the rear wheels, thus making it even harder to oversteer. In fact, common sense tells us if u try to take a corner too fast with a heavy car, u will go straight on off the road! That is understeer and it is the terminal opposite of oversteer.<br><br>Hope this clears up any confusion u have about weight of a car and its implication on it oversteering.</div>

This question is general, not refering to this incident.<br><br>To mount,consider this, the kerb is 1.5 ft high. If the car clearance is around 20-25cm, at low speed it is impossible to mount of jump over bacause the body of the car already touches the kerb. where as if it is a 4 x 4, the clearance can reach 1.2ft can go over the kerb much easier. am I right??<br><br>To flip, if the car cant go over the kerb, how to flip. That why when a SUV or 4 x4 can topper easier when loose control . Isnt it?? Thanks.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> </div></blockquote>2 reasons.<br><br>1) Assuming frontal impact, due to the lower curvature on the front of the MX5, the distance of its front wheels to the front, and the force carrying it into the curb, it will certainly mount the curb even if its clearance is low. Hence clearance is not much of a factor in this case<br><br>2) If it was a sideways impact with the curb, then clearance is not even in consideration because if u consider a lightweight block of wood with NO clearance, hitting a low curb hard enough, will still tip over.<br><br>For your case of talking about SUVs flipping, u're referring to a topple without striking anything else, occuring due to an oversudden change of direction, ie. flipping due to its high CG and inertia alone. In the case of SUV flipping, clearance does not play any major factor here other than adding to the CG of the SUV.</div>
