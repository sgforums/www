There is no reason why you would see a similarity between my car and the Mazda. Both cars are structurally, mechanically, compositionally and dynamically different. My point is, a vehicle does play a role in an accident.</div>

Cause you know him that why u believe what he say?? you are not netural also.............<br><br>By netural is to access the case with logic, I dont see if not speeding can send a sport car with good brake, low CG over to the other diraction over a stone kerb which is not low. you travel there before you should know, it might be even higher than the clearance of the MX. Only with great force can push the MX over, sound logical??<br><br>anything for me?? i still reading...............<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
