He felt bad enough over this tragedy and does not deserve this kind of interogation after clarifying what he knows. I think we should leave him alone as he has and said and clarified what he knows.

The accident happened.<br>2. The poor SE died.<br>3.

The above are the only truth that we will ever know.Whatever happen before that like how many guys and so on does not really matter.<br><br>Meanwhile we should Chip in and see what we can do for the SE family to help them finacially in anyway rather than just carry on this useless debate which leads to nowhere or helping anyone in anyway but to satisfy egos in winning debates.

I think philia and me are not saying that it is a fact that accused didn't speed.<br><br>SpoonX and aloof guy's account of the accident show the possibility that the driver might not be speeding. Then Ah Heng pointed out the physics behind this possibility and related his real life racing experiences. Some other forummers also confirmed with their own experience.<br><br>In short, what Ah Heng did was to point out what the students are learning for O levels A Maths topic on relative velocity:<br><br>V(a) = V(a/b) + V(b) =&gt; V(a/b) = V(a) - V(b)<br>if velocities are 40km/h for both it will be 40-(-40) = 80.<br><br>the definition of speeding is already a problem. ninelives claimed that eyewitness(es) reported the car was speeding. but does speeding mean it is 10km/h over the speed limit or 100km/h.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gentlerock:</div><div class="quote_body">Just some comments on some previous posts.....<br><br>(1) Doesn't matter if its FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD, 1WD because if the car is fast enough, it will still fly and flip.  If not fast enough, 100WD with 100 turbos also will not jump leh...unless you're flooring the accelerator all the way.<br><br>(2) Besides providing visual demarcation, kerbs also act at speed barriers - thats why they stick out of the ground - or else it'll be much cheaper to just draw lines on the road.  If you bang into them, they take speed off you.  Its a law of physics which cannot be changed - when you bang into something stationary, you loose energy and speed.  Its not like going over a smooth angled road hump (which is a ramp) - and even that causes you to lose speed.<br><br>(3) If you are travelling at 50 km/hr before you hit the kerb, you will be MUCH slower than 50 km/hr after hitting the kerb.  Conversely, if you are going at 50 km/hr (or any speed which can make you flip) after hitting the kerb, then you are probably going much faster than 50 km/hr before hitting the kerb.<br><br>(4) If you are at X km/hr before hitting the kerb, and still at X km/hr after hitting the kerb, then something is wrong with your speedometer.  Either that, or the kerb and tyres are totally and perfectly frictionless and has the ability to change the direction of force/motion (from horizontal to vertically up, then to horizontal again) with 100% efficiency, ie. no energy loss.<br><br>(5) I assume there are many drivers here.  Try this later....drive at 50 km/hr for 30 secs or so to feel the speed.  Then imagine (imagine only) that you bang into a kerb.  Do you think at that speed, the back of your car will fly high enough to flip over, even if your front is suddenly stopped?  (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who have accidentally missed noticing speed humps and went over them without braking, you will already know the answer</span>).<br><br>(6) Someone claimed that during an accident, we can rush to the scene and interview victims and bystanders meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  And they are willing to be interviewed by strangers too?  Sure or not???  And the police and emergency services will allow this, even when they're investigating and treating those at the scene?<br><br>Er....so who was it who claimed that guy wasn't speeding har? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote> hello just wanted to say a lil something. the car was driving on wet rd when it skiided.. lost control.. went over the curb, hit the OPPOSITE traffic then flipped over. after it has skiided... its got nothing to do with whatever speed he was going at. the impact of hitting the opposite traffic is enough to flip the car over. yup thanks.. just wanted people who dont know the situation full well to understand...</div>
