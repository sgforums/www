So just imagine what is the speed that guy driving and can you imagine how fast you need to go to sent a one over ton car flying??<br><br>I talk to a few guys who attended the driving course conducted  by BMW, even on wet ground and was taught how to fish tail a car, most of them cant do it on the first try!!! It is easier when the speed pass 60km/h (they try it at 40, 50, 60).<br><br>Maybe some expert (like spoonx) here can show me how to fish tail a FR car on dry ground at 40km/h. Can use my FR BMW318, I can even turn off the ASC for you to try. Maybe at kallang big carpark?? Few of my friends from BMW forum are interested to learnt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some comments on some previous posts.....<br><br>(1) Doesn't matter if its FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD, 1WD because if the car is fast enough, it will still fly and flip.  If not fast enough, 100WD with 100 turbos also will not jump leh...unless you're flooring the accelerator all the way.<br><br>(2) Besides providing visual demarcation, kerbs also act at speed barriers - thats why they stick out of the ground - or else it'll be much cheaper to just draw lines on the road.  If you bang into them, they take speed off you.  Its a law of physics which cannot be changed - when you bang into something stationary, you loose energy and speed.  Its not like going over a smooth angled road hump (which is a ramp) - and even that causes you to lose speed.<br><br>(3) If you are travelling at 50 km/hr before you hit the kerb, you will be MUCH slower than 50 km/hr after hitting the kerb.  Conversely, if you are going at 50 km/hr (or any speed which can make you flip) after hitting the kerb, then you are probably going much faster than 50 km/hr before hitting the kerb.<br><br>(4) If you are at X km/hr before hitting the kerb, and still at X km/hr after hitting the kerb, then something is wrong with your speedometer.  Either that, or the kerb and tyres are totally and perfectly frictionless and has the ability to change the direction of force/motion (from horizontal to vertically up, then to horizontal again) with 100% efficiency, ie. no energy loss.<br><br>(5) I assume there are many drivers here.  Try this later....drive at 50 km/hr for 30 secs or so to feel the speed.  Then imagine (imagine only) that you bang into a kerb.  Do you think at that speed, the back of your car will fly high enough to flip over, even if your front is suddenly stopped?  (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For those who have accidentally missed noticing speed humps and went over them without braking, you will already know the answer</span>).<br><br>(6) Someone claimed that during an accident, we can rush to the scene and interview victims and bystanders meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  And they are willing to be interviewed by strangers too?  Sure or not???  And the police and emergency services will allow this, even when they're investigating and treating those at the scene?<br><br>Er....so who was it who claimed that guy wasn't speeding har? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
