Just imagine,  the MX was lifted from the ground by the kerb, when the front wheel still in the air, the BMW came into contact. The front of the BMW was being push upward. As the BMW is moving, the angle of MX beging lifted further. While the MX still have forward momentum as the initial speed is high, it propell up to perform the flip and hence misses the roof of the BMW. How?? got the ppicture??<br><br>If it is the BMW driver who is speeding, the MX will be push and fall infront of the BMW and not propell and fly over the BMW and land on the van which is on the other lane and is behind the BMW.  This is physics.<br><br>If forward force(BMW) larger than unward force(MX) the MX will be infront. If upward force larger(MX) than the forward force(BMW) the MX will head for the sky.<br><br>Think I can Be CSI liao<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

TVRs are obviously not for the faint hearted and amateurs.... only bad guys drive it.. those like John Travolta.... It's really a cool car man, nvm the ugly curves it's actually feverishly beautiful... it will outrun any M3, M5, M6 or porsches. Best of all it has no ABS and Airbags... TVRs solution to the lack of safety feature is simply...."DON'T CRASH IT'. How cool is that? If you are able to drive a TVR well... it really puts you right up there with the big boys!

Philia claims that the metal plates + FR contributed to the accident, but if the guy was driving a esp-enabled mercs, the car wld not skid and flip... So probably a mercs isnt FR? Or maybe a mercs is FR but bcos wif esp, it will not skid n flip</div>

Its juz that some car agencies have this policy to allow only experienced drivers to do so... in other words, it is a company policy for certain car agencies, but not restricted by law so dun jump into conclusion</div>
