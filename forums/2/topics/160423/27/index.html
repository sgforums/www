Go for D1 courses.....<br>I'm going to be very very crude here.<br>The Fu*king BMW 318 like mention here is a bloody 1700kg car which the weight even without anti skid wun caused the kind of over steer the MX5 with 1100kg will caused. DUn compare different cars. The way the front engine rear wheel drive car of the MX 5 weight distribution is different as it has a long nose and short butt. I cannot be bothered to explain more anyway.<br><br>2ndly u all keep claiming that without speed how the bmw got smashed so badly?<br>Let me ask u this, the impact of the mx 5 was at the side not the front. How you go speeding on the side with 4 wheels on the side acting as traction to caused such damage? One conclusion.... the on coming BMW is going above the speed litmit.<br><br>thirldly i've explianed on how the whole incident happened not wholely by me but by experts after looking at the damage of the car and surverers surveying the roads afther investigating statements from witnesses and drivers involved involved. How a car can spin and in the end using the broken drive shaft with the rim in a positive camber angle acting as a pivot point to bring the car over the divider are all phiysics and investigation reports by experts. Not me.<br><br>Lastly. Non of u guys are even anywhere near the accident of spoke to any of the witnesses or drivers or even at the scene yet hauling baseless accusations and theories.<br><br>Touch your own heart and Ask yourself this simple question. [b]Have u ever driven recklessly or have near accident cases with a passenger inside? Or Riding with a pillion and self sidded with her along? Just that you were lucky no one got hurt. For this case is just unlucky someone get hurt. Before u point fingers search yourself first.</strong><br>Finally all heresay are just plain Bullshit. There was no merc involve at all.. YEs there were 2 guys that went down to view the cars together but they both went down in one car. Not the mercedes. the other only ask how much can trade in the merc. never once did the merc appeared in this whole incident. See baseless accusation again.<br><br>Lastly. You all are angry?<br><br>I WAS AT THE WAKE SEEING MY FREN LYING IN THE COFFIN A LAST TIME WHEN I WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH HER A DAY BEFORE THE FUNERAL!!!! I'M FUCKING MORE UPSET HERE THAN ANY OF YOU PRICKS HERE THROWING ACCUSATION HERE AND THERE!!!!<br>YES SO HAPPEN I TOO KNOW THE DRIVER AND HIS FREN THAT WENT DOWN TO VIEW THE CAR ABD SO HAPPEN I RUSHED DOWN TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE.<br>SO HAPPEN I MANAGE TO GET INFO AND REPORTS AND SPOKE TO BY STANDERS AND DRIVER OF THE VAN INVOLVED ON THE ACCIDENT SO WAT?<br>CAN U GUYS HERE BRING HER BACK TO LIFE BY HAULING ACCUSATION??<br>CAN U IMAGINE THE PAIN AND TORMENT THE DRIVER IS NOW GOING THRU?<br>CAN U IMAGINE HOW FUCKING HURT I WAS WHEN I SEE ANGELIA IN THE COFFIN?<br><br>SO STOP ALL THESE BASLESS ACCUSATION AND LET ANGELIA REST IN PEACE AND LET THE DRIVER SUFFER HIS GUILT TORMENT FOR LIFE!!![/b]</blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>if the driver isn't speeding he would have been about 40-50km/hr, if at this speed a car swerv into your lane, you will sure be intime for a Ebrake. given that this is a performance car, the brake should be more then enough to bring you to a stop if you are really 40-50km/hr.<br>having no intention to buy the car(as stated in today newspaper), show that is is all out to impress female SE form that showroom. i was at that road 5 minute after the accident, and i would say, if you had drive recklessly, 100km/hr is no prob.<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>YOu mean the worker are there to look after the road? seeing which car speed past or not? i believe they will only focus on the road after they hear the Bang sound. no one would on a sat 6pm stand by the roadside focusing on the road. so whadever story they give will be from the moment they heard the bang sound which is already by that time fliping in the air.<br>also the van driver story whould not be relevent as he would not have notice the OPP side of the road. so wad happen before the MX5 went over to the other lane, ONLY THE DRIVER AND THE DEAD SE KNOWS.<br>my condolence to  her.<br><br>yes, indeed he metal plate did affect, but i believe before the accident happen, no one by the road or any worker would have notice a car swerving into his lane, therefore i assume that the swerving car is only from the mouth of the "speeding" driver of the MX5. like i say have he not speed, he would have been able to brake in time give that the brake of "performance" car is alot better by nature.<br>and having no intention of buying the car, only reason he test drive is to impress(very likly), write a report(very unlikely) or just drive for fun without speeding or fast driving(For wad?)..<br>just my point of view.<br><br></i></div>

I see. How fair. But if thats your idea of being fair then why do u think its not fair if the court just ban and fine him?<br><br>In any case, I do see this as causing a death thru negligent driving. That carries fairly severe penalties. Whether he was speeding or not, he can still be driving recklessly.<br><br>In UK we just had someone who was convicted of inconsiderate driving for accidently splashing some people on the sidewalk when the driver drove thru a puddle at 15mph. reckless driving does not necessary mean speeding because speeding belongs to the list of offences UNDER the category of reckless driving.</div>
