It didn't flip when it hit the curb. It went airborne. It doesn't take a lot of speed to go airborne, this i will testify to from my racing experience on track. I remember I once hit something about 40cm tall while I was braking for a corner and I est the resultant speed when I hit it was roughly down to 30km/h. I flew BIG TIME. Its definately possible, altho it takes a bit of a freakish angle for that to happen.</div></blockquote>orh...so wat i think is correct lah...cos base on accident i get into...flip a car at 40km/h should be hard..so i say must hv thing to hit from underneath / back &gt; on-coming vehicle...to increase the verlocity of the impact...to make it fly/overturn<br><br>u at uk the newspapers also got sg news ah.. or u come back liao...??</div>

I think its more feasible to install a manual speed limiter control if u really want to limit the speed but even then I don't think it would make a very big difference, because accidents can and often do happen within the speed limit too.</div>

Go for D1 courses.....<br><br><strong>If so difficult to achieve even on wet ground (still must go on course) y it happen on a slow speed MX-5 on dry ground (metal plate more slippery than wet ground??) ?? I believe 95% of the cars using that road is not as good as the MX-5. I am just curious how this car loose control in the first place before it flip over to the opp lane?? I think this is the Question most ppl dont understand.</strong><br><br>I'm going to be very very crude here.<br>The Fu*king BMW 318 like mention here is a bloody 1700kg car which the weight even without anti skid wun caused the kind of over steer the MX5 with 1100kg will caused. DUn compare different cars. The way the front engine rear wheel drive car of the MX 5 weight distribution is different as it has a long nose and short butt. I cannot be bothered to explain more anyway.<br><br><strong>Actually thw MX-5 handle better. 318 weight distribution 52/48, MX-5 50/50. I too think heavier will oversteer easier cause by higher momentum (momentum=speed x weight) but it is true that heavier car wont fly so easily. Think is you who say FR car easily skid, now is weight distribution??</strong><br><br>2ndly u all keep claiming that without speed how the bmw got smashed so badly?<br>Let me ask u this, the impact of the mx 5 was at the side not the front. How you go speeding on the side with 4 wheels on the side acting as traction to caused such damage? One conclusion.... the on coming BMW is going above the speed litmit.<br><br><strong>I think the side impact on the passenger side is cause by the van, not the BMW, the driver side not very much damage, doesnt look like being hit by the BMW which the force is so big that sent the MX-5 into flipping. Think the MX-5 cross the kerb by two front wheel and was lifted by the angle of the kerb. This is what the newspaper illustrate too. The MX-5 pratically flew towards the BMW face to face, hit by the BMW from under than flip over to the van. Tell me if the newspaper is wrong.</strong><br><br><strong>What we mean by speeding is when the MX-5 still within control and with 4 wheels on the ground, not when the 4 wheels on the side.<br><br>According to resultant speed theory by heng, you are also doing baseless claim. Dont tell me yr driver friend can tell you how fast the BMW doing?? Or the BMW driver tell you he is speeding??</strong><br><br>thirldly i've explianed on how the whole incident happened not wholely by me but by experts after looking at the damage of the car and surverers surveying the roads afther investigating statements from witnesses and drivers involved involved. How a car can spin and in the end using the broken drive shaft with the rim in a positive camber angle acting as a pivot point to bring the car over the divider are all phiysics and investigation reports by experts. Not me.<br><br><strong>I think you are really somebody. From the short time between the accident to yr first post you had so much things done, even had the investigation reports by expert!!  p/s This is a compliment.</strong><br><br>Lastly. Non of u guys are even anywhere near the accident of spoke to any of the witnesses or drivers or even at the scene yet hauling baseless accusations and theories.<br><br><strong>You got the expert report liao, you correct lor.</strong><br><br>Touch your own heart and Ask yourself this simple question. Have u ever driven recklessly or have near accident cases with a passenger inside? Or Riding with a pillion and self sidded with her along? Just that you were lucky no one got hurt. For this case is just unlucky someone get hurt. Before u point fingers search yourself first.<br><br><strong>The answer is NO. I only had an accident 7 yrs ago, I am alone. Since than I know the danger of speeding and never do that again.</strong><br><br>Finally all heresay are just plain Bullshit. There was no merc involve at all.. YEs there were 2 guys that went down to view the cars together but they both went down in one car.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">If so difficult to achieve even on wet ground (still must go on course) y it happen on a slow speed MX-5 on dry ground (metal plate more slippery than wet ground??) ?? I believe 95% of the cars using that road is not as good as the MX-5. I am just curious how this car loose control in the first place before it flip over to the opp lane?? I think this is the Question most ppl dont understand. The part after it flip over, I can buy your theory.<br></div></blockquote>I think u are missing the point he is making that, IF u went for a drifting course u will know how EASY it is to oversteer at 40km/h on slippery surface. He's not saying it is hard. In fact, all the MX5 driver had to do was to yank the wheel a bit harder and it can happen. U use the term 'good' very loosely here. Maybe I can explain further in my reply to your next comment. In fact the point is oversteer can happen easily. Its the controlling it that is hard, which is why there is a need for a drifting course.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually thw MX-5 handle better. 318 weight distribution 52/48, MX-5 50/50. I too think heavier will oversteer easier cause by higher momentum (momentum=speed x weight) but it is true that heavier car wont fly so easily. Think is you who say FR car easily skid, now is weight distribution??<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok. 1stly many people keep overlooking the point that HANDLING DOES NOT EQUAL STABILITY<br><br>Its simple. A heavier car will be more stable. U are wrong in saying that a heavier car will oversteer easier. It is incorrect in using momentum to explain this. U should be looking at inertia. Inertia is the force that resists change in velocity. Velocity is speed x direction. When u change your direction, even if speed remains constant, your velocity changes. Inertia is what resists change to velocity, and inertia is basically dependent on weight. So higher weight = higher inertia. U would need more force to make a heavier car change velocity(skid) because u would need to overcome the inertia.<br><br>The MX5 is light. Good handling, but less stable. Lesser weight on the wheels, pressing the wheel down into contact with the ground. Besides, the MX5 has a short wheelbase. Cars with short wheelbases handle very well. But are more unstable. Everyone knows a go-kart's handling is excellent. But it is also very unstable. Doesn't take much for u to spin it by mistake. A car which handles well but which has to depend on mechanical means for most of its grip will always be more unstable compared to a car which handles less well. Don't have the mistaken impression that just because its a car which handles well, it shouldn't have spun or skidded easily at low speeds.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">What we mean by speeding is when the MX-5 still within control and with 4 wheels on the ground, not when the 4 wheels on the side.<br><br>According to resultant speed theory by heng, you are also doing baseless claim. Dont tell me yr driver friend can tell you how fast the BMW doing?? Or the BMW driver tell you he is speeding??<br><br></div></blockquote>Thinking thru the scenario from what I know so far, I doubt if the MX5 was speeding, or had to be speeding to fly when it hit the curb. Cars, especially lightweight ones like the MX5, are notoriously easy to tip over if they hit a curb sideways, to be honest. It won't fully rotate in the air but it will certainly fly and it will certainly rotate a bit in the air. Of course his claims about the BMW driver speeding were made in a huff, which I've pointed out to be wrong, taking into consideration the theory of resultant speed(factual physics. u can't escape it)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you are really somebody. From the short time between the accident to yr first post you had so much things done, even had the investigation reports by expert!! p/s This is a compliment.<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok. I believe that he is a friend of the driver, and that he had been to the scene of accident shortly after, because the driver called him. In a fatal accident like this, all evidence are essential. The investigators would have gotten to the scene fairly quickly because of the perishable nature of the evidence, and because they have to gather all their evidence quickly in order for traffic flow to resume. I would believe that he stood by and listened in while the investigators interviewed the eye witnesses, and very possibly spoke to the investigators a bit, and asked them about their prelimanary opinions of the accident. He would thus have some information which, regardless of whether he was 'somebody' or not, would have.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">The answer is NO. I only had an accident 7 yrs ago, I am alone. Since than I know the danger of speeding and never do that again.<br></div></blockquote>Thats his point. U were lucky that no one else was beside u, and that it could easily happen to any of us. And I don't think its fair that U insinuate that speed was the main cause of this accident by saying what u did. Things can happen under the speed limit and they often do.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">Sorry for so many question cos from my point of view it is not logical. If my question make you angry, you can skip my post. Thanks. </div></blockquote>It might not seem logical but I hope my explanations can help u understand better why its actually logical.</div>

In any case, its irrelevant here since the MX5 flipped after being hit by the BMW while airborne. At 40 it CAN go airborne after hitting a curb.
