My questions are legit - You post controversial crap, be prepared to face questions. I saw something which perhaps another person didn't , hence my questions. Do not assume my intentions.<br><br>Pitting myself against them, I believe I would be more of a neutral stance to comment than them (Note: I said comment). I have no previous greivances against the person(s) in question nor had any dealings with the deceased or the accused for that matter.

Why? Because this is just an open forum -  Every single person is entitled to their opinion but do not cross the boundaries of prematurely making your opinion fact. Until proven wrong, by the verdict of the court, I will not be bullied into submission nor will I stand for any bullshit of suppression of opinion by those that dare question.</div>

Doesn't making them sacarstic questions defeat the purpose? For eg, what did u hope to gain by asking SpoonX if he taught the accused to drift? That wasn't questioning a loophole. That was just being mean without a purpose. If u were questioning him on things like, what time did the accident happen and what time did he get there, how many witness testimonies he heard etc, things like that, then I wouldn't have seen any cause for me to question u.<br><br>As u said, u post crap, be prepared for questions. So my 1st Q to u is, what is the purpose of asking if SpoonX taught the accused to drift? Is that actually meant as a question to expose loopholes or if not, what was the intention behind that question? Im asking in a non-judgemental way now, because I accept that u feel he has loopholes and are trying to expose them. But I have to clarify the fact that some of your questions do not seem to serve the same intent. Pls clarify, thanx.<br><br>oh yes, pls do not just assume my gender when addressing me. thanx</div>
