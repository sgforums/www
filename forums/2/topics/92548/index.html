            <div class='col-md body'>Your cars got "worked on" because you parked in secluded lots, which may be convenient to you. My advise, which works all these years, is to park in full view of public - near heavy human traffic, in front of residential windows, etc. etc. This usually means parking far from where I want to go. But which do you prefer? A new scratch, or walking a little bit?<br><br>Parking next to or between other vehicles can cause dents/dimples, so park in corner lots, and park it as close to the kerb as possible. I park mine one inch away from the kerb, leaving about 3 to 4 feet of space for neighboring car to swing open their beautiful doors without hitting mine.<br><br>Multistorey carparks are the most dangerous. Park 4 floors up if you must, and park it in a corner, near windows of surrounding flats. Make it VERY visible to public.  Otherwise, park elsewhere - open lots. ANd walk.</div>

But the following will be needed to mount/install a Digital Surveilance Device in your vehicle:<br><br>&gt;&gt; A small CPU case with Pentium 4 or Athlon processor ( above 2Ghz )<br>&gt;&gt; Two large hard disks installed ( 250Gb each )<br>&gt;&gt; 1Gb of RAM<br>&gt;&gt; Software to manage realtime recording<br>&gt;&gt; A small dome type video camera with wide angle lens ( sees in black &amp; white ) but musty park car with blind-spot to the wall and in full view of public<br>&gt;&gt; Some wiring<br>&gt;&gt; Tap power supply from car battery<br><br>The two hard disks is required for alternately recording footages into. Once one drive is full, the software will switch to the other. Once the next one is full, it will switch back to the other and over-writes previous recordings. Footages can be programmed to be recorded in intervals of any duration of time throughout the night.<br><br>Motion or proximity sensors can also be installed to trigger recording mode. A circuit can also be integrated into the car's body frame such that when a key or sharp metalic object comes in contact, the camera will begin recording.<br><br>This is VERY VERY POSSIBLE.  Any engineer or IT expert reading this, will know that this is POSSIBLE. Only drawback is the sacrifice of some space in your vehicle, and perhaps a separate car battery to power the computer.<br><br></div>

But which do you prefer? A new scratch, or walking a little bit?<br><br>Parking next to or between other vehicles can cause dents/dimples, so park in corner lots, and park it as close to the kerb as possible. I park mine one inch away from the kerb, leaving about 3 to 4 feet of space for neighboring car to swing open their beautiful doors without hitting mine.<br><br>Multistorey carparks are the most dangerous. Park 4 floors up if you must, and park it in a corner, near windows of surrounding flats. Make it VERY visible to public.  Otherwise, park elsewhere - open lots. ANd walk.</div></blockquote>No use one lah...try liao.  My cars 4 years + without a dent mark, scratch mark because I usually park in bright and visible area, and single lot. But also got worked on.  Reason: criminal zai zai work on yr car. Multi-storey car park became the good spot for crime. If own timer camera / sensors are used, U still faced evidential prove in court that the person go near to your car but not necessary scratch the car.  Bottom line, as long as your car inside is working fine and well taken care of in servicing, don't break down on road...happy loh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, let me relate my experience to you, Troy.<br><br>It happened in 1995/6:<br><br>I was siting in my car, eating sushi take-away.

I reported him to the Police at Clementi.<br><br>Up till today, the Police couldn't do anything about it because he denied doing it. And guess what? This guy who scratched my car, turns out to be the guy who slashed a professor's throat in NUS, Raymond Ng. I still have his particulars with me, because I made hime hand me his IC that day at the carpark.<br><br>So indeed, people who scratch cars, are likely mad 90% of the time.<br><br>This is a true account.

How unfortunate.<br>I think it is now possible that ppl who scratch other ppl's cars could be of unsound mind...aka Seow Lang.<br><br>Btw the way, It is not that Police cannot do anything bcoz that guy deny. Even if he admits, it is a non-seizable case and u have to seek compensation by means of civil suit. To date that's how the Law works in Spore. The system A bit SHIT hor...<br><br>Dats why I say we must be prepared to decide what we want to do when we caught these kinda ppl red handed. My neighbour and I ambush for the guy who scratched his car, We were prepared to catch him red handed and wack the daylight out of him and run off...hahaha...but lucky farker never turn up again.<br><br>Anyway in ur case u quite steady liao...chase him and get his IC. Some ppl dun even dare to chase....<br><br>Anymore car victims wan to share their story?</div>
