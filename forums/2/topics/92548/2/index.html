            <div class='col-md body'><br>2004Lancer's thread contribution to this subject sounds logical. More in tune to "why" people scratch cars, or people's cars getting scratched.<br><br>Sometimes, I have this instinct that if I compete with others in a carpark for parking lots and I get a lot first, I suspect I may discover a scratch on my vehicle. Doesn't matter what you drive. I think what matters is being less aggressive, considerate on the road, and yes indeed, don't show off ( hao lian ). The saying goes that often one may win a battle, but not the war.<br><br>Apparently it seems like there are three obvious types of people who will scratch cars:<br>1) Outright mad people, or people of unsound character &amp; mind<br>2) People who are pissed by certain motorists or car owners, &amp; loan sharks<br>3) Teenagers learning about life, the hard way<br><br>And I think the rest are just plain luck. Park too close to a truck or crummy looking van, and you might be sorry. Or as I've seen in shopping centers; parked diagonally in a lot occupying some space of the neighboring lot. This one sucks big time. Damn selfish! And thoughtless.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>In my opinion, owning, driving, and maintaining any kind of vehicle in Singapore is a costly undertaking. But those of us where owning a vehicle is a necessity because of business or work, this predicament is inevitable.<br><br>I drive a commercial van, and it being a van, its body is ultra thin. Like a soft-shell crab. As such, parking in public places is hazardous. Repairing any kind of damage however superficial will run into the hundreds - regardless of the type of vehicle you own. Hence, my painstaking Standard in choosing a parking lot is as follows:<br><br>Standing Policies that Greatly Reduces Risk of Scratch or Superficial Damage<br><br>&gt;&gt; Always keep a disposable camera or digital camera in vehicle<br>&gt;&gt; Park in bright of well lit areas ( corner lots ) and or near heavy human traffic<br>&gt;&gt; DO Not park under any tree ( except young and short ones )<br>&gt;&gt; DO NOT park over or near dried grass or shrubs<br>&gt;&gt; Always in corner lots, and 1 inch away from the kerb and 3 or more feet away from the next empty lot or parked vehicle<br>&gt;&gt; Never park next to another comercial vehicle, or a group of motorcycles<br>&gt;&gt; Never park at or near carpark entrances or exits<br>&gt;&gt; Where there are no corner lots in MSCP, use only lots next to a pillar<br>&gt;&gt; Never park under HDB blocks<br>&gt;&gt; Never park outside schools or school's basketball or sport fields<br>&gt;&gt; Never park near trolly bays in shopping centers<br>&gt;&gt; When parallel parking, park in last lot with kerb behind with rear wheels 1 feet away from kerb<br>&gt;&gt; Never park in secluded carparks, or empty level of MSCP<br>&gt;&gt; Park away from garbage or combustible garbage nearby<br>&gt;&gt; Never park in a lot, where you regularly see a vehicle parked in<br>&gt;&gt; Never park next to a vehicle with a "Just Passed" triangle sign displayed<br><br>Following the above rules/Policies ensures you need not have to spend money on incidences to your vehicle.<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>While the above standing Policies I follow ensures that all vehicles I owned were scratch-free since 1992, I shall not be held liable for any misfortune befalls anyone who adopts and follows these Policies.<br><br></div>
