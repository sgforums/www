Like I said few pages ahead, with proper signal most will/should give way. There are those who don't give way when signalled, and there are those who don't signal and tailgate, and obviously they don't come from this forum.

Rightfully speaking, drivers themselves ought to know that once they are in a frantic situation and in a need to rush, they shouldn't be on the roads cos their presence will pose a menace to the safety of other road users. I can assure you that for an irritated and impatient driver who just want to get from Point A to Point B in a shortest possible time, he is selfishly expecting the public to indulge in his convenience and to him, all the slower vehicles in front of him are labelled as "road hoggers" obstructing his progress.<br><br>And again, do not readily believe every vehicle travelling way beyond the stipulated speed is compelled by life and death circumstances. May i refer you to the thread titled "<strong>What's the maximum speed you have driven in Singapore</strong>" under the car forums, by Mr "lovetospeed" and you will be horrified to find out that there certainly exists those morons thrill seekers who speed and tailgate just for fun. Do go into this topic and read about how these young chaps brag and boost about their top speed and their car performance. Please, for goodness sake, do be a bit more skeptical about speeding vehicles. Life and death circumstances??? My foot! Don't be naive. How often do you think life and death scenarios occur on sg roads.<br><br>To me, it's more likely that the idiot driver overslept and needs to get to his workplace on time for fear of being late, and this selfish chap is blaming the general public for causing his delay and expecting them to indulge in his convenience???? C'mon, we are all aware that young chaps these days love to speed just for the thrill and on every friday and saturday evenings, you see most cars zooming beyond 90 along the expressways towards town area and u really think they are rushing to the hospitals.?? Stop deceiving yourself, surely you know they are rushing to meet their friends in dinners, movies, pubs, discos etc after receiving loads of phonecalls and sms messages like "OOiiii!!! why so late??? what time u coming??? quick lah!!! we are all starving and waiting for you leh!!! you must come here fast so that they can serve the dishes leh!!!" So you are telling us we ought to indulge in their convenience by giving way to them????<br><br>And as a matter of fact, who are you to bring courtesy into the picture where our drivers, on the whole, don't even bother to signal properly when changing lanes and making turns. Go teach that basic courtesy of signalling to them first before you talk about giving way to vehicle wanting to overtake you.<br><br>I'm not insisting i'm right and the law is on my side but it's just that i follow the law and the law is rightly enforced and it can never be bent. I'm not encouraging you guys to road hog but i'm trying to convince you that road-hogging on the roads is inevitable.<br><br>Even if we are compelled by life and death situation, a smart person will know he won't get anything out of speeding and tailgating. He should anticipate there will always be slower moving vehicles impeding his progress and causing his delay. Out of sheer frustration, to this poor desperate guy in a hurry, those vehicles in front of him will only be nuisance to him. I hope you guys realize that's the cruelty of life and "road hogging" is inevitable.<br><br>Apart from expressways, i'm sure u guys know on normal roads, there are traffic lights every 500m. What's the point of driving as fast as possible and forcing the front vehicle to give way when after you make an exit from the expressway, u still have to stop when approaching a red light. Will you be cursing the traffic light as "selfsh road hogger"? Are you wishing that the red traffic light will spare a thought on your "life and death" predicament and give way to you by turning green immediately??<br><br>I am not being cynical by not believing that speeding vehicles are forced to do so by critical cirumstances but it's a fact that we can also think of hundred other reasons for impatient driving and tailgating. Other than shifting the blame to the road hogger for causing the delay which result in a life lost, why don't attribute the delay to destiny, everything is all destined and we have to accept it.<br><br>The frequent heavy volume of traffic in singapore shall constantly remind us to anticipate traffic congestions and delays and give sufficient time buffer to get to our destination. There is no excuse for claiming that you are in a hurry and therefore this warrants you the right to speed and tailgate, and the front vehicle should always give way to you. We cannot indulge in those drivers who fail to plan their journey time adequately well and expecting every vehicle to give way to them, this will only make them take such "courtesy" for granted, and once they are deprived of such courteous privileges, they will lose their cool and think the public owe them a favour.</div>
