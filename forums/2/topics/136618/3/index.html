            <div class='col-md body'>it would appear that very little can be said about the stick-in-the-mud mentality of drivers who persist in either road hogging or tailgating as if it was their god given rite.<br><br>we often bend the law and test our luck when drivin on the roads, be it speeding in order to overtake a slower vehicle, or following too close coz of a slower vehicle. to both, they are probably as smart as the other party that thinks he's stupid. basic rules of engagement and responsibility for self and other road users applies in all cases. if u get away with it without a speedin ticket or invlove urself in an accident, fine. better luck next time. but if u get caught 4 it, then be prepared to pay the consequences of going to court/pay money, and/or get urself/others hurt/maimed/decapitated or killed.<br><br>simple. wats there to argue?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Don't get yourself too worked up, I stronger believe none of those tailgaters you are mentioning are visitors of this forum. I believe everyone here are in the right mind when it comes to tailgating issue.<br><br>However, we do have to be clear on 1 thing too. Although the much debated fact of whether a max speed limit driver is actually a road hogger illegally or morally, I think we should put this example 1 side and prehaps realise the bigger picture. That is always keep to the left whenever possible, and don't push the driver into giving way. Giving way is an act of coutesy, nothing is going to happen if you ask for it in the wrong way. Same goes to playing pang and slightly refuses to give way.<br><br>Are we going to fight all the way to the roads, or are we going to learn and understand prehaps the reason behind each act (<span style="color: red;">NO REASON FOR TAILGATING</span>). If both side can't work it out, fine. I can always drive on the third lane (Now lorries and vans are zooming at 80kph too, so still not very slow, good for FC too).</div>

If you tailgate when there is a road hogger in front, you are confirmed wrong. Please don't allow excuses for that stupid behaviour.</div>

Your father buy the road one ah?   Overtaking lane you don't want to give way, other people must over take on left?<br><br>Don't give way some more want to speed up.  Show how little your driving skill is.   If people tailgate you speed up you think they won't follow is it?<br><br>Already say not so much traffic and you don't want to go off overtaking lane.   Other driver must over take on left.  Your kind of ch**by driver should be ban from the road.</div>
