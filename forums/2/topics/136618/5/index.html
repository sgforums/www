One day all road electric and all car move on track. Like that car got one speed only. Today car can go fast and slow.  I only study sec 2 all my friend call me ah beng also I got brain to think other people.  Some more got people say they drive 110 and KPKB people tailgate.  They also speed what?  But they think they speed ok other people faster then other people wrong.  Always like that type mind.  Other people wrong I right.<br><br>I go to race track many time.  Always got safety driving lesson and intructor always say what other people do you can not control so you must control what you do.  If got people tailgate don KPKB them you KPKB you first because you never see he coming and give way.  If people overtake on left and shoot in front, can not KPKB them also.  KPKB you first because he can overtake on left mean you also can go left and give way but don want.  My instructer say got people tailgate you must slow down little bit and look for open on left.  See open only must signal left then speed quickly so suddenly got space in front of tailgater and give way.  Defensive driving friend!  Learn first then can don get accident!  Not don speed only no accident.</div>

Someone is driving slower than me in front. Lane 2 suddenly got a opening. Mean I am not longer overtaking anyone. So I filter left. Than I drive ahead. Maybe faster than lane 1, only when I reach a slower car in my lane, I try to filter right to overtake. If in the process, I have come in front of the first slow car in lane 1, I didn't overtake him in a planned manner, I am just applying the keep left when overtaking rule.<br><br>If in a certain situation that I can't filter when encountered a slower car in front, what makes you think he can?

No one can ever justify for doing a wrong thing because another person is also doing wrong. It is true that the biker should give way. If I were him, I would have done so. No point putting my life on the line.<br>But if that biker chose not to give way, that merc also should not tailgate him right? At that speed, if he touch that biker's rear wheel, some mother will cry the heart out. But what about that driver?.....<br>Also, I would like to know, if it was a car travelling at 110 on the right, was it right for the merc to tailgate him then? Because it was a car? So if it was a bike, then it was right for the merc to tailgate him?<br>The signboard says bike should not use right lane. This may or may not be a law. TP don't catch riders on the 1st lane. This sign was probably done to remind small cc bikers to not hog the lane. But a class 2 bike can run as fast as a sports car. Then why shouldn't the bike have the right to use the right lane?<br></div></blockquote>If i not wrong... it stated in the Terory test.... that bike are not allowed to use the overtaking lane...  so if the bike is at the right lane... it his fault..he at the place...whereby he should not be in the first place..</div>

Anyway, those tailgaters I see, they don't wait for poeple to filter out, they will go straight in. Didn't even give the guy to overtake just 1 car, last night I saw. Beam and beam. If it is me, I will just slow down to filter left instead. Faster this way, but of course will piss off the driver more.</div>
