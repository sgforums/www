Nobody say is ok to tailgate.   Everyone already agree is wrong.<br><br>But road hogging is also wrong.  You keep saying is ok to block others and no need to move off overtaking lane even if you can.<br><br>You don't want to give way to others, you keep saying you can stay in the overtaking lane even if left lane is empty. Even if another car want to go by.  That is wrong!  You give so many excuse always insist you are right.  Better don't drive.</div>

You win.  What speed you want to drive is right speed.  Any lane can drive no need to give way to other driver.  No need to use head on the road.  Don't go over speed limit enough. Only must follow 1 road law.  Do 50 in lane 2 of 90km/h highway also can.  Is not speeding.  Other people must drive around me.</div>

He water had broken and she desperately needed to get her to the nearest hospital. Along the way, TP stopped him. Upon learning of the situation, they actually turned on the sirens and cleared a path on the shoulder while the husband drove immediately behind, all on the shoulder.<br><br>These are situations where breaking the law is the right thing to do (perhaps the only option available)<br><br>Unfortunately, typical singaporean opportunitists as we are, a whole gang of cars followed suit behind them, definitely not because they had wives who were equally urgent.</div>
