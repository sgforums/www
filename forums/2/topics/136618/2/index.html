            <div class='col-md body'>I see more people getting the idea of what is and what isn't road hog. (Wonder why everyone's so quiet the last time I debated <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=130428" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.) Anyway, I would urge more readers to consider the various conditions around you when you encounter slower moving vehicles in front of you. Watch your speed, watch your distance, watch left lane, and ask yourself what are your reasons if you want to overtake.<br><br>I seriously hope that when you "desperately" wants to overtake even though the other guy is travelling at top speed limit, are you in the situation that you all keep quoting as the reason to drive over the speed limit. Cause like the story of the girl who shout "woft" 3 times, sooner or later no-one is going to believe you anymore.<br><br>By the way, road hogging lane 2 isn't nice too. Cause recently I have been able to travel 90 odd in lane 3 very often, cutting those jokers in lane 2.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by houndy:</div><div class="quote_body">I have to agree with you on this one.. our speed limit is 90KM.. yes.. but if someone comes behind you at 110KM.. you should give way and later go behind him/her if you wish to continue on the first lane... no point irritating yourself and the other driver and getting  into an accident... </div></blockquote>As some ppl mention, it can also be dangerous to keep switching lane, depending on traffic condition. And I stick to my point that with this theory, even a 130kmh traveller need to give way to a 160 kmh traveller, and its gonna be more difficult to switch lanes safely as the speed goes higher.<br><br>Personally, I don't purposely travel 90 on rite lane. I dutifully travel around 90 in middle and overtake those at 80 and switch back to middle. But sometimes the middle lane is quite jammy, and I juz want to 'overtake' a few more ppl before going back to middle lane, me travelling abt 100. But some guy travelling at 120 sure come along and push my backside.<br><br>It's these ppl that I'm trying to address. Out of courtesy, we should give way. But sometimes when we don't, pls don't act as if we owe you something; you're breaking the law here!</div>

(if 10 pple say ure a pig,and u say the 10 pple r pigs..who do u think is the pig?) In most country, its safer for slower vehicle to change lane...kind of a law for them as u travel u would see "keep left unless overtaking" sign .... and i find that ur definition and example for road hogging is exaggerating...we are taking abt sg roads where 90-110 should give way to faster vehicle..if u r travelling at 200+ and a faster vehicle coming from behind...u would wait for a chance to go to the middle lane(where u could still drive at 200+) and let the faster vehicle past and go back to the right lane..wouldnt u?<br><br>If ure travelling at 160...and u up ur speed coz u saw a faster vehicle behind...do u think there will any diff in speeding ticket? if ure travelling at 90 and encounter the same problem, i doubt u would have any problem shifting to the middle lane and let him go w/o slowing ur speed..<br><br>- If u have to slow down to 90 from 250 to fit back in middle lane, doesn't that make u a SUPER ROAD HOGGER?

No wonder ppl always doing all kinds of funny things.<br><br>As I said, if given the chance, practice courteous driving. But if you find it inconvenient (measuring your own personal driving standard) to keep switching from middle to right to middle, there is no legal wrong to travel 90 on rite lane.<br><br>Yes, overseas unfortunately can get more rowdy. But its becuz those ppl have the mentality like yours and all you guys. "I'm faster, get out of my way" Just that in S'pore, ppl dare not carry it too far. But overseas, they dun care.<br><br>Anyway, by your defintion, 90-110 should give way cuz to you its quite slow and considered obstructing in a sense. But 200 is super exaggerated. So what constitutes 'fast' is all in people's own perception. Like tat no ending wat? That's why there's legislation that states 90! Until the day the govt increase to 120, wat can u say?<br><br>If 10 ppl call me pig and i call the 10 ppl pigs and our govt call them pigs also, who the pig? Them la, so simple.<br><br>Anyhow, I dunno wat time you drive and where you drive. Clear stretch of road its very easy to be courteous. Even if the 'ass.hole' as you call him is blocking ur way at 90 on rite lane, juz overtake on left lor. You should also practise some courtesy isn't it, cuz he isn't breaking the law? If overtaking on left is against some law (I'm not too sure about this), then too bad.<br><br>Its when situation gets jammy like rush hour on CTE and TPE and ppl still insist on zooming down rite lane like its their grandfather's expressway that things become hot.<br><br>Let's just use another analogy. This guy queuing up to buy wanton mee and you are behind him. You are more in a rush so when the stallholder ask "yes, what you want" you shout out first you want a $3 bowl. The guy just keep quiet and let you order first. Then when the order is served on the counter, you expect him to also take the tray and pass it to you?!?!<br><br>You jolly well find your own way to get to the counter and collect ur own damn tray.<br><br>You know why I have to keep using stupid analogies? Cuz u ppl can't understand a simple thing like "Speed Limit = 90" "Right lane is NOT designated only for overtaking" = Travelling on rite lane at 90 is legal. Courtesy can come when things are fine and dandy and everybody is happy. But if you don't want to give way, NO WRONG wat. Don't act as if you are RIGHT to have way on the right lane just as long as you are faster.<br><br>You are entitled to your opinion like "Ya lor, its a dumb law, they should change it" or "Even though its the law, ppl should be considerate". Like tat ppl can't flame you cuz its ur opinion.<br><br>But stuff like "Those bloody idiots on rite lane cruising at 90 think they are right" (not saying ur post) IS A DOWNRIGHT STUPID COMMENT??? Becuz IT IS RIGHT?!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I was just pulling your legs when I said I will cut into your lane and jam brakes. Why would I do that for? Not worth it lah.<br><br>You're lucky to be driving in SG and road hog. Try that on other countries, especially on the NS highway in Malaysia.

That is not considered hogging. A merc was right behind him, tailgating him. The motorcyclist sensed it and went faster, only to have that bloody merc also gone faster, STILL tailgating him. Hope you are aware that if he was to ride at 100km/h on 2nd lane, he would be blocked by many "hoggers". But riding on 1st lane at 100km/h, I wouldn't consider he was  hogging. But he got tailgated so dangerously by that merc. Can you see it???<br>There is no need to tailgate. If you want, ovetake! Why tailgate? The threadstarter may be inconsiderate, but he pointed out rightly the FACT that tailgating is more dangerouls than hogging. As for ppl who says cut infront and jam brake, why do that? Someone who is inconsiderate doesn't warrant such treatment. If you dun like him, overtake him!!<br>If someone is is a hurry, like sending ppl to hospital, you can always overtake roadhoggers. There are plenty of considerate drivers around the road. There is NEVER a need to tailgate or hate roadhoggers.</div></blockquote>A bike cannot travel on the first lane... the bike is at fault..merc no fault.. even if u are travelling at 110km/h.. a car from before is travelling at a faster speed than u... pls give way also..or esle u are consider road hogging too./.<br><br>Come on la.. some time u really have no choice .. the middle lane has car in there .. how are u going to overtake ?</div>

Is Lane 1 on an expressway designated as an overtaking lane ? and that<br>only on lane 1, you can overtake other vehicles ?<br><br>There is no specific legislation stipulating that the rightmost lane is<br>only for overtaking.<br><br>2. When one drives on Lane 1 on an expressway at the speed limit of 90Kmph,<br>can one be booked for road hogging - assuming he is not blocking a<br>emergency vehicle ?<br><br>Whether travelling on on the rightmost lane within speed limit constitutes<br>road hogging is circumstantial. Motorists travelling at or near the speed<br>limit are generally not deemed to be road hogging.<br><br>3. If you overtake another vehicle on lane 2, using lane 1, are you allowed<br>to exceed the speed limit in the process ?<br><br>Driving beyond the speed limit to overtake a vehicle is clearly a speeding<br>offence.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>So the bike is generally not at fault and the merc is speeding.</div>

You say merc no fault? No one can ever justify for doing a wrong thing because another person is also doing wrong. It is true that the biker should give way. If I were him, I would have done so. No point putting my life on the line.<br>But if that biker chose not to give way, that merc also should not tailgate him right? At that speed, if he touch that biker's rear wheel, some mother will cry the heart out. But what about that driver?.....<br>Also, I would like to know, if it was a car travelling at 110 on the right, was it right for the merc to tailgate him then? Because it was a car? So if it was a bike, then it was right for the merc to tailgate him?<br>The signboard says bike should not use right lane. This may or may not be a law. TP don't catch riders on the 1st lane. This sign was probably done to remind small cc bikers to not hog the lane. But a class 2 bike can run as fast as a sports car. Then why shouldn't the bike have the right to use the right lane?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all this issue stems from the ideas that "I have the right to ...". Hoggers say "I am travelling at the speed limit, so I have the right to stay on this lane". Tailgaters say "I am fast, so this idiot should give way to me..."<br>I read an article some where that said in europe, there is this particular town where an architect design the traffic system by taking out all traffic signs and traffic lights. That particular junction, for many years, had not seen an accident. Reason being simple, there is no more right of way. Everyone are giving way to others. Everyone slows down. No one claim anymore rights.<br>This is the correct way to think. Driving and riding serve to bring us from pt A to B. Not a place to show off ego or idealism. Let us not take special circumstances like sending someone to hospital for emergency. Those are special cases. But in general, if everyone think for others, there will be a lot less traffic accidents around.</div>
