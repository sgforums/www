I also believe that road hogging isn't dangerous, just inconsiderate. Read carefully and you would notice his issue is with those tailgaters, which everyone of us is not comfortable with.<br><br>What I want to emphasis is that tailgater to force road hogger off the lane is a much more inconsiderate and idoitic act than hogging itself. Other polite signals to overtake are more welcome, even to the thread starter, I guess. Like even when the escalater case, if you politely ask, the right guy will still inch a space for you to cross, if situation calls for it (catching train).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seen a motorcyclist riding at 100km/h on 1st lane. That is not considered hogging. A merc was right behind him, tailgating him. The motorcyclist sensed it and went faster, only to have that bloody merc also gone faster, STILL tailgating him. Hope you are aware that if he was to ride at 100km/h on 2nd lane, he would be blocked by many "hoggers". But riding on 1st lane at 100km/h, I wouldn't consider he was  hogging. But he got tailgated so dangerously by that merc. Can you see it???<br>There is no need to tailgate. If you want, ovetake! Why tailgate? The threadstarter may be inconsiderate, but he pointed out rightly the FACT that tailgating is more dangerouls than hogging. As for ppl who says cut infront and jam brake, why do that? Someone who is inconsiderate doesn't warrant such treatment. If you dun like him, overtake him!!<br>If someone is is a hurry, like sending ppl to hospital, you can always overtake roadhoggers. There are plenty of considerate drivers around the road. There is NEVER a need to tailgate or hate roadhoggers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many chain collisions arise because of tail-gating. A lot of these smart-alecs overestimate their reaction and eventually succumb to a collision because they are unable to brake in time to avoid hitting the front vehicle. Very lousy driving skills also.<br><br>Even if you are approaching a road-hogger, as a road user, you have the responsibility to maintain a safe following behind him such that when he jam-brake, you can avoid hitting him. You DON'T F U CKING TAILGATE him unless you are asking for trouble understand. When a collision occurs, it's you who is at fault for banging him from behind<br><br>i love road-hogging</div>
