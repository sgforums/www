Their Sales Manager Vincent Who? told me straight to my face that it would take 8 weeks to deliver.<br><br>Even gave me a breakdown of 6 weeks to assemble and 2 weeks for delivery.<br><br>First week of June came and I didn't hear from them.  I called and they told me it will take a longer, impossible to deliver in just 2 months (LIE NUMBER 1), it will come end of June (LIE NUMBER 2).<br><br>Last week of June I went down and Vincent told me "Good news!!  Happy for you your car confirm here first week of July!!!"  (LIE NUMBER 3).<br><br>First week of July I called and a sales person named Tony Who? said not yet maybe another week (LIE NUMBER 4).  When I said please confirm it cause they have been giving me one false dateline after another and I a guarantee I'm going to start hearing late July, then August, he put Vincent Who? back on the phone.<br><br>Vincent then said he had the shipping manifest in his hands and CONFIRM!!!  THE CAR SHIPS OUT ON THE 16th JULY!!!  10 DAYS FOR SHIPPING!!!   (LIE NUMBER 5).<br><br>On the 21st I called Vincent to confirm that the car was on the way, he said yes on the way, but refused to confirm that it left on the 16th like he said it would.  I made it clear then that I was not happy with the delays and Vincent said this was an unusual case (LIE NUMBER 6).<br><br>I asked for the procedure and he said, "When the car gets here, 3 to 4 days for paperwork, then 3 to 4 days more for inspection.".<br><br>On the 24th Tony called to tell me the car will be in Singapore on the 30th and he'll call me I can view it.<br><br>30th came, I waited all day.. no call.  I sent Tony and SMS, no reply.  I called in the evening and he said he needs to check.  Shipping office already closed.<br><br>Monday, 1st Aug... no callback from PMotors.  I called Vincent again and he said the paper work will clear in a couple of days and he'd call me to let me know the entire procedure  (LIE NUMBER 7).<br><br>Thursday...  No call from them again.  Already more than the 3 to 4 days for paperwork like they said.<br><br>I called again and this time Vincent told me that I was bothering them and he has no time to answer my questions.  He said cars are always delayed and thats the way it is... it's normal and if I bought a Mercedes it could be delayed for 6 months.    Just an FYI...  I HAVE BOUGHT A MERC BEFORE AND IT WAS DELIVERED IN ONE WEEK!!!!!!<br><br>4 months after I paid, I'm still waiting for my Honda!!!<br><br>I'm probably breaking all sorts of forum rules by using company and staff names, but I just think that people should be aware of this.  Just so everyone knows, if you deal with PMotors, GET EVERYTHING IN BLACK AND WHITE AND HAVE THEM SIGN IT!!!   They lie through their teeth every step of the way!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>u may be prepared to be banned in this forum but are u prepared to get sued?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sympathize with your situation.<br><br>However, delays in car shipments are quite common and are not restricted to parallel imports (PIs) or the company you mentioned.<br><br>Unless you are taking ex-stock (i.e. stock that is already in the local port/warehouse), it is normal to wait at least 2 months to collect your vehicle for the assembly &amp; shipping if the car is ordered on indent basis.<br><br>Unless there is a written agreement that the car will be delivered within a certain period (unlikely), you have no case against them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, story reminds me of my own when i was waiting for mine. PI told me dat they indented a car i was hunting around for and its due to be shipped in a few days. best if i can confirm the deal now in case someone books it when it arrives. wat a mistake it was.<br><br>turns out that only after i've put down money to bid for COE, they said they will indent only when i get the COE coz of the "good" price that they gave me. gave the SOB PI a piece of my mind and lucky for me, the receipt they signed had a delivery note in fine print which says delivery in 6 weeks or 1 month. whichever is earlier.<br><br>told them that i dun care if they have to fly the car here by aeroplane, but if they dun deliver as in the sales order, i'm takin them to court. PI at that pt kan cheong and offer to give me discount if i wait or choose another car. ended up paying 2k less for a better car, delivered in 1 week  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>moral of the story. always get things in black and white. PI can promise u the moon and the stars, but ultimately, they still wanna make sure they earn money. chances are,  they wun have shipments until they pool enuff cars amongst themselves or with other PIs to make up one load of shipment. not cost effective for them to ship one car only at a time i guess.</div>
