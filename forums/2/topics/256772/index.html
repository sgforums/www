Unless you can explain why LTA has approved it in the first place, your argument is flawed right from the beginning. Enough said. And dont teach me anything about value of life or everybody's life.

            <div class='col-md body'>You are entitled to your view and so am I. I am deem what you have penned as utter rubbish too. Have you got stats to say that the # of Van with sun shades are down? It is purely YOUR OWN observation. TP does not say whatever is ILLEGAL. It is ROV aka LTA. Get your facts right.<br><br>SAF protocol is right when a vehicle is large and you cannot see the rear.
