At the same time, my friend a mech from Malaysia JB, came all the way down to Singapore to view my damage. To my surprise, he quoted RM10K including new paint. The only thing is to tow my baby to Tampoi and he will settle everything for me. All parts are strictly from Perodua the manufacturer, 2km away from his workshop (one of the authorised workshop in malaysia)! And now, my baby has just tow in......hehe... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Honestly, if I own a Picanto and suffer from the same damages, our local insurance will declare total lost due to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beyond economical repair</span>. So you have only two choices, <strong>scrap it</strong> (not worth of doing if you still owe the instalment) or <strong>repair</strong> yourself (do you have extra cash of 23K?). Think about it. I <span style="font-style: italic;">cant tow my Picanto to Korea to repair</span>, right??????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>That is the reason why I invest on this cute little monster (Kelisa). Original parts are very much more cheaper than the local distributor.<br><br><strong>Live Example based on actual figure: Headlight</strong><br>Perodua Tampoi branch selling: RM320 (<strong>S$145</strong>)<br>Perocom selling: <strong>S$260</strong> (add another S$30 can go Tampoi and buy two headlights, 1 left 1 right)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So, see and judge yourself..........<br><br></div>

But I have this to say, when I buy a car, I dun buy with the mindset that repairs costs will be cheaper or the car can be towed back to the place of origin in an event of a severe accident.  Buying a car is very much of a personal preference.  You have to test drive both the cars in order to know.  I have done so and have made my choice.  By the way, for the manual version, the 1.1 litre Picanto costs S$1,000 more than a 1 litre Kelisa. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

U will be better off getting a 1.5 year old vios or corolla....only cost a little more and in my opinion a much better car.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad truth, the 1.3 only comes in Auto for Singapore. Think only the 1.6 model can be specified with Manual. 1.6 is quite a strong performer, think the auto does 0-100km/hr in 9+ seconds, not too bad. Manual will be a little quicker. The 1.6 is a DOHC, the 1.3 is a SOHC. However, I do not think there is any 1.6 on the 2nd hand market. I have not even seen one on the road yet.<br><br>Well the 1.3 litre is quite a decent performer considering it's displacement. Managed to top out at a little over 160km/hr with 4 adults and full load of luggage. Acceleration is acceptable as long as u do not mind the din the engine makes during hard acceleration....but then again most cars of this class are no better in this aspect. What u will appreciate is it's Kart like handling, had me playing and shredding rubber at Marina South carpark....low horsepower but very much fun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Think autotest??</div>

It is definitely a matter of preferences and priorities.  With what I am earning, I could have my choice of Mercedes, BMWs or Saab if I want to.  But based on my preferences and priority, I actually chose a Kia. Probably I just feel good having a new car to drive and at the same time, having extra cash in my pocket.  Do you know that our Minister of State, (Ministry of Education and Ministry of Community Development and Sports), and Member of Parliament (Joo Chiat), Mr Chan Soo Sen, actually drives a previous model of the Nissan March that is at least more than 6 years old.  He is certainly not cheap. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
