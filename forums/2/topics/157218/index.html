            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure you realise by now that consumption is a very tricky and evasive issue....and is very subjective to one's right foot and driving style.<br><br>If its running cost you are worried about, then there are other major things which need to be considered.  For example, some car agents may charge more than others for maintenance/repairs (and all cars will need repairs/maintenance for sure).  Besides parts pricing, the frequency of repairs needed is also a consideration.<br><br>For example, regarding the Nissan and Toyota, one important consideration is the timing belt.  Nissans use timing chains which lasts through the 10 years legal lifespan of cars here.  Toyota still uses timing belts which have to be replaced after 80-100k km (and this can be quite an expensive operation - from a few hundred to over S$1000 each time, including labour, water pump, mountings, crankshaft sensor, etc etc).<br><br>Another main consideration would be the price.  If one car is $5000 cheaper than the other, then its OK even if the cheaper car drinks a bit more - because it all balances out over time, approximately equalising the total running costs over time.<br><br>Yet another consideration is that most Singaporeans don't keep their cars for 10 years (which is why looking at price of brand new cars alone is NOT enough).  You have to estimate how long you'd want to keep it....and try to find out how much you can sell it for.  Some cars lose more value than others, in the same period of time.  The difference can be quite a few thousand in some cases.<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say is to examine the whole cost of ownership, not just the the fuel consumption.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, well said Gentlerock. One shd not be uptight over FC if you talk about same range of cars, eg 1.4 to 1.6 cc. How much can be the difference , the most about $30 per mth or 360 per yr. So unless you are a taxi driver or a roving salesman , FC cost wont hurt your pocket. Go and get the car you like and enjoy drinvg it. Nows the time as cars is at its cheapest for 20 yrs! If you work in Shenton Way or in town, parking costs is much worst. Why not buy yourself a off-peak car and enjoy driving at nite and on weekends/Pubhols.<br><br>As for Nissans, my experience is vgood. Just trade in my sunny for a latio. My sunny( manual) of 4 yrs gave me no problems at all. Did not spent a cent on maintenance n repairs,except for the scheduled servicings. Even the battery lasted 4 yrs. I wld not have changed if not for the cheap car price and being tired of driving a manual car. Recommend a Nissan anytime- March, Sunny or Latio. Love the keyless entry in my Latio( std ). Now only 58k, when it first came out in Mar this yr was 74K. Drop 16k in 7 mths!!<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was deciding between the Nissan Sunny and Toyota Vios and finally decided on the Nissan because:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>1. Price Difference</strong></span><br>At the time of booking, the price difference was about $4000-$5000... I calculated and spread that out to 10 years. In essence, each <strong>year </strong>I get $400-$500 more, or about $35 each <strong>month</strong>.<br>The FC rating (based on REAL users) for the Nissan is abt 11-12km/l, and the Vios about 14-15 km/l.<br>So for the price difference, I actually get '20 Litres' (at current high price) of petrol more for the Nissan per month. To BREAK-EVEN, that would mean the you have to travel more than <strong>1200km PER MONTH</strong>.  I certainly don't...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>2. Make</strong></span><br>Japan-made vs Thailand-Made.<br>Chasis of Sunny is more solid (hence heavier)<br>There is a reason why Sunny is sold in Japan, and not Thai-made Toyota models<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>3. Maintenance</strong></span><br>For the local package, Nissan warranty is 3 years, servicing inclusive of spark plugs, oil-filters etc... vs Toyota servicing free twice only. Translated cost can come up to about another $1000.<br><br>Hope that helps....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

So FC makes a whole world of different.<br><br>Although FC is highly dependant on the Foot, but still different cars will translate different percentage of their supposed horse power to the wheels. Meaning engine efficiency. Thus you will see a wide range of FC per car make. So a list like what I linked would more or less helps a little for those who think FC matters a lot due to their workplace, or weekly routine.</div>
