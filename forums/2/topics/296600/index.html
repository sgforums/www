            <div class='col-md body'>Just a short story to remind you guys to collect your  receipt when<br>filling petrol in malaysia.<br>while queueing at the customs for our turn to stamp our passports to go back S'pore, 2 malay guys wearing esso polo tees, probably from the station whr i filled my tank, approached us and told us that we did not pay for our petrol (pls note i've already handed our passports to the custom officer).<br>Of cos we told him we paid but the malay guy asked me for receipt which i cant produce since i don't normally ask from the counter. Hearing that, the officer, while holding the passports, refused to let us go unless we settle the payment.  even after telling them so many times that we paid, they don't let us go, and asked 1 of us to follow them back to check the cctv. of cos we didn't agree and told the officer to let all of us go back together to check, he said yes, but have to leave the passports with him as he claimed that he had already stamped one of our passports.  Rubbish!  cos we didn't see him stamp anything.  In the end, my fren, who was rushing back to Singapore decided to just pay them 'again'and end the problem. the two guys looked happy as if the trip to look for us at the customs paid off.  In the end, i paid them 62RM when i only pumped 56.50 RM worth of synergy F1 petrol. After that, the 2 guys walked to the officer's booth and shake hands with the officer and the senior, happily. in front of us man.....it appears that the staffs at the petrol stations will informed those people waiting at the customs if they noticed anyone leaving the station without the receipt.  So bros and sis, pls rem to collect your receipt when paying for anything, yes anything there. Who knows what story they may have next time. Don't give these ppl a chance to earn bonus.<br><br></div>
