              <p>Anyway, mauz, reason your own cut-and-paste carefully. The Wiki article is about SAR...and if you want to compare the urbanised areas properly, then look at Kowloon. It's there in the quote.</p>
              <p>They may not have COEs but it's more troublesome to drive up and down hilly terrain, public transport is good enough and, get this, not everyone lives and works on the same island.</p>
              <p>You might want to scroll down in the Wiki article and read the articles on public transportation, the bridge tolls (this is not between 2 countries as in our case, mind you) and the number of cars that use them daily.</p>
              <p>You might actually notice that there are trams in the city, and how dense and interconnected the rail network is, among other things. Can our public transport system compare?</p>
              <p>So why would they need to control the vehicle population via bidding, when other factors are able to keep it in check?</p>
              <p>Oh, and so what if vehicle prices were lower back then too - were salaries sufficient to afford one then? COEs were introduced as the economy started to boom.</p>
              <p>And a little known fact that can actually be Googled is that COE and ARF can be waivered for handicapped drivers (which I don't think is enough - people whom the disabled are dependent on for transport shuld also be entitled to it).</p>

              <p>Whether Hong Kong or Singapore public transportation is a subject of speculation by you, unless you have done an unbias research into the transportation system of both countries, how can one conclude that Hong Kong has a more efficient transporation system. Do you have any conclusive research?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether Kowloon be more urbanised than the whole of Hong Kong is quite irrelevant, because we are comparing countries per se and not comparing Kowloon with Seng Kang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to enforce my point about Hong Kong SAR being more mountainous than Singapore, therefore less roads in Hong Kong as compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hong Kong SAR</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hong Kong Island = 385.11km</p>
              <p>Kowloon and New Kowloon = 399.11km</p>
              <p>New Territories = 961.16km</p>
              <p><strong>Total Road Length for Hong Kong = 1,745km</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>Expressways = 153km</p>
              <p>Arterial Roads = 613km</p>
              <p>Collector Roads = 489km</p>
              <p>Local Access Roads = 2,042km</p>
              <p><strong>Total Road Length for Singapore = 3,297km</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can choose not to believe in these numbers or sidetrack, it's your prerogative, but it does reflect on yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Salaries are indeed more than sufficient to pay for a car then, it just depends on what kind of salary one is getting, else nobody would have own car during that period.</p>

              <p>Whether Hong Kong or Singapore public transportation is a
                  subject of speculation by you, unless you have done an unbias
                  research into the transportation system of both
                  countries, how can one conclude that Hong Kong has a more
                  efficient transporation system. Do you have any conclusive
                  research?</p>
              <p>Whether Kowloon be more urbanised than the whole of Hong Kong is
                  quite irrelevant, because we are comparing countries per se and not
                  comparing Kowloon with Seng Kang.</p>
              <p>Just to enforce my point about Hong Kong SAR being more
                  mountainous than Singapore, therefore less roads in Hong Kong as
                  compared to Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hong Kong
                  SAR</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hong Kong Island = 385.11km</p>
              <p>Kowloon and New Kowloon = 399.11km</p>
              <p>New Territories = 961.16km</p>
              <p><strong>Total Road Length for Hong Kong = 1,745km</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p>Expressways = 153km</p>
              <p>Arterial Roads = 613km</p>
              <p>Collector Roads = 489km</p>
              <p>Local Access Roads = 2,042km</p>
              <p><strong>Total Road Length for Singapore = 3,297km</strong></p>
              <p>You can choose not to believe in these numbers or sidetrack,
                  it's your prerogative, but it does reflect on yourself.</p>
              <p>Salaries are indeed more than sufficient to pay for a car then,
                  it just depends on what kind of salary one is getting, else nobody
                  would have own car during that period.</p>

              <p>Speak for yourself.</p>
              <p>First, bask in the irrelevance and pointlessness of this answer:</p>
              <p><em>Salaries are indeed more than sufficient to pay for a car then,
                  it just depends on what kind of salary one is getting, else nobody
                  would have own car during that period. </em></p>
              <p>I don't have figures on travelling and waiting times for HK public transport (try the Bus and Train forums), but do you have figures to substantiate that just as much of the population back then could afford a car?</p>
              <p>Some common sense however would tell you what salaries and jobs many Singaporeans had in the past, and that alternative means of getting around also play a part in keeping the necessity of private car ownership low.</p>
              <p>By the way, a section (with citations from the South China Morning Post) of the Wiki article states that:</p>
              <p><em>Cars are subjected to a first-time registration tax, which varies from 35% to over 100%, based on the size and value of the car. The level of vehicle taxation was increased by a law passed on 2 June 1982 to discourage private car ownership,[3] and also as an incentive to buy smaller, more efficient cars, as these have less tax levied on them. First-time registration tax was doubled, annual licensing fees were increased by 300%, and $0.7 duty was imposed on each litre of on light oils.[4] </em></p>
              <p>I do not know at which stage and how frequently these are paid, or whether the price you quoted from the HK Honda website includes everything (I can't read the fine print).</p>
