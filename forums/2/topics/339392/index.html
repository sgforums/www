              <p>What's the point of cars being more expensive when all the specs are the same.</p>
              <p>For Example:</p>
              <p>A Honda Jazz would cost from £8,302($18,618) to £12,602($28,261) in England.</p>

              <p>An Audi A3 1.8T FSI S tronic would cost £19,445($43,607) in England but would cost $116,200 here.</p>
              <p>Again, where did the $50,000 go?</p>
              <p>Even Proton, people would think due to the reduced shipping cost would be cheaper right? WRONG.</p>
              <p>The Proton Gen-2 1.3(M) would cost £7,805($17,503) in England but would cost $37,000 in Singapore.</p>

              <p>What's the point of cars being more expensive when all the specs are the same.</p>
              <p>For Example:</p>
              <p>A Honda Jazz would cost from £8,302($18,618) to £12,602($28,261) in England.</p>
              <p>However, It'll cost between $53,800 to $65,300 at list price.</p>
              <p>Where did the extra $35,000 go?</p>
              <p>An Audi A3 1.8T FSI S tronic would cost £19,445($43,607) in England but would cost $116,200 here.</p>
              <p>Again, where did the $50,000 go?</p>
              <p>Even Proton, people would think due to the reduced shipping cost would be cheaper right? WRONG.</p>
              <p>The Proton Gen-2 1.3(M) would cost £7,805($17,503) in England but would cost $37,000 in Singapore.</p>
