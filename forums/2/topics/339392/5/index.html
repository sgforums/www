              You are simply sleeping in school where you dont understand english.  Worst you dont even know how to behave like a person.  Everyone think you a joker and from your past post you already claim you done lots of research to substantiate your point.  However, things you mentioned you had done are weak (same like you).  The only thing I pointed at you is despicable of your character to use vulgarity on others parent. So did I argue anything else then? If you knew what you are going to do is making you a moron and you still do it that make you the moron's of all moron.  Maybe you are.
              
              Worst of your low character to put words in my mouth.  Did I whine about parking expensive?? Which post of my say so?? Does saying "paying alot" means whining? So who is the moron?? Go back to school la. Did you cut short your nipple sucking years? That why you are such a big loser. Not enough nutrition to the brain.
              
              This will be my fourth post directed at you and please try for once in your lifetime and use your brain and make a quality comment and comparison.  3 out of 10 direct at you? why not comparing 3 of mine and 4 of yours direct at me? No wonder your post are always as stupid as you are. And a good suggestion to you to stop being so damn childish putting smiling face on your post with that kind of statement.  Are you really a true loser? You had proven yourself again n0x arse

              <p>Just wondering...</p>
              <p>COE is a variable component aim at limiting the number of cars in singapore.</p>
              <p>High Tax on car sale, a fix component aiming at limiting the number of cars in singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do we need two different means of car limiting policy? COE a bonuse to letting the gov earn when time are doing good and Tax is like a fix income for sg incase enconomy are bad?</p>
              <p>hmmm ERP well that is just to better control car at peak time on certain road to ensure constant car flow. So i guess i cant really say ERP is a car limiting component.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So how do the gov spend all those $$ profited in the name of creating a smooth transportation road. Public transport are getting more costly and it is clearly unable to support the current population. Or at least draw the car user to switch their cars for the BMWs (bus mrt walk). Ooh i forgot, if the public transport are that good, then sg wont have anyone to tax/coe liao..... so i guess we better keep the transport just... workable... else the whole thing fall apart...</p>

I am typing with laughter at a dumb arse clown like you. so here again you assume as you please as you are always wrong.</p>
              <p>And here again an advise from a village dumb, please refer to my previous post where I mentioned you need to learn how to be a human being. Scolding others parent will pissed anyone off may it be direct or indirect as this is what we call moral issue.</p>
              <p>Your english solid meh? Kanasai.. If you cant counter I suggest you go rest in peace..</p>
              <p>You are here long enough to bla bla bla?? dog will always be dog. Dont try to gain credit from me by explaining how old bird or whatsoever.. cos from the past few post of yours you already down grade yourself to a dumb sg arse where no one respect and will love to fly a bunch when there is a chance.</p>
              <p>Await your reply</p>

              <p>You're right. In England, a Porsche cost like SGD$5000 to buy (second-hand that is) and you get to keep or buy a lot of classic cars like  Muscles cars. I mean I haven't seen a  muscle car roaming the streets of Singapore.</p>
