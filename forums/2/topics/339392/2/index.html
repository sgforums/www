              <p>What's the point of cars being more expensive when all the specs are the same.</p>
              <p>For Example:</p>
              <p>A Honda Jazz would cost from £8,302($18,618) to £12,602($28,261) in England.</p>
              <p>However, It'll cost between $53,800 to $65,300 at list price.</p>
              <p>Where did the extra $35,000 go?</p>
              <p>An Audi A3 1.8T FSI S tronic would cost £19,445($43,607) in England but would cost $116,200 here.</p>
              <p>Again, where did the $50,000 go?</p>
              <p>Even Proton, people would think due to the reduced shipping cost would be cheaper right? WRONG.</p>
              <p>The Proton Gen-2 1.3(M) would cost £7,805($17,503) in England but would cost $37,000 in Singapore.</p>

              <p>How come those who complain about high car prices only see $$?</p>
              <p>If you want to compare, compare the other related aspects too.</p>
              <p>Road conditions, how much more well-maintained are the roads in Spore as compared to other countries.</p>
              <p>A lot less congested.</p>
              <p>Much better road safety with stricter law enforcements</p>
              <p>All these required resources and restrictions.</p>
              <p>Much Much better environment and air conditions</p>
              <p>I'm not saying what the Singapore government implements is right. Its all about give and take. You cannot have everything. If you want better living environments, then the high tax on cars is needed. If you want cheap cars, either work harder so that car prices will look cheaper to you relatively, or live with it.</p>

              <p>The logic that if price of something is too cheap, everybody will go out to get one does not really hold, else Hong Kong will be filled with more cars and the roads will be congested everywhere. The big question is.</p>
              <p>Why are cars cheaper in Hong Kong without the need for a COE and ARF (traffic congestion relatively similar) compared to Singapore?</p>
              <p>Just because something is cheap doesn't necessarily mean everybody will buy, only those who have specific needs for that particular item.</p>
              <p>Compare a system in the 70s &amp; 80s, we didn't have a COE system then, cars were cheaper then, but traffic was far less congested then, we also didn't have as many roads then.</p>

              <p>The logic that if price of something is too cheap, everybody
                  will go out to get one does not really hold, else Hong Kong will be
                  filled with more cars and the roads will be congested everywhere.
                  The big question is.</p>
              <p>Why are cars cheaper in Hong Kong without the need for a COE and
                  ARF (traffic congestion relatively similar) compared to
                  Singapore?</p>
              <p>Just because something is cheap doesn't necessarily mean
                  everybody will buy, only those who have specific needs for that
                  particular item.</p>
              <p>Compare a system in the 70s &amp; 80s, we didn't have a COE
                  system then, cars were cheaper then, but traffic was far less
                  congested then, we also didn't have as many roads then.</p>

              <p>Saying that people won't buy cars unless there's a need is one thing, but can the need satisfied by something else? I've already mentioned public transport in HK. Why would you need additional monetary disincentives when that's good enough? As long as folks here feel that public transport is inadequate, they'll get a car.</p>
              <p>Back in the pre-COE days, were there as many people who could afford cars as there are today?</p>
              <p>By the way, Hong Kong SAR has more people AND land than Singapore, while Hong Kong Island has fewer people and less land (but a comparable population density to Singapore).</p>
