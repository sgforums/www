Before my Picanto, I went there to see the Vios,it was when it is still new with Britney Spears ads. When I went there, it was Saturday and so everyone was busy. I walk around to look see look see. I was with my parents at that time and I was driving the Mitsubishi Town Bee. When I ask the sales regarding the car, the way he talks is like you feel that he look down on you. Maybe he is thinking, " aiyah, won't buy one lah, ask so much for what." Upon see this situation, I left the place without second thought. Come on man! car is a thing which you need to have lots of commitment to it and not like supermart buying vegetables. Next, I don't know if anyone went to Suzuki? Same problem there. Like bean sprouts price went up. Later, then I found out that both are from the same mother company. No wonder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is Suzuki and Toyota from links to each other? I only know that Toyota owns Hino and Daihatsu.<br><br>The blame shall not be to Toyota as they are the car manufacturer. It shall goes to Borneo Motor the distributor. It is good to complain to their manager best more GM so that they know their staff are so lousy.<br><br>Best if you know Jap guys from Toyota then let the manufacturer screw and pressure Borneo Motor for spoilting their reputation.</div>
