            <div class='col-md body'>juz a brief intro, i have abt 1year and half of driving experience wif a clean record of 24points and i drive safely.Met wif an accident abt a month back.i juz finished my test in school and was going back home by clementi road at abt 6+pm.as usual there was a jam. the road that i was in was a 3-lane road and i was in the right lane. the lane that i was in is a 2-way arrow, straight or right turn to minor road. As i was intending to go straight, and the car infront of me had already signaled his intentions to turn right, i did the logical thing to signal left to cut into the middle lane. checking into my mirror, the middle lane was empty, (i was travelling no more than 50km/hr as got minor jam) i sped up to overtake into the middle lane. juz as i was abt to cut into the middle lane, a light blue MPV,who was in the left lane, without signalling oso decided to cut into the middle lane. i was slightly infront of him so obviously i m supposed to have the right of way, but that fucker blewed his horn at me and showed no signs of giving way. sensing that if i continue to cut into the middle lane, i will bang onto his car, i quickly serve back to my right lane.i noe i should have continued cutting, but an impulse to avoid an accident made me swerve back. however the car infront was already too near for me although i jam braked. the impact was something i wont be able to 4get soon. my right bumper had bumped onto his rear bumper. haiz, as usual we both stopped and got off the car to inspect. he is driving a white, old mercedes and is apprantly a director of a department in NUS!(found that out later). upon inspecting, there wasnt any damage i could see in his bumper, but my right bumper is screwed. we exchange contacts and i apologise to him, as i know he is innocent. i can only blame the fucker driving the light blue MPV.haiz. in the end the fella called me at night to claim damage, that his bumper got scratches. paid him $400 bucks, and my dad's car total repais amounts to $600.my dad paid for me but i felt so guilty as it was the 1st time the car met wif an accident. any opinios or comments any1?..haiz</div>
