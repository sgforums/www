            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Just ordered the Subaru Forester 2.5XT, and my wife mentioned to me that never did she think that either her or me would ever own a Subaru, especially one with a scoop...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But of many cars we test drove, we found the Forester to be the car that best suited us. In the end, it was a surprisingly easy decision to make, especially since we knew that we would probably lose a lot of money when the time came to sell it (OMV seems to be really low!).<br><br>Anyway, it would be nice to know if there are any other Forester owners out there given that I don't see all that many Foresters on the road. Any tips or comments you may have regarding the car would be most appreciated!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we looked at the AirTrek Turbo-R too but it did not really suit us. For a start, the Forester felt like it had more room internally (with a more family feel), which was important for us. Also, we preferred the Forester's interior to the AirTrek's (Unless I'm mistaken, leather seats were not standard in the AirTrek). The Forester also appears to have a better level of safety equipment than the AirTrek (also important to us). But I guess, the most important thing was that I liked how the Forester handled during the test drive (especially since my wife also gave it the thumbs up). In addition, the reviews I read on the Net regarding the Forester were all rather positive. Ultimately, it probably boils down to personal preference. For the wife and I, the car felt right, and the price was just withing the budget we had set, so we decided to go for it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But if I'm not wrong, the Forester 2.5XT is apparently faster! Thing is, the UK car mags list the 2.5XT as doing 0-100km/h in 5.9/6 seconds (manual box I think), while the local mags list it as doing it (auto box in Singapore) in 7.6 seconds (still faster than the AirTrek's 8 seconds). Any idea why the difference is so great? Did they de-tune the Singapore version or something? Even if the UK specs are for the manual version, surely there should not be such a big difference for the auto box version in Singapore?</div>

A car typically gains 1 second off its 0-100 timing by having a manual box instead of an auto box. I think it is more likely to have 7s on the manual box. Top Gear does list it as 5.7s, but I think thats not quite possible.<br><br>Anyways if we compare the stats, the Forester has 227bhp and 320Nm as opposed to Airtrek Turbo R's 240bhp and 343Nm. Taking into account ATR being about 50kg heavier, I'd expect the 0-100 timings to be similiar.<br><br>Besides, if we look at other cars like the 350Z, which has a 0-100 timing of 5.7s(CAR) or 5.9s(Top Gear) depending on which mag u believe. Weight is 35kg more than the Forester. Power is 276, which is almost 50bhp more. 363Nm, which is 43Nm more. And a much lower drag coefficient compared to the boxy Forester. It seems quite incredible that the Forester can do a 5.7s 0-100 with much less bhp, torque, and only a small weight advantage. I expect that a 0-100 of 7s sounds much more logical. I mean, afterall, u can't defy the laws of physics can u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course, im wondering if Subaru perhaps didn't "accidently" underquote their bhp n torque figures. Turbocharged, higher displacement than the Mitsu, and if that 0-100 time of 5.7s is true, then I really don't believe it has less bhp and torque than the Mitsu. Nothing ups your torque like larger displacement does, and the forester has 2.5l as opposed to the mitsu's 2.0l</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My wife and I did think about the Murano and had a look at it when we went to test drive the Cefiro. We had high hopes for the Murano but when we saw it, it was a BIG letdown. It's about $20k more than the Cefiro and I didn't think it looked like a car that was worth $20k more. Maybe $10k more... The only decent thing about it was the Bose system. The build quality was average at best and what were they thinking about that cheap looking plastic grille? I mean, really, surely if you're going to have that grille as one of the car's key distinguishing features, you would use better quality materials. For the price, I would have picked a Toyota Harrier anyday. But that's just my personal opinion...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> If Borneo had brought the Harrier in, I would probably have bought it without a second thought.<br><br>As for the Forester, I went to MotorImage thinking that it would look quite ugly but the 2.5XT model actually didn't look too bad, especially in black (think it looks a bit better than the older 2.0XT model). Ultimately, what convinced us to buy it was this: (1) the engine (though it would drink plenty of premium petrol really quick with my heavy right foot); (2) the steering (which was stiffer than most Japanese cars but slightly lighter than continental cars I have driven. Both my wife and I also drive continental cars so we're both more accustomed to stiffer steering), and (3) my wife was comfortable with the size of the car and it had enough room in the back to meet our needs. (4) The price was within our budget (obviously very important).</div>

Sometimes u have to wonder "WHAT were they thinking?"<br><br>Apparently even the 350Z suffers from this affliction.</div>
