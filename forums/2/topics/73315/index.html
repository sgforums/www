You can read the rules in the basic theory hand book for Class 3 license, there is a section for the rules cyclist should obey, if you want further clarification. </span><br><br>1) Its a must to cycle with the flow of traffice, going against the flow of traffic is illegal and dangers IE what if a motorcycle did that?<br><br>2) Cyclists have to obey the traffic lights, ie stop at a red.<br><br>3) Cyclists have to give way to pedestrians on a zebra crossing as well as on a pavement.<br><br>4) Cyclists are NOT allowed to cycle on high ramps/ flyovers or under pass. The reason being, they will go TOO slow and have difficulty. This is illegal but I see cyclists who do so.<br><br>5) Cyclists cannot cycle on HIGHWAYS like PIE, reason being, they're too slow and can obstruct traffic. IE the same ruling such for cars/motorcycles the slowest speed you can drive on a expressway is 40km/h, any slower you should have your hazard light on.<br><br>6) Cyclists must wear bright colours and a MUST to have a bike light at night. I have encountered an Indian man cycling without his shirt on, you can understand that i cannnot even see him cycling on the road at all, no street lights even!<br><br>7) Cyclists should flag or show their intention for turning right or left or coming to a stop, WHICH VERY FEW DO, ie basic hand signals applies to cars/motorcycles when your signal does'nt work, you learn this is from your basic theory handbook or from military hand signals, its the same.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Cyclists CANNOT cycle on the fast/ overtaking lanes, they can however cycle on a middle lane if its a 3 lane road, reason being they might want to turn right at the junction.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Please take note of these rulings to all cyclists. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>come on lor... i've seen these sort of motorized bikes so often. and i don't think their speed in only 25km/h. fast fast chiong... take up one whole lane summore. not that i sayiong they cant use the roads... but as a cyclist myself i know how to keep to extreme left when cycling, and signal when i turn. the thing is somethings u wanna turn left. den suddenly a bike like that zoom past your left, can you imagine if i didn't slow down i would hit a bugger like that? or maybe he'll just bang into me... how ironic...</div>
