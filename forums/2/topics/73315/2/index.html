I said "FEEL LIKE" doing those bad things, but did I ever did it?? Open ur eyes, dig them out if u have to, to help u see better grandma, grand mama bear in this case.<br><br>And I was wondering, do u drive/ride before or have a class 3 or 2 or 2a or 2b in the first place. If u really HAVE a driving/riding license, I'm surprised tat u r actually encouraging pple to cycle on the roads by saying "cyclists have their rights on the roads too", and blind enough to see the dangers those cyclists are exposing themselves to, speeding motorcycles, cars, lorries, tonners.<br><br>If u dun have a license, do take up a practical driving/riding course and see wat I mean. I can't explain the experience in words, u have to experience it urself.<br><br>If u took offence to tat "grand mama bear(referring to The Bear) got bad eyesight thingy", I'm sorry.<br><br>As for the "taken off the road" thingy, please re-consider the situation before saying tat. Thank you.<br><br>Wanna drive, take it to the roads,<br>Wanna ride, take it to the roads,<br>Wanna cycle, take to it the pathments.</div>

Read back to previous post.<br><br>I'm surprised u said tat "all it takes is half a second....half a second...and a cyclist is a smear..remember that.." I dun have to remember tat, I KNOW tat. And I'm sure most drivers/riders and this humble country knows tat. I think the only one who needs to remember is you, bear. Seems tat u down 1 of them for the count, so how it feels like to have them under ur wheel, still remember??<br><br>in another quote "i have driven in other countries where there are even more cyclists and never ever had problems there either..." No problems eh?? Bcos u r driving alongside with them tatz y no problem. Or becos u dun even care for their well-being on cycling on the roads and bcos there r sooo many of them, u doesn't mind/have no problem at all running 1 down for the count??<br><br>and another quote "i would say that most of the problems here faced by drivers are due to their own impatience and inability to be tolerant of other road users..." Oh u never loose ur cool.... wonderful!! Prehaps tatz y u dun understand why everyone have the right to be impatient and intolerant is one thing and taking it out in action is another.<br><br>got a question: "do you think a motorcyclist should ride in the lane or in between lanes?"<br>Wat do u think?? U got ur license in "1989", dun u know the simple answer to it?? Motorcyclist r pple who ride motorcycle, of cos they take the lane. As for "in between lanes", I dunno how u get ur license or wat ur driving instructor taught u, one is not suppose to do tat. I was beginning to wonder, since such a simple question and need a p-plater to answer, did u ever study for ur thoery, and do u apply basic rules on the road?? Or did u break them all the time thinking, "oh, my instructor taught me tat, so it must be right". If so, time for u to take a refreshment course @ any driving center before posting any danger to other drivers/riders/cyclists/predestrian/or any other road users.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i drive and i cycle too.<br><br>reckless drivers pose a greater danger to anyone more than a slow-moving bicycle. if a careful driver gives way or slows down to a traveling bicycle, or he filters to another lane in time, there's not problem for both parties. it only takes a little bit of consideration for each other to make the road a safer place.<br><br>most cyclists do their part by keeping to the side of the road. those that travel in the middle of the lane or cycle against the flow oof traffic are but a few. they actually pose a greater danger to pedestrians if they were to go on the pavement. a fast-moving bicycle crashing into a pedestrian can cause serious injuries.. it's even worse if the pedestrian is elderly or pregnant..<br><br>those with license learnt this in driving schools.. even if you have the right of way, you still do not assume that others will give way to you.. so drive safely, drive carefully..</div>
