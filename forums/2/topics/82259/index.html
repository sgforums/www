            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, not trying to discourage you from getting one, but you have to do some research before deciding.  Here are some things you might like to know:<br><br>More horsepower is going to put more stress/strain on the engine any way you look at it.<br><br>The nitrous itself only changes the operating parameter of the engine.  Those conditions, if not accounted for, will cause problems-potentially disastrous ones.<br><br>With all the oxygen introduced (N2O contains 33% oxygen versus 21% in normal air) you will be running incredibly lean instantly without compensating with the correct amount of fuel.  Aluminum, forged or otherwise, does not like to see this for very long.<br><br>The advantage of using nitrous is two fold. 1) It introduces more oxygen into the incoming charge in a form that initially does not occupy too much space. 2) Upon vaporization it lowers the temperature of the air causing a denser charge entering the cylinder.<br><br>To take advantage of nitrous you must have a few other elements in "the system". In order to help vaporization, just as in vaporizing gasoline, the nitrous must be in as small a liquid droplet as possible. This is done with the nozzle or "fogger". The atomization of nitrous into smaller droplets increases the surface area to achieve better evaporation. Heat is absorbed in the vaporization process lowering the surrounding air resulting in a denser charge (packing more air (oxygen) into the cylinder than at the higher temperature). The denser charge and introduction of additional oxygen into the charge allows for the oxidation or burning of fuel. This is the catch.<br><br>Additional fuel must be supplied to prevent going dangerously lean. The whole combination of additional oxygen, denser charge, and denser fuel results in much more<br>force being exerted on the piston per power stroke (torque &amp; horsepower).<br><br>Before you do anything to your car, make sure your engine is in good condition. Second, find out as much as possible about NOS, then buy the kit that suits your needs. And if you are not comfortable installing the kit yourself,don't risk it, have a shop put it in. Also DO NOT run more than 100hp on the stock fuel pump, it is already maxed out!<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
