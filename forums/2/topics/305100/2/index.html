            <div class='col-md body'>to be honest, since your dad can afford a new ride such as evo x and gtr, the best solution is to buy a new coupe as a second car instead of keeping moaning over your cefiro.<br><br>after all, i am sure whichever new ride he may choose, he will definitely find the thrill fade after a while.<br><br>it's human nature to feel less excited when one gets used to something new.<br><br>btw, if your dad does decide to choose gtr, do invite some of us for viewing as many of us are dying to sit in the car!<br><br>good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you want it to be a family car, remove evo x and subaru wrx sti from that list. sure they are fast, but they are super uncomfortable to sit in. they are cars for street racing, not for your family (including your children) to take a joyride in. i once sat in my friend's evo and i come out got headache already. your baby after one trip probably will start crying <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>get a mercedes c280 or smth like that, its fast and comfortable</div>

If he does not need space. GT-R would be the best of the lot. Big cars and good handling doesn't often come together. A GT-R has 2 doors. How would your dad fit the whole family of 5 through 2 doors? It's possible yes. But I'm sure you guys would not like squeezing into a confined space for a road trip to M'sia. I would rather take a coach there instead!<br><br>If he needs a good compromise between power+sporty handling and space. EVO X would be better. You could also consider the Subaru Legacy. It's more spacious than the Evo but a little down on power. Nonetheless, the Legacy is a powerful car.<br><br>But if he needs to fit all 5 of you in <span style="color: red;">comfortably</span>. I'd suggest he get a MPV or a large sedan. Choices you could consider -<br><br>MPV: Honda Oddesy, Toyota Estima/ Previa, Toyota Alphard (it's huge).<br><br>But it seems that your dad having a war against MPVs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> So, here's a list of Large Sedan cars (which aren't MPVs) and have a reasonable power to weight ratio.<br><br>Large Sedan with reasonably powerful engines: Honda Accord, Lexus GS300, Toyota Camry,  BMW 5 series, Mercedes E class, Audi A6. There could be more that i haven't thought of. As you can see, there ain't many Japanese cars to choose from. Europeans generally produce more large cars. I personaly like the Lexus GS300. Spacious yet sporty.<br><br>Get a sports coupe if he needs a 2nd car. Maybe GT-R for Japs and M5/6 for the Europeans. C63 AMG would be very nice!<br><br>I hope this list helps as it's really hard to understand what your father wants in a car.<br><br>Take note: <span style="color: red;">A fast, nimble handling car does not come with much space</span>. Make a compromise between space or speed/ power.<br><br>Now, choose: Speed or Space?</div>

HONDA STREAM RSZ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> your father lik to rev right? tat RSZ can take it. buy the 2litre 1, equipped wif 17-inch aluminum wheels and a custom-tuned suspension to improved passenger comfort as well as a lower center of gravity for superior handling. somemore sure SAFE, because its  included the most advanced Honda safety technologies, including IHCC2 (Intelligent Highway Cruise Control), which control vehicle speed and distance to the car ahead to reduce the burden on the driver, and CMBS2 (Collision Mitigation Brake System) + E-pretensioners2, which uses millimeter wave radar technology to detect the possibility of a collision and then help avoid or reduce the force of the collision.  plus the increased energy efficiency of the i-VTEC variable valve timing control system is further enhanced by a 3-stage variable-length intake manifold on the newly developed 2.0-liter engine to deliver torquey performance at all engine speeds cum intelligent powertrains deliver strong acceleration and near-perfect linear response. and the plus point is it achieve excellent fuel economy of 14.8km/l.  somemore 	the RSZ comes equipped with a paddle shifter with intelligent control which mean u can shift lik a mannual.  Wats more is the RSZ  with CVT also comes with a 7-speed manual-shift mode to make the most of the CVTÂ’s remarkable shifting freedom. and is sure to b cheaper than ur tat GTR.  even your dad hate mpv, i don find anything to hate this RSZ. do some research pls then choose it wisely. rsz is a SPORTS FAMILY CAR. you wan sPORTS you wan SPACE and you wan POWER plus HANDLING, THERE IT IS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Your father will probably be more realistic and realise that a 2 door coupe will not fit the family comfortably, especially so on long trips on the NS highway, and all that power will be for fish when he realises that a GS300 can keep up with him on the highway at 140 as well. The only difference is the time taken to reach from 0 to 140. Your ATTESA-ETS will probably be for moot, the NS Highway is not a circuit and your father will not take chances when he has your baby sis in the back seat.<br><br>But if he's gonna sell off his cefiro just to get the GT-R, GG. Maybe if he got rid of TS the family might fit into the R.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
