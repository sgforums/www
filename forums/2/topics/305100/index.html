            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand your post. If I'm not wrong, Nissan R35 is the GT-R? So, why would ur dad need a Coupe with so little space for 5 people. And i doubt it has 5 seats also. And the GTR sucks much more petrol than a regular MPV.<br><br>So if the R35 you are refering about is the Nissan GT-R, I don't see the reason for asking about it in the first place as it totally does not fit your dad's requirements.<br><br>The GT-R has alot less space than a cefiro. I don't see how a cefiro can be compared with a GT-R in terms of space. They are worlds apart. I suggest that your father get a MPV. He's so wrong about bad fuel consumption for MPVs. A Honda stream has good FC. GT-R is a sports car and history shows that sport cars generally do no have good fuel concumption.<br><br>My suggestion, get a MPV. But if your dad insist of not getting one. Then buy the new limo on the roads recently - The strecthed Chrysler 300c. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Or best, stay with the current cefiro. It can fit your mum and dad at the front. The rest behind.</div>

But replacing a Cefiro for GT-R due to shortage of space is very, very strange. A GT-R is definately much smaller than a Cefiro.</div>

MPVs suck a lot of petrol, so GT-R don't? I'm sure the GT-R will have much worse consumption than MPVs such as Wish, Stream, etc.<br><br>You want a fast car that can hold 5+ people? Get the Estima or Odyssey, if you don't want the smaller MPVs.<br><br>And fyi all the MPVs mentioned are JAPANESE, which incidentally, is what you father preferred.</div>

Does he want to replace his Cefiro based on which of the following reasons: <span style="color: red;">Space?</span> <span style="color: blue;">Fuel Economy?</span> <span style="color: green;">His Ego for sports cars?</span> <span style="color: indigo;">A sports family car?</span> or a spacious Sedan like the cefiro.<br><br>Honda Accord is not very sporty. I think space wise it's about the same as cefiro. Whereas for the engine, Honda is definitely better.<br><br><blockquote>The car is actually meant as a family car, so he wants the familly's take on the list of candidates.<br><br>1)Subaru Legacy<br>2)Subaru Wrx Sti<br>3)Mitsubishi Evo X<br>4)Lexus IS250<br>5)Honda Accord<br>6)Nissan FairladyZ<br></blockquote>This list does not match. Lexus IS250 and Honda Accord looks out of place here as they are full fledge large/ medium sized sedan and the rest are Sports Sedans/ Coupes. Since it's meant as a family car, The Nissan 350Z shoud be out. There's no way you're going to fit 5 people in there and stay happy.<br><br>A full fledge large/ medium sedan has proper space, good FC if you aren't heavy footed, it's Japanese (as stated from the list), has enough space for 5, comfortable ambience with comfort orientatied cabin (Electronic climate control, Cruise Control, Leather seats... just to name a few) But don't expect nimble handling or tyre spinning torque/ power.<br><br>On the contary,  Sports Sedans/ Coupes are not good on FC, it's mostly small and uncomfortable. And i don't think you can fit a family of 5 in there comfortably.<br><br>I have explained the confusion about the types of cars you and your dad have came out with. I hope you guys can refine your choices and be sure of what you need or want. The current requirements is simply contradictory.</div>

They simply don't have your specified requirements especially family size and fuel economy. But since you insisted on these cars that aren't suitable for your needs, Here's my verdict -<br><br>My choice would be: Evo X. It has the best space amongst the 3 cars. It's the cheapest i guess. It's pratical as the platform is borrowed from the normal Lancer EX.<br><br>PS: Really, given your requirements, get a bigger car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Cefiro is far bigger than any Lancers. And more importantly, it meets all the requirements except the last 1.<br><br>But i don't think price would be the issue here as they want to get cars that are easily above 150k.</div>
