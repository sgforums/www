              <p>if you wanna purchase 2nd hand cars, it's best to have 'lobang'. It's def cheaper than a first hand but you cannlt always trust what the dealer tells you about the condition of the car. If you have lobang, at least you can be assured that your source will take care of things properly for you.</p>
              <p>You don't have to pay COE cos it has been included in the car price. </p>
              <p>Hope this helps you! :)</p>

              <p>It's seems like you're planning to buy your 1st car. Not to lecture you but to let you aware of the commitments to consider.</p>
              <p>Buying a car is like buying a house. There are alot of financial commitments to consider. Such as the installment, the annual insurance premium, the 6 monthly road tax, radio license &amp; the parking charges.Another issue is the ERP. Depends on where you drive for your daily journey. If you're a 1st time car owner, the insurance premium is also high because of the illogically high number of claim cases on our local roads.</p>
              <p>Not to forget your petrol &amp; your servicing. You will also have to consider the fuel consumption of the car as well as technical reliability of the make &amp; model. Certain makes &amp; models are not suitable for tropical country use &amp; the reliability becomes an issue when you visit the workshop oftenly.</p>
              <p>Another major issue is the hire purchase loan. Many inexperienced drivers were tempted by the low upfront cash &amp; ended up commiting to a hire purchase agreement which they could'nt back out when they realise there are many other expenses that they did not factor in when they did their sums.</p>
              <p>I suggest that you visit SG Carmart.com &amp; see for yourself the make &amp; model which you prefer be it new or used car. I will advise you that as a rule of the thumb your monthly hire purchase installment should'nt be more than 35% of your net (not gross) income &amp; together with your monthly expenses spent on your ride should'nt be more than 50% of your net income. Preferably, you save up 1st &amp; downpay at least 10%-15% of the selling price excluding the 1st insurance &amp; the 1st road tax.</p>
              <p>If not you will be shocked to find out that you have only cleared the interest &amp; you still have'nt start to clear the principle even if you have been servicing the hire purchase loan for years. You will have to top up cash if you have to sell your car. You will be at the mercy of the financing firm if you land yourself in such a situation.</p>
              <p>I will be glad to advise you if you have other queries. Feel free to PM me.</p>

I was a inexperienced driver kena burned by car loan until jia lat jia lat years ago. Just like you, did not know much, trusted the sweet talks of the dealers.</p>
              <p>Dealers don't bother whether you are financially sound to own a car. They only bother about whether the bank or the financing firm approve your loan application. Some dealers even have the capital to finance you. Worse to worse case if you have problems servicing the loan, you will expect a lawyer's letter because base on the bankruptcy act, you are liable to be sued for bankruptcy if your outstanding debt is 10K &amp; above. Even if it's less than 10K, they can hire debt collectors &amp; you will not want a debt collector appearing in your office in front of your colleagues &amp; bosses.</p>
              <p>Let's say your salary is 1.5K a month. After deducting CPF it will be left about 1.2 - 1.3K. Because hire purchase loan is a high interest, high risk, compound interest loan, I believe most banks will require at least a 1.7k gross monthly income to assess such a loan. Even if 1.7K gross, you must have not any financial commitment such as properties &amp; your credit history must be clean.</p>
              <p>Even if the loan is approved, you must take note that the installment should'nt be above 35% of your nett monthly income if not you will be on a highway to financial stress. I will advise you maybe you can try car rental or car co-op plans after your P-plate probation is over. At least the financial commitment is not there &amp; you will have the luxury to try out different models before you commit to car ownership in the later stages of your life.</p>
