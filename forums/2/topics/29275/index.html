Whats tt??? I think u mean continental rite? I believe u drive a car too rite? Do u spend any money on maintance(other than fuel ofcouse!) on yur car??? For of me n most y friends, we dun spend a penny(Cars includes Japs n Germans)other than the servicing every 10000kms which is inevitable. So all this bullshit abt maintance being sky high for EU cars r unfounded unless u r getting a 10+yr old car. The 207 being a relatively new car , i believe it will do fine just by going through its regular servicing.</div>

I dun think so rite. Cos it takes nearly 150000kms under normal driving condition to completely wear off 1. But then again, the checking of these wear n tear will b included in ur regular servicing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>raider, i disagree with you on the lifespan of the mechanical components... go check the car manual and it will state the estimated lifespan of the various parts. things like timing belts, fan belts, brakes (if you can go for more than 40,000 km without changing pads, you super lucky.. never kenah traffic jam of stoplights) Also, on the whole, a lot of consumables tend to be more expensive when you do a service... if you own an EU car, original parts tend to be more expensive. i.e. oil / air filters etc.. thats not to say that all jap / korean cars are cheap either... depends on which model..</div>

Well i do. What i'm trying to establish is a EU car do not have a much higher rate of wear n tear than tt of a Jap car.<br><br>Btw how much more expensive would an oil/air filter,brake pads,engine oil,spark plugs,wiper fluid,radiator fluid,etc of a EU car cost more than tt of a Jap car??? From my experiences, alot of these r competible wif both, thus costing the same...Anyway like what u have mentioned parts prices r dependent on e brand n model of the car. So u do not expect e Lexus spare-part to cost like a Mitsubitshi's. Similarily u do not expect a Merc gearbox to cost like tt of a VW...Infact C&amp;C charges quite resonable fees for e servicing of a Merc. Its only cost $60 more to service a E-class than a Galent (which is also done by them).<br><br></div>
