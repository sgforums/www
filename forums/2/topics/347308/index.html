              i registered under private to take my btt at bbdc. i intended to take my ftt under private as well, since its cheaper and i can study on my own. but i want to take practicals as a school student, since i heard taking practicals at a school is safer, more reliable and students have priority over those taking private. 
              
              i want to take practicals and ftt concurrently but its not possible right? since my status would be private for ftt and school for practicals. or is it possible? also i heard that even if i convert to a school student after my btt and ftt, i have to take my theory lessons in school even if i have already passed my ftt and btt. is that true? but wouldnt it be a waste of time and money? what about people who decide to switch to enrolment in school instead of private? do they have to take the theory lessons as well? i chose to take btt and ftt under private because the fees for the theory lessons are so much higher than if i just take the test by studying on my own
              
              what would you advise me to do?

              i mean school package has final theory lessons and then the test. but i dont want the lessons, just wanna study on my own and take the test, so must do under private. but if i wanna do pracatical under school, i must be a student. so if i do ftt and practical concurrently, it means im dual status, ftt-private, practical-school. is that possible??? 
              
              then if i convert to school. even though i took btt and ftt under private, i still have to go for the theory lessons just because i am a student. is that true? so its theory lessons, even after i passed the test. is it like that?? im quite confused..
