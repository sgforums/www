Initially the thread was mainly for the looks which in my opinion is great and should be made a dream car. Anyways, since there's lexus is200 is300 series and the toyota altezza or the rs200, etc all LOOKS the same so it means all will be classified under lexus/toyota altezza for that purpose not to confuse kids trying to buy their dream cars (they go for looks first then only performance mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> . When we've decided to buy then maybe we will choose which spec to buy but that's a different story cos they'll do research on which spec to buy according to their need for speed!! And whoever above wanted to compare E90, then compare with the new IS250 or IS350 that just came out this year I think k  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> But of course it's all about $$$$. If ppl like me only can afford IS300 budget then this car is for u/<br><br>Note : Anyone out there who felt left out because they were in the IS category and felt that they want to be in the Altezza category as some insist so fiercely that they are different, dun despair.

From history Lexus/toyota altezza and BMX..errr BMW are sworn enemies. I tell u this car is Greatt if u decided u dun want to follow the beemer path. This car got good reputation in racing, drifting and prestige. So wat if it's toyota. Damn good company might be number 1 car producing company and by rite u SHOULD pay premium price for their cars cos so efficient, good engine, parts are easy to get and u always got TRD (Toyota racing development) to watch your back if u're into modding or Maxxing power.
