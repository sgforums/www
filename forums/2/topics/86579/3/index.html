U were either blind or u simply choose to stubbornly IGNORE it. Like ignoring it makes it go away? oh pleaseeeeeee. Don't even talk about respect.

If u think i think the Airtrek is very fast, well, re-enforces my point that u can't see.<br><br>for your dear info, i shall repost an earlier post:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">if u were to ignore the price factor, and talk about driving ommph and top speed... i could easily start talking about the 4 door Nissan Skyline GTS. Not quite a fair fight right? Why? because we are ignoring the price factor comparing the Skyline GTS to the Legacy 2.0GT. But hey, thats your exact sin too, comparing the ATR and the Legacy2.0GT. Price factor makes a big deal man. If u wanna factor out the price factor, I can start listing u family cars from hell. And the list is long. Long with many monsters which could easily eat the ATR, Legacy2.0GT AND the Skyline GTS for breakfast. Want a peep? Maserati Quattroporte. Want more? Merc E55 AMG. How 'bout another? Audi RS6. More? BMW M5. Oh hey remember the Porsche Cayenne Turbo?<br><br>If its simply motoring purity u wanna discuss, i might as well be talking about Lambos n Zondas... ATRs and Legacy 2.0GTs are not even close.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>u want very fast? well it ain't the ATR, it ain't the Legacy either. Its the Zonda. or at least an EVO8</div>
