If you really want to compare, compare the Airtrek with the Forester. Both are SUVs and AWD, and turbo. It will be a much better comparison than using the Legacy which is primarily a sedan. Airtek Turbo is quite a good buy. But the Legacy is special in it's own way as well. Some people just like how the manufacturers design and plan for the car. The legacy is pretty much good in every aspect, exterior, interior, performance, safety. It is a one stop shop which pretty much explains its premium price which many are willing to pay.<br><br>Heng@... , what are you trying to prove by saying Motorimage specs are false. Please for heaven's sake, the model of cars may be same, but the specs are different for different countries. Looks like you didn't do enough market research. Sometimes, it's really useless checking global websites, because the information may not apply here. Especially for Singapore, where Road Taxes and COEs and Import Taxes play a huge part in its final price. The distributors do not want to market a car which will not be viable to sell. That's why most cars are of larger capacity overseas. For example, 2 litre Ford Focus compared to 1.6 in Singapore, 2 litre Nissan Pulsar/Sunny. 2.5 or 3 litre Legacy/Liberty, etc. </div></blockquote>fiak lah...forester no match for ATR...nonsense...totally tried that before...forester turbo is good but not as powerful at ATR...</div>

Are u going to buy it?<br><br>Good for you if u own a high performance car and rub shoulders with like minded enthusiasts. But that does not give you the right to slam the lid on every comment u disagree with......and in an acidic manner too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> If the comment is wrong....simply input the correct info...no need for degradatory comments. Ppl are intelligent and can tell fact from B.S.<br><br>Think u should learn how to provide constructive comments and arguements from the ppl over at SAABSTANCE @ www.swedesport.com. Try your antics there....or better yet if you dare 'flaunt your expertise there'. Or boast about your supercar there....mind u if u do so u better be able to live up to your 'loud entries' cause they will take u to it @ SEPANG.....a place u appear to be very familiar with. For all I know u have an EVO8MR but......against some of the AEROS pumping out more than 300bhp with over 450NM of torque.......<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>U probably retort by saying your 500 hp *whatever* will run circles round the swedish bricks....then so what? The swedish brick is just our daily commute. Ppl do have real thoroughbreds @ home....and if u race them....they can't be bothered with u.....why risk something costing more than 2 HDB flats for an ego game? U can call us chicken or bullies but we want to live longer to spend our $$$.<br><br>So be more humble and don't think ur so great. If u got racing credentials great, but I don't see M.Schumacher or the late Possum Bourne talk in such a manner.</div>
