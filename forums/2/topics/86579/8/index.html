            <div class='col-md body'>July 8 , 2004<br><br>Saab and FHI Continue Partnership with New Cross-Over Vehicle Alliance<br><br>Norcross, GA Â– Saab Automobile AB and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (FHI), the Japanese auto manufacturer of Subaru vehicles, have agreed on collaboration for a new cross-over vehicle.<br><br>The project represents an expansion of the cooperation between Saab and FHI that was initiated last year with Saab vehicle sales through select Subaru dealer outlets in Japan, and was followed this year with the introduction of the Saab 9-2X premium sports compact in the U.S. and Canadian markets.<br><br>Â“We continue to see a working relationship between FHI and Saab as a very natural fit,Â” says Bob Lutz, GM's vice chairman for product development. Â“It makes sense for FHI and Saab to work together early in the development process to deliver their own distinct interpretations of a sporty and versatile Â‘cross-overÂ’ product.Â”<br><br>The new collaboration between Saab and FHI will integrate the development of a new Saab cross-over vehicle with FHIÂ’s cross-over project for Subaru. Both vehicles will be produced at FHIÂ’s U.S. manufacturing facility.<br><br>Â“We are pleased that our alliance with GM enables us to continue to work together with Saab,Â” said Kyoji Takenaka, president and CEO of FHI. Â“This collaboration provides many benefits such as economies of scale, higher joint volume for FHIÂ’s U.S. manufacturing facility, etc. and most importantly, creates a win-win situation for both FHI and Saab.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.saabusa.com/main/US/en/pressreleases.xml?id=1&amp;imageID=euroncap_press.jpg&amp;type=recent" rel="nofollow">http://www.saabusa.com/main/US/en/pressreleases.xml?id=1&amp;imageID=euroncap_press.jpg&amp;type=recent</a><br></div>

Having owned a 9000 aero and now a 9-5, it is the first time anyone has said that to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Strange that I do not know what I bought....considering what I do for a living....nevermind....it is quite outrageous though but then again this is a forum and sometimes for a guy crabby b'cos of not getting laid , it is an avenue for venting fustration.<br><br>As for ridiculing myself....perhaps u would like to say which other models are based on Subaru? Any interesting revelations? Reason I don't go into technical details because u can get it from SAAB websites &amp; forums.....waste of my time to re-iterate whatever's been said and known..... at least to SAAB enthusiasts.<br><br>To set the records straight, neither the 9-5 or 9-3 (chassis based on OPEL platforms) uses [b]anything</strong> from Subaru. The new 9-5 will be something radical (first SAAB with rear wheel drive!) from GM but not based on a Subb platform currently....arguements?  See for yourself at Saabstance forum.<br><br>Of course anything can happen and frankly, the 92-X Aero is a masterpiece giving the best of both worlds from Subaru WRX and SAAB.....it is indeed a great thing.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>yes. its the 9-2, not the 9-5 or other models. arbath is mistaken in saying the 9-5 uses subaru engines.</div>
