Oh, u know why after 200km/h the ATR dropped behind? Speedo reads up to 180km/h only. If its talking about initial accel, its definately a fight for the 2.0GT. mind u, im not trying to put the Legacy down here, but im raising reasonable alternatives to the Legacy2.0GT, considering factors including:<br><br>1) The fact that u don't get to go up to even 200, much less 240, everyday in singapore.<br>2) Most little impromptu jaunts at the lights often last as long till the next set of lights, if not the following set. Under such circumstances, the 2 cars mentioned are more than even.<br>3) Ommph for $, the ATR is def right there alongside the Legacy. Off the lights its a pretty even fight, and the ATR IS 20k cheaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if u were to ignore the price factor, and talk about driving ommph and top speed... i could easily start talking about the 4 door Nissan Skyline GTS. Not quite a fair fight right? Why? because we are ignoring the price factor comparing the Skyline GTS to the Legacy 2.0GT. But hey, thats your exact sin too, comparing the ATR and the Legacy2.0GT. Price factor makes a big deal man. If u wanna factor out the price factor, I can start listing u family cars from hell. And the list is long. Long with many monsters which could easily eat the ATR, Legacy2.0GT AND the Skyline GTS for breakfast. Want a peep? Maserati Quattroporte. Want more? Merc E55 AMG. How 'bout another? Audi RS6. More? BMW M5. Oh hey remember the Porsche Cayenne Turbo?<br><br>If its simply motoring purity u wanna discuss, i might as well be talking about Lambos n Zondas...

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes it's true that the Airtrek Turbo is not exactly on par with Legacy GT.<br>However, i think it's not appropriate to compare these two cars. If you really want to compare, compare the Airtrek with the Forester. Both are SUVs and AWD, and turbo. It will be a much better comparison than using the Legacy which is primarily a sedan. Airtek Turbo is quite a good buy. But the Legacy is special in it's own way as well. Some people just like how the manufacturers design and plan for the car. The legacy is pretty much good in every aspect, exterior, interior, performance, safety. It is a one stop shop which pretty much explains its premium price which many are willing to pay.<br><br>Heng@... , what are you trying to prove by saying Motorimage specs are false. Please for heaven's sake, the model of cars may be same, but the specs are different for different countries. Looks like you didn't do enough market research. Sometimes, it's really useless checking global websites, because the information may not apply here. Especially for Singapore, where Road Taxes and COEs and Import Taxes play a huge part in its final price. The distributors do not want to market a car which will not be viable to sell. That's why most cars are of larger capacity overseas. For example, 2 litre Ford Focus compared to 1.6 in Singapore, 2 litre Nissan Pulsar/Sunny. 2.5 or 3 litre Legacy/Liberty, etc.</div>

Please for heaven's sake, the model of cars may be same, but the specs are different for different countries. Looks like you didn't do enough market research. Sometimes, it's really useless checking global websites, because the information may not apply here. Especially for Singapore, where Road Taxes and COEs and Import Taxes play a huge part in its final price. The distributors do not want to market a car which will not be viable to sell. That's why most cars are of larger capacity overseas. For example, 2 litre Ford Focus compared to 1.6 in Singapore, 2 litre Nissan Pulsar/Sunny. 2.5 or 3 litre Legacy/Liberty, etc. </div></blockquote>ppl, u ALL HAVE to read carefully. At NO point did I ever say Motorimage's specs are false. I merely pointed out that 1stly, The stats from Motorimage do no coincide with the ones from Subaru, 2ndly, when PhamtomGT said that the specs were wrong, i replied by saying i don't think Subaru would put the wrong specs onto their own webby and 3rdly, that Motorimage is just the importers of the car and not the manufacturers. I don't see any discrepencies about the 3 facts i pointed out. But, I say again, at NO time did i ever claim their specs were false. Do read carefully. Thanks</div>

Actually, I could not ask for nothing much more. 245hp is 'quite' restricted, it would easily do 300hp. Somemore pampered with auto-trans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  It looks very sleek in my opinion with only a subtle scoop hinting of its performance potential.<br><br>Seriously regret getting my 95 instead of the GT, about the same price afterall. Of course 95 also very much a sleeper car with a little tuning, good for 220hp and a searing 320NM of torque.  I am a sleeper car fan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Airtrek turbo? Fast SUV but I think it will lose out by a considerable margin to the Legacy 2.0 GT turbo. Specs are not everything, best proof is when both cars floor it and hold till terminal velocity. Actually, I was challenged by an Airtrek turbo at the NS highway en-route to Penang, it was a neck to neck but once past 200km/hr the airtrek dropped behind, when I maxed at 240km/hr the airtrek was totally lost from sight. As far as top-end goes, I think the 95<br>has an advantage as it is front wheel drive as opposed to the increased drag of a 4wd system, this is why 240km/hr is achievable with only 220 hp. Think that is the reason why SAAB standard speedos goes up to 260 km/hr. Car has long legs and when given chance to unwind can go seriously fast.<br><br>This is why I am convinced that Airtrek turbo is not on par with Legacy GT in terms of performance. Look at it this way my 95 is behind the Legacy GT (stock) by about 25 hp and weights 150 kgm more. Even so, the Airtrek turbo is nowhere as fast flat out (we are not talking 0-100 km/hr times here) as my car. So a mildy uptuned Legacy GT would have an airtrek turbo for lunch at every gear. Actually, I think even the stock GT will be significantly faster too.<br>Of course an Airtrek Turbo can also be modded and be seriously quick but in the first place if serious speed is what u are after, a lower slung car is a more appropriate choice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>maybe that airtrek has a few dead bodies in it... that might explain the slowness.... lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tristan21:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes it's true that the Airtrek Turbo is not exactly on par with Legacy GT.<br>However, i think it's not appropriate to compare these two cars. If you really want to compare, compare the Airtrek with the Forester. Both are SUVs and AWD, and turbo. It will be a much better comparison than using the Legacy which is primarily a sedan. Airtek Turbo is quite a good buy. But the Legacy is special in it's own way as well. Some people just like how the manufacturers design and plan for the car. The legacy is pretty much good in every aspect, exterior, interior, performance, safety. It is a one stop shop which pretty much explains its premium price which many are willing to pay.<br></div></blockquote>Oh hey... honestly, then, ignoring the price factor, seems maybe the comparism would be fairer with the S60R? Ignoring the fact that these 2 cars are in different price ranges, hey, well they are pretty similiar in many aspects to each other eh? Both are sedans, both are 4WD, and bove have a turbo each. time to cry unfair? Well taking your comparism criterias, it suddenly seems really fair to me. So the S60R can smoke the Legacy2.0GT's ass. So it has 300bhp to the Leg's 245bhp. So it has 400Nm worth of weapons grade torque, to the Leg's 310Nm. so its a 1 whole sec faster to 100 than the Leg. Unfair no? Of course its unfair. The S60R costs 60k more! Thats why for that price range, I think the ATR is a more viable alternative to the Legacy. Both are more family orientated, both have turbos, 4WD. BUT, most importantly, both are within the mid price range. If such honest comparisms annoy Legacy zealots, i suggest they not read. Thanks.</div>
