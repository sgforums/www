Also the increased drag of a 4WD system does scrub off some top end.<br><br>Actually both ATR and Legacy GT are capable steeds, just that they are rather different vehicles and comparing them seems wierd <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Rather as posted earlier, Subaru Forester vs Airtrek turob....better fit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Legacy GT VS Accord Euro R would also be a better comparision, I like them both very much too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LCL, i apologise to u. It is my mistake for stating that it does a sub 7 0-100 time. I did a test last night, and the best i got was 7.8s. In this case, yes u are right and i am wrong. However, this doesn't mean that we can't meet still. I would be more than glad for u to attend our meetups as thse meetups are generally for all car lovers to meet, be it the kelisas or zondas. And yes, the methods i had to work with are primitive at best, with a normal stopwatch. Would appreciate it if u would still bring your timing gear along, so that i can obtain a more accurate reading, and maybe others who want to get a reading of their accel timing can do so too. But i still stand by that u did misunderstand what i meant by ATR raining on the Legacy's parade. Maybe it wasn't clear b4, so i'll clarify it again, that, what i mean was that when the ATR was launched, consumers in the market looking for a turbo-charged car more orientated towards the family would have more choices to consider, esp since the ATR is cheaper by 20k, which would make it a attractive preposition for those to whom 0-100 timings matter less. Anyways, yes, I admit, that the 0-100 timing is not sub7 as i thot it was. Thats my mistake. Can we end this debate?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
