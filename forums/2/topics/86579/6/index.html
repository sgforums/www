It is my mistake for stating that it does a sub 7 0-100 time. I did a test last night, and the best i got was 7.8s. In this case, yes u are right and i am wrong. However, this doesn't mean that we can't meet still. I would be more than glad for u to attend our meetups as thse meetups are generally for all car lovers to meet, be it the kelisas or zondas. And yes, the methods i had to work with are primitive at best, with a normal stopwatch. Would appreciate it if u would still bring your timing gear along, so that i can obtain a more accurate reading, and maybe others who want to get a reading of their accel timing can do so too. But i still stand by that u did misunderstand what i meant by ATR raining on the Legacy's parade. Maybe it wasn't clear b4, so i'll clarify it again, that, what i mean was that when the ATR was launched, consumers in the market looking for a turbo-charged car more orientated towards the family would have more choices to consider, esp since the ATR is cheaper by 20k, which would make it a attractive preposition for those to whom 0-100 timings matter less. Anyways, yes, I admit, that the 0-100 timing is not sub7 as i thot it was. Thats my mistake.

I always live with the principle that "No matter what, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A FASTER CAR OUT THERE!".<br><br>I have driven an Auto car and the best I ever did on RSM and GTech was 8.35 for 0-100. Even so, I dare not say because it is not that accurate. Which is the darn reason why I decided to shaft the NA and get a Turbo and Manual Tranny car.<br><br>I respect your apologies and my apologies as well for PRICKing you over and over again.<br><br>We can still meet up and can offer u pointers as to how to better the 7.8 secs best timing.<br><br>Ciao.<br><br></div></blockquote>lcl,<br><br>ever the real man, juz as ur nick implies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>no more mudslinging, but still got meetup or not? im needing pointers on how to better my 6.8 leh...</div>

It is my mistake for stating that it does a sub 7 0-100 time. I did a test last night, and the best i got was 7.8s. In this case, yes u are right and i am wrong. However, this doesn't mean that we can't meet still. I would be more than glad for u to attend our meetups as thse meetups are generally for all car lovers to meet, be it the kelisas or zondas. And yes, the methods i had to work with are primitive at best, with a normal stopwatch. Would appreciate it if u would still bring your timing gear along, so that i can obtain a more accurate reading, and maybe others who want to get a reading of their accel timing can do so too. But i still stand by that u did misunderstand what i meant by ATR raining on the Legacy's parade. Maybe it wasn't clear b4, so i'll clarify it again, that, what i mean was that when the ATR was launched, consumers in the market looking for a turbo-charged car more orientated towards the family would have more choices to consider, esp since the ATR is cheaper by 20k, which would make it a attractive preposition for those to whom 0-100 timings matter less. Anyways, yes, I admit, that the 0-100 timing is not sub7 as i thot it was. Thats my mistake. Can we end this debate?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>hmm.. i wonder why u did not apologise to me since i was the want that challenge your claim??<br><br>Nevertheless, i just take it as im part of the' guys' and accept your error.<br><br>the weekend does help. i got laid and i feel good now so i can be less abusive! whahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>anyways, i just wanna highlight that the ATR can never do 6s or sub7 for a stock car.<br>in fact the rex claims 5.9 for the base model, i dare to say that figure cannot be achieve in SG. they can launch at 7k rpm slip all the clutch they wan.. i think at best is 6.2 for STOCK.
