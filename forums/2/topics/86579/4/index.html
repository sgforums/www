In fact, was thinking not so good as airflow is at an angle instead of 90 degrees to the intercooler. plus, its cooking on top of the engine, so im not too sure thats wise. Was thinking it would be wiser to change it to a bigger front mount, but i'd have to get rid of the bodykit, which i kinda like.</div>

Airtrek is just a family car with more space, while Outlander is meant more for offroading. In fact, Outlander seems to be a bit X-trail-ish. prob belongs to the class of SUVs which lean more towards their offroading roots.</div>
