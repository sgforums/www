Or are you a "fellow sales rep" who is worried abt me spoiling your business?  If you don't know me, dun judge me...<br><br>To be very Honest, My honda civic after 38k, air con compressor gave way... i attribute it to my whacking and wear n tear... got some sounds here and there... i got rear ended twice, both times boot lid had to be replaced... compared to my previous sunny... it is really weak...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although Mazda 3 has one of the lowest insurance premium among the 1.6 catogery, you should that note, if i remembered correctly, it is an AT. They are not MT unless its mps or rx8.  Fuel comsumption would be rather high, this is singapore, even highway drive will be like city drive. The FC is definately one of the issues. The body is heavy, like the chev and opel but as you know, the heavier the body, the more strength the engine got to pull. 11km/ltr, can't really trust wat is written inside.My fren mazda3 1 full tank only around<br>550 +/-.<br><br>Its quite true that the stock cars really need additional pushing in the engine.But that can be compensated by some mod on it for better FC and power. Like changing to a open pod, fuel charger,add grounding, racing cable with better spark plug etc.<br><br>Aim for MT cars for better FC, currently using lancer MT. FC around 13-15km/ltr. Insurance may be slightly higher then other 1.6 sedan but its still comfortable.<br><br>My another fren, who drives matrix MT with fuel saving mod plus super saving driving mode can go up to almost 800 for 1 full tank.<br><br>Since you already say that most probably it would be you driving, and for leisure purpose, the mazda 3 would be ok. Harder cover for better protection. But you may want to think first, how long do you plan on using that car. Get the basic configurations and get the mods outside which are cheaper except, for the larger wheels, ask them for trade in. Besides the rims, the rest you can get it outside cheaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since your dad already confirm about it, the next thing to do is to check thoroughly when purchasing, such as the sales agreement, what are the things they are giving etc. But my advice would be, get the basic configurations except ask them to trade-in for a better sport rim coz they will most probably get a better price then you get yourself outside. The rest of the mods or kits, can get it outside. It will be cheaper. Unless you worry about the insurance about those after-market product. The insurance is base on the sales agreement you had with the company. the sales agreement will state the things which are included with the car at point of purchase. Therefore, if anything happens, you can claim it back in the insurance. For after-market product, it will not be insured. But there are some ways of doing it. Which is not the legal way. hehe...will not comment much about it.<br><br>Kits are ez to get nowadays. If you wan better and cheaper kits can go JB...its much cheaper then in SG. But the quality will not be there. Anyway, kits are for apperance..looks nice can already...can last or not is another thing. If you wan to know more about kits or mod, maybe can join mazda club, I believe they have more details for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mazda so bad review meh?<br><br>yup, come to mazda club and join us..<br><br>i own a mazda 6 2.0 and find it pretty ok... didnt really like it in the first place though..<br><br>anyway.. i drove a m3 sedan with 4 pple in the car to NS highway.. max i reached was 175km/h.. cannot go further.. i believe its engine cut.. or smth.. bcoz the RPM was not near redline at all.. its very stable and comfortable at that high speed... it was using 16" rims too.. if bigger rims.. should be better..<br><br>the disadvantage is m3 is a heavy body for a 1.6 and this also explains the good stability during high speeds.. but if u are willing to put more $ into it.. modifications can be done to have a better pickup..<br><br>ask ur dad to consider m6 if $ is not that big an issue.. i didnt like it in the first place bcoz of the plastic feel interior.. but the face lifted one is much better..<br><br>with 4 pple in the m6.. i was able to reach 219km/h easily.. and has very little vibrations too.. im comparing it with my previous toyota camry 2.2 which had alot of vibrations at 170km/h and above.. it also took some time to reach 180..<br><br>just a lil review on the 2 mazdas that i have driven..</div>
