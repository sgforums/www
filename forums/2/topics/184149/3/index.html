Are sales reps meant to be lonely and cannot have friends, be mute, and cannot surf forums? IF eugene has not mentioned that i was a mazda sales rep, would you be whacking me? Or are you a "fellow sales rep" who is worried abt me spoiling your business?  If you don't know me, dun judge me...<br><br>To be very Honest, My honda civic after 38k, air con compressor gave way... i attribute it to my whacking and wear n tear... got some sounds here and there... i got rear ended twice, both times boot lid had to be replaced... compared to my previous sunny... it is really weak...<br></div></blockquote>first off, yes, u can never change how people think, react and so on. this goes to the same for me not changing how u react n think n talk n ur attitude in this matter.<br><br>sales reps esp. car sales person can surf the net of course. but the difference here is that you started talking abt how ur civic is no good in terms of quality etc...even in this reply that is quoted in bold (last few words). this IMHO is not ethical of u as a car sales person to talk so much abt it. i have not come across a car sales person that likes to bash other makes/models online. i think u r my first encounter.<br><br>dun judge u? pls, do u need me to judge u? i think ur words n attitude towards this matter is enough for everybody to see. i am only replying to let u know not to go overboard in giving ur comments and not abt "cannot surf net" and so on. u have ur rights and so do i. just dun cross the line. it will make u seem not professional...esp when u r a mazda sales rep. pls promote frenliness amongst car sales person of different brands. no need to get ugly bcos of sales. if its urs, its urs.<br><br>if u consider this as whacking u, then i'll rather take an afternoon off and show u what is whacking...in ur car sales room. i believe i can achieve more whacking on the pros and cons of a mazda engine than on this. and of course, i say again that i dun need to whack u on the net. just wish to remind u to be more ethical in giving out ur comments on other branding.<br><br>lastly, i am not a car sales person. am in the IT biz. but i do like cars and mazda 3 is definitely one of them as it has the looks n certainly has come a long way since its 121, 323, 626 and so on series' days. dun get so worked up. only a frenly exchange of pointers.<br><br>have a nice day!<br><br>cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Its a pretty good daily drive imho. Don't dwell into the reality of comparing it to the 06' civic and or the opel astra or any other makes for that matter.<br>My only qualm about it is that its pretty tight in the cabin.

Customers can choose not to upgrade or upgrade, but we'd strongly encourage customers to upgrade because it is really at no cost to them."<br><br>Mazda says it has set aside five months for this entire upgrading exercise, during which affected car owners will be informed in batches to come and have their brakes upgraded. - CNA /ct</div>

It's not true that young ppl die die must drive manual cars la.. After driving both manual and auto, I will prefer auto for the stop n go traffic in local context..

Besides how much power do u need in local traffic? It's a solid car and will serve ur family well =)</div>
