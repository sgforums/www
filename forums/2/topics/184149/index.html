My young friend, i'm assuming you don't know very much about cars much less the Fomoco (In case your wondering Fomoco is Ford Motor Company just like Komoco is Korean Motor Company).<br>You think its very simple to engineer an affordable car by just making it RWD? Imagine if Honda designed their civic to be RWD then you'll see novice drivers fishtailing all over TPE becos the power driven from the rear wheels is immense.<br>And btw i don't see any Fords that are selling over 100K and the top range Mondeo V6 only seels for 90K. FYI, the Focus sells for under 70K.<br>[b]Focus Hatchback </strong><br>1.4 3dr <strong>61,900 </strong><br>1.6 5dr (A) <strong>68,900 </strong><br>Focus Sedan<br>1.6 4dr (A)<strong> 67,900 </strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>14 posts doesnt mean i am young, juz tt i joined recently...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>if u are strong in a particular field doesnt mean u have to be strong in a similar field as in motorbikes to cars<br>and if the ford engine is desgined to be high revving ... why does it produce only 100hp?? hp is directly proportionate to rev....<br>and since u like a high reving enigne so much.. why do u need a high  revving car in s'pore context since this will mean a sacrifice in low end torque....<br>fomoco i know ah.. aston martin jaguar mazda and volvo all under ford.. so is a few amercian brands like mercury and tt licoln or something<br>i din say making it rwd will make it affordable.. i merely juz say tt making it rwd will push up ford focus price... and i dun see many mercedes and bmws or lexus fishtailing... is200 meant for young drivers(aka novice).. so is 320...<br>guess u are either a mazda fan or a ford fan or juz prejudiced tt i have 14 submissions or both....<br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

After all its still an autobox which means like the conventional ones more shifting will result in wear and tear; and it ain't cheep to replace mind you.<br>Like Alfa 156's their selespeed gives problems after the 3rd year. You just can't get the best of both worlds (clutchless manuals)</div>
