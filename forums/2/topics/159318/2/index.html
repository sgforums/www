Thing is, with the 2nd hand market down in the dumps right now, how much over the scrap value of a 2nd hand car would you guys reckon a fair price would be? I'm aware that it would be dependent on the condition of the vehicle as well, but as a gauge, how much do you reckon I should offer (assuming that the car is in good shape and fairly low - abt 30k to 40k - mileage)?</div>

So, taking a new car of the same model and look at the annual depreciation spread over 10yrs, will give you an idea of the max you should pay for a 2nd hand car. [Actually, even if the annual dep. is the same, you'll still lugi less with a 2nd hand car when you sell in 3yrs time..... it's just the mental thing about getting a used car with a perceived annual dep that is tha same as a new car...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ]<br><br>As for a fair value, I guess it all depends on how much discount you think you should get for a used car vs a brand new car. As long as you think the savings you get is worth the risk of a used car, who is to say you are wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys, back in Singapore for a couple of days and the wife and myself have managed to go look around at the cars available.<br><br>Currently, I would say there are 3 choices. These are listed below in order of (my wife's) preference:<br><br>08/08/2003 Toyota Harrier 2.4GL<br>OMV - $36,830<br>COE - $32,799<br>PARF - $23,939<br>Mileage - 65,000km<br>Asking Price - $94,000<br><br>NEW Nissan Cefiro 230JM<br>Asking Price - $95,500<br><br>Dec 2002 BMW 318i<br>Mileage - 20,000km<br>Asking Price - $86,000<br><br>I have three questions: (1) Bearing in mind that I'm likely to sell the vehicle after 2-3 years, which would you buy (is the Harrier's mileage a little on the high side?)? (2) If I got the Harrier, how much would you reckon (ball park figure) I would get back if I sold the car after 2 or 3 years (I am still not sure how to calculate. Am very confused now.)? and (3) How much would I get back if I sold that new Cefiro after 2-3 years?<br><br>Many, many, many thanks in advance, kind sirs/ladies.<br><br></div>

Even if someone wants to pay you 10k for the 5yr-old car body, you'll be out of pocket by 27k =&gt; 10k/yr. But warranty ? Who is paying transfer fee (&gt;1k) ? Road tax ?<br><br>For the Cefiro, if COE stays at current level, my guess is you will lugi ~30k for the 1st 3yrs, which is similar to the harrier, but for a new car with 3yrs warranty and 6mths road tax.<br><br>But I think the price for the harrier can be cheaper, depending how good you are at bargining.<br><br>Not enoug info for the BMW.

            <div class='col-md body'>Think my wife might be close to breaking point. She's getting a little fed up with my constant pestering I think. haha. But I guess we'll go have a look at the car and see how things go. The main reason why the Forester sounds so appealing to me is because it meets my need for more space while being quite pacey (I currently drive a car that does 0-100km/h in about 7 seconds). So to me, it's the best of both worlds. My main concern is that I'll take a massive depreciation hit if and when I sell the car after 2-3 years. I guess fuel consumption comes a fairly distant second to that. Thing is, Top Gear (the magazine) said that it's top choice of the range was the 2.0XT. However, just wondering if the 2.0XT in Singapore is the 2005 or 2006 model. I think the 2.5XT is the new model. Ah well, will have to go check it out tomorrow I guess. The equipment list on the 2.0XT (in the MotorImage price list which I downloaded off the Net) seems MUCH better for about $3k less, hence I get the feeling that the 2.0XT is the older model (2005?).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OMG! How could I forget Accord Euro R (for sportslike) or the standard Accord.  Both looks good and the handling is super <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But Accord is a little too small for me, especially the boot. Plus the fact that I don't quite like the look of the handbrake. Yes I am a fussy one aren't I?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just an update. Just placed the order for the Subaru Forrester 2.5XT. Both my wife and I test drove it and liked it. Enjoyed having the power and the handling was pretty good for an SUV. Thanks for your comments/views guys.</div>
