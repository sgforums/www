Then I will be able to strike and buy car at the right time at the right place. But too bad I'm not.<br><br>This idea of zero COE was mooted during the recent article in ST that reported some of the speeches by Transport Minister Yeow CT. Obviously it have to be from such credible and heavy weight source which even the authorised dealers' salesman will tell you the same thing... But don't ask me which date that ST article was. I seriously did not keep track. The idea is supposed to be an idea but the possibility of implementing it is very real. Question is when. Now they reducing the ARF gradually; causing your parf value to drop. Literally = your car no resale value. In the meantime they built new gantries. Noticeably the new one in Orchard recently. More will come. Its left-hand-pocket-out-right-hand-pocket-in kinda of mentality. Yes. The government will never do loss making businesses so trust that this new system will even rake in more $ for the coffers. Good luck to all salesman who needs a car to run on the road...</div>

The ARF will be reduced until nothing left. Right now is 110% of OMV. The parf is 55% of this value. So in effect it is approx 60% of OMV.  2 years ago it was 65% of OMV. So this amount will gradually come down. Cannot do overnight. A lot of people will bang tables. No one will change car or buy new cars anymore. Then all the authorised dealers will feel the pinch and start to pull out of Singapore. Then we have another set of crisis-Job losses + no new car on the road = run down feeling of the country cos only old cars are on the road... No way the government will do this. But the trend of car being cheaper and cheaper cannot be avoided. Eventually you will only pay for its OMV which is its production and shipping costs. Affordable? Yes. But you pay like hell for ERP charges. This is what is happening in Japan... In this case, LTA dun even need to set aside the $ to refund u back as PARF as it will virtually be non-existent. Smart huh?  How not to win you tell me lah?</div>
