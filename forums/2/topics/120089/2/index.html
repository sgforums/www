            <div class='col-md body'>Well, its all about substance and having the ability to be yourself.There is nothing wrong with playing dress-up IMHO, because for every Porsche, there is RUF, for every Benz, there is AMG and for every BMW, there is Hamann Motorsports.If you drive well and not get on the nerves of people, that should be good enough.<br><br>Although I'm quite humoured by the lack of taste that some people have in dressing-up their cars, who am I to criticise and jerk them off for their taste.Yeah I hate them but isn't free will what makes us all humans?<br><br>Cool it and who knows the fellow in a tacky Kia or Vios might one day drive a better car than you?Everyone starts somewhere and a superiority complex does no good.</div>

A beauty to me might be otherwise for you. It is like going in front of a fat lady in reviewing clothes and say "can't you wear something else?". (Ops, sorry, my idea of an eye sore.) I still think moddings to look good or like the sport version brother is OK. But generally driving dangerously isn't, not matter what car you have.<br><br>By the way, which are the horrible looking ones? Got pictures, cause I can't visionlize it.
