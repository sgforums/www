Although we all share the part about that driver problem, but generalizing all the modded cars like this seems child-like. So this contribute to the "kid" part.<br><br>If you are riding a sport-car, wouldn't the insurance, road tax, petrol, maintence kill you? So that contributes the "Rich" part.<br><br>Of course I know he isn't a kid anymore, but this is childish. What does he hope to accomplish by posting something like that? We already have topics that talks about tailgater, signal-ness, zig-zag ziggers, hoggers. And all these only targets drivers, never models.<br><br>Anyway, I guess I am the one who started it then.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i kinda think that the way ppl dress up their cars speaks volumes bout the driver.<br><br>not agreeing with the topic starter here, but i think there's some sense in what he's trying to say.<br><br>i personally dun find anything wrong with drivers of vios, city, matrix or whatever cars he mentioned in general. heck, some of my closest friends own those cars and they are really passionate bout souping up, keeping their babes in show condition and i respect them for what they do for their cars.<br><br>its really those ppl who get the idea that a low budget sedan can be made to look and perform like a performance vehicle twice or more times their price that really gets on my nerves sometimes. face it, what kinda message r u sending out when u have a phat bodykit, neon lights, racing sticker schemed car driving like a twerp on sg roads?<br><br>and i guarantee u that there are such young punks/ old foggies he mentioned prowling the roads. its just the way he makes a sweeping remark categorizing everyone in that genre that i can't swallow. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
