            <div class='col-md body'>What i think is that, if u have a monthly salary of around 3-4k it should be enough to own car on 10 years or 7 years loan, or even a season car. Most people i know, earn a salary of around 3-4k. Still can drive a car, driving a car, u need to plan ur money wisely on the car : example , is it a worth buy ? , can it last ? scrap value high ? haha..<br><br>Since now car is quite cheap , a salary of around 3-4k should be enough to get u a japanese car ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it all depends on what kind of car u wana buy isnt it?? personally i feel a minimum salary of 3k is a must. I will never splurge on a stupid tin can and allow my parents and family to enjoy a lower quality of life..<br><br>anyway public transport is so efficient nowadays and in time to come, i am sure every part of Singapore will be 'linked' up!I understand the SMRT is doing construction in Sentosa..sooner or later, private vehicular transportation will be rational for people who simply enjoy driving.</div>

Hopefully it's more realistic.<br><br><img src="http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/1165/a3zd.jpg"><br><br>Since it's a 5 years COE left, I can only take 4 years loan rite?

The 3rd party insurance price is just an estimation. My friend said he could get one which is only 600+ for 3rd party. Or is it just a gimmick?<br><br>If I scrap the car after the COE is used up, do I get any PARF rebate or such?<br>If I sell the car after 5 years, which I highly doubt there'll be any buyers, what's the body value of the car? Is it  Car Price - Dep Value X No. of years used?<br><br>Thanks for any opinions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You might not be able to go for 3rd party insurance. In the case of newer cars, the  finance company will insist on you taking comprehensive insurance to cover for the loss of car in accidents/etc.<br><br>There is no PARF when you scrap your car.<br><br>As for body value, I don't believe you can get anything. Hell, you will need to pay for people to scrap the car for you.<br><br>Do check out the TOTAL price you will have to pay, and get the dealer to write it all clearly in black and white. Call me discriminatory or whatever, but second-hand car dealers are not the most honest bunch of guys around.<br><br>Lastly, if I were getting a car like the one you are aiming at, I'd be very worried about its reliability.
