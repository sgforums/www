            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's very true that the lack of few hundred dollars is a factor in deciding the COE cars or new cars. I also have the same situation few months ago and finally I settled for a 92 swift. Though, it's old, at least it can get me from point to point conveniently. So a lot of factors depend on your needs and budget. Of course, the engine must tahan....so have to invest in some $$$$ regularly for servicing and maintenance.
