            <div class='col-md body'>i am on the verge of getting a new car, but would like some advise on what to get. I find the sunny very comfortable to drive and the price is very reasonable as well. However, the only thing that is holding me back is the fuel consumption. I have surfed the nissian forums and find that the petrol consumption is really very high. I was very upset because i really had my heart set on the nissian. Any drivers of the new nissian sunny cvtc out there that has good reviews about the car? I also read something about installing grounding cables to improve fuel efficiency, is that really true? And how much will it help?<br><br>Also, i would like to seek advise on whether to get a manual or auto. I would like to play with the gears once a while but i know it gets frustrating in a jam. Also, is there any point in getting a manual for a car like the sunny? it is afterall a saloon car that is built for comfort and not performance, might as well enjoy the full extend of the comfort right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Yup, my manager and a few colleague are driving the new Sunny EX saloon.<br><br>Ermmmm its true that fuel consumtion is seriously bad. Abt 1 litre per 10 km only, for auto car. The manual one might hit 12km/litre.<br><br>Also, find the Sunny engine a bit rough and loud. The only thing attractive is the price of the car, and the name.......... look value for money.<br><br>Just tested drive the Mazda3 today. And seriously speaking, feel that Mazda is over taking Nissan soon. No joke. I experience it.<br><br>Of cos, when buying a car, work within your budget.<br><br>Auto or manual, for me, I will go for Auto for normal saloon car like Sunny, Corolla etc, and only manual for sports or powerful car, like the Rex or any 2 door coupe. No point to torture yourself more by driving a manual car when it lacks power. Also, Singapore JAM is a factor, like what u mentioned.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so if you are really held back by the issues, then what is your second choice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am thinking of probably a vivos or a city, understand that fuel consumption is very good...but at the price i am paying for them with leather seats and other extras, its almost the same price of the sunny which is in a better class of car. And if i get the vivos or city, do u think i should get manual or auto?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ermmm how abt the new Mazda 2?<br><br>It cost S$70,888.............<br><br>I know its a Mazda but I got to admit that they improved by a lot nowsaday. Furthermore its a new design.............<br><br>By the way if you get Vios or City, I would suggest you go for the auto.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm i was thinking that since the vivos and the city has the potential to look more sporty, thought it might be fun to get the manual to play with the gears. If i get the sunny, i would probably get the auto, tried the car, feels so much more stable, think its the weight. The only problem i am worried about is the petrol consumption. I would be happy if i can hit 12km/l for the auto. Is that wishful thinking on my part? i promise to be really light footed...hahah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, I promised myself to be a light-footer also but it never succeed.<br><br>Errmmmm 12km/h for an auto sunny is not easy leh.......... to be frank, I got 3 new nissan sunny in my office, and one older model (Last model). So far, only the manual one manage a respectable 12km/h, while the other 2 auto ranges from 10-10.5km/h.<br><br>Also, this is only my own concept. I will go for the manual car only if it has horsepower ard 130bhp. If not, I might not go for a manual. A Saloon car will always be a saloon car. I agree that mod the car will make it look good, but to me, personally feel no point torturing myself in jams and mcp, esp in shopping centre, haha............<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what about supplementing the car with stuff that might save fuel? i read somewhere that doing some grounding cables will help, although i have absolutely no idea what they are. Just that i read in some forums that fuel consumption can be improved with simple methods and it helps the sunny to achieve acceptable levels of petrol consumption. yeah i more or less decided on the sunny auto already. Now the only problem is deciding on the colour now...haha and by the way, what freebies can i usually get? I think leather seats, rims and fog lights should not be a problem?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do u think the vivos has the potential to be modified to look real fierce and be really fast and be a respectable car? if so i would probably get it and get a manual one...what do u guys think about the status between the sunny and the vivos?</div>
