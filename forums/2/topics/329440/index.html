              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I'm a new learner &amp; about to start learning driving. Thing is, i'm not sure whether to go private or with a school. My main aim, is speed. I want to get the license the quickest way. I asked my friends &amp; some told me that private is faster, while some, school.</p>
              <p>Private is obvously cheaper, but i don't like the fact that it isn't organised &amp; my records aren't kept.</p>
              <p>I'll be registering to learn Class 3 &amp; i would like to know, how long does it take on average? Also, would you kind people please advice me on which route is better, private or school? Faster? &amp; any good private instructors that you know of...?</p>
              <p>Much thanks to all of you who answer! =)</p>

              <p>I took 2+ months. Enrolled on 18 June. Passed my TP last Thursday. I think you go school better. It's more consistent and effective. Private like anyhow one.</p>
              <p>I feel that the instructors from driving schools are more dedicated. Or at least those that I've met in SSDC.</p>
              <p>Edit: I remember my instructor telling me that even if you go private, you sum up the bookings and lessons and TP and stuff like that, it's almost the same? For private candidates you still have to wait for TP because they give priority to their students. If you're looking for speed, I think you should go for driving school.</p>
              <p>Never know how private instructors are like right? They can be very complacent and just leave you to drive on yourself and they just talk on the phone or sleep. Or even worse, first lesson teach parking already. Wth?!</p>
              <p>I think you should ask how many lessons are taken for Class 3 on average instead of asking how long it took. Cus you can take 25 lessons and only spend 2 months completing it because you go for lessons everyweek. Some people go for 1 or 2 lessons every month so it's slower.</p>

              <p>its a BS that private price can sum up to almost the same. Dont talk crap la dahliamorie....</p>
              <p>Private instructor can be good too, see who you choose. My uncle recommand a private instructor @ bbdc to my friend. A experienced teacher, teach not bad... take 24lessons + revision. total 24...</p>
              <p>Theory part is easy la, those fail alot of time, must be never study or careless make mistakes....</p>
              <p>My friend passed at first time, total cost of being a private student - 1260</p>
              <p>Sch at least need 1.8k and above. 1.8k is provided you very pro ;D Plus sch dont pass subject easily...</p>
              <p>I did register bbdc sch 2years ago, did passed everything at 20lessons, 2auto car lessons, 1 revision, total 23. I spent 1.8k total (before GST 7%).</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, 23lessons in TOTAL for school, is consider extremly good liao..</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>I think the info for school and private are plenty, given by the other forum guys. I think the only thing that is left out is actually you. School or private, if your driving skills are not up to par, it will still be difficult. The school or private instructor can tell you so much stuff but on the actual test day, its all you.</p>
              <p>As for my experience, I was with a private instructor for almost a year and failed the TP twice. Took a 2 year break then enrolled in school. Started February this year and got my license last July with 1 attempt.</p>
              <p>There are a few variables at work: which private instructor or which school, where you take your TP and how good your driving skills are. If all the variables are positive, then getting your license ASAP is not a problem. Any one a negative, then may take a little longer.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that is my two-cents worth. Good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
