I just got my licence less than 2 weeks ago, on the 2nd day I passed, my friend let me drive her car. Went home and kena scolded by my mum, "You drive your friend's car?! If you scratch it how you pay?!"<br><br>Cos my friend's car is a BMW... My friend not worried I scratch her car but my mum worried. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>haha.. cool.. scratch? tell her no worries. taimiya sprayy paint will do the job.. many colours to choose from too. and it cost less then 10 bucks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  jk.</div>
