            <div class='col-md body'>i was actually travelling along robinson road, turning into finlayson green. it was a right bend, and i saw a bike coming extremely close to me somewhere behind on the right side. the guy brake, and thus skidded, or he would have crashed into me. i was just following my own lane, but he claims that i caused him to skid when in my opinion is that he was too fast and too close to me. he suffered some small cuts and theres a scratch on his bike. we have each others name and contact number and thats it, he did not take any photo or anything else. just wanna know would i be liable for anything as the only reason i stopped was that he skidded right beside me, and i stopped to see what has happened exactly and if i could help but as i've mentioned earlier, he claimed that i caused him to skid.</div>
