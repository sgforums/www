Just want to speak up for SOME incidents whereby the driver may not be at fault.. But just becaue the victim is a child and if the child pass away, the driver is in deep shit and everyboby will assume that it was the driver who was driving recklessly..<br><br>Still, the important thing is to be alert when driving at all times.. and not only at school zones.. isnt it? Less accidents = less traffic james = happy drivers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Hahaha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm i also think it's to alert motorists to the presence of a school and school children. but seriously, i dont think the red road works. it seems to be more slippery and on top of that, no information was given to motorists about it's purpose and we are all simply just guessing. they should just use signs like the flashing "SCH ZONE" light..</div>
