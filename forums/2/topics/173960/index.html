If they not happy with you, should have told you right?<br><br>Anyway, when i was in secondary school, my principal's car was keyed all around.<br><br>She was so pissed that she paid contractors to make a special lot just outside her office under a shade where other teacher's lot was under the sun.<br><br>The car got keyed worse!!<br><br>final insult right under her noses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yea got to agree.... the one who scratch the car is at fault but have u thought of it yourself.... have u done something to annoy the other party ??<br><br>Most ppl i believe are quite tolerant but sometimes i guessed as we're living in such a stressful environment, juz a minor spark is enough to piss us off.<br><br>Juz think abt it, how many times have we came across that big F* who's parking his car in 2 car park lots or the Aseh*le who seems always 2 b drunk and cant align his vehicle straight in the lot ??, or the lamer who's 2 lazy to do a reverse parking and head straight into the lot but always leaves the car in a tilted state and walks off yaya papaya??<br><br>To those who have done the part, i say stop cause no doubt u have had your 'revenge' but wat have u got in return? &gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe sleepless nites and one day you may be caught red-handed and that's worst.<br><br>The best option is juz call the HDB branch office for car park enforcement if the incident happens on a regular basis and trust me on that the job has been sub-out, the enforcement team are quite good at their work. I had an experience wif such a driver who juz luvs 2 park in 2 lots(maybe he's scared that ppl would either scratch his car or cause dents when opening doors), that after a few calls and parking fines(even if he has a valid season ticket), he learnt his lesson and now parks within a lot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm even more mindful of where I park, especially with a Jaguar.<br><br>Always look around you before you park, ask yourself; is the lot too secluded? Always park in well lit lots, or where it is in full public view.<br><br>If you park in someone's regular lot (and that someone is an Ah Beng), this will happen. If you reverse into a lot which someone has been waiting to park in, this will happen. If you have honked at someone or flashed your headlights at someone prior to entering a carpak to park, this will happen. If your car is too shiny and new and expensive, this will surely happen. If you park too close to a neighboring car, this will happen too.<br><br>Generally, there are lots of sensitive and ego-maniacs on the roads these days, so be mindful of your actions. Ever overtook someone to find that he speeds up to overtake you in return?? Well, these are the sort of people who will scratch cars.<br><br>Sometimes, kids or children scratches cars too. If you park near a school, watch out...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a feeling it's one of my neighbours. They live in a super big house got like 3-4 cars (Maybe more that i don't see).<br>Their driveway only can keep 2 cars (parallel). Most of our houses keep 2 cars (Vertical).<br>So they usually park their other cars outside. And (this is becoming a habit) using contruction site cones to "mark" their lot.<br><br>So we already have 2 cars in our driveway, so i parked the spare car (my mom's colleague's car) outside on "their" lot.<br>Then next thing i realised, i kena scratch.<br><br>Then i notice sometimes some people park at our estate and walk up to the HDB flats nearby. But if i'm not wrong there's a MSCP at the HDB flats area.<br>So.. whyyyyyy?!?!?!<br><br>And anyway, nobody talks to anybody in this neighbourhood. So i dunno how come will kena scratch. Unless kids get a kick out of doing that - which is a testimony to what their parents taught them.<br><br>Hah.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
