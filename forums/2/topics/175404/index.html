Last time, they suspended my account when they couldn't get the annual membership cos I replaced my debit card. They didn't even tell me they suspended it... I only found out like 4 months after when I tried to rent a car...<br><br>Keep a close eye on your account... they accidentally deducted the amount twice from me and I spent one month, 2 emails and 6 phone calls before I got my refund... at least they returned me both amounts, so basically last year's membership was free... hehe.. But it's a lot of crap to go through... apparently their finance department and the customer service department don't have very good communication... heh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Second year with them now. Remembered that they promised with a second year free subscribtion for so called  them before end of first year to confirm.<br><br>Once I forgot my cash card after I returned the car and went home.  Ran back to the MSCP and called them. The guy unlocked the car for me remotely and  locked it again while still holding the line. Lucky I remember before the next guy took over if not my cash card bye bye liao. $40+ inside.<br><br>Found many things left behind during my hire: Street directory,  P plates, lots and lots of coupon tabs and even an empty McDonalds Paper cup.<br><br>Overall quite satisfied with Cityspeed but just hope all members spare a thought for the next user. Please clean up after use and top up the petrol. Got once the meter showed less than 1/4 full when I was in a rush.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just cancelled my NTUC car co-op membership.  Have been member for long time; almost since they started.  Occasionally use their cars.  Locations are convenient.<br><br>Then I started to work out of Singapore and did not pay attention to their bill and they could not deduct my membership fee.  Some time later, they made a few deductions at once and decided to increase my deposit.  I cancelled because I did not see the point of paying a higher deposit then everyone else for a service that I may only use from time to time.  Actually I have not booked a car for a least 3 years but remained a member.<br><br>Usual deposit is $100 but asked me to top up another $400 if I want to remain a member.  I did not see the rationale of "locking up" $500 as a deposit for a service I rarely use.  Might as well rent a car from a regular rental company.<br><br>Considering City Speed  but no urgency to join or anything since I still work away from Singapore a lot.<br><br></div>

Is there anyway around it?<br><br>thanks.</div>
