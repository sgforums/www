            <div class='col-md body'>I was from BBDC.....It is statistically proven that it is much easier to pass at school then others..... I got my licence within 2mths.....  one mth learning another waiting for test date..... the other time I was under system allocation.... they use to want all the students to die die take 25 lessons be4 u can book for driving test......that was ages ago though..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I hear from my friends that it will take up to 4-6 mths as a private student to get a test date..... So I think sch is better in a sense.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .... If anyone is to take at BBDC now, it will be harder to pass compare to the past as the accident rate of BBDC student is quite high......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Also had fixed instructor, fixed car. But on Mon during my revision, my usual car sent for servicing, so they allocated me car 55.<br><br>Then on my test, guess what, I got car 55! I was so happy, haha. Cos on Mon I remember telling my instructor: "Wah, this 55, the accelerator not very sensitive" and some other things, so I kinda knew what to expect when driving it during my TP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, I also chose school over pte instructor cos scared the pte instructor not dedicated enough (heard too many horror stories).

            <div class='col-md body'>It does not matter which instructor you go to.. Be it a sch instructor or private one.. The way they test it is the same.. If you fail, means u are not prepared..<br><br>Points to look out if you wanna do a comparison both on school instructors and private ones:<br><br>1) School instructors have gone through proper training in the school. Pte Instructors based on what they have learnt in the past and maybe "updated" when their students failed.<br><br>2) Sch Instructors get first hand info on changes and even tips from the TP on what they are looking out for.. But not pte instructors.<br><br>3) You get piority in booking test dates if you learn under sch, thus making passing time shorter.<br><br>It does not matter if you are taking at Ubi, SSDC or BBDC.. It is adviceable to take the test nearest to your home.. E.g. Staying at Hougang adviceable to take at Ubi.. etc.. At least u noe the road well..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Tester will usually have a better impression of you if you can do the circuit well, high chance to pass if no major mistakes on the road.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im from CDC...not fixed instructor...overall quite ok for me...just that got some politics amongst the instructors...I do get a lot of circuit practice but still not confident..driving on test routes around Ubi quite ok,just that got 2 test routes have to drive until near eunos link to make U-turn...quite intimidating cause gotta cut thru mad traffic from 3rd lane to 1st lane to turn.otherwise should be fine...waiting to take TP...<br><br>One thing about CDC is that you are allowed to book test date after module 2 evaluation...while BBDC gotta wait till module 3...will save time for you provided you clear your FTT early...For me, I could book test date after 12 lessons but becos of FTT have to wait till now...waiting time for TP is around 3 weeks</div>
