            <div class='col-md body'>Tickets for the British F1 race were being sold at between 180-220GBP (about S$600) on the internet. I wonder how much will the tickets for our F1 race next year and how much government tax will be levied. Perhaps a 30% tax like the special tax on all hotel rooms during the F1 race would be reasonable. Then there is the TV rights. I should think $20 pay  per view should be pretty reasonable. Since not every home has cable TV, Mediacorp should start looking into how they can make the F1 race available to paying customers who do not have cable. Otherwise Starhub will have a monopoly and the price of the television broadcast may be much higher.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i didn't remember wrongly, an article was saying that the tickets are planned at the sub $100 range? and besides, planned route is so long, i am sure there will be open spaces where people are able to stand beside the road and be very close to the track for the pure adrenaline rush when a car speeding at 300kmh zoom past you. i can imagine our government spending a lot of money covering up the the planned route with fence to prevent people from climbing into road.<br><br>seriously doubt the tickets sales can cover that cost. guess the only reason is the exposure that sg will receive from this event.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>instead of comparing the prices for the UK event, I think it makes more sense to benchmark against that of Malaysia, Shanghai, Jpan and Australia.  My feeling is that prices will be above those of Malaysia, Shanghai but lower than Japan's.<br><br>No doubt these tickets don't come cheap but it shld not be exorbitant lest the buzz fizzle out by year one.  It does not make sense if the gahmen tailor this strictly 100% to draw the tourists, there must be some local supporters - and high prices put them off.  Already, being a street race, ppl can throng to Marina foodcourt or for those working in Merill Lynch or UBS, they get to see the race from their office - which is free.  Not unless, gahmen pass a law to have them block up the windows during the event to avoid "free" viewing..</div>

As for seats, market research will come up with a figure as to the number of foreign tourists coming in. If they have spent 2k to fly in just to watch the race, they wouldn't mind paying $600-$800 a ticket. Follow the UK, charge more for a ticket but allow them to use the same ticket for the practice and the test races as well.<br><br>I do not agree with cheap viewing areas as long as there are people prepared to pay more.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its totally justified to charge around 600bucks for a grandstand seat. The promoter should get a proper ROI from hosting the event. Its not charity.<br>F1 is like watching a top football match or some top performing artists. I remember back those days when micheal Jackson came to singapore, people were paying 400bucks per seat.<br><br>But as lazerlords rightly pointed out, we shouldn't make the F1 grandprix only for the elite. We need a middleclass fan base here and there should be affordable seats.<br><br>I think the cheapest sepang tickets are around 50bucks or so. Ofcourse those are just entry tickets and they have to camp on the hills to watch. But thats fair enough, gotta pay to play. But dont make it strictly for the uber rich only.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Tickets for the British F1 race were being sold at between 180-220GBP (about S$600) on the internet. I wonder how much will the tickets for our F1 race next year and how much government tax will be levied. Perhaps a 30% tax like the special tax on all hotel rooms during the F1 race would be reasonable. Then there is the TV rights. I should think $20 pay  per view should be pretty reasonable. Since not every home has cable TV, Mediacorp should start looking into how they can make the F1 race available to paying customers who do not have cable. Otherwise Starhub will have a monopoly and the price of the television broadcast may be much higher.</div></blockquote>I expect the lower price ticket to be around $50 each and the grand stand ticket to be about $800.<br><br>All TV rights belongs to Bernie E and Starhub is already showing them on sports channel 24. There will never be extra charge for singapore race, however i suspect Mediacorp might show them for free, like what they used to do in the past.<br></div>
