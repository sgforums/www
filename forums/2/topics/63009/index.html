            <div class='col-md body'>I read from another forum, that the altis is actually our very own corolla, both are the same cars, just that the Corolla in Singapore is visually the same as the one sold in Japan whereas the Corolla Altis is a version which was customised for CKD markets.<br><br>Technically, they are identical. If the Altis version is going to Singapore, then it could be due to the AFTA thing where Toyota feels it would be more cost-effective to ship from Thailand than Japan. They may save some money in duties although I<br>am not sure how the Singapore tax structure works.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi folks,<br><br>went for the altis launch yesterday and i must say the car is awesome....<br>it really is cheap and for those going for the vios, i would advise paying a bit more for the altis.<br><br>in malaysia, the prices for toyotas are as follows :<br>1.5 Vios - 78K<br>1.6 Altis - 120K<br>2.0 Camry - 147K<br><br>But in Singapore, the prices are as follows :<br>1.5 Vios - 66K<br>1.6 Altis - 74K<br>2.0 Camry - 108K<br><br>so, you can clearly see, there is a huge discount for the altis in singapore. toyota have made a good job in getting the altis assembled in thailand so that consumers here can enjoy a better quality car at a much affordable price !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've drove the altis 1.8 before, quite often tho i must say. all i can say that its a great car, interior is typical jap standard, but it's definately powerful, den again my daily driver is a 1.5 wira so thats not saying much<br><br>comes with trc control and vvt-i, all in all a great daily driver, auto would have been great if it came with tiptronic but i've yet to drive the manual though,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Classic payment allows 6 bids for COE non-guaranteed.<br>Gold payment gives guaranteed COE, think the difference is $1,000.<br><br>There are two levels of trim: Standard and Deluxe...<br>The aircon is an automatic aircon. From reviews I read, it seems to provide a good flow of cool air to the whole cabin, since the temperature sensors are all over the car.<br><br>The audio is an in-dash CD/mp3 player... no changer though. Yes, there are 4 disc brakes.<br><br>The Malaysian cars come with traction control, which I don't think is available here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> something not usually seen in this level of car... and yah, it's not like Toyota's giving a discount for S'poreans (still damn ex ah!) M'sian cars are so expensive bcoz of high import duties levied on foreign-made cars... to protect their own car manufacturers...<br>I think the M'sian 1.8l Altis costs SGD 54,000... about there, so still cheaper than S'pore.<br>Actually the 1.6l version is available overseas as well. This Altis is also sold in the US.<br><br>I've test-driven and ordered the 1.8l one liao... $80+k for a 1.8 car is a good deal, 136PS/ 171 Nm of torque for such a light car is cool as well though think most pple would be fine with the 1.6l....<br><br>Alas... no manual trans! Will miss my manual car...<br>Does anyone agree with me that the SEs at BM in Leng Kee do not provide good service?<br><br>Anyways the engine is a chain-cam, which is more reliable than the standard timing belt. 90% of engine  components come from Japan though I believe the engine is made in China. The auto trans is made in Japan, the steel comes from Japan and the rest are assembled in Thailand.<br><br>Heh the Camry's replacement is made in Thailand as well. If the quality is there and the price is so much cheaper, why not?</div>
