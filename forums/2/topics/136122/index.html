Kind of strange being flash at, so same thing open mind! After found out I was only using the parking light (1 click on the light). Need to do 2 click for the full head light. Actually I found my friend doing the same thing too when he got his new car, anyone else have this kind of experiences?</div>

Got 1 fine day kanna piss off by 5 different Merz for a various kind of item. The worse 1 is he purposely slow down (~70kph) just before a up-slope (hogging in lane 1 after squeezing into the lane!!!), then climb up suddenly leaving my Kelisa in the dust. AHole then filter all the way left and disappear.</div>
