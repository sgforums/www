Considerin rally is unpredictable.</div></blockquote>well it also has to be in a form of a time trial on the rally course and an actual wheel to wheel race on the circuit. i think Kimi should win, considering he does motoX bikes as a hobby, so he knows rough terrain.<br><br>Petter Solberg in my opinion is less naturally talented than Kimi to begin with, and probably not used to going flat out on a circuit, esp if he doesn't have a co-driver next to him for the circuit race against Kimi.<br><br>Also u need to consider what they do the circuit race in. If they're both driving formula cars, then Kimi defo has the upper hand because its easier to step down from a open wheeled single seater to a tin top than from a tin top up to a open wheeled racer. Open wheeled racers are much more demanding and tricky to drive, and demands a lot of specialist knowledge, such as the braking points due to the period between when downforce is lost due to retardation in speed and sufficient mechanical grip taking over etc.<br><br>So Kimi should definately win Solberg. Now if it were against Seb Loeb, it might be much closer, although its very common knowledge that drivers who started in go karts and continued in open wheel single seater formula racers have the advantage over drivers who came up in tin tops.</div>

Any circuit racer can drift pretty good. I think Solberg will lose outright. Seriously, u guys should compare Seb Loeb to Kimi. Seb Loeb seem more of a champ down to pure natural talent. He also drove in Le Mans so he's got circuit experience and those LM prototype 1 (LMP1) cars he drove are actually very similiar to formula 1 cars in terms of downforce utilization.</div>
