Personally I think they are the worst drivers in Singapore. As a road user, how often have u seen taxi drivers stopping abruptly in front of u, suddenly cutting into your lane just because there is somebody flagging for a taxi, causing u to slam hard on your brakes to avoid a collision behind. Purposely accelerating hard or driving very closely to the vehicle in front to prevent u from filtering in, flash high beams or show u the finger when they drive by, etc are just some of their problematic attitude.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style='font-size: 10pt; color: black; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Personally, I think they love people to crash into their rear. So they don’t give a damn whether they make sudden turns or sudden stops. Speaking of lost income, they are more than happy to file claims against your insurance. Adding in their lost of income and repair costs, which will usually come up to a huge sum of money. While they stay at home and happily shake their legs when they send in their vehicles in for repair. Not only are they endangering the lives of other road users especially motorcyclists, they are a pest to other road users as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style='font-size: 10pt; color: black; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I understand they have a family to feed, abide increasing rental and fuel costs, but that does not give them a reason to drive so recklessly. We all work for a living and dealing with stress are part and parcel of life. I just hope that taxi companies can really take serious action against those errant taxi drivers who think they are the kings of the road. I’m one of those road user pissed off by most attitude problematic taxi drivers too but nevertheless, ran into some pretty good ones too</span></p>

              <p>Taxi drivers have no choice either. They need to do everything within their mean to get passangers. Passengers = Revenue.</p>
              <p>As much as I wish to empathize with them, that does not mean they can drive without due consideration to other road users. Safety, be it theirs or others, should be everyone's top priority.</p>

              <p>I actually got a very BAD experience with this taxi driver. I won't say much, but all I can say is, I won't be surprised if he got into an accident, but he better don't cause I'm his passenger.</p>
              <p>There was a point of time where he had to change lanes just to prevent hitting the car infront when he braking, this shows that he was speeding. It was on the expressway btw.</p>
              <p>Another one was when he made a U-turn at the lane opposite of Suntec's convention centre. He went in at a speed of nearly 50 KM/H and I swear I was scared shit. He didn't even stopped to check for traffic, he just went in assuming that there was no car..</p>
