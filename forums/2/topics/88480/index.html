I presume you were watching the night sprints? Singapore cars are definitely limited from reaching their full potential becos of our cost and our laws. Going fast in a straight line with, in a way, a rolling start will not take too much skill or effort, IMHO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Evo  8 GSR (Malaysian Registered) Vs LS430 @ Plaza Toll Meleka to Butterworth. Guess who won?<br><br>Evo was ahead till about 200km/hr but still within sharp visual range (My Dad was driving)  from the LS though, .....after that the barge just reeled it in. Evo still able to tail to about 230km/hr.....past that gradually lost from view. At 260km/hr totally lost from sight. Actually it was never as far as butterworth, it was lost long before that....maybe 10 km from the tol station. BTW, Evo was empty while the barge had four onboard.<br><br>IMHO the barge (Ls430) looks like a slug on our local roads but do watch out for the uncle chais....as in the BMW 745, Lexus LS430 and Merc S430 and above.....can seriously reel an Evo or Sti in once above 200 km/hr. This is in purely standard configerations.....slap in a supercharger and it is in a totally different class....but very unfair comparision I know.....each of these cars cost double or more than an Evo8.<br><br>The old adage is true....there is no substitute for displacement.</div>

The UK spec FQ340 more than gives the M3 a run for its $$$. and the best part is, its 7000 pounds cheaper!</div>
