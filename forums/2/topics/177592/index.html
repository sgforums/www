Anyway I had up to 6th bid before I got back my booking fee. I had rejected all the offer of topping up my COE for the previous 3 failed bids.<br><br>Guess it's logical that the waiting time will be long if the demand is high. But then even when the demand is not high, your dealer may bid skyrocket high bid amount for you and you still end up will not get your COE till the last bid.<br><br>But I feel that the bid amount submitted by your dealer is "kelong" and I think it's really unfair that as an owner of a new car, we have no say on the bid amount. Somemore your dealer is using your IC number to bid for you. May be it's the system that is at fault? Or may be somebody is making use of the loophole of the system to manipulate the COE figures?<br><br>The only rule of this COE game is: Do not bow to the pressure from your SE/dealer to top up for a open cat COE. If you have the time to wait for your COE, it's better to wait. Then you won't "lugi" on your $ by paying COE that cost you more now but getting it lesser at the end of 10 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For every COE that the dealer bid, they have to put <strong>10k</strong> deposit with you-know-who. Hence,  the dealer will usually get the COE only when the car is avaliable or coming in very soon. Otherwise, all their money will be stuck with You-know-who !!!<br><br>Unfortunately, COE bidding in not as easy as we like to think. Even though the system allows for us to bid our own COE, but as most people are not able to come up with 10k cash for the bidding deposit, the dealers will end up bidding instead.<br><br>Unless a significant group of buyers bid for their own COE and demand for dealers to sell car without COE, otherwise this trend will continue.<br><br>How many people do you know of that can come-up with $10k for COE bidding plus a few more $K for car deposit ?<br></div>

What color ?</div></blockquote>Yup, it's the 230JM, twilight grey (which the SE said is a new colour).. btw, i booked the pre-facelift version, cos i don't think the new facelift is worth the 4k extra... the only diff between the two are the 2 big chrome exhausts, headlamps, and LED backlights for the facelift version. Oh, the key also different. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
