( heard from a friend with an EVO8 that whether or no he drives hard, does not really make a BIG difference to FC )<br><br>Comfort would be not bad but of course compare to heavy cars like camry and cefiros, the rally cars will be slightly louder and more uncomfortable?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Resale value is a drastic drop as pple who drive these kind of car would prob have given it a good drive before deciding to sell.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jiayong, let me clarify something...<br><br>Driving the E8 hard makes a HUGE difference in terms of fuel consumption. If your friend claims that his FC remains the same, his driving style is definitely on the hard revving sort. If you keep it below 3,000rpm, which is kinda nuts (but lets say you do), and you run stock boost, you will probably run 400-450km on the 55 litre tank.<br><br>My suggestion: check with your insurance company.

The STi (price from this forum) is 136.5K and is much cheaper comparing to the ones from PI since it could cost near to 145K. However the specifications are different. But i think in normal driving here, it will not make much of a different.<br><br>Using a 10 years depreciation calculation and forget about getting back the scrap value for a MR (155/10) = 15.5K.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jiayong, sorry, am not too sure about the weight of the STi. All I know is that the version at Borneo Motors is the Euro version which pumps out 260bhp. Saw a potential Spec C (280bhp) yesterday at Conrad hotel... now thats what the Evo 8 MR is going up against. Anyway, this is the first time that i heard having higher power/weight ratio is not ideal!!! I know of people making their E8s go on a lean diet to improve the ratio! No matter what car, FC will vary depending on your driving style.<br><br>Think if you want to improve your driving, learn from the experts by going for defensive driving courses. Sliding the car around is no big deal - its when you pushed the car over the limit... how you counter such situations is where such courses will help. E8 is a very clever car with immense potential. To me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  , the E8 is definitely has better "wow" factor compared to STi. Eg, STi will not get as much looks as you are driving out of Zouk... hahaha... shallow me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

All I know is that the version at Borneo Motors is the Euro version which pumps out 260bhp. Saw a potential Spec C (280bhp) yesterday at Conrad hotel... now thats what the Evo 8 MR is going up against. Anyway, this is the first time that i heard having higher power/weight ratio is not ideal!!! I know of people making their E8s go on a lean diet to improve the ratio! No matter what car, FC will vary depending on your driving style.<br><br>Think if you want to improve your driving, learn from the experts by going for defensive driving courses. Sliding the car around is no big deal - its when you pushed the car over the limit... how you counter such situations is where such courses will help. E8 is a very clever car with immense potential. To me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  , the E8 is definitely has better "wow" factor compared to STi.
