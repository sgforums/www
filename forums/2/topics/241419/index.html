            <div class='col-md body'>The camera always flashes at your back... that's how the sensors work... only after they sensed that you have beaten the red light will they flash at you so there's no way they can anticipate that you will beat the red light and flash from the front....<br><br>Anyway, i think i know which red light camera you are talking about... you are heading towards upper thomson road right? I've seen that camera activated twice before (on other cars lah... haha not mine)... The problem with that junction is that it is a super small junction and the amber-to-red transition time is very very short... so when you thought it was still amber, it might have been red to the sensors already....<br><br>Wait for the letter lor... are you sure there was no car behind you? maybe it was that car who got caught? Anyway, if you really get the letter, i think the fine is about $200 and a 12 points demerit leh... hope you're not a p-plate driver... My frens also said that if you want to argue your case, you will have to pay more to request them to show you the photo...</div>
