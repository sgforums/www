The car was totally trouble free inspite of the constant high speeds, and with 3 people and their assorted vacation luggage. That, I would feel, is a pretty good showing for a car. so yup, ford cars, i like.</div></blockquote>I have heard that Ford's engine are pretty good too.  However, the extra cash that I have to come out with if something major happens to the engine kinda turn me off.  Honda's servicing is relatively cheaper (from the bills that my dad got for servicing his Accord).  Anyway, greatly appreciate your feedback!  Cheers!!</div>
