Too bad I didn't do sufficient homework.<br>The fella told me that there is very little value for the chasis of my 8 years old Mitsubishi. I did try to bargain but he say if pay me chasis he can't earn much.<br>But he didn;t charge me any % on the papervalue. He just makan my chasis value, which I found out is at least $1,000. But C&amp;C gave me $500 off for same make trade in. So I think I lost abt $500+/-.<br>And I told him that I am removing the THULE roof racks, bull bars and CD changer. He said OK and marked on the papers no such items on my car.<br>The SE came over to help me specify that the road tax balance must give back to me.<br><br>REally thanks for the tip on the receipt upon the handover. Good to cover myself. If you can recall any other tips, please feel free to share.<br>Thanks a million!</div>
