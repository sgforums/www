But the moment you meet some one new, you are bombarding him with forceful questions like "Hey, tell me what you have modded mann" "whats under your bonnet mann"<br><br>Then when u asked the Vios what has he done, i know u are harmless and just wanted to find out..but can u pls phrase your questions properly next time? The impression you gave him was that he spent so much effort on cosmetics and done nothing to performance and that he is stupid and useless.<br><br>Seriously, u have scared more than half my friends away.
