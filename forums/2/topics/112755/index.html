            <div class='col-md body'>I have a big dilemma now<br><br>I am eyeing a brand new Mazda Premacy and was offered $71k.<br>My current car is a June 2001 Mazda 323 1.6 Manual and initially I had only wanted to change out in June 2005. My OMV is $15k, COE $26k, current paper value $35k. I am being offered $39k for my current car for trade-in. My car is in excellent condition and I have not had any problems at all.<br><br>Should I wait till June 2006, when my paper value is about $32k + a few $k for the body or should I make the change now.<br><br>Anybody got a good advice whether I should be patient or I should commit now.<br><br>Need help as I need to commit on the new car b4 the next COE bidding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hv u decided on new car, my advice is to keep until next yrs. firstly, u will lower the outstanding amount and it only cost you 2.6k depreciation for driving your car 1 full year. New premacy will be out by then, do not know the advantage of the new car, my guess is it will be improve.</div>

I am not sure of the ride quality and if this car is under power (2.0 model). The price is in between those that u have in mind. Make a wise decision yourself, don't buy and regret later.</div>
