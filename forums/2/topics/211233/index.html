            <div class='col-md body'>I apologize if I have offended anyone as it is just my personal opinion on American cars.American cars have a large displacement but very little output wuich adds nothing but weight to the car.i DUN LIKE THEIR ENGINEERING cause they could have squeezed out so much more HP from the engine.The thing which I salute the Amerians for is the interior design of their cars.To quot an example, those muscle cars of the 1960s had lots of displacement but the output was considered low for that kind of displacment.On the other hand however, the design of the interior e.g gauges, trim, upholstry is the best one can find.<br><br>These are my personal views on cars please do not be offended.

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, first things first.  The number of cylinders in an enigne is irrelevant.  As long as each combustion stroke turns the crankshaft through and equal degree of rotation, separate from what is being driven by the strokes of the other cylinders, you're fine.  For example, the power stroke of each cylinder in a 4-cylinder turns the crankshaft through 90 degrees, and because they don't overlap, the four 90-degree turns add up to a full 360-degree rotation.<br><br>Things go out of whack when this smooth delivery over the 360 degrees is upset.  Try pulling out one spark plug lead when the engine is running and it immediately becomes obvious how the engine's vibration increases, because the power is only being delivered through 270 degrees, throwing things out of balance.<br><br>In the case of a 5-cylinder engine, as long as each cylinder delivers power through separate turns of 72 degrees, you're fine.<br><br>Now with this displacement-on-demand approach, if five out of 16 cylinders suddenly stop firing, that's 112.5 degrees of rotation where the crankshaft isn't being powered, and that engine's going to run rough as hell.  It places uneven loads on the crankshaft bearings, which cannot be good for the life of the engine.<br><br>For the second point, I'm not too impressed with American car engineering at all.  They all seem to take the Tim the Toolman approach to things - if you want a car to go faster, simply whack a bigger engine in it.  They don't seem to take the time to squeeze more power out of each CC or improve handling.  it's just ham-fisted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the best mass produced car in handling is ford le.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">OK, first things first.  The number of cylinders in an enigne is irrelevant.  As long as each combustion stroke turns the crankshaft through and equal degree of rotation, separate from what is being driven by the strokes of the other cylinders, you're fine.  For example, the power stroke of each cylinder in a 4-cylinder turns the crankshaft through 90 degrees, and because they don't overlap, the four 90-degree turns add up to a full 360-degree rotation.<br><br>Things go out of whack when this smooth delivery over the 360 degrees is upset.  Try pulling out one spark plug lead when the engine is running and it immediately becomes obvious how the engine's vibration increases, because the power is only being delivered through 270 degrees, throwing things out of balance.<br><br>In the case of a 5-cylinder engine, as long as each cylinder delivers power through separate turns of 72 degrees, you're fine.<br><br>Now with this displacement-on-demand approach, if five out of 16 cylinders suddenly stop firing, that's 112.5 degrees of rotation where the crankshaft isn't being powered, and that engine's going to run rough as hell.  It places uneven loads on the crankshaft bearings, which cannot be good for the life of the engine.<br><br>For the second point, I'm not too impressed with American car engineering at all.  They all seem to take the Tim the Toolman approach to things - if you want a car to go faster, simply whack a bigger engine in it.  They don't seem to take the time to squeeze more power out of each CC or improve handling.  it's just ham-fisted.</div></blockquote></div>

And kudos to the americans for having the guts to build it. no doubt they handle like crap, but at least they dared to make it.<br><br>of course in today's world where power is easily gotten, the american's automotive philosophy is no longer adequate, especially if their brands are to survive.</div>
