As for heritage, the integra series has none. the car is just an idoltry object for those of u who love revving an engine to death. An ITR is nice i agree... but its def no where on par with the MCS. maybe in another 10 years? provided the MCS doesn't get even better? </div></blockquote>oh, like YOU have seen the topfuel DC5 at work? face it man, notwithstanding the fact that the 2 cars have near power/ weight, u put a FR car on a track vs a FF car and u expect the DC5 to beat the S2k? the S2k also has a better 50:50 weight distribution. u should know that since u claim to be go carting so much.<br><br>s2k engine is amazing yes. but go look at the torque/power graphs of both the DC5 and the S2k. the i-vtec was there for a reason to make power swap between the hi-lo lobes more linear, ie smoother. that was something that the S2k nor any vtec engine was able to achieve formerly. amazing in their own way i guess.<br><br>nobody's arguing with u which car has a richer heritage. the very fact that honda was able to make such improvements in such a short frame of time compared to the mini justifies my previous post. given 10 more years, honda would have achieved alot more compared to where the MCS would be hovering then.</div>
