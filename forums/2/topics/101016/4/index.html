F1 racing very different from street cars..and besides...the fundings for F1 is way above what the normal man on the road can afford.<br><br>oh well then...then i wouldnt have much to talk to u about...And anyway...are u sure this forum is suitable for u? i have been looking thru it...it looks quite a sad case...</div></blockquote>if u dun care how its casted, then when u have a turbo blow up on u, u won't know why it happened, and what sort of casted parts you should use then. And motorsports are all one big category. what applies to Formula can be scaled down to apply to street cars. If u think technology can be thus seperated, then I doubt if you truely understand the application of technology. Where do you think lightweight applications in aluminium alloys, carbon fibre and fibre glass in your nice moddified cars come from? Formula 1. Sequential boxes? F1. Application of aerodynamics? F1. Racing compounds in tyres? F1. Many more applications all developed in F1 and made their way to street tuning today. Having pratical workshop only goes so far if u don't care about the fundamental theories behind everything.<br><br>As for this forums being a sad case or not, well what I can say is that people here are more from everyday walks of life, not everyone can understand the specific technical terms and such. Maybe u should go to the TCC forums or somewhere like that to flaunt your stuff if u find this place not to your liking. Not everyone gets to hang out around workshops from a young age. some of them virtually know nothing about cars and only started off knowing n liking cars when they are much older than you are. Of course if u just wanna show-up lots of ppl, then congrats u may have succeeded.</div>
