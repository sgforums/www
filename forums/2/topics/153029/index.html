            <div class='col-md body'>my friend also looking for a new car. I just got mine without much knowledge, so got a rio(like the design and price). So after getting it, got some thoughts about it. The max torque say at 4700rpm. does this mean that the car is most efficient at 4700rpm(efficient as in least waste of energy)? So am i rite to say a car with low max torque(like jazz at 2700rpm) is more fc friendly than a car with higher max torque rpm? then what about power?</div>

This fella claim that if you baby the engine, the piston ring won't seal completely and you will have poorer performance/FC and more leaks.<br><br>Theoretically, it makes some sense, but not sure if its proven. </div></blockquote>think i've come across a similar theory awhile ago. can't say i really buy it.<br><br>i particularly believe in wat i personally call "progressive conditioning". unless u are running in a race engine, the methodology to follow should fall within the "safe" side of conventional run in techniques. subjecting the car to various throttle loads, initially keeping rpms below 3k and gradually raising the bar as it proceeds to hit the next oil change. while not fool proof, this does enable the piston rings and bearings to get accustomed to various tolerances before being subjected to regular "abuse".<br><br>its not like u can drive like a wuss at one point b4 the prodigal 1k servicing and ram ur engine sky high the next and expect the rings and bearings to sit in instantaneously ya know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For normal 1.6 cars<br><br>4th gear @ 3k rpm is normally around 80km/h<br><br>5th gear @ 3k rpm is around 100km/h<br><br>For 2.0 and above<br><br>4th gear @ 3k is around 90 and above<br><br>5th gear @ 3k is around 110 and above<br><br>But this really depends on the horsepower and throttle level.<br><br>As for run-in  during the first 1K before servicing.. try to maintain around 2.5k to 3 k rpm for all the gears not juzz only to smooth run the engine, its oso to save your life. Coz during the first servicing, they will oso help you to tighten some of the screws so its better to go slow first if u dun really wanna see your trye running faster than your car. A new engine is juzz like you juzz started to light your ciggie, need to inhale a bit first before u continure for a deep in hale to smoke.<br><br>After your first servicing, den its time to slowly build up the rpm, go to 3.5 den 4 den 4.5 and so on. It is oso to let your engine get accustom to the power lvl .Dun go for a full blow immediately after your first servicing if u wanna have a longer engine life. There are some idiots i kno who juzz ramp all the way and less den 1 yr problems comes out for eg. How come the FC like increase.  Engine like dying for more power etc etc...<br><br>So far i have tried on my lancer and its all ok.. Highest reach is 180km/h on 5th gear @ 5.5k rpm and its working fine. Take your time to build up the cars stamina.. dun b too hasty about it.  I waited till 10K service den go for the 180. after the first servicing, i only go to 120km/h.<br><br>Have fun running in the engine of your car<br><br>Cheers</div>
