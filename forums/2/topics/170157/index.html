            <div class='col-md body'>TP already sent out warning that there will be operation island wide to catch drunk drivers during this festive seaon. so my advice to young and old punks is that dont push you luck too far.<br><br>If you drink and mati mati want to drive, dont be how lian and offer to send friends (especially chicks) home, drive home by yourself. If you kenna caught, all you friends will say is that I am sorry. but for you, you will get your license suspended, or even jailed. Worst is you tried to drive without license.<br><br>Be smart, get someone to drive, or park your car at carparks that allow overnight parking.<br><br>As for passenger, if the driver is drunk, please dont get into the car.<br><br>have a blessed holiday season!!</div>
