            <div class='col-md body'>Hi narz... what i know is that your mthly payment will depend largely on your downpayment and how many yrs loan you are comfortable with. Even if you do not want to put any downpayment also can but u still have to pay for the drive off price.<br><br>I agree its an affordable car but many ppl give it the thumbs down cos its a Korean car. If you have the time maybe you shld go down to the showroom and have a look. Once u sit inside maybe you will like it like i do..<br><br>regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi narz...as for me i had done my sums so most probably i would be able to "rear" it by nxt year. Hopefully after Jan. I had went down to the showroom twice ardy but not yet test drive. I agree with what u had mention. Many ppl will said that this car is not worth buying. But maybe i am quite hard-headed so i would be following what i myself want instead of what others had in mind.<br>So if i made a wrong choice i have only myself to blame. If you can afford around 1k per mth you still have many other choice so i would encourage you to look around.</div>
