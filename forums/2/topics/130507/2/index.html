            <div class='col-md body'>the point the thread starter is making is while he doesn't mind people modifying their cars to increase performance, it's actually a con job to modify a car and label it as another higher performance car, which it isn't. if you can't f.ucking afford a ferrari, don't go &amp; f.ucking label your car as such...same with branded goods...if it's not louis vuitton, don't go &amp; simply paste lv stickers all over your bags...why is singapore government cracking down on pirated stuff? same reasoning...<br><br>for all you stupid c.unts who think it's ok to put a ferrari logo on a mitsubishi lancer just because you did it with your own money, go stuff a police nightstick up your arses..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
