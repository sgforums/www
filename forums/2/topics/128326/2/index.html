What i would do is make them pull over by turning on my hazard lights or simply aim my middle finger at them, sort things out the violent way if they have the guts to. I get very violent when got provoked at road, especially when they are in the wrong. Some of you will understand, that urge to pin that fellowÂ’s neck on the lamp post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Woah.. careful bro... I understand wad u mean but TP very serious abt road rage now... That time i kena challenged by a freako in his new Honda Accord along Clementi Ave 6, Was driving my dad's Camry with whole family. I horned at him cuz he purposely cut into my lane and in a very dangerous manner.. I almost kissed his butt but thank God my rxn was fast so nth happened... Then he purposely horned me back and kept staying beside me, pointed at me and stared... Challenging me... ... I was so pissed that at the moment i wanted to push him to the side wall and cause his car to flip. But i din cuz i noe it was wrong. Thank God that i kept my cool!! He tried to follow me from behind after i shot past him(haha, Camry 2.0 more powerful than his Accord 2.4), then at the split road, one heading towards Bt Batok and the other PIE(Changi), i suddenly took a swerve and he bo pian got to head into Bt Batok. Managed to throw him off... Whew.. Scary Experience...</div>
