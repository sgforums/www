            <div class='col-md body'>Recently a girl wrote to the Straits Times, that she had harrowing experiences riding pillion on a motorcycle. She wrote that car drivers just pass so close to her that if she were to stick out her heel, she could touch the cars. She also said that women drivers were increasingly also among them.<br><br>While on women drivers, I like to relate my curious experiences with them.<br>I have been bullied of my lane by lady drivers on 3 occasions. On all these instances, they came from behind, on my right and drift left, forcing me to either speed up or drop back. I could not be in their blind spot I as was ahead of them when they move up to me. Their actions were deliberate. As a biker and a driver, I let these incidents pass, as one of those things on Singapore roads.<br><br>The curiousity, is the fact that 1 was driving a SUV, but the other 2 were driving compact cars. One was a Nissan March, I can't remember the make of the other compact car.<br>I have been bullied before, but by a 10 tonne tipper, who was trying to get to the left lane as he need to turn off up ahead. That is not unusual.<br>Surprisingly, I have  never been bullied by drivers of luxury cars like Merc or Lexus.<br>But lady drivers in compact cars?<br><br>The lady drivers were of the late 20 or 30 age group. Alone in their cars.<br>I was begining to profile them as frustrated, yuppies who can't quite afford a sedan. But then it might just be co-incidents.<br><br>Never the less, I ride/drive defensively, never assuming the teacher type driving a Daihatsu or Suzuki would be safe driver.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I leave NO ONE assumed, on our roads.<br><br>First off, always spot others before they make an offensive move on you. When you have spotted any of these road-hags, anticipate what they might do, and leave no room for them to get into your blind spots.<br><br>Second, pick up your pace, leaving them behind to make whatever move they want. If they are faster than you, eg. a Porche or Ferrari, get outta their way. Or, just keep your right of way, they won't risk damaging their exotic machine by getting too close to you.<br><br>Third, if ever you find yourself being squeezed out of your lane, try and speed away safely if possible. Otherwise, honk them. Wake them up.  Give her the finger if you must.<br><br>I hate women drivers like these that you described. They always make STUPID moves on the roads, and risk themselves and others as well. Thinking they are or wanna be on par with men on the road. They should get real; I believe their is no such thing as men driving better or women driving better. It's just common sense, patience, courtesy, and good judgement behind the wheel. Put just EGO behind a wheel, and their'd soon be trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bullies come in all shapes and sizes...irregardless of sex, race or age. What i would do is make them pull over by turning on my hazard lights or simply aim my middle finger at them, sort things out the violent way if they have the guts to. I get very violent when got provoked at road, especially when they are in the wrong.

At least the flash will stun her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>These reminds mine of a Vios driver (needless to say, female). I was exiting TPE (toward changi dir) at the exit to Tampines ave 10. There is this 3 lane just after exit before turn right to tampines ave 10. The angle that the 3 lane approaches the ave 10 is quite acute, so sometimes the left most car need to do a very wide turn.<br><br>This gal shot directly in and I, in the middle lane have to do a little wide to let the 1 on the right to squeeze through. I think she got mad for that wide turn I did, like want to close in on me during the straight road. Not signal for intention to go to the right, anyway I slow down. She slow down also??? I speed up, she speed up??? Then I horn, she wind down window and show her hand...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>By chance we stop side by side at the next red light and I asked her what is bothering her.

But because all the cars moving off at the same time, and first car somemore, so reaches the bend at the same time. Anyway, the lanes have turn in markers. I am just following them. But the Vios is really dashing straight for the bend. I always travelled by that road, so I know roughly how wide I should bend. But I can't say the same for the "lady".<br><br>But her act of closing in on me during the straight up was somewhat deep for me. I seriously thought she is trying to cut into my lane and even slow down. Then she also slow down, I really don't understand the logic here? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i think its not juz ladies... Even guys do that... Actually, for those who're slow drivers, pls keep to the left. The extreme right lane is for thosewho travel at a higher speed. I've seen ppl who juz travel 80km/h on AYE extreme right lane... And they juz dun bother to filter in even when some cars flash their lights or follow closely. Such actions actually will cause road accidents and its very inconsiderate for the "slow" ones to do so...<br><br>Also, sometimes i see some Schumacher wannabes on the highway. They overtake cars like no one's business. I juz wanna appeal to everyone to be very careful. Cuz for us guys we can handle such takeovers and calmly let u do so. But ladies may not be able to do so and accidents can happen. PLs be very careful ppl... TC and God bless!</div>
