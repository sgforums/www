Saftey first!<br></div></blockquote>Hmm...that's a good point.I was thinking of also merging the Shoulder Lane back to Lane 4 for say,a few car lengths,to allow breakdown.However this could introduce even more bottlenecks at the merging area when drivers want to move back to lane 4.Maybe the car lengths can be marked as BreakDown Zone but this is not feasible.<br><br>What about allowing road shoulder lane usage for bottleneck area?This is a short term cheap method instead of the costly lane-widening option.To allow emergency viehicles,the lane 1 of of the bottlenecked area(along with the SH Lane usage) can also be marked as emergency lane too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think when the KPE fully opens (meaning the full 12km from ECP to TPE) the problem should get better as there will be an alternative route for people staying in the North-East to use.<br><br>But if there are still jams in the CTE even after KPE fully opens, i think the govt must think an "out of the box" idea that is never used in other parts of the world. Maybe we could build double deck CTE, with the lower deck being the orginal CTE and a new upper deck to handle almost double capacity. I went to Tokyo in june and saw many bridges where some of which is double deck bridge. But it will be very costly to build and there are space contrains, for example, the CTE tunnel.<br><br>Maybe the govt could build another expressway that links up the same area as the current CTE so as to divert some traffic away from the main CTE. The problem is, where do we find space? Even if the expressway is fully underground, some buildings will have to be torn down to make way for consruction. Historical buildings maybe lost forever. Landlords will not be supportive about this idea.<br><br>If nothing useful is done, we will end up like cities such as New York, Tokyo and London where gridlock is an everyday issue.</div>

Height limit 2m or 2.5m (no heavy vehicles allowed!) the height limit also helps to save money as they wont need to build such a "tall" underground tunnel.<br><br>but then there are still problems to the double deck idea.<br><br>expressway is like a bottel of mineral water. Imagine the hole at the top of the bottel of water is the expressway exit/entrance. normally the hole abt 20cent coin size. u turn the bottle upside down all the water come out in less than a min. but our current problem is that our "hole(entrances exits)" on our "bottle(expressway)" is too small/slow - it simply cannot clear the traffic leaving and entering the expressway fast enough. so imagine the bottle has a hole the size of this circle -&gt; O &lt;- instead of a 20cent coin size, the water will drip out one drop by one drop or maybe even slower.. it might take half a day for all the water to flow out.<br><br>incresing the size of the bottle without doing anything to the hole will not solve the problem. traffic jams on expressways are because people cannot clear the expressway fast enough, and of course, pple driving too slowly..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ban slow moving vehicle like bus,lorries, etc from using the expressway, which is supposed to be express, and encourage them to use the normal city road instead. In this case,  the number of traffic traveling will be so much lesser and the average speed will be so much faster as the most left lane will also be traveling at a faster speed instead of their usual 50-70kmh.<br><br>good suggestions? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Ref: LTA/P&amp;P/F20.016.000/7938/sl<br><br>PUBLIC FEEDBACK ON ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING (ERP)<br>FEEDBACK NUMBER: 507946<br><br>We refer to your email of 23 August 2007.<br><br>Please allow us to explain that we do not rely on ERP alone to relieve<br>traffic congestion. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) adopt an integrated<br>package of measures which includes traffic engineering such as road<br>widening and modifying traffic schemes.<br><br>However, measures like road widening alone are not sustainable solutions.<br>Over time, more traffic is attracted onto the widened road and it becomes<br>congested again. This is what happened on the Central Expressway (CTE) and<br>the East Coast Parkway (ECP). For example, LTA widened the northbound CTE<br>by one lane between the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1<br>in 2002 to improve traffic speed. But within six months, congestion built<br>up again.<br><br>Similarly, LTA added one lane to the eastbound ECP in February 2007 between<br>Marina South and Fort Road and within two months, the congestion returned<br>as more people use these roads to take advantage of the improved speeds.<br><br>We would like to share with you that roads are designed to provide<br>operation efficiency, safety, comfort and convenience to the motorists. In<br>order to achieve this, the design of roads will have to comply with the<br>road geometric requirements. This is a set of road design criteria, as well<br>as the professional application of these requirements to suit the<br>topography and site constraints. The design of the CTE alignments is well<br>within these geometric requirements.<br><br>Due to land constraints, it is not always possible to have exit slip roads<br>linking to all the roads in each direction. Hence, traffic lights near to<br>the expressway exits may be necessary to distribute the outgoing traffic to<br>different roads.<br><br>Our traffic light system is adaptive to traffic flows, i.e. the appropriate<br>amount of green time given to each direction of the junction/ signalised<br>intersection is based on the traffic demand of that direction. This means<br>that if the traffic flow on the direction exiting from the expressway is<br>heavier, more green time will be given.<br><br>We have forwarded your feedback on road hogging to the Traffic Police (TP).<br>Their patrol officers will monitor the situation and take relevant<br>enforcement action against road hoggers where appropriate. TP will include<br>your feedback in their road safety public education efforts.<br><br>We thank you for writing.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Celine Quek (Ms)<br>Assistant Manager<br>Community Engagement &amp; Feedback</div>
