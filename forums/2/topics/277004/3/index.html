            <div class='col-md body'>My reply to them before this reply:<br><br>Hi, thank you for your response. I can understand that road widening is not a sustainable solution.<br><br>However, taking traffic flow as water flow, one can understand that it is not that much the size of the expressway(river) that matters, it's how fast the traffic(water) can get through it and how smoothly. In the case of rivers, they are connected to the endless sea and thus usually have no problems with moving the huge amount of water along as the exit is always "clear". In the case of severe weather, the rivers may flood its banks but this is not a daily occurence and can be taken as an example of "accidents". Accidents along the expressway will no doubt bring traffic to a halt and there is even less the LTA can do about that.<br><br>However, peak period traffic jams are a daily occurence and CAN be minimised.<br><br>The main problem would be bottlenecks and traffic lights.<br><br>As you have said, our traffic light systems are adaptive based on demand - which is gathered by sensors installed underneath the roads. However, these measures cannot cope with peak hour traffic jams. Firstly, junctions like the one at thomson road that is connected to the thomson exit of PIE(Changi) only have sensors to detect the first car, the sensors cannot tell if the cars leaving the expressway have become jammed all the way to the left most lane of the expressway in such a way that the speed of cars on the left most lane of PIE(Changi) drops to ZERO km/h as it is merely a line of cars waiting for the lights to turn green.<br><br>Perhaps installing additional sensors further down from the traffic light to detect the 10th car or even the 15th car etc. would help the traffic light algorithm detect extremely heavy demand. Also, another detector loop near the expressway decelerating lane to detect the speed of vehicles leaving the expressway would help as well. having a speed reading of below 10km/h should trigger a green light and hold it until the speed goes back up to 40 or 50km/h.<br><br>However, no matter what measures are in place to improve the traffic light situation, the fact remains that at a traffic light (signalised) junction, somebody has to stop to allow somebody else to go. One way or another, some traffic has to come to a stop. Which is why I have suggested that the LTA upgrade certain junctions like the one mentioned above to have an underpass so that cars can flow out of the expressway without having to stop at the lights so near to the expressway. However, I also understand that there could be site constraints to allow the construction of this and as such, perhaps the LTA could explore the possibility of having 2m or 2.5m high underpasses where 4.5m high underpasses are not feasible. This way, Cars, Light Goods Vehicles, and Taxis would be allowed to flow smoothly and only heavy vehicles or tall vehicles would need to stop at the light. I believe this is feasible as the peak hour traffic mainly consists of cars, LGVs, and taxis anyway. On a sidenote, this will also improve taxis as a choice of public transport during rush hour if the route goes through one of these underpasses. Of course, the LTA would still have to do a feasibility study become building such low underpasses.<br><br>Secondly, the LTA did not address another problem - bottlenecks. There is one location that is a case-in-point waiting to be solved - the CTE(both directions) to PIE(Changi). Everyday, the traffic on the two sliproads from the two CTEs leading to PIE(Changi) slow down to below 10km/h even as the expressway itself is smooth-flowing. I have already sent feedback regarding this matter several months back and to this date, nothing has been done about it. I have asked fellow drivers about their thoughts on this location and everyone I spoke to agrees with me. Due to site constraints, I don't think the LTA can widen either sliproad to become a 2 lane sliproad and that is thus not feasible. However, the LTA can make simple changes to the merging area and the area where the sliproad enters the PIE but I cannot understand why the LTA has to this date done NOTHING about this.<br><br>Firstly, the two sliproads from the two CTEs are drawn as merging lanes when they meet. However, NOBODY follows the markings. Instead, everyone squeezes out and drive out as though it was a two lane road. This is not about enforcement, this is about road design. I would like to take an example to illustrate my point. A recently competed entrance to the SLE(TPE) at Woodlands Ave 12 also has a merging lane before it enters the expressway. However, vehicles here are FORCED to obey the markings as the road itself and the KERB acts as a FUNNEL, it gets smaller and smaller such that the originally two lane road, becomes only wide enough for vehicles to pass in a single file (one lane). This is accompanied by the merging lane markings. Traffic here is heavy but SMOOTH everytime as there is only one lane of traffic joining the expressway and a lone accelerating lane.<br><br>This has to be applied to the CTE to PIE(Changi) case. The current merging arrows are useless as everyone can see that the single lane is actually big enough to fit two cars side-by-side and in a rush to be in front, everyone would just squeeze beside each other to get to the PIE first. This is not only an accident waiting to happen but also slows traffic down to a halt. If the LTA really wants traffic to merge, the lines must be logical. Firstly, the lines at the side of the two lanes must go nearer to each other and accompanied by merging arrows to signify that the two lanes are becoming one lane and this should only be a few metres long, long enough for vehicles to merge safely but not stretching for so long that drivers can spend so much time driving beside each other and end up deciding not to merge. Next, closely put together spring-loaded bollards (Like the one forming a wall at the junction before D'almeida street) can be installed at either side to physically reduce the width of the area so that it can accomodate only one lane of cars. Once this is done, vehicles will be forced to merge like the one at Woodlands Ave 12 to SLE(TPE). Next, a short "parallel continuous white lines" should be painted after the 2nd chevron to separate the joining traffic at lane 4 of PIE(Changi) from the traffic on lane 3. This is because there is no acceleration lane at the location and the parallel continuous white lines would allow the joining traffic to drive parallel to the main traffic flow before switching lanes safely. The LTA has already done this with a lot of other locations and I cannot see why it cannot be painted down here as well.<br><br>I hope the LTA can look into these measures thoroughly. Thank you for your time.<br><br>Regards,<br>xxx</div>
