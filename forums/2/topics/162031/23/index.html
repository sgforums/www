A nissan sunny can be consider as rare car in other country because there isnt any SUNNY to begin with. So are you suppose to take a picture of NISSAN sunny from let say USA and post it here? The reason why I say that this thread should be dedicate to Singapore sighting is because we dont want to have too much rubbish that are meaningless in the context of this forum and this thread.<br><br>As far as sighting is concern, in any car forum, sighting are usually pictures that are taken while the cars are moving, park in the public car park. Picture taken in Motorshow are plenty, so are we suppose to keep seeing the same picture appearing again and again, just because they are taken by different people?<br><br>LESS IS MORE!!<br><br></div></blockquote>O... heng got take nissan pic and post here??? no right... all are RARE ones... don't u juz get it... he post becoz we ask for it...<br><br>like it a not this is sg car forum... not any other car forum...</div>
