            <div class='col-md body'>whats with this forum, recently it seems like a trend to constantly argue and put people down. if you don't like something in the forum, then live with it, venting your anger here will just cause arguements and make you look foolish. lets just be happy with what we have here, and if we disagree to something, keep it to ourselves.<br><br>another suggestion would be we make a complaints post, so everyone who wants to vent can go there. you can complain and people who don't want to listen to you can just not go there. its better than going to a post and seeing it get totally off topic because of arguments.<br><br>actually i'm going to make the complaints post now</div>

A nissan sunny can be consider as rare car in other country because there isnt any SUNNY to begin with. So are you suppose to take a picture of NISSAN sunny from let say USA and post it here? The reason why I say that this thread should be dedicate to Singapore sighting is because we dont want to have too much rubbish that are meaningless in the context of this forum and this thread.<br><br>As far as sighting is concern, in any car forum, sighting are usually pictures that are taken while the cars are moving, park in the public car park. Picture taken in Motorshow are plenty, so are we suppose to keep seeing the same picture appearing again and again, just because they are taken by different people?<br><br>LESS IS MORE!!<br><br></div>
