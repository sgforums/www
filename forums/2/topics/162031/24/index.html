I did not know beforehand this place existed, nor did I pay any money to see it. The garage is in full view of the street, it counts every bit as a sighting, but too bad that in your haste to create trouble for me, u never use logic at all.<br><br>So there, everyone else I asked says it is acceptable to post the pics I post, and I don't post a lot to begin with. So what can u do huh? I die die will continue to post. Not happy? Not happy suck thumb la. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Yeah yeah yeah, whatever you have posted has got no meaning in the context of this thread. period.<br><br>PS&gt; post whatever you want, and hopefully someone will entertain you. Btw, I feel sorry for you that no one actually pay any attention to your pic on the Yamaha single seater where you even draw a cute little picture to say HI? you must be so disappointed huh?</div>
