This is first.<br><br>Secondy, whether the person who post the bid for the car has the ownership of the car in the first place? i.e. he is not a small employee of the car warehouse, but manager or general manager etc who is deemed to have authority to sell the car at the stated bid.<br><br>Thirdly, we dont even know if the person who post the bid IS from the car warehouse. He could be someone who impersonate people in the car warehouse due to past grudges or bad relations before at the warehouse, who wants to get back at them. This will then NULLify the contract anyway.<br><br>Fourthly, the court has laws that protects the property of people which gives values (commercial) to them at appropriate prices. $1 is NOT an appropriate price for a car. And those previous cases where computers, laptops, processor chips, etc etc who accidental sell at $1 due to wrong posting, its the GOOD-WILL of the people that they HONOR their deals, but they ARE NOT obliged to do so.<br><br>Just to let all know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
