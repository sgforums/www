            <div class='col-md body'>erm....<br><br>offer - the car agent did make an offer at NO min price to sell the car in the AUCTION. So, at $1 , it is still a price being offered by the ang mo.<br><br>acceptance -  Well, the ang mo did accept the offer by bidding the price.<br><br>consideration - something for something, $1 for the car<br><br>intention to create legal relations - Well, it is in the auctions!<br><br>Some years ago, i did ask my law leacture about this question out of the blue. Eg, If happen to be i have buy a car ( normal price $100,000) but it is written in the contact that it is sold to me for $10,000, a mistake by the agent which he left out one zero, how would he think the chances of which the judge will award me with the price is $10,000?<br><br>Ans: In the text, i have a sure win case as i have all 4 points to make a legal contract and the agent might have wanted to sell my the car at $10,000 because we were friends or out of goodwill? But, pratically, it all depends on how the well lawyer were to fight this case.<br><br>What i think is that the only hope for the car agent to win this case is that they can say that the auctions were not set up by them but others and was a sabotage case.<br><br>Well, i am not a lawyer and have not touch my B.law book for years.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i guess every case is unique in itself.<br><br>I am very sure the seller will bring out that Epson Printer case as precedent.<br><br>But in the Epson Printer case, one thing was sure is that the buyer knowingly ordered a number more than he required as he knew he is getting a bargain from the erroneous price.<br><br>The Seller was able to convince the judge that it was a genuine error.<br><br>The buyer in the printer case was clearly exploiting this error.<br><br>Whereas in this WRX auction...as mentioned in the newspapers was that the seller may need to convince the judge that it was a bona fide error.<br><br>But i feel that his/her case might be weak IF s/he have in the past always does bids at $1 without reserve price.<br><br>Plus, yahoo auctions have clearly stated the difference of a reserve price auction and one without. There are already a few checks in place before the seller can place an auction erroneously.<br><br>The buyer in this case, whether or not he is trying to exploit the auction, he knows that the seller have an obligation to sell whether there is or no reserve. Whether or not he is trying to take advantage of this bid is irrelevant as the seller had their onus to check whether the auction they are putting up is free of errors.<br><br>I really think this case is really up to how well they can convince the judge.<br><br>I am rooting for the Buyer in this case.<br><br>But one big disadvantage for the angmoh....  how is he going to insure his car?<br><br>Insure for $1.<br><br>next time he kena highway missile and windshield crack, the entire car must write off. hahaha.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm the seller of the WRX, i won't be losing sleep over this.... why? Because Yahoo Auction is not considered a 'Traditional Auctioneer'. meaning transactions in Yahoo Auction are not recognised as auction sales by the Sale of Goods Act ( Chapter 393 of S'pore Statues). Therefore the seller is not bounded by law where for auctions, a contract is sealed at the fall of the hammer.<br><br>In my opinion: <strong>The seller merely put up an offer to sell his WRX at a starting price of $1. The buyer responded by offering to buy at $1. At this point, the ball is in the seller's court. It is his rights to accept or reject this offer of $1 made by the buyer.</strong><br><br>Therefore, there is no breach of contract law whatsoever.<br><br></div>
