            <div class='col-md body'>I particularly like the Accord best although I have never driven the Camry before. The Accord is like a driver's car imo. Cockpit has a nice layout and centre console has the best functionality and looks great. It has a dual climate control as well. However, it was disappointing that the Accord did not come with rear air con vents like the other 2. Handling was quite good with little body roll and the engine could be revved until 5000-6000rpm without much problem.</div>

I am on shell98, $95-$100 for a full tank and i travel only about 450-470km. Whereas, the newer camry/accord/mazda6/ and even the cefiro for its known 'reputation' for drinking petrol can do much better than my current camry..<br><br>bigger chasis doesnt mean heavier also, smaller chasis can be as heavy too..<br><br>IMHO,<br><br>Camry = Reliable car, relatively powerful (enough for overtaking blah blah), value for $, It's more for passengers..<br><br>Accord = Reliable car (i still prefer toyota on reliablity though), powerful, but its 2.4, higher tax and insurance. It's a driver's car.<br><br>Cefiro = Reliability... Hmmm... (I wouldn't comment because of other nissan owners here.. might start a 'war'). FC is high (nissan badges never low..). It's a car for passengers as well..<br><br>I've test driven quite a few sedans.
