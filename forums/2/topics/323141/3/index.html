              <p>Turn the other way, so if I express what I don't like about another 1 car, I also expect  everyone to listen in too?</p>
              <p>As always, the rule of thumbs, there'll never be a product that can satified ALL people in this world, so all here are suppose to be free to speak-up their mind and feeling about one product. Am I right? Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks!</p>
              <p>Btw n0x, thanks for telling me abt ur thought. Think my posts will definitely make some ppl here felt bias and not happy. If that's the case I offer my apologies to whoever felt not happy if I commented negatively about their ride.</p>

              <p>LOL, welcome to sgforum, where everyone agree to disagree. This is the style of cars forums, if you have been here long enough, you will understand that flaming is part and parcel, and very much the fun over here, especially in cars. Last time still got those record breaking thread 20 over pages of flaming, like the china cars threads. But everyone flame here flame here end of the day, is just a forum. If everyone get along well and all say the same thing, then it would be very boring and lifeless.</p>
              <p>Whats more important is to make sure no hard feelings, and nothing personal. Its just part of the fun over here at sgforums. You are right, of course there is no one car that everyone will like, because if have, everyone would buy that car. But differences exist and that's also part of the fun. Enjoy your stay!</p>

              <p>Man you're really speak-out the need in a normal and healthy forum. A forum should be full of debating about the agree and disagreement... cause every need is indeed different, just like our own fingers with different length.</p>
              <p>Seriously I'm don't like flaming ppl or thing. Our govt ppl had though me well on this (ha.. just kidding). Most of the time I base my words on personal finding, facts and mechanical knowledges. Only small portion base on friends and other ppl feedback.</p>

              <p>They could have offered it in any number of gears they like because CVT is infinitely variable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>They could have a 9-speeder and pwn Lexus' 8-speeder. Shift until you die. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Heard from where? Your friend? Your friend's friend? Your friend's relative's friend's relative's friend? When scrap the body value more or less the same as other cars one lah, a few k. Engine noisy? Have you sat in the CX7 or new 6? If you want totally noiseless, unless electric car, which car engine don't make noise?</p>

              <p>Exactly, insulation plays a part too. Body value, metal is metal, not say Mazda-brand steel cost less than what Toyota-brand steel. (with regard to Agenda posting)</p>
