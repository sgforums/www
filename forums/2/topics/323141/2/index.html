              <p>So what's wrong with 135hp for a 2.0? Seriously there are a few 2.0 engines that are around that range what. For example the chery A5 2.0 has an output of 130hp. Ok granted you can say it's a china car, let me find another example.. say the Renault Grand Scenic, according to sgcarmart, the scenic 2.0 has 136hp. So "no one on earth wanna have a miserable 136hp for a scenic"? You sure?</p>

              <p>For a 2 litre engine,the norm for the current generation is 140-160hp.So 130+hp should be for 1.8 typical engines and strong 1.6's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Very few people were,unless of course they get inflatuated with the model and buy it for it's look.</p>
              <p>Typical everyday buyers look at the comfort,power,handling,crusing capabilities(road noise,cruise control etc),and whatelse.So if im one of them,i would be hesitant to pick the renault because compared to other 2 litre cars it has the least power(for example).Power is important and even more in MPV because of the heavy weight and in case the driver want to sprint faster for some reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in money term, what you can get in a 1.6-1.8 is in a 2.0 capacity engine so you're paying more road taxes.</p>

              <p>I can't help but notice that in this statement that you made, you have effectively related comfort, power, handling, cruising and NVH with power. So by your line of reasoning, because the Renault has less power, it is therefore inferior to say, offers less comfort, handling, NVH than a similarly more <strong>powerful</strong> MPV?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you sure? Have you ever drove a Grand Scenic? Or for that matter, have you ever sat in one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Going by your reasoning again, let us bring up another example, say of 1.8 MPVs. So the Wish has 132bhp, while the Stream has 140bhp. So going by your line of reasoning that for the same capacity buyers will buy the one with the higher output, tell me, do you see more Wish-es or Stream-s on the road?</p>

              <p>Ok,lets not get this escalate to an argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's difficult to get a universal rule here,because the phrase goes "to each his own" so anybody has the right to get whichever car they want.</p>
              <p>What i mean in the previous post is that potential buyers(assuming neutral) would look at the list(which i had compiled above)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Power</p>
              <p>NVH</p>
              <p>Comfort</p>
              <p>Looks</p>
              <p>Engine Capacity</p>
              <p>ETC</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To each his own again, lower powered cars does not means inferiority but then again,assuming the said car is priced more than the more powerful counterpart,are you sure you want to fork out more money which for less you can get another car with more power?</p>
              <p>I wont be biased against the Grand Scenic, but with the respective power and the engine capacity,i recommend looking at other similar cars unless this one has the best factor which the buyer is looking for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the case of the 1.8 MPV,again its up to the buyer but at least now the horsepower count is competitive for the engine capacity.130-140hp is the norm for the 1.8l field so now its up to preference again.In the previous post i was comparing engine capacity to engine power,not the same capacity.</p>
              <p>So if i like the Wish alot,i wont mind the small difference,because at least it's not an alarming difference like having only 110hp for the engine for example.</p>

              <p>My 2 cents to you, get Lancer EX for low FC and more comfortable drive.</p>
              <p>For Mazda3, I felt low down and cramped when sitting in it. The rear seat is not that comfy also when compare to Lancer EX. The FC can be around 8~10km/L according to source.</p>
              <p>Even Mazda3 share the platform (bottom of the car only) with Ford Focus and Volvo S40, but they are totally different car built and quality on top of the platform.</p>

              <p>Can you tell which one has less power or under power as some claimed?</p>
              <p>Basically we just don't ask too much for a 1.5/1.6A engine. And that's including new Honda Civic 1.6A, some say they test drove it and felt was less power and speed when compare to a Hyundai Avante 1.6A.</p>

              <p>Power spec : Lancer EX 1.5A</p>
              <p>Max Power 109 Bhp / 6000 rpm Max Torque 143 Nm / 4000 rpm</p>
              <p>Mazda3 1.6A</p>
              <p>Max Power 107 Bhp / 6000 rpm Max Torque 146 Nm / 4000 rpm</p>
              <p>Can you tell which one has less power or under power as some claimed?</p>
              <p>Basically we just don't ask too much for a 1.5/1.6A engine. And that's including new Honda Civic 1.6A, some say they test drove it and felt was less power and speed when compare to a Hyundai Avante 1.6A.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Civic 1.6 is SOHC while Avante is DOHC leh, pls compare apples with apples. For that matter, the civic 1.6 has better FC as compared to the hyundai.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and the underpower engine one, no need to claim, I have hard facts to prove it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lancer EX 1.5A Kerb Weight 1,260kg</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mazda 3 1.6A Kerb Weight 1,183kg</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So according to physics, if both cars have just about the same power, but with about 80KG OF WEIGHT DIFFERENCE, so CAN YOU TELL WHICH ONE HAS LESS POWER OR UNDER POWER AS SOME CLAIMED?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And no need to claim here claim there. On MCF, there was a thread about the EX started by the SE who feedbacked the EX 1.5 FC was about 11+, while over here, sinicker has also kindly provided his FC readings of about 12+ km/l. All this based on hard facts and proof, instead of my dubious many friends who make many many claims.</p>

              <p>Not that I have anything against the EX, I quite love the design and the high tech interior and beautiful instrumental dash, but want to compare have to compare honestly and fairly and not just anyhow whack without making sure of your facts correct in the first place. Mazda 3 how old liao?? EX how new? If the fact that the 3, which is an old car, can be compared to the EX, it just shows how forward thinking the 3's engineering was at the point of time of release.</p>

              <p>C'mon man, just be realistic. SOHC or DOHC is not that important anymore when compare Honda super i-VTEC SOHC engine to other make DOHC engine. It is just a simple comparison, don't make it so difficult to understand.</p>
              <p>Some more I haven't compare their price yet leh, otherwise all will say Civic 1.6A not value for our hard earned money.</p>

              <p>Yes, the point about the price i totally and wholeheartedly agree with you. The civic pricing is just.. outrageous, absolutely and blatantly overpriced out of all the 1.6s. But even then you still see a lot of civics on the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the FC, I guess the fact that the 3 is a 4AT while the EX is a 5AT does play a part in it, as with other factors. The weight was just a comparison, the mazda 3 may not be the best fuel saving car around, yes, but it is still a very nice car to have and drive, considering that apart from sinicker, there is at least 1 more forumner who drives the mazda 3 as well. *ahem*</p>
