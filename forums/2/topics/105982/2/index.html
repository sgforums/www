            <div class='col-md body'>u can call a cab it will be much faster and seriously how many times in a month do u go shopping dat involves alot of shopping. IMO i still think a cab its cheaper.<br>Its easy to own a car but not easy to upkeep one.<br>ITs not only the instalments, there is the depreciation, road tax, insurance, parking, petrol, servicing, etc<br>Juz like when u r now in ur teens its easy to get a hp but not to pay the monthly bills.<br>But of cuz if u travel alot on the road especially sales line den its different.<br>Somehow i think it is more of a status symbol but becuz now most pple haf a car it looks to haf become a necesscity den a luxury.<br>In fact i find some people haf already taken their car as the wheelchair, they cant go anywhere w/o it.<br>I am almost lidat too but at least i still take bus to work cuz only $0.63 from my hse to workplace....wahahahahah<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had experienced Chinese new year without a car couple years back, it sucks big time. Have to wait for ages for bus. Taxis also can't see much. Took over 2 hours to get from Macpherson to Serangoon Gardens. The journey is a 10mins trip with a car. Really sian. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">   Make sure next time changing car, have to have Chinese new year covered.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>
