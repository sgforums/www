            <div class='col-md body'>You said your dad and yourself save part of your combine income to amount to 170k am I right? Then no offense but your old man must be as gullible as you. Handing that amount of cash to you just to purchase a car? there are many more financially wise stuff you can do with the money. But on brighter side of things, when you are 18 and more sensible(hopefully) you'll have a tidy sum of savings. And as our other friends here have said, a 170k car ain't just a 170K car. Factor in road tax, fuel, insurance( this would be high cos you're a new driver and you're driving a sports car) etc. Two years isn't a really short time my friend, eat a slice of humble pie now to avoid having to eat the whole pie later.<br><br>On the lighter side of things, I know the perfect car for him...<br><br>OUR FAVOURITE CHERRY QQ!!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
