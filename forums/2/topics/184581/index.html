            <div class='col-md body'>I think tyre is about to fail. Usually will see an uneven bump on the wheel, causing unbalanced wheel. If left unchecked, tyre will have a bald patch very fast, or there will be squeaking sound indicating bearing failure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You might really have to bring it down to the w/s to have a look.<br>Theres quite a few things which can result in that sound.<br><br>The internal disc rusted and the surface of the disc becomes uneven, as it turn, whenever it hit that spot, there could be a sound. Most probably is at the tip of the circumference. Not on the shiny surface. Maybe need to go for some scraping or knocking to get rid part of the rust.<br><br>The tyre has been taken out and putting it back was not done properly.<br><br>I kenna both of it...tml bringing it back to the w/s.<br><br>Because you say it sounds like going over the stripes, i would think most probably is the same situation as mine.<br><br>Even if your tyre wall is uneven or crack or due to wear and tear, it most probably wun make that sound of going over stripes, at the most is noisy tyre. Aligntment runned would result in noisy tyre or steering alignment run.<br>I kenna this after I came back from Genting. Went JB to do alignment 4 wheels cost only 15 ringgit.Very cheap.</div>
