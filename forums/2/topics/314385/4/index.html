              <p>Tats y... this rule somehow apply to pple who run faster than u on 1st lane, u should try give way instead of road hog the rd n trying to tap on the brake to aggitate the other party. Btw, 1st lane is for overtaking, not for pple to think they have the right to maintain at 1st lane eventhough they travel at 90. And to emphasis again, by overtaking fr the left will not only endanger ur own life, also to others as well. Dun believe, check with TP, its not recommended. But of coz, if u confidence to overtake fr the left w/o endanger anyone, go ahead. Wat i trying to imply here is, if anyone r slower, go aside, dun block the whole Singaporean on the rd.</p>

              <p>The are places in our expressway system where you just can't give way, like at the exits and at some connectors which are just two lanes. You can't give way, and that tailgater can't overtake, due to traffic alongside. And that guy two feet behind you believe that you will not brake suddenly.</p>
              <p>And where it is possible to give way, it is also possible to overtake, even if from the left.</p>

              <p>i'll turn on the rear windscreen wipers and play with my indicator lights. so he knows that i'm aware he's trying to get past me but yet i will not budge. </p>

              <p>Please ask yourself why people tailgate you in the first place?</p>
              <p>Are you hogging the righte lane of the expressway @ 60-80km/h? If you are... you should keep to your left and let them pass.</p>
              <p>If you are travelling fast enuff to be on the right lane. Just  carry on the ignore the tailgater.</p>
