              <p>I would let them overtake and after they overtake i would proceed with my normal speed..</p>

And when someone behind who is going faster comes up, they won't budge cos 1)they are at the "fastest" lane and 2) fastest lane is according to speed limit so, they find no reason to move aside. this is very evident in the N-S highway... some stay at 110 at the first lane and dun wanna move aside to let the faster ones through, until the 2nd lane is totally clear for them to change.. or they kena nighbeamed  until buay tahan. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p></div>

              <p>I dont tailgate...of the times I need to drive someone to the hospital...I will just switch on my headlights with fog lights and flash once or twice from behind far far away....</p>
              <p>the problem is some drivers will persist in keeping at the speed limit on the right-most lane...</p>
              <p>yes I can overtake from the left....but if U remember ur lessons...it can be more dangerous than speeding to overtake from the left...so I hope U are comfortable with the idea that U are making someone overtake from the left just because U are not a believer that emergencies can indeed happen to people(driving any type of car).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying anyone driving over the speed limit is someone with an emergency...but I dont see anything wrong with giving people the benefit of the doubt....in face...sometimes ambulances with siren on may not be conveying emergency cases...I presume U will still give way to them?</p>
              <p>While we all know that SCDF ambulances can take pictures of a car blocking them to fine them...I still would like to take it that U wouldnt want to impede a real emergency.</p>
              <p>Why not apply the same thinking to a private sedan coming up fast behind ur rear mirror?</p>

              If you remember ur TP lessons, lane 1 is only for overtaking and emergency vehicles. So if you believe you can stay in lane 1 because u are already at the maximum legal speed you are technically in the wrong. 
              
              Just give way to them. They might really have an emergency and your hogging might cause someone else their lives. You wouldn't want that on your conscience right?
              
              Even if they don't have an emergency and they just wanna challenge the traffic police it is their own problem. Who are you to judge whether they really have an emergency anyway?

              And also don't make cars overtake from your left. Very dangerous. 
                      
                      There was once i saw a car he was in lane 1 overtaking from the left(i.e going from lane 1 into lane 2). Another car from lane 3 also overtaking at the same time (i.e from lane 3 into lane 2).
                      
                      Needless to say they collided into one another and the lane 2 vehicles nearly crashed into them as a result. this sort of accident very hard to avoid cos when you're overtaking (at least for me) u only tend to see the next lane only. it is unlikely to notice that another vehicle from 2 lane away is trying to overtake at the same time.
                      
                      Anyway driving on road you're not only responsible for your own safety but other road users as well. give way whenever possible and never drive with the " i am the king of the road" mentality.

              <p>Bro, thats just me. And it would have to be possible to overtake from the left for me to do so. Learn to give way if u see ppl on ur tail or if u see coming quickly close to ur ass. It would make driving on the roads here a lil more pleasant.</p>
