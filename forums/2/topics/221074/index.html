If you still want go by woodland causeway, once out of custom, it is one way, keep right, there will be a road that allow you to U turn.  After that just keep following signs to KL , when in JB go slow a little the road is confusing and road works. Don't worry about getting lost, just as long as you remember the few states, you just general direction go, soon or later you see sign to go  KL ( Malacca is on the way to KL so just follow the KL sign).<br><br>2) Touch &amp; Go you can get from May Bank. But I never have one, just alway go to the extreme left box and pay cash. It is as fast.<br><br>3) It is up to you. As you are just driving to Malacca, most petrol pump guys got used to singaporean paying credit card, just the you may have to go to the counter to sort it out. Just bring some spare cash , in case you want to explore rural areas  there , some rural stations, which  will need you to key in the pin then sign, those then pay cash will be faster ....<br><br>4) When you at malacca, becareful where you park, some place have coin meters, some places in city have prepaid coupons that you scratch instead of punching like ours.<br><br>lock your doors, usually I would top up at the last pump on the expressway when coming back then go into JB to pump when I come back - to avoid crowds and also there been a few case of crime at pump station in JB.<br><br>Just remember even is you go wrongly, just go straight on, and U-turn when you can, do not panic and do funny driving.  Usually right outside Malacca Police will have speed traps, so do slow down a little.<br><br>Would advice you to wash your car before you go, if can put rain-x on your windscreen, as it is now rainy season, if you encounter heavily rain, if your windscreen if clean and with rain-x that help a lot.</div>
