Like you said, "harrass" was not the right word to use. Lane 1 is an overtaking lane, not a cruising lane - even if you are travelling at 120km/h. If the celica was trying faster than you at the moment, he had the right to ask you to move over.<br><br>Singapore drivers are too egoistical - its not an ego-buster to ask you to move over.</div>
