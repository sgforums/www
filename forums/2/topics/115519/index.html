            <div class='col-md body'>Last time my friend used to comment, got so much money to buy cars, and yet want to save a little on things like 50cents for parking. Rules and regulations are there for a reason. Can always stop driving if you are not prepared to follow the rules. Take a taxi or bus, then you can stay as long as you like without worrying about summons.<br><br>Just think about all those seasonal parkers who can't find parking lots because of the many others who park without putting a coupon.</div>
