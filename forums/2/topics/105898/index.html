            <div class='col-md body'>HI all,<br><br>Tot of buying my first car in February and have shortlisted down to 3 brand nw cars namely YRV,Vios and the 1.4 march.<br><br>YRV-  Unique shape (though does not appeal to all) and using same engine as Vios (VVTI) as Daihatsu and Toyota uses the same engine. A mini MPV but more like a wagon with low FC The only flaw is the interior is quite simple without airbags and simple design on the panel and the steering wheel design is outdated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> . Price now is 59K + (Made in Japan 100%) FC is aorund 14l/KM<br><br>Vios- Nice car, i bet no complains from plp who got it already and interior looks good too. Std VVTI engine and low FC. The only flaw is assembled in thailand (Doesnt really matter) and main one would be everyone is driving a Vios, so chances the car parking next to u is the same model. Price aorund 60 k +<br>FC around 14-15L/km<br><br>March- The new march is 1.4, which is big capacity compared to the small frame of the car which is I not necessary. They shld have stick to 1.2. On catalogues and pictures on the net, march seems nice on the interior but on my personal experience inside the car, I find it very plastic and cheap feeling inside which doesnt impress u as much as the pics does. Also recent models of nissan products are drinkers and nothing to crow abt their engine. The only plus point will be its cute exterior design which may fetch a better resale next time. Price 60 K flat. FC unknown<br><br>So guys any advice? I understand YRV is abit underated in this forum as not everybody knows abt its VVTI engine and its good reputation. Mayb its resale wouldnt be as ggod as Nissan or Toyota, but Daihatsu vehicles is is quite an assurance. Opinions???<br><br></div>

ISDL, no doubt the Fit is nice but<br>given the choice i go for Fit 1.5. think now used Fit 1.5 is gg 63 plus. probably of the new face lift fit 1.5 is out. I hv nothing against Daihatsu YRV (non tubro)but i think the resale value kena sucks. cos ppl will compare to vios, march, ignes, city blar blar. If you're juz looking for a transportation, any car u mention is gd enuff. u want power, style, gd resale value. i take ignes.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>btw u want power, more fuel consumption. u can hv best of both worlds ya</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah did consider the new fit but value is around 67+ if i am not wrong, so really out of budget. Btw suzuki ignis have already stop their sale as I heard rumour that ignis is not selling well in spore, tats why they stop it early and replace wif swift. Anyway there were some complains abt the ignis on the website and moreover the rear cabin is damn crammed if u ever try bfore. And lastly talking abt reslae,I guess all used cars got no resale value now, thats why if u thinking of buying a new car, at  least keep it for 5 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YRV - Since it is more mpv like, it has a little more space and headroom. I don't know about the seat configuration, but the very least it should be able to fold out for more storage space. Yes, the engine is from toyota and although the engine make a major component of the car, it is not the only component. I guess it is whether the synergy of all the parts that give you the satisfaction. I agree that it is unique, but quite subjective. In comparision on unique-lity, i would rather go for March or the Ignis 1.3<br><br>Vios - Very nice car and it is really powerful (in 1.5 catagory  terms), mainly due to its vvti engine + 970kg weight and fuel consumption is good. Cruising is also comfortable. However, being a sedan here, it can only offer you what a sedan can offer space-wise. I do totally agree with you too that it is very common.<br><br>March - March is marketed as a car with "so March (much) more intelligent" and "so March feature". As the name implies, it is "intelligent". Features features that can only be found in expensive cars, e.g  a keyless entry keyless start, digital display, speed sensitive wiper. As for space wise, I am not sure it is offers as much as space as car of its class.<br><br>Maybe you would like to test drive all of them first to find out how they perform on the road before making a decision.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I have already tried YRV and the pickup is very good. Moreever YRV is using exactlly same engine as Vios that is the VVTI engine. As for Vios havent tried, power should be higher as expected due to its 1.5 engine. Definitely a good car, but even malays nwadays go for vios, the resale is defintely affected any like what I say nowadys in these market, when u buy a car, prepare to drive more than 5 yrs, then scrape it. No cars can guanratee any resale.<br><br>lastly for the march, if anyoneseen the interior, u wont care abt the so called keyless entry or other gagdget coz the interior very plastic look. FC is a suspect too.</div>

One of my friend hit 195kmh at NS highway with 4 pple in car. He drives a YRV-T  thou. The NA is not far off. Can hit 190kmh from another of my friend. Pickup wise - you have tried it. YRV NA FC is abt 15km/l.<br><br>Vios is too common, and Thai made which sometimes is a buying factor. power is there but the road tax is higher than the YRV and i think cost more than the YRV. FC is pretty similar to YRV.<br><br>For March - I do not like the outlook. so no comments. Nissan drinks as well.</div>
