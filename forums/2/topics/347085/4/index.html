              <p>Hi everyone, I'm new here.  I took the plunge and ordered a Cerato Forte pre launch and got the 1.6A SX at 45K, COE inclusive, 6 months road tax and Rikekool solar films thrown in.  Solar films comes with 10 yr warranty!  Any time the film starts to peel, send the car back and they will have it replaced, quite cool.  My friend is using this brand of solar film and he mentions that his 'transition glasses' does not darken when placed in the car, but it darkens after he winds down the windows, so it can't be that bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The interior is really spacious while the exterior is sporty.  What I did not like is the 1.6 versions did not offer you leather seats, although you can get it done yourselves outside.  Exterior design was by Kia's Chief Design Officer, Peter Schreyer, who designed the Audi TT also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The feel when test driving is good, however it is noticeably noisier than the Hyundai Avante.  Possibly because of the 17 inch rims they use, suspension is also harder than the Avante which makes it a little bumpy when going over little pot holes.  Not sure if this is to compensate the height since it is 30mm lower than the Avante.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The sales person also mentioned that the engine is the same as the Cerato Variant 2, they sup-ed up the Forte's engine so that it is performing almost at its limit, they also gave it an aluminium block, making it lighter than previously.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I checked with my collegue who owned a Cerato variant 2, he mentioned that FC is about 11-12KM?  Hence I am not optimistic that the Forte will be any better, specially with those 17" sports rims offered.  I won't be driving it for long distances, hence not too bothered by the FC.</p>

              <p>He called me last thursday to tell me I need to top up additional 1K to get my car. It is stated clearly the price I'll be paying in the order confirmation form. What is this about? Next moment say he need to talk to his management to waive off for me. He called me again today to say he had to forgo all his commissions to get it done for me!! When i asked him when can I get my car,  he say End Apr to May. The next moment, he called me  again in the evening to say he can delivered the car to me already!! Really cannot believe this guy!</p>
              <p>John, at least your SE is good, he throw in Rikekool solar films for you. Mine keep telling me his commission is only 300bucks. He cannot throw in anything for me except the alarm!! </p>

              <p>Sorry to hear about your bad experience Jruskysg, my SE is Chris Tay, he told me upfront that his commission was $500 and the best he could offer me were the solar films from Rikekool, he offered them upfront to me even before I asked!  I was quite impressed with his honesty, I asked him if he could add on the key-less engine start/stop functionality but he says that is not possible, as i think its only for other markets.  He was also unable to throw in the leather seats as they cost about 1K. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought the SX model already comes with remote alarm?  Unless you ordered the EX then it excludes the alarm.  I heard from a friend that his friend had same experience regarding the 1K top up due to COE change, however this is for an OPC Kia Picanto.  They refused obviously and now are planning to place charges against them because the SE refused to return them their deposit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the inconsistencies I read from your note, it seems this SE is trying to get this 1K for himself, and after he failed to convince you he came up with this ridiculous story about losing his commission. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm getting my car only in May, so I was told, I'm not in a hurry to get the car, so not too particular.</p>

              <p>That's a very valid point, about why manufacturers like Mitsubishi and Hyundai can install multilink independant suspension for their cars, and yet priced cheaper than their made-in-thailand counterparts. The cheapest MIJ car with multilink would probably be the Mitsubishi Lancer GLX. The Nissan Sunny comes with torsion beam setup, same as the Swift as well. I've no idea why sgcarmart lists Sunny's rear suspension as multilink, but personally I've seen jacked up Sunnys before and I'm pretty sure the N16 uses a torsion beam setup..</p>

              <p>Thats true, the GLX has rear drums, but that sure does not deter the drivers of Lancerlutions! Mazda 3 only has a 4-speed auto, I think only the 6 SP is 5-speed auto. But the Mz3 does share its platform with volvo/ford, and lots of people have praised its stability. The price now is very very affordable because the new Mz3 coming out soon later this year, continuing the recent mazda trend of good looking cars.</p>
              <p>Then again, must consider that the Forte is a new model, and at with the spec level and at that pricing is already much cheaper than when the Avante first came out.. and the price will probably fall sooner or later down the road, I don't think the torsion beam setup will really deter potential buyers..</p>

              <p>Another point about Nissan, according to TC website, I noticed that the site lists the Sylphy and the Latio both having torsion beam suspensions - despite being newer models? Looks like not only the koreans are adept at cost-cutting measures.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>I got mine at Leng Kee on the last day of their prelaunch, so I captured the early bird discount.  they have a catch though, you have to take min 50% loan for 5 yrs.  Loan from Maybank, interest 2.8% fixed per annum.  Over the weekend in the papers they were offering the fixed interest rate at 2.58%!!  &lt;---about $50 lower per year</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then again i don't think they have the early bird 2K discount at the launch.  1.6A SX model should be retailing at 47K at the launch, anyone can verify this?  New Forte selling at 47K at sgcarmart.</p>
