              <p>my firm believe is, you get what you pay for. In these difficult
              times, can save just save lor. Who cares about the hp or torque
              difference as long as you can get from point A to point B in one

              <p>@Ducky88ducky : Better to check with your SE regarding brand of
              solar film. It should be stated clearly in your sales agreement.
              From my understanding, I think C&amp;C have a tie down with
              Rikecool for solar film. I saw the advertising rack in the
              showroom. Call your SE to confirm.</p>

              <p><br>ofcourse if can get it fast better isnt it? can try earlier to see if this car is really that good. Some times , you can only see the true quality of the car after driving it for at least 2~3 months.</p>

              <p>yes i am fully aware that the altis is using the torsion beam setup and on some days i do feel tt toyota is cutting corners in places where its of least concern to the consumers...  ( as opposed to say how many bhp and torque the engine is putting out)</p>
              <p>And no offence but u dun see that many FN2R as compared to the FD2R here on our roads does it... i am not saying the FN2R is inferior but honda's approach and mentallity when going about with the production of that 2 cars is evident for everyone to see...</p>
              <p>i am no expert myself... but what i can confirm is that a torsion beam being a dependent suspension is cheaper to manufacture than its indepenedent multi-link setup counterpart....</p>
              <p>and no.. i am not putting the car down... at the end of the day.. its still good value for money... and i can safely say that korean cars has progressed to the extent that i would seriously consider them for the next car...</p>
              <p>however.. when u look at a car it will always be put up alongside its nearest competitior and be scrutinized detail for detail... and in this case its the avante(which i think is value for money too).. and the question inevitably comes along as to why this car can and why this car cannot....</p>
              <p>like on some days... i wonder why mz3, nissan sunny, civic fd4/fd1 can have rear independent suspension and made in japan whereas the altis is otherwise...</p>

              <p>That's a very valid point, about why manufacturers like Mitsubishi and Hyundai can install multilink independant suspension for their cars, and yet priced cheaper than their made-in-thailand counterparts. The cheapest MIJ car with multilink would probably be the Mitsubishi Lancer GLX. The Nissan Sunny comes with torsion beam setup, same as the Swift as well. I've no idea why sgcarmart lists Sunny's rear suspension as multilink, but personally I've seen jacked up Sunnys before and I'm pretty sure the N16 uses a torsion beam setup..</p>
