If not, u have to top up to sell yr car.<br><br>for car reg nearly 5 year ago, the PARF rebate is 130% of the OMV if u de-reg b4 5 year and 120% for between 5  to 6 years.<br><br>Btw, i sell cars leh, please give me business if you need to buy cars, hehe.<br><br>cheers!!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....If you car is 4years+, so you got it in year 2000. C.O.E. that time is very much higher than presently. From my standpoint, i would not say that you will "earn" some money, but in actual fact i will call it savings.

So, assuming you have a 1599 CC car with $14,000 OMV, then the scrap value is<br><br>50% COE + 130% OMV<br>= 50%*38499 + 130% * 14000<br>= 19250 + 18200<br>= 37,450<br><br>Your scrap value depreciation per year from this point onwards<br>= 10% COE + 10%OMV<br>= 3850+1400<br>= 5250<br><br>New Similar 1599 CC Car ~ 70,000 with scrap value ~ 8,000 after 10 years<br><br>Depreciation per year ~ (70,000 - 8,000)/10 = 6,200<br><br>So, it is a little more, but if you add in maintenance cost, then . . . . . . . . .<br><br>For exact costing, check your log card for the actual COE and OMV value and do your own maths. You probably have to check the cost of the new cars as well. It is quite likely that it is worthwhile to consider scraping your car to buy a new one.</div>
