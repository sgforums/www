Generally, their cars are in pretty ok condition.  What I do not like is their customer service - not exactly friendly.  Also, they're kind of inflexible when it comes to changing your bookings.  Apparently, you've to pay $20 admin fee for changing your booking.  I tried to change my hourly booking to a day-package and I was told that I have to pay $20.  After some wrangling, they waived it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Also, their mileage is 40cts per km and is slightly higher than NTUC's 30ct per km.<br><br>I've decided to terminate my membership coz I just bot an OPC.  I need a car mostly during the week-ends and I find renting kind of exorbitant.  Most of the time, I need a car only on Sat or Sun but their weekend packages require me to book from Friday to Monday...just doesn't suit my needs.  Plus the mileage, etc...each rental comes up to quite a fair bit of money.  For eg. a 3hr rental can cost me $70 - $100 depending on how far I go.  I think I'm better off taking a cab.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Even if I didn't get a car, I think I would change gone over to NTUC coz they hv opened another station nearer my home.  The day packages for Cityspeed are slightly better if you compare the hours.  For eg, the weekday package for Cityspeed is from  8am to 7pm...whereas a similar package for NTUC ends at 6pm.  The night-time package for Cityspeed also starts earlier than NTUC.<br><br>So you hv to do your own homework and compare.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Given the choice, I will go for NTUC carcoop.  There are NTUC carcoop and Cityspeed near my home. To find out the rent-out rate , thus my chance of booking a car, I inspect the car park during weekdays and weekends:<br><br>This is the statistics at my place:<br><br>Cityspeed : 4 cars allocated, car park lot always empty after 6pm or during weekends<br><br>NTUC Carcoop: 5 cars allocated, always saw 2 car left<br><br>My vendict is for Carcoop as I have a higher chance of booking a car at that car park and they have many type of vehicle at that car park. You can also interprete that more opt for Cityspeed since they are no car left. Part of the reason is the seasonal waiver promotion for Cityspeed. For NTUC carcoop, there is also a waiver promotion. Thus , before you sign up, call the hotline and ask for <strong>waiver promotion</strong> !<br><br>This is my investigation before my parents bought a new car recently which has stopped me from signing up with car sharing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think between renting and car sharing, it all depends on<br><br>1) how much you travel<br>2) how you drive<br>3) Time flexibility<br><br>1) If you need to cover long distance, travel a lot then rental might be better, as the sharing $0.40 per km can add up to quite a lot. Just remember for every 100km cover is $40.00. For rental, an average car fuel consumption is very conservatively 8km/litres, 1 litre abt $1.30,  which calculates to abt $0.15/km. Every 100km is around $15.00. See the differences<br><br>I know that for every booking you will be given free km, that when you need to do some work and weigh the cost of both rental and sharing. The general principle for me is that for every $10 you spend on booking, you get roughly 10km free.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2) If you are heavy footed and / or you do a lot of city driving with start-stop traffic, then go for car sharing. If you can <span style="font-style: italic;">lun</span> putting the metal to the floor and / or you travel mainly on expressway, then go for car rental.<br><br>3) For example if you need the car in the evening for a function or just 1, 2 hr to run some errant, then it might not be wise to go for car rental as you would be probably park the car for most of the day. This is the flexibility that car sharing offers, use only when you need it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just my 2 cents after experiencing both renting and sharing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While doing some research between cityspeed and car ntuc about 1+ years ago, my findings are:<br><br>NTUC requires more "capital" to join. $500+ as compared to $330 by Cityspeed<br><br>NTUC Package are more expensive. (Either cost more or less hour usage). For example, the overnight package from NTUC starts from 9pm to 6am and Cityspeed from 7pm to 8am. My experience is that I need the car the most from 7pm to ard 10pm. Also, I certainly would appreciate 2 more hr of sleep before return the car to the station. (unless they have a station at your block carpark)<br><br>Cityspeed cars are cheaper by the hour although ntuc scheme has more variety of car** and more flexible rate.<br><br>**<br>Despite more variety of car, let me quote a station as an example:<br><br>Clementi Ave 3 Blk 455A<br>Car sharing in the carpark: Cityspeed and NTUC Car coop<br><br>Car for Cityspeed:<br>Proton Wira<br>Toyota Corolla 2003 model<br>Nissan Sunny 2001 model<br>Ford Laser<br><br>Car for NTUC:<br>Nissan Sunny 2001 model<br>Nissan Sunny 2001 model<br>Nissan Sunny 2001 model<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>**<br><br>The $0.40 per km applies to both ntuc and cityspeed. However for ntuc, if you qualify as a  frequent member, then you get a discounted rate of $0.30 per km.<br><br>Cityspeed made use of sms technology (which I find it quite fascinating) while ntuc requires you to collect and return the key from a secured box at the carpark using I think a membership card and pin.<br><br>No prize for guessing which car sharing I went to.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Like I say, this information is collected one year plus ago, I am not sure whether have they revised their policies.
