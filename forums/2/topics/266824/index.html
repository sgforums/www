            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if this is the right place to post this..<br><br>Just had an minor accident yesterday *sigh*<br>Backed into a vehicle, looks like a minor accident, but <strong><span style="color: red;">big bills?!?!</span></strong><br><br>I came out of my vehicle after the accident to survey the damage,<br>didn't seem like much, but the driver was insisting on the scratches on the plates, sensors maybe (didn't think i would have touched the sensors, as the license plate was protruding) and the bumper side didn't seem to rest that well.. (see photos)<br><br><img src="http://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/ben_nl/CIMG5999.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/ben_nl/CIMG5998.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/ben_nl/CIMG5997.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/ben_nl/CIMG5996.jpg"><br><br>I didn't think the shock was too much, keeping my fingers crossed that any repairs, if any, will be minor. The driver made me sign something, I took the photos, and we exchanged numbers and he left.. Just a sway day..<br><br><strong>But things got a little worse.</strong> About 15 minutes later he called me up and said his bumper bracket(?) is broken and <strong>that the repair will cost a lot more?!</strong> He asked me to meet him for him to show it to me.. After I met him, he pulled the bumper out from the side to show it to me.. I noticed that now when he lets go, the bumper side rests quite well? hmm.. do you think...??<br><br><img src="http://i202.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/ben_nl/CIMG6001.jpg"><br><br>Well anyway, now waiting for him to call me on the amount of $ needed for repair. <strong>He is saying he is looking at changing the whole bumper and will cost a lot of $!</strong><br><br>I've got 35% NCB, not sure if the repairs will really cost a lot or not.. claim insurance? sigh....<br><br>Advice anyone?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that is some f**ked up Lexus driver. Chrome-plated plastic number plate bracket doesn't cost that much... and that bumper bracket, he could've ripped you off by pulling it out himself then calling you back 15min later, or that damaged was already an existing one... who knows. The sensors looked totally untouched to me. Obviously he's trying to get the whole front bumper replaced.</div>

Said he already checked 2 wkshops (both at Defu Lane) and both quoted him more or less the same.<br><br>Seems like the $800 is for :<br><br>1) Repair the broken bumper bracket<br>2) Respray some scratches<br>3) Fix the sensors in the bumper<br><br>Is the $800 quote reasonable?  I'm wondering how much my bumper repair would cost, would be bring to Alexandra Village later to take a look. I'm driving a Latio.<br><br>Any advice would be helpful, thanks!<br></div></blockquote>My friend the advice is do not go banging into people - you be end up paying $$$ . Look at it from the owner view - his car nice nice you bang into it - by right - he can no go for repair of the broken bumper bracket &amp; opt or a whole new bumper !! the cost of bumper will go over thousand. $800 is like that, look on the bright side - at least it is not $3000+ for changing the whole bumper and spraying it.<br><br>Your own bumper - that will cost at least over $1000+<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Licence plate very cheap. As for the bumper, tell him to bring to the distributor workshop/service centre and see if the front portion of the bumper got any damage. If no damage, how can it cause the side of the bumper to be damaged. Tell the lexus driver to go die la. Lexus driver sucks!</div>

Don't sign anything at the accident scene. You may not be fully liable. Don't admit liabilities.<br><br>If you felt threatened at the point that the driver made you sign anything, please make a police report immediately. Tell the officer no injures but just to make a report/ a record just in case there is future disputes.</div>
